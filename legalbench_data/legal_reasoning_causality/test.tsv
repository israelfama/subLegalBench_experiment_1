0	Yes	"This review indicates that the statements in Sheehan and People Who Care that an expert's failure to consider variables other than the salient characteristic renders his opinions inadmissible are outliers. HN26 There are some common themes in the cases: statistics play an important role in a plaintiffs' ability to make a prima facie case of pattern-or-practice discrimination; experts should carefully formulate their initial hypotheses; experts should consider variables other than the salient characteristic and their failure to do so weakens and renders less probative their conclusions. But particularly when plaintiffs have other evidence (such as individual testimony about personal experiences of discrimination), the weight of decision seems to treat failure to consider other variables as a factor going to the weight of the statistical evidence and not as a factor that renders the evidence inadmissible. The court concludes that Neumark's failure to follow what the Seventh Circuit appears to deem ""best practices"" by failing to consider variables other than the salient factor of race does not render his opinions so unreliable that the statistical evidence is irrelevant [*132]  on that basis alone. The court concludes that if the only flaw in Neumark's methodology had been his failure to account for variables other than race, the evidence would have been relevant to the plaintiffs' allegations that Infosys discriminated under Rule 401's ""liberal,"" basic standard of relevance, Daubert, 509 U.S. at 587, and the defendants' criticisms would go to the probative value, or weight, that the trier of fact should give that evidence.16

1	Yes	"A statistical study is not inadmissible merely because it is unable to exclude all possible causal factors other than the one of interest. But a statistical study that fails to correct for salient explanatory variables, or even to make the most elementary comparisons, has no value as causal explanation and  [*538]  is therefore inadmissible in a federal court. The idea that the educational deficiencies of minority students in the Rockford public schools are due primarily to discrimination by the school authorities and can be rectified by an equitable decree is at once unsubstantiated by responsible evidence and--since there is no evidence that these deficiencies are any greater than in school districts around the country that have not been held to have discriminated against minority students-- implausible.

Tracking might be adopted in order to segregate the races. The well-known correlation between race and academic performance makes tracking, even when implemented in accordance with strictly objective criteria, a pretty effective segregator. If tracking were adopted for this purpose, then enjoining tracking would be a proper as well as the natural remedy for this form of intentional discrimination, at least if there were no compelling evidence that it improves the academic performance of minority children and if the possible benefits to the better students and the social interest [**28]  in retaining them in the public schools were given little weight. The general view is that tracking does not benefit minority students, Daniel U. Levine & Rayna F. Levine, Society and Education 38-41 (9th ed. 1996), although there is evidence that some of them do benefit. Adam Gamoran & Robert D. Mare, ""Secondary School Tracking and Educational Inequality: Compensation, Reinforcement, or Neutrality?"" 94 Am. J. Sociology 1146, 1177 (1989). All this is neither here nor there. The plaintiffs' argument is not that the school district adopted tracking way back when in order to segregate the schools. It is that it misused tracking, twisting the criteria to achieve greater segregation than objective tracking alone would have done. See 851 F. Supp. at 913-14. The school district should be enjoined from doing this--not, on this record, enjoined from tracking."
2	Yes	Equally without evidentiary significance is the statistical analysis of the list of 17; indeed, the analysis was not even admissible under HN4 the standard of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), governing the admissibility of expert testimony, which requires the district judge to satisfy himself that the expert is being as careful as he would be in his regular professional work outside his paid litigation consulting. E.g., Braun v. Lorillard Inc., 84 F.3d 230, 234-35 (7th Cir. 1996); Rosen v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 78 F.3d 316, 318 (7th Cir. 1996); Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1316-19 (9th Cir. 1995); cf. Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v.  [**7]  Exchange National Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989). Although the expert used standard statistical methods for determining whether there was a significant correlation between age and retention for the 17 persons on the list, see Michael O. Finkelstein & Bruce Levin, Statistics for Lawyers 157 (1990) (Fisher's exact test), the omission of Sebring and Shulman from the sample tested was arbitrary. The expert should at least have indicated the sensitivity of his analysis to these omissions. More important is the expert's failure to correct for any potential explanatory variables other than age. Completely ignored was the more than remote possibility that age was correlated with a legitimate job-related qualification, such as familiarity with computers. Everyone knows that younger people are on average more comfortable with computers than older people are, just as older people are on average more comfortable with manual-shift cars than younger people are. Three weeks of training might go some distance toward closing the computer-literacy gap, yet it would be more surprising than otherwise if so short a period of training could close the gap completely. The expert could easily [**8]  have inquired about the feasibility of ascertaining through discovery the history of the use of computers by each of the employees on the list of 17.
3	Yes	"The expert's failure to make any adjustment for variables bearing on the decision whether to discharge or retain a person on the list other than age--his equating a simple statistical correlation to a causal relation (""of course, if age had no role in termination, we should expect that equal proportions of older and younger employees would be terminated""--true only if no other factor relevant to termination is correlated with age)--indicates a failure to exercise the degree of care that a statistician would use in his scientific work, outside of the context of litigation. In litigation an expert may consider (he may have a financial [**9]  incentive to consider) looser standards to apply. Since the expert's statistical study would not have been admissible at trial, it was entitled to zero weight in considering whether to grant or deny summary judgment."
4	Yes	"Dr. Vekker analyzes only correlation and is up front about that goal: ""Dr. Bloom's analysis fundamentally ignores the relevant question that I am answering . . . the question in this case whether there are gender disparities in compensation and selections for promotions in Tax and Advisory functions at KPMG."" Dr. Vekker's regressions convincingly answer this threshold question of correlation in the affirmative, which is an important starting point. Defendant is correct that, for the reasons discussed below, Dr. Vekker's report, coupled with the remainder of Plaintiffs' evidence, does not convincingly show that causation can be determined on a classwide basis -- but this does not mean that Dr. Vekker's testimony is unhelpful. Dr. Vekker's testimony need only logically advance Plaintiffs' case. It does so by showing that disparities exist and affect all members of the Proposed Class. The motion is denied.
"
5	Yes	"Mariner's [**21]  explanation is not so convincing as to render Integra's explanation implausible at the pleading stage. Integra sought to control for, inter alia, the ""access to care available to the [SNF] patients"" sampled in its models through the use of county-level demographic variables (e.g., unemployment rate, percent of population without a high school diploma, log median income). See FAC Â¶ 95 (Equation 1, Panels A and B). But even if Integra did not explicitly factor a more difficult locus of discharge into its regression model, the likelihood that locus of discharge would be the cause of the higher rate of UHR across all 58 principal diagnosis codes (with a sample size of over 13 million SNF admissions) is not so obvious as to render Integra's explanation implausible. Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. Mariner has not pointed to any evidence that there are such significant differences in locus of discharge at Mariner and non-Mariner facilities. If such differences existed, one would expect that they would appear in the data and influence the UHR rates with respect to certain diagnosis codes, but Mariner has pointed to no such pattern. Cf. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (in assessing plausibility, the Court should ""draw on its judicial experience and common [**22]  sense"")."
6	Yes	Here, the scope and specificity of the plaintiffs' investigation and the alleged precision with which its proffered regression analysis can attribute the plaintiffs' injuries to the defendants' actions, provide plausible proximate cause.13 The statistical evidence offered, like the differential impact of the mobile home park's documentation policy in Reyes and the costs incurred by the tax base in City of Miami, is precisely the kind of statistical evidence of disparate effects that is cognizable under the FHA. The statistics and regression analyses presented in the complaint raise a fair inference of causation. While the defendants' critique of the investigation's composite variables also may have some merit, see NFHA v. U.S. Bank, N.A., No. 01-12-0283-8 (HUD Jan. 8, 2016), Bank of America Mot. Dismiss, Ex. 1, ECF No. 44-3, they do not defeat the well-pled factual contention that the defendants' delegation of its maintenance responsibilitiesâin the aggregateâcaused disparate racial impact. The other factors considered in the City of Miami proximate [**39]  cause calculus do not change this result. While the risk of additional plaintiffs and multiple recoveries may be marginally greater than that in City of Miami where the city was the only injured party, the risk is mitigated by the necessary investigative depth and statistical sophistication required to bring a disparate impact claim. See City of Miami, 923 F.3d 1286-87. By the same token, it is hard to imagine a plaintiff better situated to bring these claims than a group of the nation's, preeminent nonprofit fair housing organizations. See id. at 1288-89. In sum, the complaint surmounts the causality hurdle imposed by Inclusive Communities, but the extent of the investigation's  [*638]  accuracy, and the plaintiffs' statistical methodology, will be subjected to rigorous factual analysis at the summary judgment stage.
7	Yes	"To explore a possible cause and effect relationship further study is required. The investigator should then observe the effect on one variable, the dependent variable, of manipulation of another, an independent variable. Id. at 348. Independent variables represent the possible ""causes"" of the ""effect"" being studied. If the study does not contemplate the results of manipulating various independent variables, it does little to prove causation. That is because the real cause of the observed results may be variables other than the one with which the dependent variable is associated. When an association is identified among variables, a controlled experiment will help identify which independent variable caused the effect. In fact, this is the best way to eliminate other variables as possible causes of observed associations. Id. at 347. If a controlled experiment [**31]  is not conducted, then the investigator should at least measure the group in which the effect occurred against a comparable group in which the effect is not expected or observed. See id. at 349. The key to success, however, is that the second group actually be comparable.

The statistics offered by the plaintiffs have only eliminated random chance as a possible explanation for the disparities. See Pls.' Ex. 56, Wertheimer Report at 8, PP 14, 16, 20-22, 28; Defs.' App. 108, Rothman Report at 4; see also EEOC v. Sears Roebuck & Co. 839 F.2d 302, 323 n.20 (7th Cir. 1988) (standard deviation and other measures of statistical [**43]  significance merely attempt to eliminate chance as reason for results, do not prove causation). That method would be valid if it is reasonable to assume that the job skills the defendants needed to retain were equally distributed across age groups. See Barnes, 896 F.2d at 1466. If it is not reasonable so to assume, a defendant can show that the statistical method is faulty, or that chance does explain the discrepancy, and the statistical evidence may lose its effectiveness altogether. Id. at 1469. If it is reasonable, the statistical evidence that shows a greater number of terminations among certain age groups than would be expected due to chance, may state a prima facie case for age discrimination. Id.

"
8	Yes	"In the Sixth Circuit, it is required that in order to indicate pretext ""the statistics must show a significant disparity and eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory explanations for the disparity."" Barnes v. Gencorp, 896 F.2d 1457, 1466 (6th Cir. 1990)(citation omitted). Here, the Thompson ""analysis"" does nothing more than, first, to note that no female truck drivers had been hired and then to calculate the likelihood of that happening by chance,  [*22]  assuming that 6.9% female drivers should have been on the Commission's truck-driving roster.
If taken merely at face value and viewed in the very best light, the importance of this statistical observation would be only to demonstrate a ""significant statistical] disparity."" Simply stated, it begins with the assumption that there should have been a certain female constituency, and ends with the statement that, because none was observed, there was a female constituency ""shortfall."" The Report does not in any realistic way ""analyze"" anything, nor does it proceed to ""eliminate . . . common nondiscriminatory explanations"" as required under Barnes.

Of most fundamental concern to the court is that the Thompson/Paranjpe report is based solely on the premise that there is a state-mandated ""requirement"" of no fewer than 6.9% females in the Commission's workforce."
9	Yes	"One nondiscriminatory reason advanced by defendant is that the workers terminated during the WRP were not performing as well as the workers who were retained. Plaintiff's statistics are ""not . . . probative because they do not include the qualifications of both the individuals retained and the individuals terminated."" Swanson v. Leggett & Platt, Inc., 154 F.3d 730, 734 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that data showing that seven of 15 senior managers over 40 lost their jobs in year while only one senior manager under 40 was terminated was not probative of pretext) (citing Vanasco v. National-Louis Univ., 137 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir. 1998); [*41]  Fisher v. Wayne Dalton Corp., 139 F.3d 1137, 1140-41 (7th Cir. 1998)). 14

Plaintiff's statistics therefore do not eliminate or refute defendant's nondiscriminatory explanation. Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that the under-forty entry level managers who were retained [*42]  did not receive higher performance evaluations than the over-forty entry level managers who were let go. See, e.g., Fallis v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 944 F.2d 743, 746-47 (10th Cir. 1991) (using this analysis in a RIF case and concluding that the plaintiff's statistical evidence did not demonstrate that the defendant's proffered reason was pretextual). ""HN16 Because there is a nondiscriminatory explanation for the disparate treatment between the [entry level managers] under forty and the [entry level managers] over forty by [defendant], the statistics relied on by plaintiff do not permit an inference of age discrimination."" Id. at 747."
10	Yes	"Moreover, Farber's finding that the residuals represent gender-based differences is also founded. The use of statistics in sex discrimination cases is common. See United States v. City of New York (City of New York II), 731 F. Supp. 2d 291, 300 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (disparate impact); City of New York III, 717 F.3d at 85 (disparate treatment). Indeed, the Second Circuit has stated that ""[i]t is apodictic that 'statistical reports may . . . be admissible to support an inference of discrimination.'"" Bickerstaff v. Vassar College, 196 F.3d 435, 448 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 67 (2d Cir. 1997)). Regression modeling, the form of statistical analysis Farber used, attempts to eliminate other possible causes, leaving only the studied variable as the cause of the difference observed, also called the residual. Ottaviani, 875 F.2d 365 at 367. In employment discrimination cases, statistical significance at the 5% level, or approximately two standard deviations, is sufficient to make a prima facie case. Smith v. Xerox Corp., 196 F.3d 358, 366 (2d Cir. 1999), overruled [*28]  on other grounds by Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 461 F.3d 134 (2d Cir. 2006). Such a statistical significance means that there is a 5% probability that the difference found is due to chance rather than being caused by the studied process. Id. Here, Farber's regression analyses show statistical significance at the 5% level, so his studies indicates that there is a 5% chance that the residuals (i.e. the difference in treatment) result from something other than differences in the employee's gender. Farber Report Â¶Â¶ 76, 79, 81-83, 98-102, 104-105, 134-135. The Court, therefore, finds that Farber can testify that the differences he found were based on gender.

11	Yes	"Barak-Corren admits she can't explain why her survey suggests many more vendors would've been willing to serve same-sex couples than opposite-sex couples before Masterpiece, and what that means for the level of ""discrimination"" she infers before and after the Supreme Court's decision. See Expert Report at 22 n.28. Were opposite-sex couples experiencing more discrimination than same-sex couples in the wedding marketplace before 2018? Surely not. The City takes the opposite position. City Daubert Response at 13. Yet the study suggests as much. At least some of that disparity can be chalked up to its treatment of pre-Masterpiece non-responses as neutral but post-Masterpiece non-responses as discriminatory rejection. Post-Masterpiece, more vendors (75.5%) responded to opposite-sex requests than to inquiries from the fictitious same-sex couples (63.3%). So the study cannot reliably indicate whether, and how severely, Masterpiece changed vendors' willingness to serve same-sex couples.13"
12	Yes	"Given the massive sample size, and the apparent quality of its statistical analysis, taking into account relevant variables, Integra's allegations establish a plausible claim. And given Integra's transparency regarding the formula which it used to analyze all 13 million samples, it has put Mariner on notice of the ""particular misconduct which is alleged to constitute the fraud charged."" Bly-Magee, 236 F.3d at 1019. Integra's statistical models, combined with the particular details it has provided regarding the ""who, what, when, where, and how"" of the fraudulent scheme, are sufficient to state a claim under the FCA.3 Ebeid, 616 F.3d at 998 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation omitted).

 [*949]  Moreover, even if an FCA claim requires specific [**18]  evidence of unlawful conduct in addition to statistical evidence, see Providence, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 9393 at *11 n.5, Integra has included such allegations here. Integra has provided specific details concerning the fraudulent scheme, including the ""who"" (Mariner management and Mariner employees at the 22 Defendant SNFs); the ""what"" (billing for medically unnecessary services, or services that were not provided at all); the ""when"" (claims for patients admitted on or after January 1, 2011, and prior to October 1, 2016); the ""where"" (at each of the 22 Defendant SNFs); and the ""how"" (charging a higher rate of UHR therapy to fraudulently maximize Medicare reimbursement)."
13	Yes	"Overall, the percentages and correlation coefficients in nine of the ten endogenous are sufficient for purposes of the second Gingles precondition. See 478 U.S. at 56. Plaintiffs have shown minority political cohesiveness in these [**105]  appellate-judgeship elections.

Nonetheless, the stark statistic remains that, in Alabama's history, only two African Americans have been elected to statewide office for a total of [**186]  three general elections and three primary elections. At the statewide level, this factor weighs in favor of Plaintiffs.
"
14	Yes	"Within the Democratic Party, there is evidence that black Democrats get more votes in statewide appellate judicial races than white Democrats. Under a multivariate regression model in which the two independent variables are the percentage of registered voters who are African American and whether the losing candidate was African American, black Democratic candidates perform an average of 1.4 percentage points better than white Democratic candidates.44 Bonneau Expert Report, at 15, [*1292]  Â¶ 36 (Defs.' Trial Ex. 24; Doc. # 85-1). Excluding Sue Bell Cobb from this measure, that number increases to 2.1 percentage points. Id. And, since those results hold constant the percentage of registered voters who are African American, Trial Tr. V, at 66 (Bonneau), it is unlikely that a [**126]  ""lag"" in white support for black Democrats is being disguised by a ""boost"" in black support for black Democrats. In fact, Dr. Bonneau found that, in areas with the highest percentage of African-American voters, black Democrats either perform worse than white Democrats or there are no statistically significant differences. Bonneau Expert Report, at 16, Â¶ 38 (Defs.' Trial Ex. 24; Doc. # 85-1). From these results, it reasonably can be inferred that white Democratic voters give equal or greater support to black Democratic candidates as they do to white Democratic candidates. Plaintiffs do not challenge this fact, only its significance.
"
15	Yes	"Both Dr. Bagley and Dr. King also opined that these disparities are inseparable from and (at least in part) the result of, the state's history of official discrimination. See, e.g., Milligan Doc. 68-2 at 17; Caster Doc. 50 at 30. Both experts also opine that these disparities hinder Black Alabamians' opportunity to participate in the political process today. See, e.g., Milligan Doc. 68-2 at 17; Caster Doc. 50 at 30. Dr. Bagley explained two ways how: (1) that because white Alabamians tend to have ""more education and therefore higher income"" than Black Alabamians, they tend to be better able than Black Alabamians to ""afford a car, internet service, a personal computer, or a smart phone; . . . take time off from work; . . . afford to contribute to political campaigns; . . . afford to run for office; . . . [and to] have access to better healthcare,"" and [**241]  (2) that ""[e]ducation has repeatedly been found to correlate with income [and] independently affects citizens' ability to engage politically."" Milligan Doc. 68-2 at 17. We credit this testimony.
"
16	Yes	"The Court begins its analysis by first reviewing the endogenous elections. To understand Dr. Mayer's conclusions, it does well to first understand Dr. Mayer's methods. Dr. Mayer relied upon the data set provided by Mr. Elyâwhich combined surname and ACS dataâto analyze endogenous and exogenous elections. Rather than employing an ecological regression analysis to estimate individual voting behavior from this data, Dr. Mayer relied on an ecological inference analysis. For the Court's purposes, this simply means that Dr. Mayer used a technique which recognizes that certain ""statistical assumptions underlying regression analysis do not hold when one has aggregate data rather than individual data . . . ."" (Defendants' [**132]  Exhibit 1). Dr. Alford agrees that ecological inference techniques ""use the available data in a more efficient way and so provide estimates of the relationship between the size of demographic groups and candidate support that are potentially less biased and more certain than previous methods"" (Defendants' Exhibit 1). Thus, the Court need not question the reliability of Dr. Mayer's methods. In the end, Dr. Mayer simply used a more reliable method for estimating the voting behavior of subgroups in the relevant electorate in FISD. With this understanding in mind, the Court now looks to the seven endogenous elections Dr. Mayer analyzed.
"
17	Yes	"Defendants also challenge Dr. Kriegler's reliance on the 10th and 25th percentiles of respondents, arguing that ""ignor[ing] the vast majority of the data"" does not make his results more reliable. Id. at 13-14. Defendants argue that Dr. Kriegler's attempts to validate his results through reliance on daily itineraries and deposition testimony of players also falls short. Id. at 14-16. For example, they argue that Dr. Kriegler conducted no statistical analysis that attempted to link the itineraries with the survey [**47]  responses at the Club level and that their own expert found ""no statistically significant correlation between the survey responses and the testimony provided by players on the same team."" Id. at 16. Defendants also fault Dr. Kriegler for failing to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals, which they contend is an accepted scientific practice for surveys. Id. at 16-17. Finally, Defendants argue that because Dr. Kriegler relied on the Main Survey, his opinions must be excluded for all the reasons Defendants contend Dr. Dennis's opinions are inadmissible. Id. at 17-18."
18	Yes	"Dr. John Alford testified as an expert for the Defendants on racially polarized voting. He does not dispute that voting in Louisiana is polarized as between Black and White voters; rather, it is his opinion that polarized voting in Louisiana is attributable [**154]  to partisanship, not race. The Court does not credit this opinion as helpful, as it appears to answer a question that Gingles II does not ask and in fact squarely rejects,331 namely, why Black voters in Louisiana are politically cohesive. Further, the Court finds that Dr. Alford's conclusions conflict with the opinions of other experts in this case who employed more robust methodology. Dr. Alford merely looked at the results reported by Dr. Palmer and Dr. Handley and opined that polarized voting ""may be correlated with race, but whatever accounts for the correlation, the differential response of voters of different races to the race of the candidate is not the cause.""332 Not only does this statement appear to concede that Dr. Alford does not know exactly why voting is polarized (""whatever accounts for the correlation""), Dr. Palmer's well-accepted ecological inference analysis contradicts it. Dr. Palmer demonstrated that the race of the candidate does have an effect; he found that Black voters support Black candidates more often in a statistically observable way. The Court finds that Dr. Alford's opinions border on ipse dixit. His opinions are unsupported by meaningful substantive analysis [**155]  and are not the result of commonly accepted methodology in the  [*841]  field. Other courts have found the same.333"
19	Yes	"For whatever reason, Plaintiffs chose not to invest in this type of evidence. Instead, Perry brought a significant amount of credible information about Hinds County and Mississippi elections to the witness stand. He has a facility with summary statistics. Yet there is a material difference between summary statistics and the kind of specialized analysisâbe it a regression or even a t-testâconducted by academics and statisticians who testify as experts in  [*700]  voting cases. See, e.g., id.; Thomas v. Bryant, 938 F.3d 134, 160 n.126 (5th Cir.) (collecting cases for the proposition that ""[ecological inference] analysis is widely recognized and accepted in voting cases""), reh'g en banc granted, 939 F.3d 629 (5th Cir. 2019); Monroe v. City of Woodville, Miss., 881 F.2d 1327, 1331 (5th Cir. 1989), opinion corrected on reh'g, 897 F.2d 763 (5th Cir. 1990) (criticizing plaintiffs' expert for the ""failure to provide a test of statistical significance""). Perry does not have that level of expertise, and did not conduct a statistically significant analysis showing that African-American voters in Hinds County vote sufficiently as a bloc to usually to defeat white voters' preferred candidate. Nor did the plaintiffs designate an expert to counter the defendants' statistical expert, Dr. D'Andra Orey, who conducted ecological regression and ecological inference analyses for [**29]  Hinds County."
20	Yes	"Finally, Professor Freyd claims that the University could adopt a different practice, such as distributing salary funds to ensure that all professors fall along the regression line of salary as predicted solely as a function of seniority or time in service or otherwise ""creat[ing] a system that was based on doing the job well and rewarding it for doing the job well."" Barran Decl., Ex. B, at 20. However, Professor Freyd does not provide any specific suggestions for how to create a system in which professors would be compensated solely on the basis of their time in rank that would address retention issues, and she does not present evidence that there is an alternate employment [**30]  practice that would ameliorate the difference in male and female full professor salaries in the Psychology Department while effectuating the University's legitimate business need to negotiate with professors who have received competing offers."
21	Yes	"Professor Freyd's data reflects such a small sample size as to render the statistical significance of Professor Freyd's analysis suspect. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that ""statistical evidence derived from an extremely small universe, as in the present case, has little predictive value and must be disregarded."" Morita v. S. California Permanente Med. Grp., 541 F.2d 217, 220 (9th Cir. 1976) (quoting Harper v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 525 F.2d 409, 412 (8th Cir. 1975)). In Stout, six female applicants for a company-wide promotion alleged gender discrimination. [**26]  The court noted the small sample size limited the probative value of the plaintiffs' statistical argument in support of a disparate impact claim. See Stout, 276 F.3d at 1124 (""A sample size involving 6 female applicants in a pool of 38 applicants is likely too small to produce statistically significant results.""). Regardless of what Professor Freyd's expert says as to the reliability of the sample size, the rule in the Ninth Circuit is that ""Statistics are not trustworthy when minor numerical variations produce significant percentage fluctuations."" Contreras v. City of Los Angeles, 656 F.2d 1267, 1273 n.4 (9th Cir. 1981). Here, had three female professors (rather than two) accepted the University's retention offers, the female retention rate would be 60%  [*1297]  (rather than 40%) versus the male retention rate of 62%. It is samples like these that have ""little predictive value and must be disregarded."" Morita, 541 F.2d at 220 (quoting Harper, 525 F.2d at 412). Professor Freyd has not provided sufficient statistical evidence to establish a prima facie case that the University's practice of offering retention raises has a disparate impact on women and does not make out a claim under either federal or state law."
22	Yes	Dr. DiPrete also conducted multiple regression analyses of route assignments at DPA to determine whether Black drivers were more likely than white drivers to drive routes in predominantly Black areas and routes that were more difficult and more dangerous. PSOAF Â¶ 4. The parties agree that DiPrete's analysis using ZIP code data indicated little to no statistically significant differences in the racial, poverty, or crime characteristics of the routes driven to by Black and white drivers. DSOF Â¶ 17. But his analysis using 2010 Census Tracts data does show that Black drivers were significantly more likely than white drivers to deliver or pick up packages in areas that had a higher percent of Black residents, poor residents, and non-white residents, and that the neighborhoods where [**53]  Black drivers delivered packages  [*783]  had a higher average rate of crime. Resp. DSOF Â¶ 17; id. Â¶ 8. In addition, DiPrete concluded that Black drivers were more likely than white drivers to pick up or deliver packages in neighborhoods that were more than 70% Black. Id.

23	Yes	"Figueroa provides several pieces of evidence to bolster his disparate impact claim. Among them are statistics from 2006 to 2008 showing that no Hispanic or Latino candidate was promoted to the FS-01 pay grade, even though, during those years, Hispanic and Latino candidates made up 4.0% to 5.8% of the applicant pool and the overall promotion rate was 14.1% to 17.6%. HN5 ""[S]mall numbers are not per se useless,"" and the ""'inexorable zero' can raise an inference of discrimination even if the subgroup analyzed is relatively small."" See Valentino v.

24	Yes	Notably, it is undisputed that the vast majority of Lukoil's workforce is non-Russian; that none of the three managing directors who were in charge during Benzinger's tenure at Lukoil were of Russian descentâReynolds [**35]  and Rodilosso are American, and Fenner is British; that the sole member of the Lukoil board of directors during that time, Bullock, is British; and that Benzinger was replaced by Charles, an American. Def. 56.1 Â¶Â¶ 59, 61-63. Benzinger does not claim, and the record does not suggest, that anyone made invidious comments or that statistical evidence supports her contentions. In the end, Benzinger is left only with her conclusory allegations that she was treated differently because she was not Russian. Under the totality of the circumstances, no reasonable juror could find that the record raises even a de minimis inference of discrimination. Benzinger's NYSHRL discrimination must fail on this ground, as well.
25	Yes	"Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege a causal relationship between Defendant's employment policies and any alleged disparities.15 HN33 ""At the prima facie stage"" under Title VII, statistical analysis put forth to support the existence of a disparity ""'must [demonstrate] that the disparity is substantial or significant, and must be of a kind and degree sufficient to reveal a causal relationship between the challenged practice and the disparity.'""

HN34 Even at the pleading stage, Plaintiffs must ""set forth enough factual allegations to plausibly support"" the existence of a disparity. Mandala, 975 F.3d at 209. Merely alleging that men are ""frequently"" hired at higher salaries than their female peers does not sufficiently demonstrate that a disparity between the starting salaries of male and female reporters exists; Plaintiffs do not allege, for instance, that ""the [**59]  majority"" of men are provided higher starting salaries than their female peers or that ""on average"" men are paid $20,000 more than women. Without more, the allegations related to male salaries are insufficient to show a disparity, let alone one caused by Defendant's employment practices. Cf. Richardson v.

26	Yes	"The Court also finds that Plaintiffs' common statistical evidence supports a finding that they are similarly situated. Plaintiffs point to the expert testimony of Dr. Neumark to show that Google discriminated against them. Dr. Neumark found a statistically significant disparity in offer rates between individuals age 40 and older who received on-site interviews compared to offer rates among individuals under 40. See Neumark Report Â¶Â¶ 7, 36. Although Google's expert Dr. Johnson refutes Dr. Neumark's analysis in his own report, Google appears to concede that the dispute is a battle of the experts that the Court need not resolve at the certification stage. See, e.g., Perez v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., No. C 06-01962 JW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155921, 2011 WL 8601203, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 2011) (holding thatHN14 at the certification stage ""[t]he court cannot weigh in on the merits of plaintiffs' substantive arguments, and must avoid engaging in a battle of expert testimony."") Instead, Google argues that Dr. Neumark's statistical analyses are not tethered to Plaintiffs' actual claims and therefore  [*1173]  his report does not move the needle on whether Plaintiffs' are similarly situated for trial. Reply at 14.

In evaluating whether Dr. Neumark's findings [**42]  are sufficiently tied to Google's allegedly discriminatory hiring practice, the Court declines Google's invitation to turn a blind eye toward Plaintiffs' statistics. The Court notes the remarkable difference of [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] between the offer rate for older job applicants compared to younger job applicants that received on-site interviews. Neumark Report Â¶Â¶ 7, 36. The likelihood of observing a difference this large under age-neutral selection of applicants is less than [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Id. To put these statistics in perspective, the Seventh Circuit has explained that HN15 ""[t]wo standard deviations is normally enough to show that it is extremely unlikely (that is, there is less than a 5% probability) that the disparity is due to chance, giving rise to a reasonable inference that the hiring was not [age]-neutral."" Adams v. Ameritech Servs., Inc., 231 F.3d 414, 424 (7th Cir. 2000).

27	Yes	The EEOC argues that the September 10, 2008 terminations were discriminatory because black Somali Muslim employees were treated more severely than others, while JBS claims that the evidence is insufficient to make out a prima facie case. The Court finds that the statistical evidence presented, in combination with the other circumstantial evidence (e.g., that Muslim employees' use of unscheduled breaks to pray was targeted for discipline), is sufficient for the Court to infer a pattern or practice of discriminatory discipline on the basis of black race and Muslim religion during Ramadan 2008. See Pitre, 843 F.2d at 1267. The Court, however, finds that the EEOC has not shown a prima facie case that there is a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of Somali national origin. The non-statistical circumstantial evidence of prejudice and discrimination was tied to race and religion. While national origin undoubtably played a role in cultural tensions at the Greeley plant in 2008, there was little, if any, evidence linking discipline or harassment in the [**113]  Greeley plant to anything particular to Somali nationals as a protected class apart from their black race or Muslim religion.35 In particular, the Court finds that the weaker statistical correlation between Somali national origin (using the January 1 birth date proxy) indicates that any pattern or practice of discrimination was on account of such employees' other protected characteristics. The statistical evidence shows less of a correlation between Somali nationality and discipline than the other protected characteristics. It is reasonable to inf er based on the circumstantial evidence that, to the extent discrimination occurred, black race and Muslim religion were the basis for any pattern or practice of discrimination, not Somali national origin.
28	Yes	"Regarding Tsur's second, and alternative, theory of disparate treatment, that Intel's neutral selection criteria were inherently biased against older workers, the Supreme Court has foreclosed this argument. The Court agrees that Tsur has provided declarations and deposition testimony raising a genuine issue of material fact whether the SSL4 and SSL5 awards, one of the criteria used for the layoffs, were skewed to more senior grade employees. HN13 The Supreme Court, however, rejected disparate treatment ADEA claims when the employer acted ""on the basis of a factor, such as an employee's pension status or seniority, that is empirically correlated with age."" [*27]  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 608, 613, 113 S. Ct. 1701, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1993). In that case, the Supreme Court explained: ""Because age and years of service are analytically distinct, an employer can take account of one while ignoring the other, and thus it is incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily 'age based.'"" Id. at 611. ""This is true even if the motivating factor is correlated with age, as pension status typically is. Pension plans typically provide that an employee's accrued benefits will become nonforfeitable, or 'vested,' once the employee completes a certain number of years of service with the employer."" Id."
29	Yes	"Dr. Vekker analyzes only correlation and is up front about that goal: ""Dr. Bloom's analysis fundamentally ignores the relevant question that I am answering . . . the question in this case whether there are gender disparities in compensation and selections for promotions in Tax and Advisory functions at KPMG."" Dr. Vekker's regressions convincingly answer this threshold question of correlation in the affirmative, which is an important starting point. Defendant is correct that, for the reasons discussed below, Dr. Vekker's report, coupled with the remainder of Plaintiffs' evidence, does not convincingly show that causation can be determined on a classwide basis -- but this does not mean that Dr. Vekker's testimony is unhelpful. Dr. Vekker's testimony need only logically advance Plaintiffs' case. It does so by showing that disparities exist and affect all members of the Proposed Class. The motion is denied."
30	Yes	While blacks and Puerto Ricans do not have the same access to Lefrak apartments as do whites, the reason for this inequality is not racial discrimination but rather the disparity in economic level among these groups. While a showing  [*201]  of a disproportionate effect on non-whites is sufficient to require application of the compelling state interest standard in the context of an equal protection challenge to government action, see, e.g., Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 391-392, 89 S.Ct. 557, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616.393 U.S. 385, 89 S. Ct. 557, 21 L.Ed.2d 616 (1969), such an [**28]  analysis is inappropriate in the context of a purely private action asserting a claim of racial discrimination. A businessman's differential treatment of different economic groups is not necessarily racial discrimination and is not made so because minorities are statistically overrepresented in the poorer economic groups. The fact that differentiation in eligibility rates for defendants' apartments is correlated with race proves merely that minorities tend to be poorer than is the general population. In order to utilize this correlation to establish a violation of the Fair Housing Act on the part of a private landlord, plaintiffs would have to show that there existed some demonstrable prejudicial treatment of minorities over and above that which is the inevitable result of disparity in income.
31	No	"Plausible allegations to this effect may arise from a range of circumstances. These may include ""the employer's criticism of the plaintiff's performance in . . . degrading terms; or its invidious comments about others in the employee's protected group; or the more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group; or the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff's discharge."" Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 312 (quoting Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., 584 F.3d 487, 502 (2d Cir. 2009)).

35	No	"Champion's comments made in 2016 and 2017 occurred sufficiently close in time to [**51]  the denial of promotions to permit an inference of retaliation. Her comments in  [*50]  December 2016 took place three months before her March 2017 interview for the RCM1 position at Riverbank Athletics in March 2017, and Champion's 2017 comments were made during the interview itself.

The same, however, cannot be said regarding her 2014 comments. Even if Champion could establish that her comments constitute protected activity, her claimâto the extent based on her 2014 commentsâwould not establish the causal connection required to make out a prima facie case.

HN21 Causal connection can be demonstrated either ""directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant,"" or ""indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by the discriminatory treatment."" Hicks, 593 F.3d at 170 (quoting Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000)). Temporal proximity is sufficient for prima facie causation. See Zann Kwan, 737 F.3d at 845.

Champion has not identified any direct evidence of a causal connection between any of her four sets of comments and adverse employment action. Rather, she relies on the temporal proximity between her comments and Parks' decisions not to promote her. But Champion's comments during the 2014 RCM1 interview are simply [**52]  too remote in time from the earliest of Parks' adverse actionsâits decision not to promote her to the 2016 RCM2 position. HN22 In this Circuit, although there are no bright-line rules establishing the limits beyond which temporal proximity will fail to give rise to a causal inference, a two-year gap, without more, is clearly too long. See Gorzynski, 596 F.3d at 110 (five-month gap is not necessarily too long for temporal proximity); Chukwueze v. NYCERS, 891 F. Supp. 2d 443, 457 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (three- to six-month gap standing alone is insufficient to establish causal connection); Lioi v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 914 F.

36	No	"The Court is thus left with the issue of causation: whether the adverse employment action Dreibelbis suffered was the result of her disability. The County contends that the ""termination memorandum"" issued in conjunction with Dreibelbis' termination on June 21, 2018, which is attached to the Complaint, ""clearly"" shows that she was terminated because ""she failed to comply with the County's Time and Attendance Policy by accumulating an excessive number of unexcused absences."" County's Memorandum in Support of its Motion (""County's Mem."") [ECF No. 6-1] at 8. The County further argues that ""[e]ven assuming Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case, which she cannot, the County [ ] nonetheless had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for [her] termination,"" and Dreibelbis would be unable to satisfy her ultimate burden under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas. Id. at 8-9.

As Dreibelbis points [**20]  out, and as the Court has discussed at length, consideration of burden-shifting is inappropriate at the motion to dismiss stage.18 To the contrary, the Court is satisfied that notwithstanding the ""termination memorandum,"" Dreibelbis has met her minimal burden as to the issue of causation at this stage of the litigation. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the County often treated her past requests for leave due to her disability with antagonism and expressed this antagonism with a notation ""w/no choice!"" on a form approving a request for FMLA leave.19 Compl. Â¶ 9; id., Ex. C. Moreover, Dreibelbis alleges she was terminated eight days after she requested and tookâalbeit without approvalâleave owing to her disability. See id. Â¶Â¶ 9-12. These allegations are, in the Court's view, sufficient to form a reasonable expectation that discovery may reveal further evidence to support Dreibelbis' contention that the County's decision to terminate her employment was motivated by her disability."
37	No	"Kelley alleges that, as an African American woman, she was ""summarily, and wrongfully, fired"" whereas ""male and white colleagues were given opportunities to resign from ISU with significant buyouts or severance payments,"" and as a result of this disparate treatment, Kelley suffered lost earnings, benefits, and professional embarrassment. Compl. Â¶Â¶ 152, 154. HN23 At the motion to dismiss stage, although the Court accepts the factual allegations in the Complaint as true, it does not accept ""legal conclusions or '[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.'"" Barton v. Taber, 820 F.3d 958, 964 (8th Cir. 2016) (alteration in original) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). Kelley's conclusory allegation of disparate [**43]  treatment is insufficient to permit an inference of discrimination. See Hager, 735 F.3d at 1015 (holding that to support an inference of discrimination based on disparate treatment, plaintiffs must allege that ""similarly situated employees"" were treated more favorably (citing Coleman v. Md. Ct. App., 626 F.3d 187, 190-91 (4th Cir. 2010))). Kelley's complaint vaguely refers to ""male and white colleagues in ISU's Administration"" without alleging any facts suggesting those colleagues were similarly situated. Compl. Â¶ 151. Kelley alleges she served as Title IX coordinator, equal opportunity director, affirmative action compliance officer, Section 504 coordinator, ADA compliance officer, and civil rights investigator. The nonspecific term ""colleagues"" encompasses a broad spectrum of administrative personnel at ISU, but fails to identify any who were similarly situatedâparticularly in light of the constellation of roles that Kelly held at ISU. Thus, Kelley's allegation that she was treated disparately from white and male colleagues does not give rise to a circumstantial inference of discrimination. Because Kelley has not plausibly alleged facts supporting the fourth element of a prima facie claim of unlawful race and gender discrimination under Title VII, Count III must be dismissed. [**44] "
38	No	Viewing the circumstances as a whole, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has  [*671]  failed to plead sufficient facts to support an inference of causation. Plaintiff's sole allegation is that Defendant received a rejection letter from Jefferson three months after Plaintiff emailed a detailed complaint articulating Dr. Brooks's discriminatory behavior to Jefferson's Dean of Students and Admissions. (See FAC Â¶Â¶ 29-30.) As the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action is not unduly suggestive, Plaintiff must allege additional facts to support an inference of causation, and Plaintiff has failed to do so. See Henderson, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110001, 2015 WL 4977189, at *9 (granting motion to dismiss retaliation claim where the plaintiff failed to allege any facts to support a causal connection between the resolution of his EEOC complaint and his wage increase over six months later).

Despite having full knowledge of the events described above, Plaintiffs nevertheless [**25]  filed this lawsuit on November 13, 2017, including allegations against Federal Defendants based on their rescinded interpretation of Title IX. District's Plan was enacted in November 2015, well before the May 2016 Dear Colleague letter was issued. Similarly, most of Federal Defendants' enforcement actions alleged in the complaint occurred after the Plan was enacted.

Therefore those enforcement actions cannot support Plaintiff's alleged causal link.

(Doc. 31-2, pp. 20-23; doc. 31-3, pp. 6, 12.) Plaintiff was discharged for ""sleeping on the job"" after Defendant's investigation concluded that he fell asleep at his work station in the allocation room. (Doc. 33, p. 2; doc. 31, p. 2.)

(Doc. 33, pp. 6-7; doc. 31-2, pp. 47-48, 52, 62.) There was no evidence that, like Plaintiff, Burke or Farmer ever fell asleep at their workstationsâintentionally or otherwiseâor took any ""unintentional"" breaks by ""dozing off.""11 At this point, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to produce evidence ""sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision."" Id. at 1024. ""[T]his obligation [is one] that merges with the plaintiff's ultimate burden of persuading [**21]  the factfinder that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination."" Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1221 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). ""To show pretext, [an employee] must demonstrate 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'"" Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1265 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). However, an employee is ""not allowed to recast an employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or substitute his business judgment for that of the employer."" Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030. Rather, ""an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason."" Id."
42	No	"However, a review of the ""over base level"" numbers of the four comparators and Escalera in core endourology reflects significant differences in the severity of losses between the comparators and Escalera during the January through June 2015 time period. Escalera's utilization of different time periods for each comparator within 2015 is not appropriate when examining the team managers' performances given Bard Medical's Solo/Skylite production products. Using the same time frame for each comparator, the record reflects that between January through June of 2015, Kunzinger was $55,626.89 below base, Santoro was $160,651.77 above base, Peters was $20,070.56 above base, and Martin was $79,932.38 above base. (Ottley Dep. Exs. 3, 12, 14, 16.) These numbers demonstrate that the ""losses"" experienced by the comparators during the same time period as Escalera are not substantially identical. Escalera's loss of base was $68,799.06 more than [**25]  the closest comparator he identified.

Additionally, comparing the ""over base level"" numbers of the comparators and Escalera between January through October 2015 reflects that at the time Escalera was terminated he had suffered significantly more loss over base than his identified comparators: Escalera was  [*805]  $174,792.44 below base, Kunzinger was $101,132.60 below base,3 Santoro was $110,078.73 above base, Peters was $31,876.80 below base, and Martin was $1,611.79 below base. Because of these significant differences in losses, no reasonable jury could find that these four comparators and Escalera are similarly situated in all relevant respects.

Harvey v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 38 F.3d 968, 972 (8th Cir. 1994). Carter was removed from her cheer and dance duties, in part due to multiple complaints about the routines [**6]  being inappropriate. HN4 At best, there is evidence of only one complaint against Populis's routines, and that was from Carter. See Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 651, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 188 L. Ed. 2d 895 (2014) (""[I]n ruling on a motion for summary judgment, '[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.'""), quoting Anderson v.

P. 56(c)(1)(A) (""A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by: citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions."") But Carter was removed from her duties based on two other reasonsâlow participation rates and team misconduct while traveling. There is no evidence that Populis had similar issues. Thus, Populis was not similarly situated in all relevant respects."
44	No	"Fennell has introduced five (5) SVPs Government Affairs that he alleges to be ""similarly situated""âB.M., G.J., G.T., R.M., and M.C. Comcast has presented another SVP Government Affairs, Rick Smotkin, that it alleges Fennell ignored in his comparator analysis. Fennell disputes Smotkin as a proper comparator.

Each individual's position at Comcast, to include their job responsibilities, are summarized below, based on the evidence in the record taken in the light most favorable to Fennell.
Fennell fails to provide any record support for his contentions about Division job responsibilities. See id. He points to no facts, in his Counterstatement of Facts or otherwise, to support [*45]  even an inference that these three individuals have relevant job similarities to qualify as comparators to Fennell. Likewise, he presents no argument in his response brief as to why the Court should consider these three individuals as comparators, aside from them sharing a job title. He concedes that job title alone is ""not dispositive."" See Resp. 9-10; Monaco, 359 F.3d at 305; see also In re Tribune Media Co., 902 F.3d 384, 403 (3d Cir. 2018) (holding two employeesâone a seasonal, non-union employee, and the other a full-time union employee who had been with the employer for decadesâwere not ""similarly situated"" as they had different tenures and statuses); Cagnetti v. Juniper Village at Bensalem Ops., No. 18-5121, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126095, 2020 WL 4039027, at *10 (E.D. Pa. July 17, 2020) (Leeson, J.) (""The fact that two employees share a job title is insufficient by itself to support an inference that they are suitable comparators. . . . Typically there must also be evidence that the employees 'were subject to the same standards and compensation scheme, or had comparable experience, education, or qualifications.'"") (quoting Reid v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 274 F. Supp. 3d 817, 823 (N.D. Ill. 2017) and Tank v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 758 F.3d 800, 810 (7th Cir. 2014)); cf.

45	No	"Faulkner listed seven men in her complaint who were allegedly similarly situated to [**6]  her but treated more favorably by DCDC. However, the record indicates that six of them were not similarly situated to Faulkner, and one was treated the same. One of the men had no injuries, four were released back to their jobs without medical restrictions, and a sixth was released back to work with no medical restrictions until he retired. The seventh comparator was similarly situated to Faulkner in that he, too, could not perform the duties of a corrections officer, and was terminated. Faulkner therefore did not establish her prima facie case of sex discrimination, and the district court correctly granted summary judgment on her claim.5
"
46	No	"Carter contends the circumstances suggest discrimination because he was disciplined for conduct that Atrium's white employees engaged in with impunity. For example, he asserts he was disciplined for being on Facebook and using his cell phone at work and for failing to account for missing bills from the lobby cash drawer, while other white employees were not. But Carter acknowledges that he was fired over the hotel key incident, rather than as a result of these comparatively minor infractions. He has not presented evidence of any situation in which a white Atrium employee took a hotel room out of service, made a [**10]  key to it, and then allowed unregistered guests to gain possession of the key, without being fired as a result. Nor is there evidence of white Atrium employees engaging in comparably serious misconduct without experiencing similarly harsh employment consequences. As such, Carter has not shown that similarly situated employees outside of his protected class were treated more favorably than him after engaging in similar misconduct. See Pye, 641 F.3d 1019 (explaining that to be similarly situated employees must be ""involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and . . . disciplined in different ways"" (cleaned up) (quoting Wimbley v. Cashion, 588 F.3d 959, 962 (8th Cir. 2009))). The record shows that the first of the three Assistant Front Office Managers Atrium hired was a former Atrium employee with a great track record at the company who had left to attend hospitality school. The second had an undergraduate degree in event management. And the third served as a Night Auditor at another hotel for five years, which both parties acknowledge represents management experience. In contrast, Carter had no formal hospitality or event management education, lacked management experience, and received a number of disciplinary write-ups from Atrium before being passed over [**13]  for promotion. In addition, the record shows that Atrium has hired Black men for the Assistant Front Office Manager position in the past. Even drawing all reasonable inferences in Carter's favor, after a careful review of the record we conclude that he has not presented evidence to show that Atrium's stated reason for declining to promote him was ""not the true reason,"" but rather a ""pretext for discrimination."" Kim v. Nash Finch Co., 123 F.3d 1046, 1056 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Summary judgment on the failure to promote claim was warranted.

47	No	"Plaintiff's race discrimination claim fails to meet these standards. Under the third prong of the pleading standard, Plaintiff was required to provide sufficient factual allegations to support a plausible inference of race discrimination. The Amended [*16]  Complaint, however, is devoid of any such factual material. Although she alleges that she was repeatedly mistreated by her supervisors, ECF No. 17-2 at 3-9, there are no facts alleged from which it can be plausibly inferred that the mistreatment was racially motivated. While the Amended Complaint generally avers that ""[s]imilarly situated co-workers outside of the [her] race were not treated in the manner in which [she] was,"" id. at 9, Plaintiff offers no facts to back that up, rendering the allegation ""just a legal conclusionâand a legal conclusion is never enough.""

Indeed, nowhere does the Amended Complaint even generally describe any comparator employees, how they were similarly situated, or how they were treated differently than Plaintiff. Other courts in this [*17]  District and elsewhere have not hesitated to dismiss disparate treatment Title VII claims with comparable pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., Beaulieu v. Barr, No. 15-cv-896, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186769, 2019 WL 5579968, at *4 (D.D.C.

Maryland Ct. of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187, 190-91 (4th Cir. 2010) (concluding that the plaintiff's allegation that he ""was treated differently as a result of his race than whites""âeven where the plaintiff identified an alleged comparatorâwas insufficient to sustain a Title VII claim at the motion to dismiss stage because, as here, no factual allegations plausibly suggested the comparator was ""actually similarly situated"") with Fennell, 770 F. Supp. 2d at 128-29 (finding that Title VII plaintiff had sufficiently alleged race-and sex-based discrimination where he ""identifie[d] three allegedly similarly [*18]  situated white employees, and one similarly situated female employee, who engaged in comparable conduct but were not treated in alike manner"").6 Thus, Plaintiff's allegation that ""[s]imilarly situated co-workers outside of the [her] race were not treated in the manner in which [she] was,"" ECF No"
48	No	"Here, Sosa alleges that Berger and the NYCDOE regularly granted accommodation requests to Caucasian, non-African American, non-disabled teachers, (Sosa II Compl.

However, Sosa makes no mention of who these other teachers were, how their requests were similar to hers, or any other facts that would elevate her allegation beyond that of a ""naked assertion."" See, e.g., Stinnett v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 278 F. Supp. 3d 599, 612 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (dismissing Title VII disparate treatment claims because ""Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that she was similarly situated in all material respects to the male employees she identifies"") (quotations omitted); Goodine, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50435, 2017 WL 1232504, at *4 (""Plaintiff refers to a generic class of white probationary employees, which is insufficient even at the pleadings stage."").

Pls.' Opp'n to Joint Mot. at 35. The Court presumesâgiven this vague contentionâthat ""the similarly situated Caucasian Americans"" to whom she refers are the three Caucasian National Representatives in District 2. But the current record does not demonstrate that those Representatives were ""similarly situated"" to Lewis because they did not do what she didânamely, refuse to abide by the new reporting policy and ask their union to address that policy with AFGE. See De La Fuente v. DNC Servs. Corp., Civ. A. No.: 18-336(RC), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68738, 2019 WL 1778948, at *6 (D.D.C. Apr. 23, 2019) (""In the employment context . . . similarly situated employees 'must have . . . engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it.'""

If Lewis was threatened with a suspension for trying to exercise her collective bargaining rights, [**51]  that is a separate (and perhaps troubling) issue. But the facts alleged do not plausibly raise an inference that Lewis's race was the reason why Cox and Castellano sought to suspend her.

50	No	"Wills hasn't identified a single similarly-situated comparator. See MSJ Response at 8-10. He doesn't, for example, offer up a white store managerâor, for that matter, any other employeeâwho yelled at several coworkers (sometimes in front of customers) while throwing merchandise and who, despite this misconduct, wasn't fired. In fact, the record supports the exact opposite conclusion. As Schiller, the ethics case manager, testified: ""[T]he determination was made to terminate Marcellus based on his pattern of harassing and intimidating behavior in his store. And that termination is very consistent with  [*1246]  how we would treat other store managers who behaved the same way."" Schiller Depo. at 51:7-11 (emphasis added). Despite having over nine months to develop the factual record in this case, Wills hasn't adduced a single piece of evidence to rebut this proposition. And that's sufficient to dispose of Wills's McDonnell Douglas claim here. See, e.g., Holmes v. City of Ft. Pierce, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2607, 2022 WL 247976, at *6 (11th Cir. Jan. 27, 2022) (finding that the plaintiff failed to make a prima facie case because the ""alleged comparators did not engage in the same basic misconduct""). [**81]"
51	No	"The Court finds this argument persuasive and agrees that as a matter of law, those three officers cannot be considered mutually exclusive. HN12 In order for the plaintiff to be considered similarly situated to the other officers, he is ""required to demonstrate that all of the relevant aspects of [his] employment situation were 'nearly identical' to those of the [the other officers]."" Neuren v. Adduci, Mastriani, Meeks & Schill, 43 F.3d 1507, 1514, 310 U.S. App. D.C. 82 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). That the plaintiff did not pursue arbitration constitutes a major difference. Chief Pavlik attests that under his watch no officers, who were previously terminated, were reinstated unless he was ordered to do so by an arbitrator. Plaintiff argues that the ""union let [his] case fall by the wayside."" ECF No. 24-2, pg. 13. But  [*82]  even if true, that has no bearing on this analysis. The plaintiff's claims allege that WMATA officials treated him disparately from other officers by not reinstating him, not that his union representatives treated him poorly. It is also important to note another difference between the plaintiff and M.S., S.B., and N.M. Those three officers were terminated based on violations of internal policies not because [**14]  they were criminally convicted, as the plaintiff was in this case."
52	No	But Plaintiff's argument [**44]  does not extend beyond the prima facie stage. Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant lacked legitimate business reasons for the 2015 raise, the 2015 RIF ratings, or the subsequent termination. Likewise, Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant's stated reasons were a pretext for retaliation. Conversely, Defendant has established that it gave similar raises to similarly situated employees, honestly rated Plaintiff's job competencies in the 2015 RIF, and non-discriminatorily selected to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff presents no evidence that Defendant's actions were actually driven by retaliatory intent. Instead, Plaintiff appears to rely on the same actions he argues establish pretext for intentional race and national origin discrimination. But the Court has already rejected those arguments as insufficient to establish pretext for Plaintiff's discrimination claims and they similarly fail with regard to his retaliation claims. Ultimately, a reasonable jury could not find in Plaintiff's favor. See Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013) (plaintiff's ultimate burden is to show that the adverse employment action  [*1223]  would not have occurred but for the protected activity); Allison v. Housing Authority of the City of Seattle, 118 Wash.2d 79, 821 P.2d 34, 37 (1991) (under the WLAD, plaintiff must show that [**45]  protected activity was a substantial factor in the adverse employment action).
53	No	"Upon review, the court finds that Plaintiff does not support her claims regarding the preferential treatment of male employees with any cites to evidence in the record, as required by Federal Rule 56(c) (1). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1) (explaining the need to support factual positions in a summary judgment briefing with cites ""to particular parts of materials in the record"") ; Causey, 162 F. 3d at 802 (explaining that ""conclusory statements, without specific evidentiary support"" cannot support an actionable claim for discrimination).

Further, even if Plaintiff had cited to evidence in the record to support her claims, the court finds that Plaintiff has not established that any male employees who received preferential treatment from Defendant may be considered proper comparators who were substantially similar to Plaintiff in terms of ""conduct, [**23]  performance, and qualifications."" Rayyan, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5061, at *9; see Hurst, 681 F. App'x at 191.

Under these circumstances, the court finds that, based on the record evidence, a reasonable fact-finder could not conclude that Plaintiff was treated differently than similarly situated employees outside of her protected class. For this additional reason, the court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination against Defendant.
"
54	No	"A plaintiff may satisfy the fourth element of the McDonnell Douglas test by showing that he was replaced by a person from a nonprotected class or that similarly situated nonprotected employees were treated more favorably. Haji v. Columbus City Schs., 621 Fed. Appx. 309, 315 (6th Cir. 2015). Here, Defendant did not hire another person for the position after rescinding Plaintiff's offer. (ECF No. 49-3, PageID #798-99; ECF No. 49-5, PageID #978.) Therefore, Plaintiff must show that similarly situated employees received more favorable treatment.
