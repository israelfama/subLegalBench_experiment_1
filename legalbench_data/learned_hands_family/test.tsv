0	So my mom is in nursing home here in Los Angeles. I want to take her home with me, but my siblings want her to stay in the nursing home. If I were to take her home and she dies in my house, they said that they were going to sue me for everything that I own. Is that legally possible?	Yes
1	Just need clarification on what counts as educational expenses for a child in Missouri. Is it strictly for college/secondary education (Tuition, room and board, books, etc)? I have a child going into elementary school and he is now required to have a laptop. I would like to be able to have this bill shared between myself and the ex.  Need some guidance on what exactly the education expense entails.  Thank you.	Yes
2	"My sister (27) has two kids (ages 2 and 4) with the same man (31).  She's been living with him for five years now, but things are looking like they're trending towards a breakup.  Her boyfriend earns his money under the table and doesn't have a declared income.  He has encouraged her to pretend that she is living alone and doesn't know where he is whenever she applies for any sort of government assistance (I'm not sure exactly what she's done, I do know she got some help with preschool funding, for example).  He's encouraged her to do this as he doesn't want anyone coming after him for child support and she has agreed because, as they were living together, he was already (nominally) contributing to raising them.  Now that their relationship is ending, my sister is looking to leave, however, he is threatening to report her to the government for lying on those forms if she does.  He says their kids will get taken away from her and that she'll go to prison.  He has various bits of documentation (bills paid from the same house, photos of them together, etc.) that he's planning on using as proof.  I've encouraged her to speak to a lawyer, but she's too afraid to do so.  I'd really like to encourage her to leave him.  He's abusive and neglectful (he makes her pay for all of the food, clothes, etc. for the kids because they're ""her problem,"" verbally abusive, might be physical I'm not sure), there's a lot I'm leaving out of this to keep this story from being easily identifiable.  However, I can't advise her on this issue because, frankly, I don't know if his threats hold water.  I'm sorry for being so vague, but can anyone give me an idea regarding what the consequences might be for lying on government assistance forms like that?  Would pointing out that she was in an abusive relationship and essentially coerced into it help at all?  Thanks, I'll answer any questions as best I can."	Yes
3	"A couple of months ago my girlfriend came home blackout drunk and was out of control breaking things and eventually bit me (no blood was drawn) because I wouldn't give her the keys to her car. Not having been in a situation like this before I called the police because I didn't know what else to do. Looking back, I should have just got in my car and left and let her drunken-ness run its course. Instead, the police showed up and asked if I wanted her to go to jail overnight to ""dry out"" and I said yes. I, naively, didn't realize what would happen. Now we have to go to court next Monday and I have no idea what to do. I don't want anything bad to happen to her such as going to jail. I'm a fairly new California resident and have read that it's nearly impossible to drop domestic violence charges even as the victim and I don't want to say anything incriminating towards her.  It's worth noting that this is the one and only time she has ever been physical with me. She doesn't remember any of it. She has her AUD (alcohol use disorder) under control + is going to AA + going to therapy weekly + she's taking Naltraxone which has been working wonderfully. She has had a really rough past few years while going through a divorce but she's finally turning it around to live a healthy, happy and productive life once again. I don't foresee this happening again because she knows I won't stay with her if it does + I know she *really* doesn't want to go to jail. Everyone makes mistakes and I have forgiven her and we are moving on from it.   Regardless, we still have court next week and I would be very grateful for any advice.  Thank you for reading."	Yes
4	Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	Yes
5	My brother and his ex were never married and have been together for 6 or 7 years. They have 3 children and have lived in Iowa all throughout their relationship. They split up a couple months ago and had been sharing custody without any official agreement. She just left and took the kids, she is currently on her way to Georgia. What are his rights.  Where will a custody battle take place?	Yes
6	So, my dad has been doing this to my mom and now that her credit is shit he's using my (19 year old college student) credit to open cards. I can't complain because he does pay off my credit cards and hes paying for a study abroad trip but honestly what the fuck? I just got a letter in the mail (my home address not uni address) one saying I was approved and there was a card for me and my dad in there (I ripped them up and threw them away) and the other saying I was denied.      I tried calling every customer service number I found but there was only a robot server, so I just ripped the cards up. The issue is he has my SSCN written down (he has all three of ours written down on all of our SS cards. For example mine has his and my moms, his has my moms and mine, my mom has mine and his)     I don't want to get in anything too legal but I don't want my credit to go to shit. Can I change my social security card number at all? (also would that require me to get a new passport?)	Yes
7	"Hello there Legal Advice!  So, last year I went through a custody battle with my son's mother. My new attained girlfriend at the time knew the fine details of the entire ordeal. Now that she and I are no longer together and went through a ""bad breakup"", she has taken the liberty of contacting my son's mother and made **accusations that** -  * I'm addicted to narcotics due to a foot injury as well as marijuana edibles. * Claiming I am emotionally and physically abusive in front of my son. * I apparently left him in a high chair for two hours while playing video games with a soiled diaper.   I had received notice from a judge's order that my parenting time has been revoked down from three days a week, down to eight hours a week with a licensed therapist. Thankfully it's only for a week, but now I have to build my defense case. I have a court date for this Thursday to prove my case  * I'm not an addict and am able to provide a list of all prescriptions. Last one being prescribed to me was three months ago. **I have a print out I will be submitting as evidence to support my claims** * I'm not addicted to marijuana edibles. I did take some, to help me fall asleep at night only when my son wasn't there. It's been about a month since I likely took anything. **I have my employer and who is able to be a character witness** * I am not abusive in any way. **Character witnesses** * I have never neglected my son in any way shape or form. **Character Witnesses**  **What other options do I have available to me to prove these accusations are false to the judge?**  * The last trial of the custody case, the Judge stated: The Court has some concerns about Mother’s ability to encourage the sharing of love, affection, and contact between Child and Father. The Court notes that Mother is overprotective of Child, which unfortunately has impacted his relationship with his father."	Yes
8	Small preface: My mother is very trustworthy and would not misuse money or steal.  I am 19 and ready to start my freshman year at college. My mother is still receiving child support from my father. She is saving it instead of putting it into my savings in case she can get into trouble. We have not talked to my father about it yet in case it will cause a stir and give him an out.  My question is: is her receiving it past the date we thought illegal? If so, should we just transfer it back to my dad?   Thanks everyone :)	Yes
9	My wife and I divorced 2 years ago. During the divorce she signed off on the house we owned jointly giving me sole possession. Since then I have had a new deed prepared in my name only so now, as far as the house is concerned, I'm the sole owner. However she is still on the loan which I've been making the payments on since she moved out in March 2013. I've never been able to refinance due to terrible credit and though it's improved since I'm still having issues qualifying. She wants me to refinance ASAP so she can be removed so that it won't show on her credit (she's trying to purchase a home elsewhere). Totally understandable and I'm trying to get it done but I'm curious as to my legal obligation to do so. For instance if I cannot qualify, does she have any legal right to challenge my possession? As far as I understood that when she signed away the home during the property division and a new solo deed was processed her rights to the property ended. Is this correct? I live in California for reference.	Yes
10	My ex just moved in with her boyfriend. I've heard that the alimony I'm paying may be 'renegotiated' in this situation.  Is this true, and if it is, what are my next steps. How long of her living there should I wait?	Yes
11	"Im 14 years old and my father has been emotionally abusing me and my mother for years. Divorce has been an idea that has come up and it seems like it wouls be a good idea if it weren't for who my father is. He is a  lawyer and pretty big name in the town that I live in. Last time he kicked my mom out he tried to make her quit her job and said he will send her ""papers"". This makes me fear what would happen in the event of a divorce. I also have recordings of him talking to someone I believe he's having an affair with. What is the best way to proceed with a divorce and protect me and my mom. He's also very possessive of me and the property that him and my mom share. I'm sorry that this post is all over the place but this was the best way for me to describe my situation.   Thanks"	Yes
12	Hi, I was told by r/personalfinance to post this here.  So, I am going to try to make this as brief as possible, but I also need to add in enough background information that may also help provide a better answer.  My dad and mom have been living together for nearly 30 years, my dad has worked full time post of that time in various positions. He is retired now and receives a significant amount of retirement income each month, totaling between 3k-4k. My mom has worked, but only infrequently and only has SS of about $500 per month.  Their combined income should be enough to live off of, but... My mom has been recklessly spending money on various things, mostly dining out and groceries that seem to disappear. Not only that, but my mom and sisters are semi-hoarders and breeders of animals (cats and dogs) which are destroying the house and costing them hundreds if not thousands of dollars each month to maintain. The amount of cats and dogs combined are almost 20. My mom also has power of attorney over my dad for unrelated reasons.  I recently found out that my mom forced my dad to open several credit cards in his name and has maxed out of them to a total of 25k. Additionally, in the past week my mom and my sisters have left me and my dad at home with a barely operable car and we do not know where they have gone or when they are coming back. The biggest issue is a large settlement that is incoming for my dad to the amount of 200k. Since my mom has power of attorney over my dad I need to know whether or not she can take the money out right or if we have time to stop her.     He has already been to a notary public to revoke the power of attorney and has a set appointment date for receiving the settlement in person. So, my question is, what the hell do I do or can do? What the hell do we do when we get the 200k? My mom and dad also own the house, both of their names are on it. My dad wants to setup a living trust and invest the 200k and keep it away from my mom. Is this the right decision? I just need help or advice.  Additionally, my dad is going to see a lawyer on Thursday about getting the POA fully revoke and we'll see  Thank you.	Yes
13	Wife called police on me last night after we had an argument. Claimed to police that I had shoved her. Both of us had been drinking. Under washington state law one of us had to be detained according to the police and since she claimed I shoved her,  I went to jail. I now am facing a DV charge and my court date is for tomorrow. I'm wondering if anyone can help with explaining my options and what to plea. Thanks.	Yes
14	Hi. I'm 18 years old and I would prefer to switch from both parents for a week at a time to one parent permanently. Are there any legal repercussions and how should I go about this?	Yes
15	Firstly, we're located in Oregon. It's been a long road and there's so much information that I'm not even sure to begin, so I'll just list the facts. My SO impregnated his (now ex) girlfriend after a couple months of seeing each other. He already had a son from a previous relationship and has shared custody of his 8-year-old with his son's biological mother. His son's biological mother is a heroin addict and is not in the picture at all.   The newly impregnated girlfriend (who I'll refer to as Megan for this post) and he decided that they're going to try to make it as a family because she wanted to keep the baby. SO's relationship with Megan lasted a little over 3 years and during that time, Megan attended a community college and was a stay-at-home mom for both the 8-year-old and their shared son. SO worked full-time and paid a majority of the bills. She used her refund checks from student loans to pay the rent only. The 8-year-old was encouraged to think of Megan as his mom. The end of the relationship seemed amicable and mutual. They even hugged after the breakup. Megan requested that SO not stay at the house anymore, so he started to stay with me. He and I were best friends and I lived in a small one bedroom apartment. There wasn't enough room for the 8-year-old and SO didn't want to leave Megan financially devastated because she still did not have a job. He continued to pay all of the bills for Megan which was about $1,100 a month and he would go to Megan's house each night to put the boys to bed. They were trying to keep up consistency so that the routine didn't change that quickly. He even spent his days off over there so that the boys didn't miss any time with him; he was at Megan's house as often as he was before the breakup. This pattern continued for about 6 months and during that time, SO and I became romantically involved. As soon as Megan discovered he was moving on, the entire situation became very hostile and ugly. Turns out she was harboring love for him still and had deluded herself into thinking they would get back together. Fast forward about a year and SO and I have moved into our own two bedroom place. The 8-year-old is in our care. His little brother is now a toddler and he lives with Megan. We have countless harassing texts, voicemails, emails and FB messages from Megan who has been a continued nightmare. She even went as far as to attack my SO's professional profile on both FB and Amazon. We have screenshots and countless prints of her erratic behavior. She became very fixated on me and insists that I'm taking her life away from her. She's convinced that I'm an evil mastermind and said she was going to make sure that I never got to be around either of the boys. A little about Megan, she's a very intelligent person, but she's also conniving, capable of delusions and has an obvious superiority complex. SO and Megan are still in an ongoing battle for their shared toddler and that trial will take place this September. SO recently received an email from Megan where she informed him that once the battle for their shared toddler was over that she fully intended to take him to court over the 8-year-old. She's not legally or biologically connected to him, but they did develop a mother-son relationship for a little over 3 years. We were still letting the 8-year-old see her every weekend until she threatened to take him away from him father. Her email wasn't stating that she wanted parenting time or visitations, she wants take custody of the 8-year-old and have him in her home. Can she legally do this? I'm baffled as to how she could. The attorney we spoke to said that her chances of winning were nonexistent. Megan has been very confident and stated in her email that the attorney she spoke to said the state of Oregon does recognize her parentage and she can take SO to court over the 8-year-old. Please help. We're stressed and quite frankly, I'm not sure what to believe.   TL;DR My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend helped raise a child for 3 years. She is not related to the child nor did she and my SO marry. We have a lot of documentation that she's not a rational or reasonable person. Can my SO's ex-girlfriend win rights to a child that's not hers?	Yes
16	My 16 year old daughter is pregnant and I refuse to support her child, period.   She doesn't want to be emancipated, but I don't want to support her lifestyle anymore. I want her gone. I know I sound like a monster but I can't take this, I will off myself before I support her anymore.   (Drugs,sex, sneaking out, stealing from me etc...) I am a single parent, Father, mother is deceased.	Yes
17	My new husband and his ex-wife have joint legal custody of their two children, 10 and 11. He is the parent with primary physical custody, however, and they reside with us the majority of the time, with her receiving standard 1st, 3rd, 5th weekend visitation, as well as other holidays, etc., as noted in their agreement.   She is, however, a very high-conflict individual. My husband receives many texts blowups, sometimes almost daily, which usually escalate to her calling him over and over, or emailing him long diatribes if both of those avenues fail. Sometimes this will slow for about a week until the inevitable flair blindsides us again.   These communications can range from demands for him to provide her my social security information to run a background check on me since I reside with her children, to detailed questions about things in our home; do we have parental locks on all electronic devices? Do we have a gun safe? What is the “safety plan” for her children now that my son (13) also resides in the home? We need to provide her with the children’s cell carrier and plan information so she can monitor those accounts (in our name, which we pay for). Where are their shot records, right now? Why aren’t we making sure those phones aren’t on every minute, every day, as they should be reachable to her at any time?   These are just some of many examples of demands, all given in command form, “You need to do this, RIGHT NOW.” They’re interwoven with name calling, verbal attacks, bullying, and total emotional meltdowns in which she has once even insinuated she will take her life, tell her children she loves them!, or a time when she had the children and refused to commit to returning them at the end of visitation, saying she’d be in another state, or maybe another city (although she DID return them, after we both were insane with worry and stress). The emotional breakdowns when calls aren’t answered or texts aren’t replied to, or information she wants isn’t given, can also come with threats to show up on our door at 3am to take the kids because we are unfit, to call the police, or just standard legal threats of all of these refusals to her demands or communications being “documented” for her records.   Emotionally demanded or not, she has the rights she has as ordered by the state to her kids and information about them. Having joint custody means, (I believe?) she is supposed to have a say in their day-to-day life, but I’m not sure what our responsibility is on that front, or what the actual actions are to carry out abidance to that looks like. We do know WE have the right to have a life that isn’t plagued with these demands and emotional attacks under the guise of it being about the sake and safety of the children. We are planning on communicating our intent our ground rules and guidelines about communications with her, including we will not communicate on anything but things which are about the kids, and further than that, that we will only communicate with her about things about the kids which we are LEGALLY bound to do.   With all of this said, even generally, what are we legally bound to do? I know most of this rests in what’s in the custody agreement, but it’s pretty standard for the terms listed, no special previsions or demands made and signed to. Is there a place to start before we make is serious by heading to the lawyer for legal counsel? We’re willing to do so eventually, but dang… we just want to know if we’re overreacting when we should have been saying, “LOL yeah right!” from the get go before we get official.   Thank you in advance if anyone out there is with me this long. I appreciate any pointers or guidance on this issue for my family.	Yes
18	My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	Yes
19	Charlotte, North Carolina Asking for a friend. Spouse is the legal guardian for a person with Alzheimers. (Guardian and Alzheimer's person are married). The Guardian, while driving, Alzheimer person as passenger, got in a car accident, no other cars involved, so probably fault will be found with the Guardian.  Guardian seriously hurt, in hospital, rehab etc.  Spouse with Alzheimers only got scratched and bumped a bit, no real injuries.  Guardian remains in rehab home, Alzheimer spouse in care facility.  Apparently the insurance called the Guardian and said there could be the possibility that the kids of the spouse (her stepkids) with Alzheimer's can sue the Guardian for injuries to the spouse with Alzheimers, especially as an estate is involved.  A will already exists regarding the property. Again, from what I know the spouse with Alzheimers was checked out by the hospital, no injuries found, sent to the care facility because of the Alzheimers.  Does this seem correct?  Is there anything the Guardian should consider doing now with respect to the above?	Yes
20	So...I have 2 kids (3 and 6), bought my first house, and want to move in with my girlfriend of 3 years.  My kids have known her for quite a bit (2.5 years).  Now I wanted to make this a trial run to see how we get along as a family, but I have a standard visitation with no overnight guests rule.  ....do we have to get married to make this happen?  It seems crazy. We want to write up a lease agreement to make a 45 day safety period if it doesnt work out, but I don't want to violate my order.    How can I make this a trial without violating anything?	Yes
21	I'm in Minnesota. A little background to this twisty, complicated, decade-long issue. (names changed) 12 years ago when my sister was in high school, she was dating a nice boy named Mike. Mike's sister Nancy was... crazy. She had a baby (Derek) when they were all in 10th grade, and, long story short, Nancy was a huge partier and drug user and her parents were no better. Mike and my sister ended up raising Derek pretty exclusively (with help from my parents) until Derek was about 4. My sister and Mike got married right out of high school and then divorced (amicably), but Nancy continued to leave Derek at my sister's house for weeks while she disappeared god knows where. On and on this went until Derek was about 8. Nancy ended up doing some jail time and Derek was living with her parents who were heavy gamblers and drinkers. He was getting in serious trouble in school and having serious behavioral problems. Mike intervened and called my sister asking if she could take Derek full time as no one else in their family was stable enough to care for him. She agreed and Nancy agreed as well, stating that she 'never wanted him'. Derek went to live with my sister and her boyfriend Randy who, because he's such a great guy, had no problem with her ex husband's sister's kid moving in with them out of the blue. They worked up a plan with the new school district and got Derek into family therapy to work through his issues, and over the last couple of years he has been very stable and his grades and outlook have improved immensely. He has stated that he hates his mom for what she's done and he wants to live with my sister forever.    Things were going well until about 2 months ago. Nancy has been in and out of rehab for years, and she is currently living in a halfway house. She called my sister to demand that she bring Derek down to the Twin Cities (about a 6 hour drive from where my sister lives) because she wanted Derek to stay with her for the summer. My sister said no, for every reason. Nancy is living in a halfway house, Nancy is not sober, Nancy does not have a job. Derek is doing well, he is stable and he is happy with my sister. Nancy then threatened my sister and said she would be taking Derek back full time unless my sister drove him to the Twin Cities every weekend for visitation. My sister can't do that, it's a huge cost, it's a huge amount of time, and most importantly, Derek doesn't want to see his mom.    She is currently waiting on her approval for foster care status, but that takes time. She doesn't have any legal rights over Derek, but his entire extended family 100% agrees that the best place for him is with my sister. What options does she have to make sure that Nancy doesn't follow through with her threat? Everyone is sure that *eventually* Derek will still end up with my sister, but that could take time, and Nancy is so unstable that my sister worries for his well being, even being with Nancy for a short amount of time. She's feeling very frantic and stressed and she doesn't know who to talk to or where to go to make sure this doesn't happen.	Yes
22	I am a grandmother trying to get my granddaughter out of foster care. I'm trying to become party to the case by filing for intervenor status. I fit the criteria. I then want to file for probate guardianship. The atty I consulted asked for a $5000 retainer which is beyond my means. How do I do this myself? Forms? Examples? Help!	Yes
23	throwaway username. Do parents have any recourse when their minor child is being courted by a MUCH older predator (30+years) if the child's age is of their state's age of consent - 16 NJ and 17 NY.	Yes
24	Virginia  Note: I ask questions often for different family members/friends. My life isn't as crazy as it would appear in my comment history.   I have exact 50/50 joint custody with ex wife. Her new husband left her and now she is getting a job where she works third shift and will not be able to keep child for half of her week and wants me to take him. I agreed as long as we can switch to me having primary custody and get it down legally.   What is the best way to get this in writing legally? Mediator? Paralegal? Notary? Most cost effective would be appreciated. Originally (5 years ago) we went to a mediator, but this time there isn't anything to meditate since we have already come to an agreement.	Yes
25	I don't know if this belongs here or if any of you can help me but I live in Florida, I got married in November of last year, and I recently decided to change my name. My husband has two last names and I only wanted to take the first of the two names. I got it taken care of at the Social Security office last week, my name is changed on my SS card and it is exactly as I wanted, it went great.  Well,I had my appointment with the DMV to change my license today and they told me I absolutely cannot do that, Social Security shouldn't have let me just take one of his last names because he has two last names on our marriage license. They told me either I need to take both names, he has to change his name, or I have to petition the courts.  He's an immigrant and can't change his name in this country without a ridiculous amount of problems, I don't want to take both last names for personal reasons, and It's like $300 to petition for a name change here.   Something about this feels not quite right; I'm not changing his last name, I'm just electing to take only one of the names. Is there anything I can do or any law about names/changing that I can reference to hopefully prevent me from having to petition the courts? Is this fishy to anyone else? Do I need to just bite the bullet and petition for the change?	Yes
26	Rather than the traditional route of donating through a company (which after some research I decided was not for me) I found a site that does it in a similar fashion to a dating site, which seems much less carefully tracked. Is it possible I could be sued for child support or other risk factors for this? Should or could I draft up some kind of legal waver and how would I go about doing so if I did? For further information the site I use is www.coparents.com	Yes
27	Hey, LegalAdvice!  I don't know if another sub is better suited for a post like this, so if there is let me know so I can fix it.  So, this inquiry is regarding a bit of family law. The 16-year-old in question is my girlfriend; I'm 17 at the moment. A little over a year ago, she finally got away from her home and parents back in California and was able to visit a friend here in Arizona. At the time it was just temporary. However, that ended up changing. She was crashing at her sister's house, but when the moment came both of them decided she'd be better off not leaving, and to no opposition by her parents (her legal guardians) she didn't.  For the record, the desire for her to stay was not unfounded. The long time she spent with her parents, she spent living in borderline unlivable conditions, jumping from hotel to hotel on credit alone. Her mother's mentally ill, her father's disabled, she was suicidal and surrounded by drugs and bad influences. The only things she has vocalised missing are her brother and 10+ animals. Come today, her mother got kicked out for stealing, and her father and brother got evicted. If going back before was somehow an option, it isn't anymore.  Ever since moving in with her sister and brother-in-law, she's done exceptional in school, stopped smoking cigarettes/doing any drugs, made friends she finally plans on keeping, is a much happier and optimistic person, and is looking for work to become more self-sufficient.  Of course, though; nothing is perfect. The sister is in her mid-twenties, but living with four biological children ages 2 to 10. Previously, sustaining everyone was easy because her sister and brother-in-law had decently paying jobs, and knew how to live affordably. However, just a few months ago the eldest daughter confided that her brother-in-law had been molesting her. He has been kicked out, an order of protection's been approved, and he appears to be gone for good. The case is still getting investigated, but it welcomed something my girlfriend was familiar with to her new home; CPS.  Now generally they almost have entirely un-involved her and me from everything, be it the case, the therapy, or any questions. But lately, her name has been popping up in the case workers mouths a disconcerting amount, specifically in regards to custody. Why she's living here, why she's not living with her guardian, why she doesn't have custody, etc. She has made it crystal clear that she does not want to go back, nor does she want to get fostered. Of the options available, she's only happy living on her own, with her sister, or with my parents and I.  Granting her sister legal custody has proven irksome since her disabled father and brother are currently reaping the benefits that come from her perceived care and social security, despite her not living with them. Which while fraudulent, would be hard for her to take away from her struggling family knowingly.  My question; What is the worst, if anything, that could end happen? And if it's bad enough, what options can we pursue to make sure they don't? (Minor emancipation, etc.)   Out of all of this, I want to know what I should expect, but especially want to be well informed. So if there's a place anyone thinks would have useful information, I'd love to have it. Thank you for reading!  **TL;DR**: 16-year-old GF living with her sister, can't go back home to her parents (legal guardians), CPS starting to make us anxious about her living situation	Yes
28	Throwaway, just in case.  My wife has joint custody of her kids.  We live in another state, so their father has them for the majority of the time.  He travels for his job some times and she will go back to stay with the kids to keep them in school whike he travels for a week or more at a time.  Recently, he decided to move and sold his house.  They, he and the kids, currently live in a camper with no running water and only a generator for electricity.  The kids are taking showers at the Y and he said the can shower at school once it starts back.  He plans to dig a well, but it has been over a month and he hasnt even has someone come out to look for a site to drill.  He had been talking about sending the kids to live with us.  Nothing definite, but with the way things are going, we figured it would be for the school year.    Last night he said he was not going to let the kids come live with us.  I believe he pulled this last night because she was taking the kids to visit family today and he is leaving to travel  for work before she would be back.  Very passive aggressive.  He wont be able to appear in front of a judge because he will be travelling, so if a hearing is required, it will have to be delayed until he returns near the end of the month.    My wife is going to talk to her attorney there.  What can we expect, as she is going to be asking for emergency (lack of a better word there) 100% custody until their father has a place other than a camper with a generator.    As a note: both kids are teenagers and want to live with us.  They were 5 or 6 when the divorce happened.  I know some states take this into account, but it is not relevant to the issue of living conditions.	Yes
29	My wife spoke to me about wanting a divorce last week. She packed her bags and left me Tuesday night.  Today is July 17th 2017, and I received an email from her asking me to move out  by Tuesday August 1, 2017 at 6pm.  What are my legal rights to stay in her condominium? (I live in British Columbia, Canada)  I have been sharing costs of the mortgage with her since we got married March 4th 2017.	Yes
30	I witnessed my (Indonesian) wife attempt to murder our daughter (Two YO), forcing her to drink bleach. Daughter recovered.  I told my mother then and wife confessed to her days later also.  Wife has disappeared with daughter now, demanding ransom over the phone ($20k). I have no legal recourse currently there, and no escape path for her.  I want my elderly mother's witness to my wife's confession to her reported legally, ASAP.  It may be useless, however some day I hope at least that my daughter could see the confession, documented at law firm here.   Could you please recommend a service type?	Yes
31	"My fiance is by all means, still married legally, she and her ex have been seperated for about 4 years now.  We have been together for two of those.  We just had a child a few days ago and found out that her ""husband"" is considered the father, what can I do to prove my paternity?"	Yes
32	Home state: MA New state: NJ  Hello.  I am trying to divorce my husband. He is emotionally and financially abusive. I have proof that he had an affair with a 16 year old girl while we lived in Boston. I am going on vacation to my family's home in NJ. Would I be able to stay and begin the divorce process from there? I have a daughter so I am prepared for the reality that that may not be possible. I am just asking out of desperation because being here with him is driving me into a deep depression.    Here are the facts:   * Married for 4 years * He is a green card holder/non citizen * I have picture proof of his adultery and abuse in text form * Daughter, age 3, was born in NJ * We lived in Boston for almost 2 years * He doesn't want me to divorce him and has made marriage counseling appointments  * I have 0 support system in Boston * I have no job, he works under the table     I know this is a shot in the dark question, as I feel like I definitely have to return to Boston to divorce because of custody reason. But I am asking anyway. I just wish to get out of here as soon as possible. I am numb right now but want to make the smartest decisions possible before I break down.	Yes
33	Both of my biological parents are deceased and I'm looking to find out more information about my biological father.  None of my relatives knew much about him so I can't really ask them anything.   I was able to find out that my parents were divorced in 1980 in Nevada (when I was a baby).  Through online searches I've found out which court, date, and certificate number of the divorce decree.   I'd like to find out the date of birth of my biological father and any other information about him.  Would the divorce record contain much information about the defendant or the spouse?  At the very least I assume his D.O.B. would be available?	Yes
34	"My fiancé's ex wife is threatening to withhold the kids from visitation. This isn't the first time and she has a habit of calling the cops and child protective services, etc. a few times a year. Every time, by the way, it's been considered ""unfounded"". The newest issue is sleeping arrangements. The kids are 5 yr old triplets. I personally have 2 kids of my own who live with me full time and we have the triplets every weekend. We have a 3 bedroom home with a finished basement (that was that way when we bought the home). The current sleeping situation is my two kids sharing a room, and the triplets (just turned 5) have toddler beds in a shared bedroom. We wanted to move them to big beds. We decided that we'd use one room of the finished basement and turn it into their bedroom (their play room/the theater is already down there and they spend most of their time down there anyway). We got the 2 girl triplets a queen bed to share, and the 1 boy triplet a twin bed. They only sleep at our house on Saturday nights. In the room that is now their bedroom, there are two means of egress (escape). One is the stairs leading to the upstairs, and the other is a Bilco door that is in the room leading directly to 4 stairs that lead to outdoors. Before we moved them down there we went to the township and spoke with the building code guy for the township-explained the situation and asked if we were in the clear to have them sleep down there. His answer was yes. No new construction or anything as it was finished when we bought it.   Ex wife states that it is against court order custody agreement which only states that there be an ""appropriate sleeping arrangement"" for the children. Obviously we're never going to have a house with 6 bedrooms, and so nothing will ever meet her personal definition of ""appropriate"" because she'd prefer they all have their own room. She states she called the township and asked if it was a legal bedroom and she says it's not.   I guess I'm just wondering if her complaints have any legal merit. I just think of these single dads with studio apartments or something and I can't imagine that as long as the child has an appropriate and safe place to sleep, that the court would dictate specifics on sleeping arrangements. Any thoughts?"	Yes
35	My son’s father filed for a child custody modification last year. We are going to trial at the end of the month. The original judgment handed down by the court gave me primary physical custody with visitation for our son’s dad on Wednesday nights and every other weekend.   I cannot afford an attorney so I will be representing myself at the trial at the end of this month.   I have a few questions: 1. His lawyer emailed me a “take it or leave it offer” regarding visitation (for me) which I declined to sign. Since then, my son’s father has not let me see our son. His lawyer indicated in the email that I could not show the judge the “offer.” Is the lawyer allowed to say this? My son’s father has now said he will ask the judge for me to see our son a few hours each week.   2. DCF (Mass) was involved during a domestic violence incident in 2015 in which I was arrested and my son’s father had a 51A filed against him for abusing me. A 51A was filed against me as well because I was arrested in front of our son. At the time, our son was 4 months old (I had full legal and physical custody) and I was used to the abuse and thought it would make more sense for me to decline to press charges against my son’s father so that my son wouldn’t be taken into custody by DCF. How can I most effectively tell the judge the circumstances of that night?  Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
36	So I was recently jailed on an Domestic Assault charge on a person that I've been friends with for years. The only reason it was classified as Domestic Assault is because we dated years ago. I'm really shaken about the entire court process and I plead not guilty. However I have numerous scratches and contussions from the actual fight, but I was the person that was taken to jail. With a no contact order in place she is on Facebook taking about she beat me up and knew I would to go to jail, she also messaged me an apology and said have a nice life. Her family was there when all this happened and I didn't have any witnesses of my own.  Is this case going to stand up in court or do I need to get an attorney? I also want to get a teaching license and would rather not have anything violent on my background. If you guys could help me out I would definitely appreciate it.	Yes
37	It's not my child, thankfully, but I'm attempting to give my friend advice. Missouri (at least where I live) has been known as a mother state.  Her boyfriend divorced officially divorced his wife last year after a rather harsh divorce in which she went rather psycho. In order to keep it from turning it into a huge custody battle (which it ultimately pretty much turned into), mother took weekdays while father took weekends and alternated holidays. Mother bugged them about holidays and attempted to extend or shorten the time, and for the most part the father didn't fight her on it. She began to move further and further away. She claimed job but twice it has turned out to be for men she has met over the internet. Understand, she meets these men and under two weeks she makes plans to move. The first time she intended to take the father to court in order to move out of state for the new boyfriend, but the guy broke it off with her. She recently did it again, but this time she shifted over custody and pretty much dumped the kid on him.  The kid has behavioral issues. He's 8, and was expelled from school last year. The mother 'homeschooled' him (sat him in front of a computer for two hours in which he watched youtube videos that gave him nightmares). After about two months of that she stopped even that. While he is not in school, he is not with his therapist and she refuses to find him one because she doesn't 'trust any of the ones in the area' so he hasn't been getting the help he needs. She also constantly forgets to give him his medication. He is a violent child. He destroys, he threatens. For some reason his mother decided to teach him to shoot a gun (gun safety is important, sure), but he got mad at my friend one day, and he threatened to shoot her. All guns are safely locked up in the house, but it's disturbing, especially as mother tries to undermine friend, tells son that he doesn't have to listen to friend, or attempts to blackmail father or make son think they're getting back together (attempted to make friend think father was cheating, claimed pregnancy of father's child and miscarriage the very next day when friend was present despite being on IUD and second trimester at least with no hospital visit). During the time that the father and my friend has son, they give him the proper care and his behavior improves, but when he goes back it goes right back to square one. He becomes a nightmare again. He's allergic to cats but she has a house full of them. The father believed he needed the mother in his life, however. But she refuses to work with him. Even the kid doesn't believe the mother wants him at this point, and thinks the mother thinks the boyfriend is more important than him.  Well, after the most recent boyfriend/job/move, where she attempted to move across state lines again and father refused to allow her, and she gave the father primary custody, the kid has started to improve again. Where the kid has tantrums every day, friend said he's only had one this last week and a few hiccups here and there that were easily rectified.   My friend sent me a few videos of him today talking about her. He thinks he's dumb, that mother doesn't want him and that's he thinks the boyfriend and the job and the move is more important. That she doesn't want him and he doesn't want anything to do anything with her anymore. At first he started off angry but at the end of it there was just this resignation.   Mother has also on numerous occasion claimed to have blacked out, lost her memory to the point that she thought she was still married to father on two separate occasions (she went to the docs but the docs ran tests and can't find anything wrong with her), and claimed to having seizures, but no reasons as to why. She also drives 3 hours to drop son off for the halfway point (in which cops have to be present at father and friends insistence as mother tends to start screaming matches) but doesn't see a worry about driving so far with her kid in the car and potentially endangering him. I originally thought you couldn't drive within 6 months after having a seizure but I don't think that necessarily applies in Missouri.  I've encouraged friend multiple times to call cps on her for her actions, but she's worried about making things worse.   Anyway. Again, mother state, and while the mother is pushing things over onto the father finally, she keeps coming back. She won't stop. She won't let go, she won't let the father go. She seems to want to wipe her hands clean of the kid but it's like she wants to use him as leverage just to keep him in her life. To her the kid is just a pawn and while I don't have much to do with them (I've literally never even met the mother), it makes me sick that this is going on.   Is there anything that the friend and father can do for the kid that can get her away for good, if she doesn't stay away on her own? She's missed several times she was supposed to call him and she was supposed to come pick him up but never did. She called him today apparently, after friend texted her and pushed her to talk to her son, but apparently she was just acting nice and didn't really respond.	Yes
38	The guy thinks he's the father of the an infant (3 weeks old) but the mother says he's not.  Can the guy or the court compel the mother to allow a DNA test?  **Thanks**.	Yes
39	"I divorced my spouse July of last year and part of the settlement involved being awarded a portion of their 401k, which was operated by the local chapter of their union.   In December of last year the provider of the 401k merged with the international chapter's 401k provider and since then noone seems willing or able to help me.  I've been told to basically stop calling/emailing the international chapter's investment department as ""we've not received the final calculations from the previous provider and cannot give you an update""  What, if anything, can I do to compel them to follow the court order?"	Yes
40	My financial situation changed due to me leaving an abusive relationship and at the time, the best decision for my son was to let him live with his grandparents while I got into a better financial and living situation. (GA, USA) The problem is ever since I started talking about being ready they started alienating me from my son (now 6 yrs old). So now that I'm fully ready and without doubt can give him the life he deserves, I have filed a petition for terminating guardianship, which was rejected and now has led us to court soon. I have a few questions about what is admissible in court specifically: Text messages, and call logs (where calls were not answered or returned), a notarized statement from a witness, can I have a (sibling) character witness?  It has been about 2.5 years since I signed over guardianship and I've continually requested and been shot down for visitation through the last 2 years. and have been trying to convince them to terminate for at least 6 months now.	Yes
41	"If I were to divorce my husband of almost 5 years, what are my legal rights?  He definitely makes more money then me and we did not sign a pre-nup.  We got married in NYC but will be moving to NJ this fall to attempt saving our marriage.  We also have a 15 month old daughter.  These are my questions below.  My biggest fear is that because he makes alot more then me that the courts will side with him or he'll hire lawyers to ""get me"".  Also, if we got married in NY and lived in NY but soon will move to Jersey (in Oct/Nov 2017) How does that work?  Would it go under NY or NJ law and how would that affect me? HELP! :(  1.  Child custody.  I would want joint custody for us to make decisions together, BUT I want her to live with me with granting him visitation rights.  During a heated argument he threatened me with taking me to court to gain full custody of our daughter.  He even mentioned that he will hire the most expensive attorney for him to win.  He has since apologized multiple times, but I have no idea if he will rant and threaten me again!  2. We did not sign a pre-nup and live in a co-op (that we bought together).  I recently became a stay at home mom with no income.  However when we move to NJ, I plan on going back to work and earn my own money."	Yes
42	"Hello.  I currently reside in California with my long term girlfriend. We've been together for 5 years and have discussed many times that we both do not want children.  She's been on birth control for the past 4 years, and we never had an issue.  Just last week, she told me she was pregnant. Claimed to be the 0.01% miracle that happened even with the birth control. I was skeptical, but stayed calm and collected. We discussed an abortion, but she was completely against it. She explained that she would feel too guilty and wants to go through with the pregnancy.  This rang a few bells in my head.  How can someone, that was so against having children - all of a sudden get knocked up and then calmly proceed to keep the baby without much discussion. It just wasn't adding up.  Yesterday, while she was in the shower, I snooped around her laptop and found a chatlog via a Facebook group chat with her 2 best friends.  In the log.. not only did her friends convince her to have a baby because she might regret it later, but also, managed to plot getting off birth control without my knowledge.  I had never felt such betrayal. In an instance, I started questioning how much I really knew her.   The chat log was so shocking, I couldn't help feel more hurt than angry.  They were all just cheerfully plotting this without my knowledge while laughing their asses off saying stuff like:  ""yeah, he doesn't need to know LOL.""  ""Just do it now, and apologize later. It's no big deal.""  Not only do I not want this kid, but I don't even want to spend another minute with her in a room.  I can no longer be in this relationship, after such a backstab.  I realize now, is the time to be calm and collected but I really have no idea to do.  Do I have any options?  I've read stories about this throughout the internet, and it's terrifying me."	Yes
43	I don't want him to go to jail. I didn't think it would result in criminal charges.	Yes
44	"Over the past year or so I randomly every now and then get a phone call from someone claiming they are debt collecting claiming I have an old account opened up with a loan company. I have never opened up a loan. They seem to always know my information. One of the first times they called me they told me I could pay it all off with a small one time payment, I was intimidated and gave them some of my personal info at one point because they wouldn't tell me what they were calling me for until I did.Every time someone has called me I always refuse to give them my info and they always get mad and hang up. My credit report say there is nothing opened in my name that I'm not aware of. What scares me is that they say the dates of the loan being opened is when I was in prison and my current roommates at the time had access to all my personal information I left at the house.  Today I got a call again, it started as a message saying someone is trying to contact me and send me information and to press 1 to be connected. I pressed 1 and someone answere with ""Hello"". I told them they called me and she then said she is a company who helps other businesses collect debt. She ask me to confirm my SSN and i said no. She got mad and said I will have to take it up with the judge. This very same phone call has happened a few times. They keep calling and saying they are sending me information to sue me for the debt. What can I do?"	Yes
45	"I'll start with the brief background.  My mom has been an alcoholic for just under a decade, and she dragged my dad into it for a while too. My sisters and I were emotionally abused and berated for the last 5 years or so. I was getting the most of it and would instigate to prevent it from getting to my sisters, but I was at University this last year and it got to them.  Finally, my mom got into rehab. Instead of getting better, she cheated on my dad with an alcoholic 25 years older than her in rehab and abandoned us for him after getting out. She's refusing to help with any bills, even though my dad can't cancel her off the phone plan without paying a $600+ fee. She won't help with any of my sisters' activities costs or my schooling.  I'm 19 now. I built my car up from scratch with my dad, and it was given to me for my birthday at 16. Stayed in parents' names for insurance purposes. I've got a job now and am paying my own things because my dad can't afford it all on his own, but my mom is refusing to sign anything over. She won't sign off on the title of my car to me, or even my sisters car to her. She changed our legal address on our accounts so all of our bills, which she isn't helping with at all, go to wherever she is and we can't access them.   She's literally holding everything in our life ransom because she got sober for a hot minute and ""fell in love"" with this guy and has gone completely loony on us. (Yet she keeps texting us kids how much she loves us.) As a result of this, in addition to paying my own things as I mentioned above, I'm having to send my dad hundreds of my earned money (which I desperately need because Michigan raised public university tuition prices almost 3% again this year) because he can't afford everything on his own.  She apparently wants to do an ""easier"" (I know it's never really easy) divorce that doesn't require court or anything, just filling out the documents and seeing a judge or something, I don't completely understand how it works. My dad is trying to fill out the divorce documents, but it's hard. He's been struggling massively with depression since all of this started happening. (To make it worse, my internship is 10 hours away in Minnesota, so I can't be physically there to help.)  I guess the question/advice I'm seeking, is what are our legal rights against my mom as the remainder of our family (Me, dad, sister 16, sister 14), and what are my legal rights against my mom in terms of my car, when I have my dad's backing? (The plates and everything expire this month and I don't know what to do.)  Title has MI in it, but for clarification, we live in Southwest Michigan. Even though I'm in Minnesota for the whole summer my legal address is still our home there.  Thanks everyone. I'm sorry if this was a bit too long; I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, never thought I would need to use it for something like this, though."	Yes
46	I am looking for some help on how to best (meaning as easily as possible) adopt my adult step daughter. Her mother and I were married for 8 years. We are no longer married but we have an amicable and friendly relationship. After the divorce I stayed involved in my step kids lives because... Well I loved them. After we divorce I was obviously no longer consider her step-dad. Over the past few years I have gone to her graduation, sent her birthday and Christmas gifts. She is 19 now and soon to be 20. She currently lives in Tennessee and I live in Georgia. We both joke about how I call her my daughter and she calls me dad, but when people start asking normal questions about our family. It doesn't take long until they get that confused look on their faces as they try to work out the family relationships because I have a very not nuclear family structure. So it takes us each about 10 min of explaining until they get the full picture.  So we talked about it today that I could just adopt her and make it easier and I would then have legal rights as a parent. My ex is fine with it and so is my current wife.  What I really would like help with is what state to file in and if I can keep the costs down by doing it myself.  Thanks in advance 😄	Yes
47	Hello! I just got married last month, and in addition to my wife taking on my last name, she and I are adding her maiden name as second middle names.  My question is this: do I need to do things like renew my passport and driver's license with the new middle name? I've heard things like the license won't even have both middle names on there because of space constraints, and for most of my transactions/official things, I won't even include my second middle name because of a lack of space in the form or inability of the form to accommodate a second middle name.  In essence, do my passport and license (and other similar documents) need to reflect my legal _full_ name? Thanks in advance!	Yes
48	To elaborate: my parents are currently separated, and went to a mediator to settle the divorce terms rather than sue. In the meeting, my dad agreed not to touch the money in any of the joint bank accounts, but he is now saying that what he did was legal. Can he actually do this? It's a shitty thing to do, especially when my mom, sister, and I are on vacation together, and it could really hurt hurt her financially. We just moved money from her other accounts into one he can't access but we are not sure what else to do.	Yes
49	My ex is court ordered to pay child support in addition to half medical and half school expenses. He was laid off and instead of looking for work has decided to go back to school. He said that he can no longer pay the child support or maybe pay a minimal amount (less than $35/week) which is hundreds less than he's ordered to pay.  What are the chances a court will calculate his income based on minimum wage? His earning potential is way higher. I really can't afford an attorney so I'm trying to determine what to do about this.	Yes
50	Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old. My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.  I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.  My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.  This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.  I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!	Yes
51	"TL:DR at botrom...  Child was born in Texas. She is married in Texas but was separated when we started dating. The mother was apparently sleeping with both of us after a while and got pregnant. When she found out, she insisted it was her husband's and went back to work things out with him with very little communication between us until birth.   After the baby was born, at the end of March this year, I insisted on a paternity test to be certain. Finally bought a test from the company Identigene on Amazon as they seem to be reputable and accurate from reviews I've read. We collected the samples as instructed with mother's permission and mailed it back. We got the results emailed to us and it turns out I am the father.   Now that we have those results I scheduled a ""court approved"" lab test to be done this Wednesday. Her husband recently left for business in another state and will be relocating there and wants her to move with him. She has not told him that she had the test done but plans to tell him the results of the lab test this week as well as tell him that she is not planning to relocate out of state and she is actually looking to move into a house much closer to where I live so that I can be an active parent to this child.  To be clear, so far: she regrets getting back with him bc she thought he was the father and now that he's not she plans to divorce him and stay close to me, but we are not getting back together ourselves at the moment but she is being fully cooperative and wants me to have every legal right to be this kids father.  TL:DR  What do I need to do legally to change a child's birth certificate to remove someone else as the father and have me added instead. What else do I need to do? Mother is fully cooperating with me so far."	Yes
52	My father was recently deemed incapacitated. From what my lawyer has uncovered, on the day he was admitted to the hospital and before he was official deemed incapacitated by a psychologist, his ex wife talked him into signing a financial power of attorney. Three days after he signed the power of attorney, he was ruled mentally incapacitated. I have since then been granted temporary guardian and appointed conservator. My question is, was the power of attorney signed by my father in the hospital granting his ex wife financial power of attorney hold weight considering he was ruled mentally incapacitated 3 days later?	Yes
53	Ex is self-employed. Ex has zero parenting time (his choice). The last time the amount was changed was over 9 years ago.  I requested a modification, and when he received the notice, he threatened to kidnap the kids away from me.   I am disabled, have zero income (other than the child support), and we are living in extreme poverty (3 people).   Since he said that I called up and cancelled the modification. I have no way to prove that he makes oodles of money; I know he fudged the numbers last time. He lives alone in a high-rent district; He travels frequently out-of-state and internationally; he lives in a very-high-income place;   I guess I'm afraid of him going in front of the judge and saying that since he has so much more money than i do that he is better able to provide for the kids and therefore they should be with him all the time.  Also One more question: Department of Revenue refuses to send the support to me when he sends it to them: I get the money as a lump sum, never in a consistent manner.   I know he sends the same amount, on a consistent basis, as i have witnessed this, and also multiple times when he went out of state he left the money orders with me to mail in for him once a week.   Can i get them to pass the money to me on a consistent basis? Because of their inconsistency I got a warning when I turned my rent in a few days late.	Yes
54	I am only asking for informational purpose as I was curious whether it rests with the father or the mother (paternity established, and they share custody). I also understand that if mother and father are fighting wrt to naming the child they should probably not be having childre, but I'm asking this question from a purely academic point of view. I also want to know if different states have different laws regarding naming the child, or if there are some ridiculous laws in other states, feel free to chime in.	Yes
55	My sister (23) and myself (24f) were sexually assaulted by our older cousins (I'll use their initials, E, L, C) when we were younger. The youngest E is 3 years older than me, and C the oldest, is 6 years older than me, L being the middle child. My sister had reported to my mom that E had done something to her when she was about 10 and demanded my dad do something about it. My dad couldn't believe that his nephew E would do such thing and decided they would no longer stay over. At the time, I was also going through some questionable things with the older sister L  and because of the lack of support, I never spoke up about her and I've suppressed those memories (for the life of me I cannot remember what she did, but that it confused me). Two other aunts, my father's sisters, contacted my mother about their daughters suddenly showing sexual behaviors at such a young age. These cousins are about 6 years younger than we are. Those aunts didn't report it, again, because it's family and denied it when my mom did decide to call the cops.  All of this caused strain between my sister and dad, and of course my dads side of the family. Recently I spoke to a counselor about a memory in which I woke up to my pants being pulled down and my cousins L &amp; C hovering above me, to which they giggled and said they were playing a prank. They stopped, but in my sleepy haze, I could see my other cousin E at my sisters waist with her pants down. I fell back asleep and always beat myself up for never mentioning that. My counselor reminded me that I wasn't the adult and what happened wasn't in my control. I eventually came and told my sister this, to which she responded that she knew I knew something this whole time but didn't remember that specific incident. She waited for me to be ready and she understood why I stayed quiet. I told her that if it would help her quality of life and help her move past her fears that I would be with her every step (as much as distance and work would allow) of the process if she decided to press charges. She did, or is trying to. The detective says none of the other victims want to speak out. I'll be talking to her next week and will be giving my account of one situation no one but myself can remember. Not having correct dates and ages makes me hesitant it'll do anything.   When dealing with old situations with little to no evidence, what can one expect in Illinois? It scares me like no other that they won't have any repercussions for taking my sister's innocence and then tormenting her, her whole childhood. One of the cousins got a lawyer, and the other two won't speak to the detective.  Any advice would be great.	Yes
56	[Iowa] She'll sometimes not let me leave the house and take my phone so I have no way to talk to my friends, lately I've just been using my 3ds to message them. If I just left the house could she call the police and make them take me back? She also won't let me ride in friends cars but I can't find anything that says it's illegal for me to do it without her consent even though she says it is.	Yes
57	"My children were removed from my home last August after my husband made a false report that got me arrested and released with no charges. The DHS complaint and arrest was for my husband alleging that I held him and the children hostage at gun point. However, my husband admitted to the DA, DHS, and PD that he lied about the incident. My husband was never arrested or investigated for filing a false report.   My husband (who I now have a restraining order against and am in the process of divorcing) failed his court ordered psych eval, and I passed my court ordered psych eval. In court two weeks ago, I was ruled the only viable parent by DHS.   DHS is refusing to give my children back unless I admit to criminal activity per the caseworker verbally telling me that repeatedly.   The children have been with my family since last August. My family doesn't support me (except for my father) due to the caseworker telling them that DHS knows for a fact that I committed a gun crime.   I have no mental health diagnoses (a psychologist certified it), I have no substance abuse issues (random UA and medical records proved it), I have a clean background (I have never been charged with a crime, and I have never been arrested before my husband made his allegations), I have a clean, safe, and stable home (DHS and service providers have been there to prove it), I have a job (I am capable of providing for my children), I have been engaged in every service recommended by DHS without hesitation, and I have completed the Action Plan created by DHS (except for the 32 week domestic violence course which I have 22 weeks left).  My court appointed attorney will not defend me or advocate for me due to his stated reason of not wanting to make the caseworker get mad and quit her job (he blames me for making the last caseworker quit his job due to being scared of my husband). He has stated to a service provider, my father, and myself that I made the last caseworker quit his job. My lawyer calls me needy, says that it's my fault that my husband stalked/beat me, and he has repeatedly stated, ""It's not my job to explain the state's case against you. I don't know the case, it's complicated."" He has been my lawyer for almost a year.   A few days ago, the caseworker told my lawyer that I sent my parents hostile e-mails after court which proved that I was an unsafe and unstable parent. I never sent them e-mails, and I gave the caseworker and my lawyer a statement provided by my father denying the caseworkers allegations. After I provided my father's statement, the caseworker has refused to communicate with me. My lawyer, a former prosecutor, is trying to get me to admit to sending the e-mails and has not commented on my father's statement denying the allegations. My lawyer will only say that he is waiting to get a copy of the e-mails (that don't exist) before he will comment about them.   The caseworker told my mother, brother, and sister in-law that it is their legal duty to report to her every time they learn that my father speaks to my lawyer. The caseworker also told my mother, brother, and sister in-law that my father has to legally give her the contents of private and privileged communication between my father, my lawyer, and myself. My family (my brother and sister in-law are the foster family and my mother lives with them to care for the children) has been pressuring my father to give them the communication between my father, my lawyer, and myself so that they can give it to the caseworker. My refusal and my father's refusal to give the caseworker private and privileged communication is being seen by DHS and my family as me being an unsafe and unstable parent. My lawyer refuses to comment or intervene on my behalf regarding this matter (he also refuses to comment or intervene on most things).  DHS is threatening to adopt out my children per my lawyer and my family.   TLDR; My lawyer won't put me in front of a judge so that I can fire him. I'm drowning due to not having competent representation."	Yes
58	Thanks for reading. I am a 22 year old child of two parents whom divorced when I was 2. My father never paid my mother child support, and when my mother tried to petition for some, he denied paternity. Anyway, he never paid a dime of child support. Is it possible to sue him for back child support? He lives in GA now. I have honest motives for wanting to sue as he has caused serious financial impediments to my life recently. Thank you!	Yes
59	"I have a 2 year old who does not have any father declared on her birth certificate. Her father turned out to be a drug addict and has not been involved in her life since I left him 22 months ago. He has made no attempts to establish paternity, but has threatened to try and sue for custody a few times when I have spoken to him.   He is very unstable, and his family is equally unstable and they all have a plethora of substance abuse problems. I am very afraid his grandmother may give him the money to sue for custody. I think he would end up dumping her with his mother and her heroin addict boyfriend because he is completely incapable of caring for her (or thinking of anyone but himself). It would ruin her life for them to be involved. Ruin it.   I have an advanced degree and am financially stable on my own. I don't need child support from him, so that is not a factor.  I read that if the parent is a drug addict and doesn't try to establish custody, it is possible to petition the court to terminate their parental rights.  What is the likelihood of this succeeding? What kind of proof do I need to file my petition?  How likely is it that this would just be an easy way for him to establish paternity without having to pay any money (which is probably the only reason he has not done it yet)?  He did complete a drug treatment program, and has a job / apartment now, but he is still making up excuses to go to the hospital and get pain meds - which is what he is addicted to.  He is so addicted that he actually hurts himself so he has a reason to go (punching walls to try and break his hand, jumping off things to try and break an ankle, throwing himself down stairs to try and get injured, he even faked needing a cane for after ""breaking his back"" several years before I met him)."	Yes
60	"I understand that getting legal advice like this on the internet can be complicated and I'm certainly not looking for definitive answers. I'm also aware how during a divorce there is always hearsay and he-said, she-said or just the old two sides to every story. I would ask though that given this is my life and my family, whom I know intimately and have decades of anecdotal evidence I'm basing this off of. I would ask that within the constraints of this post we just more or less take my statements and fact and then offer your advice accordingly. My intention here is to find a starting point with some good professional advice in what is likely to be a long and complicated road ahead.  My mother married a mentally unstable and physically abusive/alcoholic narcissist. It has taken me many years of living on my own to be able to get my bearings and see him for what he is and although he was certainly not always this way he has started to get worse as it seems he's now working towards an agenda.   I don't see him as this particular mastermind as it is clear he is riddled with mental issues which have gone undiagnosed all his life as he both denies any and all of it and also refuses treatment. However I have recently learned from my mother that a woman, lets call her Becky, with whom my father has had an affair with in the past is back in the picture. Rather she never left the picture, it's just that Becky and my father have gotten sloppy and my mom has noticed. Becky it seems also has a long history, looking back in hindsight, of being EXTREMELY effective at manipulation and extracting money from people. My father is also one of those people (some of you may be able to relate) who puts external social validation WELL above the needs/validation of family....  Becky started out as a family friend about ~15yrs ago. Because my father so vehemently vouched for her it took a long time for her shitty personality traits to shine through on its own and about 9 yrs ago my mother, brother and I all confronted my father and explained to him that she is no good. That we no longer are willing to deal with or finance any of her bullshit. Especially if it means doing so puts our family in financial distress. Then perhaps 5 yrs ago my mother had to overhaul their finances and discovered my dad had several maxed out CC's which he was in the process of having sent to collections. At the time just his off-center personality explained these away and we did not dig into it much more but I've recently found out. That as far back as 3 yrs ago my mother was informed through a trusted friend that Becky and my father were seeing each other a few times a year.... every year... now those CCs make more sense. My father also has not worked a 9-5 in his entire life. He has had some work in the past but has mostly been living off my mother and drinking for the last ~10yrs.  Again, I have to stress that I don't think my father is capable of scheming so much as Becky is capable of putting thoughts and words into his head. It would seem that he is convinced that if my mother were to divorce him, since they live in California, he would get alimony and half of the assets. He and my mother are on the deed to their house however my mother is only one supporting them and paying the mortgage. Given the most recent phone calls I've had with my mother and hearing the distress in her voice with all the mental gymnastics my father knows how to put people through I get the impression he is hoping that a suicide would leave everything to him. Not that he can afford the mortgage, but he could certainly liquidate, downsize and then Becky would be able to live off of that for quite some time. The thing we discovered about Becky, again, hearsay, but people who know her who have reached out to us... this was many years ago. Said she was involved with another man in the exact same way. She leeched off of him and his family for many years and then the wife ""killed herself."" I'm laying this out because this is the kind of sick and twisted people my father is associated with. I wouldn't put anything past him at this point because he does own guns and I'm sure if Becky told him to kill my mom, he would just do it. He has done more irrational things in the past on a whim and I know in a divorce situation emotions run high and these threats can be thrown around without there usually being much validity. It's just that knowing my father I know he is more than capable of it because he's not mentally sound and he's clearly working for the interests of a person who while not crazy is certainly not a good person and like my father I feel I would be making a mistake by believing there is some line of rationality and reason which these people will not cross.  In my mind I want to treat this as a ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"" kind of situation.  I hope that was mostly coherent enough, as it is I had to spend 30min on the treadmill to clear my head enough and organize my thoughts.  Any advice is much appreciated."	Yes
61	"TL;DR: Alcoholic EX abandoned daughter 3 times in two years and is now saying that I have no right to keep her from him while we wait to go to court.   Everytime I go to file our divorce and custody paperwork something changes, which is usually him exiting, or coming back into our DD life so it remains to be filed.  The first time he told me that he couldn't care for her anymore because of his depression and said that he was thinking about moving to Abu Dhabi with his dad and NOT keeping in touch. I gave him two months while my daughter, then 4, asked me why I stole her away from papa. She regressed to peeing in her pants and bedwetting every night at the start and asking if my SO was her dad now. We got her through it, but by the end I told EX that he needed to either start taking her again or at least paying CS.  The second time, DD was almost 5. I for the 3rd time caught ex drunk in the morning from staying up until daylight drinking while she was in his care. I realized that it wasn't a mistake or one off and with him completely passed out and DD having helped herself to ice cream sandwiches for breakfast, I realized this was dangerous and harmful to her. I found out from his SiL that she frequently watched Adel while he slept off his drunk. I started by being supportive. I told him to go to AA, and got his family involved. At the time we had a 50/50 schedule. I didn't tell him that I couldn't give DD back, but he also didn't bother to ask to get her back when his days came and went. DD regressed to nightly bed wetting again, and developed social issues. I ended up telling him that he needed to be in therapy for his depression and alcohol treatment. 4 months later he asked if he could see her for a holiday and I told him that I thought that would be confusing and reminded him of what he needed to do. No response. The next month he asked for another holiday and I gave him the same answer. Then the next month for Christmas, 7 months after I had picked her up at his house while he was drunk, he asked if we could talk. I met him for coffee and it seemed like he understood what had gone wrong, he was in therapy, and ""not drinking."" so I told him he could have every other weekend and I'd give him first dibs on babysitting. He said that he would pay me back for his months of absence. He didn't, but that's beside the point.   It was working for 4 months, but then when I went into labor with my DS I let EX have dibs on watching DD. The next morning while I was in active labor and about an hour away from giving birth I had to organize for a pick up of DD because EX was drunk. I let him talk me into it being a mistake, and we continued visitation for another two weeks until he was forced to move out of his house. I told him that while he was couch hopping he only had to see DD once a week for several hours so that she wouldn't panic and think he was leaving again. That went on two weeks with my full support before he stopped responding about when he was going to pick her up and missed a weekend, only to apologize on the following Monday and say that he was going back into counseling (something he was supposed to be in the whole time he had her). THIS RIGHT HERE was the point where I finally broke. THIS is the moment where I stopped being friendly or supportive. He didn't ask about her, until her birthday a month later (June) when he'd found permanent housing and I told him we needed to go to court and reiterated that this was not good for her. I finally filled out CS paperwork and that pissed him off. Then he asked to bring her to a family picnic the next month (last week) and I told him again that he needed therapy and AA and that I thought it would be confusing for DD to have him in and out.   Last night, after I had found out that he was drinking over the weekend and then no called no showed to his weekly gig, we had a texting battle where he told me that I had no right to withhold her. I told him to take me to court. He stopped texting.   What I'm looking for here is legal validation and perhaps resources so that I can get this done correctly with my DD best interest in mind. I know that what would be best for her is for him to get his shit together, but he's blame shifting and refusing AA rather than doing it.   Anyway, if you read ALL of that, kudos, and thank you."	Yes
62	My boyfriend has a 6 year old son, we'll call him John. Bf has a very strained relationship with his ex (John's mom) and exes bf. Up until a year and a half ago, John lived with my boyfriend, ex got him every other weekend, and she paid child support. Bf's company shut down, lost job, and lost his apt.  Now John lives with the ex and her boyfriend with her other children. My bf for the last year has been in and out of apts, homeless for a few weeks at a time, and occasionally lives with his parents who are EXTREME hoarders (so not a legal or viable option for John to stay).  Now my bf has a steady job for last 3 months. Is making child support payments and sees John only sat and Sunday.  In the last few months my boyfriend also called CYS because ex's boyfriend put his hands around John's throat. He has proof and pictures. Took him to police station they took pictures, John told them is was ex's bf, CYS case worker said they couldn't label it as child abuse because there was no hospitalization and no lasting marks (the hand marks eventually faded after a few days)? So they didn't do anything and John had to be returned to his mom. This is not the first time the ex's boyfriend has placed hands on John but I believe this is the first time we have proof.   My bf also has reason to believe there may be some sexual abuse happening in that house as well. John was caught taking very obscene, inappropriate picture of his genitals, and taking videos. It could just be a sexual exploration thing but I can't remember doing that when I was 6?  My bf is trying to keep up with his child support payments, get an apartment (for him and John), and find a lawyer but it seems impossible when he's literally starting from scratch.  His payments for child support are less than $200 a month, most apartments require a credit check (he has shit credit) and first+last/security which he doesn't have, a lawyer is so out of the question financially.  My bf doesn't want to put John in foster care but we're at a point where we feel strangers could be safer then leaving him with his mom. We would have to do an emergency custody hearing which would cost him around $400 just to file. He also did this a couple years ago and this resulted in zero punishment the last time the ex's bf hurt John so it feels pointless.   He just feels so defeated with the whole situation. I can tell he's at a point where he would rather beat the shit out of his ex's boyfriend just to get rid of him, end up in jail, rather than his kid stay there another day and risk more abuse/injury. I can't really blame him. He's terrified the boyfriend is going to take things to far and seriously injure or do something worse to his son.  I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but he needs legal help. This situation has been escalating on a weekly basis. I can tell that my bf is feeling cornered, desperate and that his kids life is being threatened probably on a daily basis. Does anyone know of an organization that can help a parents with low income? We live around Philadelphia.  :TL;DR son is being abused. Need to get him out of mothers house. Very little access for funds or resources.	Yes
63	"My husband and I are considering a divorce. We have a child born in 2014. We also married in 2014, in California, where we've lived the entire time.  I've been the higher earner in our relationship. He was out of work, and then took care of our child when I returned to work. In case of divorce, our child would stay with me. We've discussed that, in case we do divorce, we would want to treat our property (~100k 401k, ~200k investments, no house) basically as non-community property, the way it would have been had we not gotten married. Now, this ""you keep yours"" and ""I keep mine"" results in a very skewed allocation of our assets, where he gets to keep ~40k, and I keep the rest. In a non-contested divorce, where we draw up all the paperwork together, can we agree to such a lopsided allocation? Or is that somehow illegal, and/or could be rejected by a judge? If so, can we sign a post-nup that outlines the above in case of divorce?  To make it abundantly clear, there's no coercion whatsoever involved. We both think it is in our child's best interest to split assets as described."	Yes
64	Ok, so I'm going to use 'wife' b/c that's how we considered ourselves, but we never filed a marriage license.  My wife moved out June 21 and took our nearly 5 yr old daughter with her.  I've seen my daughter less than 8 hours since then, spread across about 3 widely separated days.  Tuesday I had a massive panic attack due to everything that's going on, and apparently my texts to wife were too much for her. She cut off all communication and told me not to contact her.  Previous to this, even that night, she would have our daughter call me almost every evening ranging from about 9-11pm.   Well, last night, no call.  My wife has untreated depression, and while were together she would often stay in bed all day, barely, if at all, supervising our daughter during the day. I have multiple people who can attest to this.  She has also said to me that she has had suicidal thoughts, but she doesn't act on them due to not wanting to abandon our daughter.  I have reason to believe this is still the case where she is staying.  I have been told that I have enough reason to call 911 and have her committed. I have not done this b/c I believed she was not a danger. But w/o contact, I am much less sure.  I do not want to take such drastic action, as I believe that would destroy any possibility of us reconciling, but if I become convinced that our daughter may suffer, then I must.  She currently has my car, b/c when she left she did NOT tell me she 'was leaving' but that she was going to spend a few days at her dad's, which isn't unusual. I haven't asked for the car back yet, b/c I love this woman, and I believe that we could rebuild the foundation of our relationship and work things out.  My basic question, however, is that w/o having daily contact with my daughter, I do not know what level of care she is getting, and that worries me. What can I do?!  Super stressed, so this was a bit rambling. I'll answer any ?'s I can.	Yes
65	"I'm going to try to summarize this as briefly as possible. By the way, I'm in Virginia. Basically, my mom was impregnated and my ""dad"" didn't want anything to do with it. To protect me, my family had him sign something saying he wouldn't contact me or contribute to my welfare. This applied until I turned 18. Now, as an adult, I've attempted to make contact but he has responded that he has no interest. Given that I didn't make the decision to essentially sign him off all parenthood duties, do I have any legal grounds at all to sue for child support as an adult?"	Yes
66	As a 17 year old in Utah I'd like to move in with a friend. I have ptsd and I feel like the longer I stay in the house where everything happened the longer it'll take to recover. There's also been more and more conflict with my mother and my ptsd symptoms and suicidal thoughts are increasing. I'd like to know if the police would come get me even though I'm less than 6 months away from turning 18, if the people I'm staying with could get in trouble, and if I can stay in school and work without a parent/ if I'm listed as a runaway.	Yes
67	I just found out that my husband has been having a year long affair with multiple women.   I am a stay at home mother and full time student with two kids (6 and 1.5). I have not worked in over 6 years.   My husband and I own a house together, though it is primarily in his name as he has income. I am, however, in the paperwork showing that I also own the home.   I feel so lost. I never wanted to be in this position and I have been busting my ass to finish my degree to make sure I could provide for myself if need be. So I guess my question is - now what? How can I protect myself and my children? What kind of government assistance is there for women like me? How much of his paycheck will go towards child support? We live in Texas, and he makes roughly $45k before taxes.   He's my best friend, I'm not out to be vindictive, I'm just trying to get by while I finish my Bachelor's.	Yes
68	(Portland, OR) My transgender partner and I got into an argument. The argument continued to escalate to the point where I made a really horrible comment invalidating her gender. In response to this, she lunged at me and started punching me, pulling me down to the ground and beating me with a broomstick. I managed to constrain her and make my way out of the apartment. I called 911 and they arrested her.  When the police arrived, I made the mistake of talking to police who recorded a statement (I was completely jostled and nearly out of it when he was asking me questions). My apartment management also convinced me to call the DA and give them the case number. I have not yet been contacted by a prosecutor.  I do not wish to follow through with prosecution. While in this one instance she initiated the attack, I believe there has been a mutual pattern of abuse in our relationship. There have been times when I have yelled at her or made physical contact (such as grabbing her and trying to force her out of the room or pushing her when she was in my face). Usually this happens after we have been arguing and it quickly devolves into shouting matches. We are both to blame for raising our voices, talking over one another and escalating these arguments. We both say horrible things to one another. It's just a mutually abusive relationship that I want both of us to be out of because we've tried it for so long and it does neither of us any good.   tldr; me and transgender girlfriend got in fight, she was arrested for domestic assault, I called DA with case number. What can I do to have them drop charges / not continue with case?	Yes
69	Here's my situation regarding my marriage..  I am American-Vietnamese, born here in the United States in the state of Georgia. My husband was an international student I met when I was 17. We started a relationship in which lead to our marriage when I was 18. I had our son when I was 19. We went through paper work to change his status and attempt to get his green card through marriage. I am not familiar with what the correct terms of the whole process. During the process I was pregnant with our son, so the initial interview happened to confirm if our marriage was real or not. We definitely passed really easy because of our baby. Since then he got temporary USA resident and temporary work permit (I think that's what it is), and the application for his actual green card applied for. We got lots of confirmation letters that the application had been received. We lived our lives as we waited. During this wait time our relationship went downhill. It was a very unhealthy relationship in which I needed to escape in order to recover myself and to do everything I could to provide for my son. He was arrested when I was 21 for domestic violence. It was an accident on his part but I was scared so I called the police. He had to pay a fine, take family violence classes, and was on parole for a few months. That was the end of our relationship.. the last straw. I immediately moved to Florida with my son to get away and start my life over. I left with nothing but our clothes. I've since then built a life for my son and I here. I am about to turn 23, he is 29, and throughout these two years I have let his dad see him many times. I am grateful for their father-son bond and do not ask much from his father. His dad asked me to continue helping him getting his green card because he does not want to be sent back to Vietnam. Out of fear that he would be sent back and my son would not have his father here in the states or him not being able to help with child support, I agreed. I am in a very healthy relationship right now with a man who loves my son and I for about six months now.  Now that I live in another state and in a relationship, I'm worried. He called to tell me that he got a letter asking for an interview next month. It's been almost two years since I left and this is the first letter. He asked me to fly in for this interview. Let me also add his family here in the states are the ones handling all the paper work and they are the ones going back and forth with the lawyer.. I pretty much have been doing what I was told since this whole process begin and I have no knowledge of what goes on.  All I know is I have to attend this interview and I am nervous. He was arrested and I moved out of state and am in a new relationship. I honestly want out, but I do not know where to start. I no longer care about getting his green card and don't really want any ties to him anymore besides our son. I want to get a divorce and move on with my life. Should I go to this interview and tell them our relationship didn't work out? And I don't want to do this anymore? And is there any chances I can get in trouble?	Yes
70	My [19] dad has been an alcoholic my entire life. He drinks to the point of passing out every single night. I've been out of the house for 2 years now, but when I lived with my parents I never once saw a night where he wasn't passed out drunk by 11 pm or so. My mom has been putting up with this for 20 years and has been trying to hold things together for her kids. But rightfully, she has finally decided enough is enough and is considering a divorce. I have a little brother and sister who are 8 and 11.   My mom and I are both concerned that if her and my dad get a divorce, he will get some custody of the kids. She wants my brother and sister to have a relationship with their dad, but she's genuinely terrified that if they stayed overnight with him and there was an emergency of some kind after my dad has started drinking, he would be blacked out and unable to help. She's brought this up to him and he is a hallmark addict--he denies any problem and claims he could still parent the kids.  My mom doesn't have much evidence to prove my dad's alcoholism other than verbal testimony from her, me, family, friends, and the kids. To my knowledge, he's never gotten a DUI or had any alcohol-related arrests or altercations. My mom said she has started taking video of him when he's passed out, but other than that she doesn't have much. My question is, would my dad's alcoholism be able to be proven in court and is it likely that a judge would grant my mom physical custody of the kids until he gets help?   Thank you all in advance.	Yes
71	"Hello, I recently turned 18 and a friend and I were participating in a competition where one of the categories was ""best kept secret"". We decided to get married for this, as a joke, despite never being in any sort of physical or romantic relationship. I soon realized my mistake and I want to get a divorce, or ideally an annulment. How complicated would this be? Both parties are mutally seeking the divorce and we have no assets or anything to divide between us, we just want this to go away.  I am aware of how stupid this was so spare the lecture, I'm just seeking legal advice. Please note I live in/the marriage took place in New Jersey. It was a civil wedding, done in my towns village hall."	Yes
72	My ex-and I have had a horrible divorce (like the majority of them).  He has caused many issues in my new relationship.  The strain has caused my new husband to leave a few times because he could handle the verbal abuse of my ex.  Me and my new husband have come to terms with our situation and decided to face that is our life and we are moving forward.  We are not going to separate anymore.  My ex is not happy that me and my new husband are staying together.  Has threatened to get a Guardian ad Litem for my 11 year old.  There is no abuse in our home and my son is loved.  Can my ex (who is living with his girlfriend an no legal place of his own) get custody of my child because of my new husband leaving before?	Yes
73	"Hey guys, I'm a bit stuck right now. I got a message from a woman who claims to have my fiance's kid. They had talked years ago about the baby, and his mom told her she would pay for a paternity test; she saw it and ignored, then waited until the day before he left for basic to reach out again. His mom and the girl argued, then the girl ended up blocking her after saying military men do not make good fathers and she doesn't want him in the child's life, she just wants the child support.  So, fast forward to where we are now: two years have passed, and she just messages me out of the blue saying she wants to take legal action for sole custody and to get a paternity test, so she can get child support.  His name is not on any documents, or the birth certificate. Also, he has texts where she admits she essentially raped him. At a party while he was passed out, she ""went for a ride.""   He think she's just playing games again, and he recalls her doing the same thing to another man - trying to get child support from him.   Any advice? I'm super stressed about this. Can someone explain to me how the child support and paternity works? How does he sign over his rights? He said he would want to do that if it came to it.   We are in Missouri, she lives in another state but had the baby here."	Yes
74	I recently filed a petition to change my name, and checked several times to make sure I had the spelling right before submitting anything. Come to find out when searching the case on the court website, my current middle name was entered incorrectly. Is this something that could have an actual impact (since the whole point is about changing my name), or would it just be dismissed as a data entry error?	Yes
75	"My brother got a girl pregnant via one night stand, the baby is now 2. He wants primary custody. Here are the circumstances.  The mother has no criminal record. Has her own home. Has 3 kids. Works as a CNA and makes probably $25,000ish a year. She is the custodial parent. We are concerned about her volatile relationships. She has had several boyfriends since her daughter was born. She keeps getting back together with the other 2 kids's dad, an alcoholic who has been arrested for DUIs several times; as recently as March 2017. Everytime they've broken up, she blasts him all over Facebook, posts pictures of him cheating on her with her sister, goes into these huge drama posts. He supposedly threatened to set their house on fire during one of their off-periods.   My brother expressed concern the last time she got back together with him. She said he was still drinking, but that she would get him help by bringing him to a church sobriety program once a week. My brother used to check the fridge every time he'd go over there out of concern for Baby. 3 months later, they're still together, she's still having alcohol around the house. She posted on Facebook a few weeks ago a picture of her boyfriend working on their car next to a beer, and captioned it with ""yeah that's his beer, if you have something stupid to say about it, say it to my face!""   It's just a matter of time before they break up again and more drama erupts. Last time they broke up, she had posted on Facebook that the guy wasn't safe for her kids to be around, and that she'd never let him around them again. Before she brought this guy back into her life, she had a different boyfriend where there was a domestic dispute, they both assaulted each other but neither pressed charges, and the kids had to be locked in their room. Brother has a text of her talking about it.   She smoked cigarettes while pregnant with all of her kids and still smokes. She sent my brother a text about how she was smoking in the car and an ash flew under her butt and she crashed the car, several months ago. She's posted several videos on Facebook of her recording her kids dancing to music at a 180 degree angle from the road, and has one video (albeit a year old) where one of her kids is next to her in the passenger's seat.  Brother is a registered sex offender. Offense was committed 8 years ago. Makes 40k a year, has his own home and lives with a girlfriend. They've been in a stable relationship for a year. Never has brought the daughter around any other girls.  In the court ordered parental agreement, my brother is only supposed to see Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. However, through informal agreements, my brother has seen the baby every weekend Thursday-Sunday for several months. Before that, informally he had the baby Thursday-Sunday every other week, and visited on the alternating weeks.   My brother drives 1 and a half hours to see his daughter one way, it should be mentioned. He's driving 6 hours round trip each week to have his daughter.   Our biggest issues are her instability and that everytime Mother gets mad she threatens to ""enforce"" the actual parental agreement, which would mean that Brother only gets Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. She uses the daughter as a pawn to control my brother.   He used to give her $200 a month, undocumented, on top of his child support. He stopped after a lawyer advised him to, she went hysterical and nearly ""enforced the agreement"" again. It's walking on eggshells with her now. Any day she will probably pull their informal agreement. We don't even know if he'll  be allowed to get her this upcoming week.  Our question -   My brother wants to hire a lawyer and go to court. He wants the primary custodian title, shared decision making and to have Baby 5/7 days while the Mother would get her during the weekends. Is this possible, considering the circumstances? We have screenshots of everything I mentioned, texts she's sent him, etc. He just doesn't want to waste the $4000 retainer for a lawyer if this is going to be a waste of time or if there's not enough here, if his sex offender status would not allow for it, etc.   The mother likely can't afford a lawyer. Don't know if she would be representing herself or what, but probably.   Thanks."	Yes
76	So my ex wife and I were married in England and moved to Canada. We separated and a year or so later, she moved back to the U.K. with our two sons. She then legally divorced me from the UK and three years later sought to obtain a divorce agreement here in Canada. The resulting Court Order addressed support payments for our children (whilst they are children of the marriage). Since then our eldest son has started University in England, age 20, away from his home, on a three year Bachelors program. I was not consulted on this and simply expected to pay 75% of the fees (approx $15,000 a year) as well as 75% of residence costs (he now rents a home with other student, and I am expected to pay 75% of this. My ex wife also wants me to still pay her support payments in line with guideline table amounts, so that she could contribute her 25% in compliance with the court order that we currently have.  I didn't believe that this was correct, and am about to sit in a DRO meeting in an attempt to mediate a solution to facilitate a revised Order, failing which we will unfortunately end up in a full court hearing. (The DRO meeting will take place in Canada, with my ex wife dialing in).  I find it hard to comprehend how decisions can be made, without conferring with me but I'm expected to pay, pay and pay.  My son is working part time (his schooling takes about 12 hours a week) and he does not currently contribute to his tuition fees or his housing.  Me ex wife lives with her partner (in U.K.), she has recently had a third child with him, works for his businesses and is claiming that she earns very little. She does not pay for the home she currently lives in, so the argument for support to maintain a home for our son, should he choose to come visit in the holidays is, in my opinion, moot.  To add insult to injury, she has destroyed my relationship with my sons by using lies and destructive 'propaganda'. I used to see my sons often and text daily, and now they refuse to speak with me.  I have never shied away from my financial responsibilities to my children and never would,  but at 44 years of age, I need to be able to properly plan for my future, provide for my new family, and repair my relationship with my sons.  I am seeking any advice on the pertinent issues related to paying for education for an adult child, who lives abroad, we were divorced abroad and the rules for support are ordered here in Canada (in the U.K., support stops at 18, no matter the schooling being undertaken). Also in respect of her working for her partner and not showing true earnings, in order to reinforce her argument that I pay a larger portion of the education costs. Final note, I believe she has not paid her 25% of the first years tuition, and simply had my son take a student loan to top up the 75% that I have paid.  Sorry this is convoluted, I'm typing on my phone. Any further factual information required to provide advice, please let me know. I love my kids dearly and the ongoing dispute and the resulting damage it has had on my relationship is incredibly hurtful and is affecting my current relationship due to the stresses involved. Any advice is truly appreciated.  Thank you!	Yes
77	"My fiance and I have been together for 4 years.  My daughter and I lived with him here in AZ for about a year before he had to move home to IA to take care of his sick dad. Since being there, he has inherited the family farm from his grandparents since no one is able to take care/run it.     In the meantime, I have been here with my daughter.  She is now 8 years old.  My fiance moved about two years ago, and yes I have procrastinated a bit on trying to move but it was only because I have been scared to confront my daughters father about moving.  We split up about 5 years ago but he has an anger problem.  Considering that I have triggers of people being angry and yelling at me, is why I haven't confronted him until recently.  I did mention the fact of moving last year which he seemed to be more willing to try if I went without her first and then after settling down, she would then come out there.  At first I thought it would be a good idea, but then I realized I felt like it was a manipulation tactic so I put it on hold.  I also wanted to wait until I had a job lined up so that way if it does go to court, I had something to argue for.  Earlier this year, I was offered a job about 20 minutes from where my fiance lives.  An amazing opportunity and one that I couldn't possibly turn down. . About a month ago, I confronted him that I was wanting to move and that my daughter is in fact wanting to come with me.  Now I know she is not at the age to where her voice and opinion matters, but she has stated many times that she does in fact want to move with me if I go.  Her father of course the first day was not happy.  About 3 days later, he seemed more open to it, especially after explaining what the job opportunity was.  4 days after that, we got into an argument because he doesn't understand why I want to be with my fiance and not him.  Then it turned into a fight of how I apparently have done nothing but cause him so much pain and suffering the past 5 years that it has made him live such a terrible life.  This is what hurts me.  The fact that he said this, I feel now is just another manipulation tactic.  I have done nothing but give him what he wants.  He wants more time with her? I give it to him.  He needs me to pick her up because he unexpectedly has plans?  I pick her up.  I pay for all the childcare, school things such as pictures, clothes, lunches... I pay for all of that.  He very rarely offers to pay for anything and even that usually doesn't go through.  He's supposed to pick her up from school every day and bring her home after dinner... half the time that doesn't even happen.  He doesn't even have a proper bed for her at his house.  Found out he didn't even have toothpaste for her.  All he has done the past 5 years is continue to make me feel guilty for his misery because I don't love him back and in result, I've given him anything he wants.  I started saying no more.  At the end of this argument, he gave me back a note that I handwrote him when I was 17.  That was almost 10 years ago!  Every time I try to move on with my life and live my life, he comes back with all of this, continues to make me feel bad so that way he can get what he wants.  He stated that he really doesn't care if my daughter goes.  I left the conversation feeling like I finally would get what I deserved and that he would let me go.  I was wrong.  Not even 2 days later, I get served with papers that he's wanting custody and for ME to pay HIM child support! Oh and he also stated in the papers that to the best of his knowledge, there is no job and that there is no other reason for me to move other than ""I just simply want to"" and that I'm not caring about the ""best interest of the child.""  This hurt more than anything.  I have not once asked him for child support.  The fact that he's going on paper to basically say that I've been lying to my own child and that I don't care about her is appalling.  The FACT that the papers were signed the DAY BEFORE we had that last talk, I feel was once again another manipulation tactic.  He had that conversation with me about me not loving him and blah blah blah already knowing he already signed papers. Including the fact that he even told me he really doesn't care if she goes.  He's made this a ""If I can't have you, no one can"" situation and it's not fair.  So now I have to go to court.  I don't have a lawyer at the moment for relocation because I don't have any money.  I did go and file my response the next day at the court house granting ""Joint Legal Decision Making"" as well as child support, but stated that I wanted her primary residence to be with me considering that that is how it's been her whole life.  I have also stated that I am willing to go to a mediator.  I also completed my Parenting Class Certification which the court has.  Now my issue is, I have not heard anything back.  It's been past 20 days since I filed my response and there has been no update online.  It says there was an ""Affidavit of Service"" filed on July 6th with a docket date of July 10th but I'm not exactly sure what that means considering I've gotten nothing.   So my question is, what is my next step?  How can I find out what's going on?  Also, if I make a list about the relocation and why it IS in the best interest for her to go and why it's not a good idea for her to stay with her father, would that help?  I want to get all my eggs in a basket before I go to file a petition to move.  I just want to know if there's any advice or tips on relocation.  TL;DR: My ex filed papers for custody, child support and opposing my relocation.  I filed a response the next day and it's past 20 days since then and I haven't heard anything.  How do I go about finding out what's going on and what are some tips on how to get a successful relocation?"	Yes
78	Hi, I have a software company that actually doesn't have any money in it, besides a couple of hundred dollars in bank, and I'm going through divorce. (it's an LLC, solo to my name)  My soon to be ex is fine with me having all rights, etc. on the company, but how would that be legally phrased?  I have a lawyer, and he will put in something, but if there's some specific Intellectual-Property advice I can get, then we could put that statement in.  Or maybe a generic statement of me getting entire business is enough?  There's some code there, i don't think it's of value, i just don't want there to be a battle over the business later, if I continue the business and actually make a profit in the future.	Yes
79	Hello everyone, first and foremost thank you for taking the time to read my post, it means a tremendous amount to me. Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I am a 16 year old male living in California, in a household with my mother, stepfather, and younger brothers. I will be a senior this upcoming year in high school.  I have been living with my mother my entire life, parents split when I was younger (not married), and my stepfather moved in a year after.  I have suffered from mental abuse from my stepfather ever since he has moved in, around 10 years ago. It has involved constant bullying, intimidation, aggressive behavior, and abrasive yelling. He is much bigger than I am, and uses this to get up in my face and shout profanity at the slightest mistake or misspoken word. My mother is aware of what has been going on, but does not know of the impact his behavior has had on my life. There have been many attempts with counselors and family members to correct his action, but nothing has changed.  As a result, I suffer from heavy and frequent anxiety, stress, and panic attacks. It is difficult for me to participate in any amount of light arguing with anyone without choking up, tearing up, or cowering away in fear (it takes a lot for me to say that). Any type of confrontation or chance of there being one makes me extremely nervous and panicky. Yelling of any kind also raises my anxiety, which (almost) always ends with me crying. There are other examples of the impact of this abuse. This has affected my relationships in a variety of ways with my family members, friends, and peers, and hinders my day to day life.  When I leave my home for school, a friend's house, etc., I feel much better mentally. But when I return and see my stepfather, everything comes back in a wave. This has created a very unhealthy lifestyle for me.  I have a solid relationship with my father, but he lives across the country. He knows very little of what has occurred.  If you read this far, thank you, and here are my questions:  1. What are my rights living in California at 16 to choose where to live? Am I able to live with other family members at my own consent? It is my final year of high school, so moving into my father's house across the country is a last resort, although it is an available option.  2. Who are people I should get involved to help me? I have many loving family members and friends, but I don't want to drag everyone into a nasty battle.   3. What are my best options/decisions I have or could make to remove myself from my situation?  If there are any questions I could answer to improve your response, feel free to ask. Once again, thank you for reading.	Yes
80	"curious about a situation a friend of mine is in. She is legally married, although trying to get a divorce from her child's father. They live in separate states and are in no way ""together"" anymore. He barely gives her any money for the baby and she is going to put him on child support. She recently found out that her ""husband"" got another woman pregnant and her sister has contacted my friend. She told her that he will not give her the money for an abortion and they are trying to get my friend to give her money for it. Threatening that if she ends up having the baby that she will put both of them on child support since they are still legally married. I've never heard of such a thing, is this something that can actually happen or is she full of shit?"	Yes
81	My 27 y/o brother was in a car accident last Thursday. It's pretty serious. He has some fractures, broken bones, and a severe head trauma that has caused him to fall into a coma. He is currently in stable but serious condition in a neuro ICU room.  My family and I have been left in shambles because of my brother's accident. We are trying to collect all of his things to store away since we know he's going to be in recovery for a long while.   My brother is 27, unmarried, and living with room mates. According to the police station and tow company, the vehicle cannot be released nor the items removed by anyone but my brother or his power of attorney. The storage rental place said the same thing as well.    my brother did not have a living will or other documents pertaining to if he were to be unable to make his own decisions. We can't access any of his personal belongings to get necessary items like his keys and glasses. We aren't allowed the code to access his unit despite my brother having the same last name as my brother.   Is there ANYTHING we can do to be able to access my brother's belongings, there are several very important and sentimental items that will be lost forever or stolen if we don't get access and some of that means a lot to my brother and I.   If it helps, my mom, my father, and I all signed at least one medical document since the accident. My father is handling the insurance and health insurance portion, my mom is going back home to Florida because she still has a job and needs to keep it so it leaves my dad and I as the remaining two who can take responsibility but I'm fully ready to let my dad handle the legal aspect of my brother's recovery.	Yes
82	Location: Alabama  My ex just served me with court papers saying I owe her $15k in back child support. I got hurt on the job several years ago and she knows I can't pay. She's just upset that I am filing for full custody and so now she's trying to get back at me. I just got a part time job a couple of months ago but didn't work for years trying to get disability.   Can the judge make me pay or send me to jail when I haven't even been working all this time? The child support was set when I had a job but that was in 2010. What happens if I can't pay?	Yes
83	Using a cell phone for privacy reasons so please have patience with the formatting. This is a multiple part situation and I will answer any and all questions to provide more detail and get better advice.  My girlfriend and I have been together 5+ years now. In that time we have purchased a home and had a child together. We have had several unsuccessful pregnancies and I have no desire to get married and it seems everything has taken a toll and we are on the verge of splitting. The marriage part was a well known fact. Before we became a couple I knew marriage wasn't something I wanted and was very vocal about that. Seems like this amongst other parts of our relationship were ideas she basically ignored figuring I would change my mind eventually.   Here were are with a two year old and a mortgage and things are unraveling. Her behavior has become erratic, hiding things, lying about situations, in general I can barely have a conversation with her without her screaming and storming off. I've told her several times if she isn't happy we should consider going our separate ways so our child doesn't have to grow up seeing us fight. This is why I am here. I already know what's going to happen. If I decide to start the process she will go off the deep end. Times when she has had too much to drink she has threatened to take our child from me. I know deep down that if I take the first step she is going to come after everything, our child, the house, everything we own just out of spite.   I am losing my mind, I can't function thinking about what's going to happen. We might have a few good days so I relax a little and then out of nowhere she blows up and I am worried she's going to show up with the cops and try to force me out of the house. Everything I own is here, everything in my life is here, no family and no where else to go. I started my own family and now I am waiting for it to be taken away from me.   What rights to do I have with our child if she packs them up and goes to her family's house? What rights to I have if she tries to kick me out of the house/accuses me of something so the police assume I am a danger (yes, a real thought of mine)? What rights do I have in Massachusetts that will make sure I get to see our child an equal amount of time when the dust settles.   Again I apologize for the format and rant. I didn't know where to begin, what not to say or how to finish. All I know is everything I have in my life could be gone and I have to know what my rights are so I can fight for them.   Thank you for your time...	Yes
84	My friend's parents are finally getting a divorce. The wife has been abusive of her husband/her kids for a long time, and the husband is finally going to file. However, my friend just told me that they're going to be settling in court since the wife refuses to agree to terms.   Most importantly, she wants her soon to be ex-husband to keep paying her money so she can continue to live in her house (the husband will move out once the divorce is final). My friend is concerned that she'll get the money because she'll claim that she was abused by her husband. My question is, is she legally allowed to do this, considering her children are over 18? (My friend still lives with her mother.) Regardless of the legality, is the judge likely to award her money? I want to reassure my friend/offer her courses of action she can take, but I have practically no knowledge of law.	Yes
85	"I have sole physical and custodial custody of my children in California. My ex-husband lives in Wisconsin and has supervised visitation rights only. I want to move with the children to Oregon. I've verbally told my ex-husband of our plans, and he has no objections to this. Our current parenting/visitation plans will all remain the same.   Since this seems very simple, I don't think it should require an attorney and seems like it should just be a form I submit to the court, or maybe a form or official notification I submit to my ex-husband. I've tried to Google for some kind of ""intent to move"" or ""address change"" form from the state of California, but can't find anything like that. Maybe I just write my own letter?   What do I need to do to for this move? Thanks!"	Yes
86	Greetings!  I reside in the state of Illinois, and I'm wondering if getting married in Mexico will automatically hold a legal authority in the US? I cannot find any info about this online (though I'm bad at research). Do countries instantly exchange marital information about a citizen/resident? Or will it only hold its legal value and thus show up on my american record if I notarize and apostille the certificate in the US.  Big thank you in advance.	Yes
87	My husband and I are getting a dissolution.  He has a lawyer and I don't.  We have two kids.  His will stay in the house and maintain primary residence.  I will get he kids 2 Monday and Thursday 5-8 and every other weekend.  My question is about child support payments.  The dissolution paperwork stipulates that I will be obligated to pay $645.94 and half of the daycare ($1300) costs plus half of any extracurricular fees and medical fees not covered by his insurance.  Just the child support and daycare would be just shy of almost half of my monthly income.  My ex makes roughly $20,000 more a year than me.  Is this typical in terms of payment or is he trying to screw me?	Yes
88	Hey everyone. I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'm not sure how to proceed. My mother is seriously mentally ill and has been refusing treatment for as long as I can remember. I beg her to get help because at this point she's extremely paranoid, terrified of touching things (germ situation), repeats herself 100x times, and has pulled out all her hair, and sadly, there's even more :( I've tried pretty much everything, but she's ALWAYS been this way. It even had a huge effect on my upbringing and due to that I have CPTSD. She once tried to burn me alive as an infant, and would regularly slam my head into concrete and the tub for things as simple as knocking over my juicebox. I'm afraid that at the rate she's going, she's just going to crash and burn... hard. I have a 16 year old sister too, and I fear that if my mom really gets out of hand, we'll be evicted. She honestly screams 24/7 so I'm not even sure how we haven't gotten kicked out. Due to my cptsd and a slew of other conditions, I'm disabled and can only work a job from home, but that's not enough for me to move my sister and myself out... I was wondering if there was any way the section 8 could be transferred to me or my sister, as my mother isn't stable or responsible enough for this kind of thing and always submits their paperwork MONTHS late. It's like she's trying to go out of her way to get us kicked out. Anyway, I'd like to keep my little sister safe, more importantly. Is there any way we could protect ourselves and our housing as my mother continues to self destruct ??  Thank you, and sorry for the essay... It's just been a LOT :/	Yes
89	So my friends sister is married to a marine. They have been married for nine months. Yesterday he served her divorce papers but would not let her see the papers. He now is telling her today that if she doesn't sign by 5am tomorrow then he is going to go to the court and say she is refusing to sign them. With a quick Google search it looks like she has 30 days before he can do anything. But he is refusing to let her even see the papers so she can't sign even if she wanted to. What's her best course of action? Thanks!	Yes

91	My aunt has sole custody of the kids, the court allows my uncle to speak to the kids when he wants to and vice versa. However he never calls the kids and instead harasses my aunt who put a restraining order against home because he's crazy and abusive.   My uncle is extremely authoritarian and tries to restrict everything he can, currently in divorce with my aunt; he does not allow the kids to speak to my aunt when it's his days or weekends.  He disables their internet on their iPads and blocks all her calls/texts so she never has an idea whether or not the kids are safe. She fears one day the kids may get kidnapped from him and she won't be able to get a hold of them...  I'm concerned for their safety to and am curious, if I buy my cousin a phone and pay for his services per month to be able to keep in touch when needed; is my uncle allowed to confiscate it or place restrictions?   Any help is truly appreciated, thank you!	Yes
92	we live together, have another child and i make a very good living, stable household. Her aunt is currently keeping her son in another state and naturally has grown attached to him, all signs and conversation sound like they want to keep her child. What legal actions should we take and what rights or actions can they take so we can be prepared when we go to court next month?	Yes
93	Tim and Barbara have a marriage ceremony in 2007 in South Carolina, and fill out the applications for a marriage license (one for the judge, one for govt agency, and one for their own records), but do not file them because they want to continue receiving social security benefits from Tim's first wife who passed away. Instead, they opt to store those filled out by unsubmitted documents in a box in their closet.  The two live together, but do not file taxes together, do not share bills for many years, and have almost entirely separate finances.  Tim has recently passed away. Would they be considered married by common law in South Carolina, or would their not filing a marriage license application and continued receipt of social security for Tim's previous wife be sufficient evidence that they did not intend to marry? If so, how would this be presented to the court that makes this determination?  I apologize if my understanding of common law marriage is lacking, I'm still researching the subject and don't have any legal knowledge outside of what I've picked up on Reddit and a few other sources. Thank you for your time!	Yes
94	"I've been searching google for the answer and am having difficulty finding the answer.  I only found one website that directly addresses this but don't know if it's accurate:  ""The parties’ property settlement agreement, while completely enforceable as a contract, is not filed with the court."" http://www.divorceforgrownups.net/karins-blog/2011/9/13/keeping-your-divorce-information-private  I'm trying to help my mom by getting her divorce property settlement, but I don't know if it was filed with the court.  My mom's divorce took place about 13 years ago.  I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question so I don't waste an entire day going down to the family law courthouse which is far from my home and finding out that the divorce property settlement is not there."	Yes
95	"We used to bank with Ally, we are 0 contact though I have attempted to reach out to her and her parents to have this issue addressed. Ally will not remove co-owners. They will not close the account if there are pending debits on the account. So, if she continues to use it there are very few opportunities where I am able to request a closure.   Yesterday I locked the debit, which she is able to remove, and had a day without pending debits. I learned the Account cannot be closed by me unless I have them send the money to my address on file or by ACH. I do not want to ""steal"" her money, even though it may be mine legally and Ally was more then happy to send it to me.   I want to close this account because in the prior 6 months she had a period where she frequently overdrafted, making me realize that she still could effect me financially. On one such overdraft letter the bank had issued a second request for payment of the overdraft prior to reporting the issue to the Chex System. She appears to be better now, but I just want all ties to be eliminated.   Getting a divorce was easier then closing this Ally account. Not really sure how to proceed."	Yes
96	I'm in montgomery county pennsylvania i filed for divorce in january since then she's filed 2 false pfas against me shes been taking 500 dollars a month from my disability on top of the 1000 a month i give her for child support. This morning i woke up to a knock on the door it was the county sherriff serving me with a PFA saying that i held a gun to her head back in February. They took my gun and i have a court date next thursday what can i do to prove everything is false.	Yes
97	Hello, my name is logan I am fifteen and about to turn 16 in two months and I have a very important question. Me and my mother have been constantly fighting for three years she has put me through abusive relationships with boyfriends, took my money, did drugs and slept for a whole two weeks while I got raped while i was walking to gas station and much more that has ruined my life due to her immaturity. She lost her job for pepper spraying me and she blames me for ruining her life all the time. I suffer each day and I just want to be free at this point. I am about to get a job at wall mart and I get a social security check each month (haven't seen a dollar of it since I was born). My plea to the judge will be that I want to be Emancipated so that I may be released from my pain of having to live with this monster and start my life. She has not had a job in 8 months and isnt getting one and just lives off my social security. I also have a sister who is 31 and is willing to give me a place to live till i can get enough money to go on my own. Yes I know this sounds like every teenage plea that their parents are horrible and that they are mature but this is different. I have attempted suicide many times and my childhood is basically over and I dont really see a point to go on at all but either way I just want to get out. Do you think I will be accepted for Emancipation in your opinion or not I just want some sort of reassurance. Thank you for the read and im willing to answer any questions.	Yes
98	Hi there. Quick question please; I am supposed to have my son every second Sunday as per a court order which was agreed to in mediation. Last week Sunday my visit was cancelled despite the court order saying it was non negotiable and the reason why it was cancelled is because apparently my son was sick although he was fine the previous evening when I saw him and they would not show him to us to verify that he is indeed sick. Also they did not take him to the doctor and I stay less than twenty metres from his place so there was no real reason that they needed to cancel the visit. I went to the police station to report them and the police were unable to do anything. The court order is brand new and I'm already being pushed around like this. Now the social workers have told me to forfeit this week's visitation as well because they worry that the conflict is harmful to my child however what they fail to acknowledge is that there would not be any conflict if the other party simply followed what they agreed to. Is there any justice for people who breach court orders and go against agreements? I do not understand why I must now make a second agreement if they wouldn't even follow the first. I stay in the same apartment complex as him and they still never let me see him and it's grossly unfair. Also they drive around with him in the car without a car seat. I am extremely discouraged by the judicial system!!!	Yes
99	throwaway time. I am above 18 years old. She's already got the paperwork started. My mom and my Dr. are guilting me into going to a 2 moth program (which I really don't want to go to) because they don't believe I can take care of myself (I can). Is there anything I can do if she actually goes through with getting me a legal guardian?	Yes
100	"TL;DR: If I offer my ex $8,000 to sign a financial settlement to give me $20,000, is this extortion? Can ex later argue she was coerced? Can my attorney ethically discuss with me how to present it so it's legal?  I have a petition for rule pending to enforce financial aspects of my divorce decree, namely contribution to kids' expenses and a retirement account payout. Over 12 years for 3 kids I've paid about $73,500 in documented expenses with zero reimbursement from ex.   The retirement issue was resolved by agreement a few months ago, but the other expenses drag on.  The decree says 50/50 but ex argues that this was based on our salaries being equal at the time. For 9 of the last 12 years, she's been out of work and says I should pay 100%. She never asked to change nor disputed the 50/50 until I filed the petition. I've been giving her receipts all these years and she kept saying ""I'll pay when I go back to work next year or the year after"". I have some sympathy for her as the kiddo she has with her new husband had some significant medical issues for a few years and she chose to stay home with her.   She has just returned to working full time and I took this action to force her to share the financial burden of college, which is frankly overwhelming me.   She's in a rough financial situation right now with significant damage to her home from a recent storm. Insurance is not covering it and she's clearly desperate for cash because she asked me for a loan of $8,000 this morning.   I'm not unreasonable and she's been a pretty good mother. I am tired of legal expenses and now that I've gotten the promised retirement money, I'd be willing to settle for $15-20k of the $36k and her paying the remaining college costs. I've already taken parent loans for 4 years for one kid and 2 years each for the other two. She can either pay or take out loans for the next two years for the two youngest.   Can I propose giving her the $8k in exchange for her signing an agreement to this effect? I'd want her to sign it before I give her the money and giving her the money would contingent on her signing.   I have an attorney, but am not clear if my attorney can ethically discuss how to present this offer in a legal way."	Yes
101	"My state appointed lawyer is trying to get the neglect charge dropped however, the lawyer informed me it's unlikely they will drop the charge. If the state refuses to drop the neglect charge, what happens when I refuse to admit to the neglect? Family law doesn't require the state to provide actual evidence in any charges therefore, the neglect charge is based on hearsay. My child was never neglected in anyway, shape or form and I refuse to let them put neglect on my record without fighting for myself. My state appointed lawyer told me its ""not a big deal"" however, I disagree. A neglect charge can impact a hypothetical custody battle and my career. I have worked with children for the past several years until a few months before this happened but I intended on returning to that field of work. A neglect charge will go on my CANTS report and will disqualify me for any position in that field. A family member was angry with me and decided to call dcyf with crazy allegations on drug use etc. When they came to investigate I admitted to being prescribed suboxone when asked what medications I regularly take. I have been prescribed this medication for nearly 8 years. My daughter is under 8 years old.  I was honest bc I didn't have anything to hide after all, it's a legal medication prescribed to me by a doctor. I've been clean since being prescribed nearly 8 years ago. However, the state used this against me. I've been doing everything they tell me to do including random drug testing which are all clean. My question is, once I tell the state I'm not admitting to the charge, what happens and how do I go about it?"	Yes
102	Background: My soon to be ex and I are in the process of a divorce. We have a toddler. I have a lawyer, but they won't be able to talk until later and I'm freaking out a bit.   Current agreement: I have primary custody, my ex has visits twice a week for two hours, and an overnight on the weekend. He doesn't actually take the overnight on the weekend, instead he just sees him twice in the weekend. His is because he doesn't feel ready for an overnight yet, but he  wanted the option on paper. We also have a first right of refusal clause. So if either of us are gone for more than three hours, we have to offer the other person the child. This arrangement was working great! We don't get along at all, but baby was happy and visits were going okay. Baby is watched by grandma while we're both at work. We finished the custody portion of the divorce, but not the child support. We mutually agreed upon an amount he would give me, not much, but something to put away for baby. I didn't WANT child support, but my lawyer suggested that it's good to get since I make less and I could save it for baby's college fund or something.    Issue: My ex was fired for inappropriate behavior at work, and hasn't been able to get a job since. This wasn't an issue since I was on vacation anyways. Well, I went back to work this week and now my ex wants the baby everyday I'm at work, plus his scheduled visits.   This would be fine with me if my ex was a normal person. Usually, I'd say that a child should be with their parent because it's important for them to bond with dad as much as they bond with mom. I'm all for father's rights. However... my ex is crazy. He hit me while we were married, he's tried to have me fired, he's really unstable (I would go into more detail, but I don't want to be too specific and have him find this post). Don't get me wrong, I WANT baby to have a relationship with him! However, I want the majority of baby's life to be stable with just a sprinkle of crazy from his father. I don't want half of his life to be insane instability, alcoholism, emotional abuse, etc.   So, my ex has now formulated his master plan. He will have baby when I'm at work, thus establishing more custody, since his income is now below mine, I will pay him child support...   What on earth can I do? I feel like I'm at a complete loss. Our agreement dictates that I MUST offer him baby while I'm at work.... How is it fair for him to just sit at home and not work and not support baby?...	Yes
103	Hello all, I have a couple of questions about divorce and I was hoping I coud get a couple clarifications about them.   I would like to divorce my wife, she's been toxic and I haven't been as much as happy since I left. We live in different states, She's in Texas, where we used to reside together until I moved to DC for work. The house we lived in is under my name, I paid for it and she still live there with my daughter. All furnitures are mine, they are family antiques that were shipped from France and most things in the house belong to me. When we got married, we signed a Pre-nuptia, in France ( We did it a a notary, in the presence of an interpret etc). I don't wish nothing bad to my wife and want to help her and my daughter as much as possible but I feel that she might try to take advantage and keep some things she is not supposed too. She made copies of documents about money that I have in France to show a judge to try and get more child support (that's what she told me).   My questions are as follow: where should I file for divorce? Texas or DC? Will the prenuptia work in the US (wife said no, but she is obviously biased and not a lawyer so Im not sure).   I've been sending some money to her here and there, to pay the bills of the house and help with my daughter (wife goes to school and refuse to work so always need money) should I keep sending money or should I just wait until a set amount is decided by a judge?   If she were to destroy or sell some of my antiques as revenge, do I have any recourse?	Yes
104	"My grandma owns her home and has lived there for 25 years.  she was admitted to the hospital 1 week ago because she had a minor stroke. She recovered completely in the hospital and was told she could go home monday (today the 17th). However before leaving she was given a psyche evaluation, that said she had 'minor dementia' even at 96 she is alert, can understand, and can speak for herself, we've never had any problems getting her to understand something or to tell us what she wants, except she is hard of hearing and can't see very well. She is quick and sharp as a tack though.  When her daughter heard this who has the power of attorney pushed to have her taken out of her home and put into a care center. When i walked into the hospital today to pick up my grandma she was crying because she wanted to go home and they wont let her, because the power of attorney daughter insists she goes to an ""Assisted Living Center"" I've been living with my grandma for years taking care of her and she can say for herself ""I want to go home and i want my grandson to take care of me"" but even though she can say that and understand she is being taken away, and the daughter's true goal of selling her house is in reach.  Is there anything i can do to help protect my grandma's interests and what's best for her? even though her daughter has power of attorney? Do i need to get another doctor to test her to see if she can make decisions for herself? She is stubborn but very kinda, and is adamant about what she wants and her daughter the POA is ignoring it completely. and my grandma even said she regrets making her the POA and would make me it instead if she could."	Yes
105	I left my ex may of 2013. I ended up walking out of his house with 3 kids, pillows and blankets under my arm and a backpack full of clothes for all four of us. I stayed with my sister for a month. Found an apartment, started fresh after 11 years with the guy. Went to court a couple of months after I left. Judge said equal custody, 1 week on 1 week off. Did that for 2 1/2 yrs. Met my current husband. Married April 2015. More problems with ex. He got arrested for child endangerment, drugs, and battery. Went to jail for 9 months.  I got a lawyer have had him now for 3 1/2 yrs now and haven't stepped into a court room. Did mediation before he went to jail, came up with an agreement 1/2 custody. He got arrested, lawyer revoked the mediation agreement. Filed a petion on full custody. Ex got out of jail filed counter petion. I have court on the 15th order to show cause. My lawyer said we need to do another mediation before going to court. My lawyer also said we are back to square one with 1/2 custody. I am willing to share time with him every other weekend. Other than that the kids stay with me and my husband.  Dcfs has been called 3 times on him for different incidents.  They open then close. Why I am writing this is... how long does it usually take to get into a courtroom and get something like this resolved? What are my rights as a mother and where do legally stand? Do I have to let the kids go with him even though dcfs has been involved and currently there is a open case. Do I have to do mediation again? Any advice helps. Thank you.	Yes
106	This is a throwaway account to protect our identities as much as possible but this does take place in the state of California. So a few months ago, my twin sister was raped after our high school graduation party. She's not in a good state of mind right now and is extremely angry at me because I was actually their target. I don't blame her in the slightest because the group of boys said my name a few times during the ordeal.  My grandparents and parents are both extremely traditional people. They hold strong to their traditional Asian values of practically blind worship to the senior generation. My grandparents were extremely against the idea of abortion while my parents were on the fence but leaning towards my grandparents because of that respect towards the elder generation. Eventually, my grandfather found out that I was coordinating with my sister's best friend on how to get my sister to an abortion clinic. That night my grandfather kidnapped my sister and they were missing for almost a month before the police found them. My grandfather was trying to fly her to China.  During that month, we discovered the identities of the rapists and we also have the semen samples from the rape kit as further evidence. I got in a rather heated exchange with several of the perpetrators but now I'm being threatened with both my and my sister's integrity. They realize that we can easily ruin their lives forever and send them to jail which is why they are threatening to release a video of the entire rape to the student body of the university that we will be attending after the summer. The group of boys dragged me into a room and molested me while forcing me to watch the video. I was forced to give one of them oral sex in order to keep them quiet about the video. I tried to keep a semen sample but they took it away. They didn't penetrate me and my hymen is still intact so I don't have any evidence to prove this happened the way that it did. They did video me doing everything and I was forced to say it was consensual. I'm sad I had to do this but I want to help my sister however much I can even if it's just to shut this group of boys up so that event isn't revealed.  The entire incident has been kept very quiet because my parents insist that our momentary desire for vengeance is much less important than the stigma such an incident will cause if it becomes public. My sister hasn't said a single word and I'm very worried about her. She isn't mentally stable right now and while so far not suicidal, I am very worried. My grandfather has since returned but now after realizing that there is a high possibility of the father being black, he is insisting that she abort the baby. We just got back from the abortion clinic a few hours ago but they are refusing to help because my sister won't reply to anything that they say and that she isn't mentally sound.  I don't know what to do and don't know who to talk to. My family wants to keep everything quiet. My sister has not said a single thing. She did yell at me for a few minutes but quickly stopped talking. It's been over a month since I last heard her voice. I don't know what to do! I should be an adult right? I'm already 18 but I don't feel like an adult. This whole thing feels like a guillotine hanging over our necks.  How can I report those boys to the police without everything becoming public? They already said that if we take them down then they will take us down with them. One of them said he will help me if I have sex with him but I don't want to.  What should I do about my family? Right now they are against everything that I think should be done and my sister has not replied to anything that we ask.  I'm so angry! My grandfather kidnapped my sister causing everything to be delayed so long and now he has completely changed his point of view. First he was trying everything to prevent the abortion and now he is trying everything to force her into it. He even threatened me while holding a coat hanger because I pushed him away when he was trying to enter my sister's room. I also can't stop crying every time I hear my mom and dad regret having daughters.  The reason I'm posting here is because I was hoping a lawyer could give me advice on what to do. I feel really alone right now. The group of rapists is threatening me from the front while my family isn't doing anything to help from the back. My sister is completely silent and I'm worried about her committing suicide even though she hasn't shown any intent to.  Am I even in the right place? Can a lawyer even help me? I want to sue my family and get protective custody of my sister but can I even do this? My sister hasn't said a single word and has no response to anything that anyone asks. All she does is sit there. The only person who knows other than the related parties is my sister's best friend. Not even my best friend knows.  Please help me. I don't care if my video goes public. I only want to prevent my sister's video from becoming public. The problem is that we are identical twins so either video becoming public would be bad for my sister. I tried fighting back against the group of boys but they responded by posting a short clip of my sister's video to this website and everybody on that website is showing crazy enthusiasm for it. I tried to use that to my advantage but nobody on that website has an account only a bunch of numbers where their name should be. I've bookmarked the link to that website but I don't even want to look at it anymore because I cry every time I read the replies.  I don't even know if I can ask a lawyer to help me. My family obviously won't pay for it and I only have a few thousand dollars.I read online that there are lawyers who might do this for free but how do I find them?	Yes
107	My partner, lets call him John, and a child 9 years ago when he was a teenager but the mom and her family chose to exclude him from the pregnancy and did not include him in the birth. She tried filing false restraining order charges that were dropped once her allegations proved to be false. She did not want John in this child's life. At the time, he was a punk kid and not exactly the worlds best role model. However he has cleaned up his act, he went to school and got a degree, he has three beautiful daughters, and he just started up his own business. We don't have a lot of money since most, if not all, of our money is going towards helping the business grow but the older this child gets the more depressed John gets. He hates not being a part of his life and he truly is an amazing father. How do we go about even starting this? He has tried reaching out to the mom in the past about meeting him and she blocked him on all avenues so we don't want to keep pestering her and rather have another way. We aren't looking to take him from the only parent he's ever had unless there's reason to? We simply want to meet and get to know our son.	Yes
108	Hello, I was wondering if someone on here could help point me in the right direction.    Back in March 2017 my 18 year old daughter contacted me and asked me to come pick her up and asked if she could live with us.  She had been out on her own since Jan 2016 when her and her mom got into a fight and her mom kicked her out.    I jumped on a plane immediately and flew to NC to pick her up.  After getting her settled in and enrolled and transfered in to the local High School I decided to contact the OAG to file a change of status and termination of CS.   The OAG mailed me the required forms and gave me instructions on how to prove her residency. Which I sumbitted per their request.    Now child support was due to terminate in June 2017 so there was merely 3 months of payments left from a 17 year history of the order. I did not want my ex to have anything she did not deserve especially once I learned my daughter had essentially been homeless since Jan 2016.   The AOG placed the moneys on hold while they verified the change.  Months went by.  Finally received a status update from the AOG on June 20th 2017.  However it was not was I was hoping for.  They informed me that with out the other parents signature stating she is giving me credit for those three months the AOG states they can not return the money to me.    The OAG claims it is their policy but refused to give me documentation stating the legal procedure claiming it is not public record.    It has been one month since they mailed my ex wife the documentation and she never responded.  I called the AOG and asked them what the next step was and they told me they do not have an answer for me.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor who ended up just contacting someone else who is going to send another letter to my ex wife inwhich will go straight to the trash.    So my question is what policy is the OAG following that stipulates they must have a response from the other party to determine status change?  They claimed it is not public record when I asked about such policy.  Also if I were to file a suit in court on what grounds would I file since the court order has already expired since my daughter is 18 and has now graduated?    A lawyer would cost too much in comparison to what the AOG is holding.   Any advice would be appreciative.	Yes
109	I am a foster parent and have been getting increasingly frustrated with the way DSS is handling my daughter's case. It has made it abundantly clear that there isn't enough oversight. They make decisions on behalf of the kids that have a great, and sometimes permanent, impact on them and there is no higher entity signing off to ensure that the decisions being made are in the best interest of the children (spoiler alert: in my kids case, they're not!)  I want to propose some kind of legislation making it necessary to get a judge or guardian ad litem or someone to sign off on these big decisions before they can be implemented. And they need to be able to provide a GOOD reason for something as extreme and permanent as separating siblings into separate pre-adoptive homes. IMO this kind of decision should be made by a judge the same way a judge is who decides whether or not they go home to mom and dad. That isn't something that 2 people from the county DSS should be able to decide on behalf of a child. There needs to be more oversight.   I am in the state of Virginia. How can I go about suggesting a change in our laws like this?	Yes
110	"I live in Southern California, moved back in with my parents about a year ago with my 2 kids.

111	NY state  To start, about a month ago I punched my then GF of 6 years in the jaw (hard, bad brusing and she took pics). The day before I was going to propose to her (day of incident), a man contacted me and told me I was basically living a lie. She had loved him, but stayed with me and pressured me for marriage for months (he had proof and she confessed after I showed proof). I had also loaned her a substantial amount of money that she now refuses to pay back (Over $10,000), had just bought her an engagement ring, she owes me $550 in tolls and $200 in traffic tickets, and that same day she had taken my car without permission and refused to return it until the evening. When she did finally return, I snapped. I am a military veteran and I can sometimes have a hard time with my anger. I have never hit her or any other person I was in a relationship with, but I was overwhelmed with grief, anger and disgust.  It wasn't right that I struck her despite it all. She wasn't right for the things she did, but I should have just walked away. Anyway, we broke up that same day. She decided not to press charges because she knew she really screwed me over. She went to the hospital but didn't come after me legally.  The past month she has begged for me to come back to her and I met with her. We had sex on two occasions, no violence, no issues, but I decided to move on. I should not have even done that, but I longed for the past.  So yesterday, the guy she was cheating on me with prior contacted me. He asked if I had sex with her two weeks ago. I said yes, twice. He wanted proof and I sent him the messages and a video. They are in a current relationship.  So now my ex wants revenge and is pursuing an order of protection or so she claims. She called my mother threatening me this morning. Should I be concerned or what steps can I take to protect myself. I would like to cease all contact with this girl.  Summation:  -I punched GF in jaw after I found out she cheated and other things (money also involved, large sum) -We break up and she doesn't press charges. -New BF she also cheated on me with found out that I had sex with her recently and approached her on it. -Now she is threatening an order of protection, I'm guessing using the prior strike to do so.  I just don't want anything to do with this girl. The money thing is another headache I'll have to deal with.	Yes
112	My mom is being pressured by family to sign a POA for her brother who suffers from dementia. He currently is assisted care in Florida. Would she be financially responsible and what are other issues she should know if she decides to sign? Should she seek out a lawyer before doing anything?	Yes
113	"My mom has chronic pain with arthritis, osteoporosis, and 3 herniated discs. 2 weeks ago my mom had a compound fracture and had to get rods and screws inside her leg. When my mom get another perscription from the hospital she asked my grandma to hold on to it and give it tp her when she needs, but as my title says she has been giving it to her when she only thinks she needs it. It says one every six hours and the doctor said to double up  while she is healing if she feels she needs to. Well my grandmother being the over controlling person she is has gone full dictator over her medicine and sometimes my mom will be crying in pain and she wont give it to her. Some days she would only give her two a day saying ""you dont need this medicine all the time"" acting like she doesnt even have a broken leg or all these chronic pain problems she did before. She will certainly not let her double up like the doctor ssid she could. So needless to say when my mom got her refill on saturday she was not going to let my grandmother have her perscription again because of her constant negligence. Well my grandma gave her an ultimatum. Either give her the medicine or she would have to find somewhere else to live which is completely ridiculous. My mom. Cant work and is basically bed ridden most days because on top of the chronic pain she for one has the broken leg and two she has addisons disease with all kinds of other problems which basically keeps her from work. So what can we do about this? She made a deal with her the first time i understand i figured that might play a roll but she definitley did not want her having this refill and considering its a schedule 2 drug i figured legally there is no way she would be able to keep this."	Yes
114	I'll try to stick to details and ask for specific advice, forgive me if this is a bit scattered. I am planning to leave my husband of 4 years due to overwhelming debt and lies regarding our finances. My credit has taken the bulk of the hit due to the fact that he had no credit cards and I signed the lease on our first apartment, I am about 60K in debt and have been trying to get documents together for bankruptcy. In doing so, I discovered lies and deception were more involved than I had thought and I need some advice on moving forward.  Filing bankruptcy in PA- I forget what the term is, but we are both liable for the debts accrued during the marriage in PA. Can I file for bankruptcy after the divorce is finalized? Would they come after me for his debts accrued during the marriage later? Child support, house- I'm not asking for abuse and name calling, just advice. He tells me he won't pay me child support or help me in any way and I will be homeless. How exactly do they decide what he pays and how? How can I support myself inbetween the filing and official divorce? Is a homeless shelter my best option? I really would like to stay with my kids in a home and not put them through that situation, and I'm worried of what it would look like to the courts if I took them out of a physically safe home to a shelter. -As another question, can he kick me out of the family home? His parents own the residence and we rent from them. He says I'm not on the lease and have no right to be here.  Do lawyers ever make payment agreements in these types of circumstances? I can't afford to even begin this process and I'm unsure where to start.  Can he use mental illness against me in the proceedings? I had PPD with my first child and had trouble bonding with her, but I have attended counseling and parenting classes since that time. He says I am unstable and he will get full custody if I leave.  I appreciate any advice and thank you for taking the time to read.	Yes
115	I share a home in New York State with my significant other of six years. We have lived in our home for almost four years. We are not married so my SO bought the house and everything is in his name (mortgage, insurance, taxes, deed, and so on). He and I came up with an agreed upon figure that I would contribute every month towards the mortgage and expenses. The mortgage is about $1,600 every month and I contribute $700.   Because I am contributing to our home I'm starting to feel as though I should legally own part of the house. My biggest fear is that if my SO, heaven forbid, dies that I will have no legal right to our home.   Where should we start? Would it be better for my SO to leave me the house in a will?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
116	So, I need to find a way to get my mom, siblings, dog, cat and me out of my home and away from my dad. We live in Michigan. I'm 20 years old. My sister is almost 18 and my brother just turned 15. My Dad is verbally abusive to my mom, constantly berating her and screaming about the smallest things. Occassionally his outbursts have been directed at me or my siblings, but mostly my mom. He loves to throw and break things. There have been several times where he has been physically violent towards my mom, hitting her or pushing her over. He pushed her down the stairs once. He has only been physically violent towards me once and never towards my siblings. Most of the time it doesn't escalate this far. He usually only gets really bad when he's had way too much to drink, but he's an alcoholic and drinks every day so...  Anyways, things have been pretty bad recently and my mom is done. She wants to leave, with or without my siblings and me. I'm pretty sure he will kill us if we try to leave though. He has threatened to kill my mom numerous times as well as threatening to kill us all and then himself. He has guns and once pulled one out during an argument, so I don't think they are just empty threats.  I'm just trying to figure out the best way to leave. We need to disappear. I'm tired of being constantly afraid. I have about $15,000 saved up, but my mom doesn't have much. We could make something work. I would obviously have to quit my job because he knows where I work and I wouldn't feel safe, plus we would have to move far away.  My biggest concern is that since my brother is only 15, my dad could fight for custody or if we just left, my mom could get in trouble. I don't know how any of this works, but my dad having any custody if this happens is not an option.  We have never filed a police report against my dad or anything like that, so there is nothing on record. He has no criminal background. During one argument, my mom did call the police (about three years ago), but it was so bad that we left the house before the police got there. They tried to call my mom, but she wouldn't answer her phone so nothing came of it.  Other things that could hopefully somehow help. My dad drives drunk a lot. He hasn't ever been caught though. He also used to smoke marijuana daily, but quit about a month ago. I'm not certain but I think there is still a plant in the backyard.  Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.	Yes
117	Shortly after high school I brought my girlfriend out of her abusive home to live with me 700 miles away. Flash forward a few years. She is paranoid, frightening, and downright abusive. We live in a small trailer renting it under the table from my grandparents friends. We are both in our early 20s  We fight a lot and it usually always leads to her trying to take the keys to my company truck I use for work and to hide my work clothes and phone. I need my phone for work because I am always taking calls. She will throw things grab my cloths and stretch at me. And in the past month I have been telling her I'm tired of it and want her out but she won't leave she doesn't work and has no friends that I know of in this town.  Here's where I saw it really turning in he past few weeks she has been getting mad for my lack of intimacy (although I tell her I don't want to be with her already) and she will try to force me out of the room and then grabs on me and I snapped  she was holding my shirt and as it started to rip I hit her arm hard and her hand hit the wall. She started crying and it swelled up some.  Normally I'm a very easy going person and I never get violent with anyone but I feel my rage against her raising and I just want her out now. I'm afraid she will try to attack me and I'll seriously hurt her. I've never felt his angry in my life before. I'm rambling.  How do I just end it. She has nowhere to go and practically no work experience as she has always refused to work. She doesn't even have a drivers license. Could I get a restraining order on her even though we have been living with each other for a few years?  I'm sorry this is a wall of text I can't think straight right now I'm angry and sad I'm sitting in my car because if I go inside it will start a whole new fight. I'll answer any questions to clear up any confusing thank you.  TLDR I'm brought my girlfriend to live with me 3 or 4 years later I want to end it she's abusive but won't leave and has nowhere else to go.	Yes
118	My dad is going through a divorce in Indiana. He inherited a 50% stake in his mothers house (in Ohio) when she died. His brother inherited the other 50%. I know that Inheritance can be considered marital property in Indiana divorce law, unlike most other states where inheritance is not included as marital property.   What factor does his brother owning 50% stake in the house have in the court calculation to split inherited property in divorce?  Thanks.	Yes
119	Hi Reddit - I'm asking on behalf of my mother, who's never used Reddit but would love your advice.   She divorced her ex-husband (my ex-step-father, XSF) in 2010. At the time, my younger brother was only 14 so they agreed to put off sorting out the financial settlement until Brother was 18 and going to university - he has issues which make him very unsettled with change and it was concluded it would be best for him to live with my mother in the family home, and then sell the home when he went to university. In the meantime, XSF paid child support, maintenance, his contribution to the mortgage etc.   Due to various different health circumstances, Brother didn't go to university until last year. In the meantime, my mother has got re-married and this has made XSF incredibly bitter. Her new husband does not live with her, they have no joint account and no financial commitment to each other. XFS is now refusing to co-operate with proceedings to divide their assets. My mother has proposed various different financial settlements (via her solicitor to his solicitor) which have either been ignored or rejected, with no counter-offer given. At one point he verbally agreed to her offer, said he would send the paperwork - and then a week later, rejected the offer and came back with a much lower one.   Around this time, my mother decided she would much rather just be rid of him altogether - XSF has become increasingly rude and aggressive via any form of communication. He refuses to respond to letters sent to his solicitor (claiming he didn't receive them although we have proof of delivery and there's no reason his solicitor would hide the letters). He's told Brother that our mother is lying about the letters, accused her of splitting up the family, said he will take her for every penny, claims that she should pay him maintenance so he can retire, etc. Finally, she decided to just accept his very low offer, for the sake of having a quiet life. She sent the acceptance over a month ago - and he's not responded to it. We know he's received it, but he's ignoring it.   Mother's solicitor has said that at this point, taking him to court is her only option - she's even agreed to his (pretty insulting) offer, just to get rid of him, and he's refusing to accept her acceptance. Presumably, this is just to make her miserable as he knows she's keen to sell the house and move out of the area (and in with her new husband) and she can't afford to do that unless she sells it. Going to court will be incredibly expensive (her solicitor is estimating up to £30k in fees, which she may or may not get back from him) and a very lengthy process, up to a year and, if he's going to be as awkward as he carries on being, possibly longer.   LegalAdvice, do we have any options apart from court? I've suggested one more letter, sent to both XSF's home address and his solicitor, saying that she has accepted his offer on [date] and is waiting for his response - if nothing else, if she has to take him to court, then she'll have proof that he's deliberately ignoring her in an attempt to drag out the process. I don't know if it's better to just leave it and go to court, or if there are other options we can take. Thank you!	Yes
120	My ex has filed a domestic violence protection act against me, asserting that I had yelled at her, but nothing further than that in the instant.  While I did yell at her for one sentence in the midst of her yelling at me, this seems rather arbitrary and there was no assertion of violence (and never has there been in the past).  I have only contacted her since to apologize for yelling and to arrange a time for her to come and get her things.  More importantly she also asserted in this that previously I had made her leave the residence which we were staying (for which I was the only one on the lease and the only one paying rent) and she had no where to go during this time.  I can document that this is not true, that I only asked her to leave for one night and that she had her own separate residence to stay in.  Also that I had assaulted her by touching her sexually while she was sleeping and could not give consent (while we were dating and having consensual sex), which is also false but of course there is no way for me to prove this.  Are there any repercussions of this?	Yes
121	"Greetings!  My ex husband has repeatedly violated our court ordered custody/parenting agreement. I am asking the judge to find him in contempt. The form asks me what ""remedial sanctions"" I want to request. I have zero desire to see him spend time in jail, and I feel a money award only hurts my children. A court order has already failed, so asking for another one requiring him to comply with the first one...seems a bit ridiculous. I do not know what is right or fair here - I just want him to stop violating our agreement. Any advice is welcome and I'll happily give anymore detail that could be needed! Thank you!"	Yes
122	So I have 2 legal godparents who are in my biological parents' wills (signed by both parties and everything). My parents' divorce is getting messy and my mom is so mentally unstable that she is starting to make things up to make my father look bad. She kicked him out of the house and told us a bunch of BS. (Even before she's known to be a manipulative and compulsive liar.)   I don't want to live with her because I legitimately fear for her sanity and at this point my own. I can't live with this much stress and tension. I can't do it. And my father will have to work all the time (it's not unusual for him to work 12 days in a row.) and I don't want to add any more stress to him than he already has.   I'm 17 but for the time being before I turn 18 next year would it be possible for me to live with my godparents instead? Please help. Any advice is needed.	Yes
123	I was at my ex's house, long story short he started to beat me and I told him if he didn't stop I would break his laptop so I did. He ended up throwing me out(literally) and beating me, while he was beating me his mom jumped in and started kicking me. I went to the police today to press charges.  I guess basically I'm asking what happens next and can I get in trouble for this as well even tho I was the victim ?	Yes
124	"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Long post ahead, sorry if this gets into r/relationships territory.  My husband and I recently decided to get legal guardianship of my nieces (ages 13 and 15). Their mother, my sister, had abandoned them at their father's house, who in turn dumped them at his mother's house, where they were living without proper care. So far, the transition has been bumpy. They have never been in a single home for longer than a year. Their mother is not self-sufficient and has always relied on boyfriends for housing. We are trying to help the girls transition to a more steady life and have emphasized that they will both have a home here until they are old enough to move out. We are getting them registered in our local school district and have gotten them onto our family's insurance plans.   The younger sister (let's call her Jane) ran away from our home in New Jersey at approximately 4:30 AM on monday. According to Jane, she was picked up by an Uber driver at our home address and was taken to a train station, from which she took two separate trains to arrive at her mother's apartment in New York, where she is living with her current boyfriend. This was not discovered until 11 AM, when I knocked on Jane's bedroom door. On her bed were several notes, including descriptions of her appearance written like a missing persons report. She wrote down her age, height, weight, eye color, hair color, and clothing, as well as a second note detailing her reasons for leaving.  When this was discovered, Jane's older sister (Grace for now) became panicked and called her. At this point Jane was already in New York. She offered scant details about what happened, and given Grace's emotional state, it was difficult to glean details about the call from her.  At 12:30 my husband arrived home early from work and we decided to call the police. A police officer arrived shortly after. We hoped that they would be able to bring Jane home remotely so that we would not have to confront my sister directly, but the officer stated that he did not feel that that was necessary. He said it was generally unheard of to remove children from their biological parents and did not want to get involved. He called his sergeant over, they took photos of Jane's notes, and then it was decided that my husband and I would have to go to New York to pick Jane up.   We brought Jane home close to midnight. She asked to be allowed to sleep at her father's and we let her. We didn't ask her too many questions about what happened, but now we are stuck in a bit of a jam. We were disappointed by the guidance of the officer, and we don't know where exactly we can go legally from here. Here are the issues which have arisen since this event:  1. We have tried to contact Uber re:picking up a 13 year old girl at 4:30 AM with multiple suitcases and have not gotten a response. It's difficult to believe that the drivers are not trained to have suspicions with circumstances like these.  2. Jane and Grace's father is now threatening to try to get custody because this event has proven that I am ""negligent"" in his eyes. He has no house and not much legal income (decent illegal income), but his threats are still scary, given that now he is trying to be a bigger part of Jane's life and Jane talks to him quite a lot. We have been letting the girls stay with their father when they ask, but now we are wondering if we need to scale this back.  3. My sister is not admitting her degree of involvement in this case. It appears as though she encouraged Jane's behavior, but we have no concrete proof (except for the notes, which seemed scripted.)"	Yes
125	I had just recently passed my road test in MN. I am a 16 year old and need a parent/guardian to sign off. Here's the issue I am currently living with my aunt and uncle and my parents are in China on vacation and they won't be back until December. They haven't given legal custody to my aunt and uncle so they can't sign off on my license. My uncle has the same last name as me so could I tell them that he is my dad and would they figure it out? Is that legal to do? Is there anything else I can do before my parents are physically back in the states?	Yes
126	One of my best friends with two children is currently going through a divorce but her husband is basically making her wait out till she runs out of money. He took all of the cash before she could get any from their joint account. He got his own apartment when she told him to leave, he left her with the girls and will only see them once a week for a few hours when he chooses. He already hired a lawyer and will not provide her any money for child support. He is basically holding out knowing that her job will not support her and the two children. He was very abusive before she finally kicked him out. I've been trying to help financially as much as I can but I know it's going to get worse. Does anyone have any recommendations? She cannot afford an expensive lawyer and the ones she's called all expect lots of money. I know his lawyer is holding out to make as much money as possible but any help now will be great. I honestly just want any options for her because he keeps making threats that his lawyer will make sure she doesn't get any money and that he will get full custody even though he never watched them and multiple times he left them unattended and would choose to sleep or game instead.	Yes
127	I'll try to keep this short. My sister's ex-husband (whom she has a child with) is in the middle of a custody battle with his ex- girlfriend over a toddler. He called my sister and asked her to give a statement to his lawyer complimenting his parenting  style over  their own kid. Problem is that they've had some real issues precisely with co-parenting. One summer he came with all clothes that were too small and had to buy him a new wardrobe etc... She's been mulling over this for a while. Wondering about retaliation if she didn't. I think it's a bad idea and she should wash her hands all together of the her ex and his fight with the other woman. Thoughts?	Yes
128	My girlfriend and I got pregnant. She doesn't want to raise the child. We're both in our 30s. I have a good job, stable income, and own a home. I'm prepared to raise the child. What do I need to make sure she signs or agrees to so this all goes down legally?  She is currently 6 months pregnant. Right now she says she wants nothing to do with it's feeding or rearing, which is painful. But she had a troubled childhood so I'm trying to chalk it up to that. Forcing someone to mother a child they don't want to mother could be more damaging to a kid than esuring legal steps are taken for me to have stable full custody from day one. She doesn't seem adversarial right now, except in firmly stating she will refuse visitation or any physical caretaking. Honestly if she is this troubled I don't want her to have those roles.   What happens next?    This is in East Texas.	Yes
129	I had a one-night stand with an Englishwoman while in South America a few months ago. She contacted me out of the blue to let me know that she's pregnant and thinks it might be mine. She is not open to having an abortion and is not thrilled about the idea of adoption. What are my responsibilities here (assuming the child actually is mine)? I've also found conflicting information on whether the child would even be a US citizen.	Yes
130	Recently, my mom and my stepdad broke up, there were a lot of problems, but I want advice on a particular one.  My former stepsister(age 14) lured my nephew into her room, waited until he fell asleep, then took pictures of her making my nephew touch her inappropriately.  She then snapchatted a few of those photos to her friends.    Among the picture of her making my sleeping nephew touch her inappropriately, we also found nude photos of my nephew.  Her phone was taken away from her, but I'm not sure if she got it back since my mom and I left, and she may have deleted the pictures; BUT she has an iPhone which stores pictures in the cloud, so they may be in the cloud.  Is there any way my mom and I can go to the police and they can issue a search warrant to look through her iCloud photo's and/or past snapchats?	Yes
131	My husband left me and our 3 year old son. He moved out and now lives with his girlfriend and is refusing to give me any money for bills, child care etc. he stuck me with all the bills. And I can't afford it all on my own. What can I do?	Yes
132	"I'm estranged from both of my parents. They're bad people who I don't trust at all. I currently live with my brother in Texas who is also in no contact with his/our parents either. I'm going to be a senior in HS this year.   I recently found out my mother has acquired my SS# because she wanted to ""help with insurance"" but I'm afraid she'll try to ruin my credit for her own gain. I have issued a fraud alert for my credit just in case and have requested a credit report via mail. Hopefully nothing will come up because I have no credit cards or anything under my name (as far as I know). I'm still worried though and would appreciate it if you guys could give me any more advice on how I can legally protect myself from both of them."	Yes
133	After a sudden separation my child has gone to live with their father and their grandmother. I am unable to have custody right this moment for a few reasons.  Once those reasons are settled on my end I intend to file for primary custody. One of my many reasons I believe it's in her best interest to be with me lies with my ex-MILs blatant disregard of our parenting requests and such.  The specific incident I am curious about is an allergic reaction to diaper rashes. She used a brand of diaper my child severely reacted to and was told both in writing and verbally to stop and switch to the brand we use due to the reaction. She didn't and my child reacted badly again, and ever since has had extreme stress and anxiety to getting touched down there. Diaper changes are now really, really upsetting for my child and although I made progress with getting them comfortable again they've completely regressed since entering into her and my ex's care.  My ex-MIL has a history of this kind of thing (ignoring people and doing what she wants) and there are other more minor incidents involving my child.  Is this diaper issue something to note since it caused physical harm to my child and has had lasting effects? With her past history of doing whatever I am concerned she'll do this again but with something else.	Yes
134	Someone is contesting the right to my daughter. He claims to be the bio father after 15 years.  I just want to learn as much as I can about this guy.	Yes
135	My wife's ex-husband took out a $20k student loan in her name back when they were married. It was a physically and verbally abusive relationship so she did nothing about it at the time or during the divorce and since the loans were under her name he said he was not responsible for any of them. Fast forward to current time, I'm helping her pay them off but sick of it and wondering if there's any legal ground for us to sue to make him pay it. He opened them up under her name but they were married at the time so in my mind should both be responsible, at worst case for half of it. Any advice you guys can give would be super helpful, or just let me know if I'm boned here and can't do anything about it.	Yes
136	Long story short, I've detached myself from my immediate family. Moved 30 odd miles away, changed my name by deed poll, and tried to start a new life. Issues with debt from them are coming to me, (my sister was paying my phone bill, I then took over, and they're saying something is outstanding but they won't tell me what and she's being uncooperative to say the least) as letters regarding it are coming to me, but addressed to her (as the debt is in her name but I'm now the registered address for the phone contract) - I'm planning to go into a 3 store and talk to someone face to face about it, but how can I prevent this in the future? Is there anything I can do? Do I have to literally wipe everything and start again? :(	Yes
137	State is Iowa.  So if my husband is not adhering to the custody Arrangements set forth in the finalized divorce decree and stipulation how many months or weeks or incidents should I document before I seek legal counsel.   I have no desire to work with him directly. I would rather surprise him with a court hearing.	Yes
138	Long story short.. divorced 2 yrs. minor child lives with me alone. No contact from ex in over 2 yrs. he has recently started emailing me asking for pictures of child. My Atty advised I should send. He has increased requests to every month and now every week for the past three. Each email he is trying to get me to converse with him, &amp; makes references to our past relationship. I only respond with pictures, no conversation. I had pfa against him which expired and was not able to be renewed because he moved out of state. My question is what is reasonable for asking for pictures? I mean come on, appearance isn't going to change month to month and I feel that he is just using as an excuse to try and get me to talk to him. I feel like it's just more emotional abuse and harassment.	Yes
139	STATE: GEORGIA -daughter history of meth, heroin. -thought she was clean -came to town to testify FOR her in custody/divorce of youngest child -found neglected, unfed, unclean children- ages 4 and 5-- with her locked in her room most of the time -arranged a 3 hour meeting w/ her psychiatrist -he reported her to DFCS based on a private conversation with her, I am guessing -DFCS interviewed me yesterday -daughter asked me to leave her house (I own it, she lives there as a tenant but has never made a rent payment as she is unemployed). -I left peacefully, because...kids don't need to hear arguing. I'm at a friends.  QUESTION: Should I stay for a few weeks or return home (across the country)? The kids have lived with me 3 times and spent summers with me. We are very close. The baby will be with his father enough that I'm not worried about him. The older 2 do not have a father with custodial rights. He's always in jail.   I don't know how DFCS works except for the many, many times I cared for children in the ER when they came in for medical clearance as part of placement with DFCS.	Yes
140	We live in Southern California, USA.  Firstly, I know, I know, talk to a lawyer, and I’ve sent an email to a family lawyer, I just want to make sure we tap into every available resource before moving forward.   What happened:  My Mother-in-law and father-in-law have had a very dysfunctional relationship. Father-in-law slept on a mattress in the living room for almost a decade, both estranged, living under one roof, until we finally convinced him to sell the house that my wife grew up in (house was originally under MIL, but had it transferred to his name because of a bankruptcy, or so I’m told.)  From the 6 years I’ve known my wife, I’ve seen how he is; Huge egotistical, narcissistic, bully who has verbally and physically abused my wife in her teens, and my mother-in-law, so of course he’s having a huge ego/power trip now that he supposedly netted over $200,000 from the house (he’s not telling us exactly how much).   He says the check is ready and wants to give half of my MIL’s money now and half after she signs the divorce papers. They both want a divorce lawyer, so it seems like a really dumb excuse. My cynical side/bullshit meter is telling me that he’s holding onto the money as a power move and that he won’t give her the rest of the money when she signs the divorce paper work(he confided in my wife his intentions, instructing her not to tell my MIL, which of course we did). My MIL told me that he’s been pressuring her to have sex with him for the money, going as far as cornering her and tormenting/sexually harassing her.  Disgusting shit.   I also suspect that he’s ready to run to Mexico, since he’s Mexican, has been visiting Tijuana, and has been talking about purchasing a house down there for $35,000.   I’m sending this to a family lawyer, and have instructed my MIL to record any conversations between them if they talk. Besides that, I’m at a total loss for words or what to do, all I know is that I hate seeing my wife and my MIL suffer from such a monster. My MIL and FIL are going to the bank tomorrow so that he can ‘give her her money’, again, my cynical side is telling me that he’s gonna shortchange my MIL and keep more than his fair share, or just give her half now and half possilbly never.    I just want to be prepared to act to any possible scenarios.   TL:DR FIL is holding money gained from them selling their family home hostage, and tormenting/sexually harassing my MIL, and I’m trying to be prepared for worst case scenarios.   Thanks in advance for reading this and for your help.	Yes
141	So I know similar questions have been asked about this, but my current bf's situation is completely different and I can't talk to anyone about this and feel completely alone.   My partner just got a call from a one night stand he had 5 years ago claiming he has a four year old child. (they worked together at the same company so she found his number through mutual friends on Facebook) Anyway, when she was 6 months pregnant she said to him that it might be his but then weeks later said it wasn't and that she had slept with two other men that same week and that he shouldn't worry. Well she called two weeks ago for the first time in 2 years and insisted it was his, wants child support and that he should come and do a paternity test immediately. My boyfriend only told me this yesterday, I've never seen him this nervous and upset.   The problem is, is that we live in a different country now. Have been for 3 years.  So he would have to fly a 13 hour flight and pay for the expensive test. Well he doesn't have to but is scared she might go to court, convince them that its his and put a block on his passport or a warrant for his arrest. Probably would have to get lawyers involved as well. He has a job, responsibilities here and can't just leave. We're quite serious in our relationship and this might change every dynamic of it, I guess I'm just lost and he doesn't really know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.	Yes
142	"I've been taking medication since I was 10, ones to help my depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I also got on a birth control pill when I was 17. My mother always kept my medicine in a lockbox and only set out a weeks worth of pills af a time which sucked because she's HORRIBLE at remembering to give me more at the end of the week and she procrastinates on it even when I remind her. Once I turned 18 I told her to stop keeping it locked, but she refused even though I'm medically independent. When I miss my meds I get horrible withdrawals that include vomiting and migraines. The birth control is locked away too, and the last thing I need to to become sexually active and miss a day and get pregnant because the pill isn't accessible. My mom justifies herself by saying she doesn't ""want me to kill myself"" via pill. The very pills I need to stop me from wanting to hurt myself. Is this legal for her to do?"	Yes
143	My ex and I agreed that we would pay our fair share of taxes, in proportion to our earnings, at tax time. Because I withheld too much, and she withheld too little, I ended up paying her taxes for her. Per our divorce agreement, in this situation we agreed to pay back the other, but she is now refusing to pay. Do I have to go to divorce court, or could I take her to civil court, or even small claims court, to get my money?	Yes
144	Is this possible?  I understood the order to read that my child's father is to pay $xx each month or it could be withheld from his pay.  Got a very angry couple of phone calls today that they are forcing him to have it held and a call to the Attorney General confirmed this.  I never asked my lawyer to put that in but what's done is done.  Is it expensive/complicated to change the order to say it won't be withheld?  The support has always been paid on time from his VA disability.  I don't see the sense in doing it through his employer.	Yes
145	So, my dad has been doing this to my mom and now that her credit is shit he's using my (19 year old college student) credit to open cards. I can't complain because he does pay off my credit cards and hes paying for a study abroad trip but honestly what the fuck? I just got a letter in the mail (my home address not uni address) one saying I was approved and there was a card for me and my dad in there (I ripped them up and threw them away) and the other saying I was denied.      I tried calling every customer service number I found but there was only a robot server, so I just ripped the cards up. The issue is he has my SSCN written down (he has all three of ours written down on all of our SS cards. For example mine has his and my moms, his has my moms and mine, my mom has mine and his)     I don't want to get in anything too legal but I don't want my credit to go to shit. Can I change my social security card number at all? (also would that require me to get a new passport?). He does end up paying all the credit cards off but he ends up racking them up and currently he has a full wallet full of them (ideally I think you'd need at most like 3/4, he owns at least 20) so I don't see why he'd need more ESPECIALLY under my name when I just started my journey to credit. I don't want this to bite me in the ass when I'm trying to buy a house. Should I just leave it or should I do something about this? He could have been doing this to me for god knows how long because I was getting credit cards in my name that he told me of left and right that he also has and has been saying I'm approved for them. Is there anyway I can talk to my bank and approve him JUST to pay my credit cards without him being able to open new cards and make himself an authorized user?	Yes
146	"GF and I broke up. I confronted her about her affairs and told her I would report her [unrelated] illegal activity. She got an order of protection. She went out of her way to tell me in an email that her police report included that I ""shattered a light switch.""  I have a family court hearing coming up. This is what I plan to include in the memo. (I know you'll tell me to talk to a lawyer but I can't afford one and none of the free legal centers answered their phones today. And the public defender doesn't see my case until the day of.)   &gt;The evening of July 2 I confronted X about her affair while we were in the bedroom. I moved out of the bedroom into the living room. As I was passing through the doorway, walking away from X, I open-palm slapped the wall, and then sat down on the couch. The bottom edge of my right hand hit the top left corner of the light switch and broke the top left corner of the light switch. This left a superficial scar on the bottom edge of my hand. The top edge of the light switch is about two inches below my elbow. I didn't raise my hands and I didn't throw a punch."	Yes
147	when i was about 8 or 9 my dad and I would stay with his GF who was an exotic dancer who used heroin regularly. he is very abusive to my family and I. whatever whatever. I am trying so hard to not see him anymore. i live in MI, USA.   like I was saying, when i was 8 or 9 my dad and her and I would all sleep in the same room. they would be having sex while i was in the room! (didn't completely know when i was younger due to a lack of knowledge, but now I remember their convo and the noises they were making. pretty easy to put 2 and 2 together).   i was just wondering if i can bring this up and tell anyone and have him get charged with SOMETHING. i know it's probably a no since there's no clear evidence, just my word against his. but i'm just wondering. he does have a bad record of DUI's and domestic abuse.  TL;DR- can my dad get charged with anything if it's just my word vs his	Yes
148	"Hi everyone, thank you in advance for any help you can provide.  My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.  She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was ""acting like a slut"" and ""dressing inappropriately"" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent ""promiscuity"". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.  I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because ""[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.""  I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a ""you're starting high school"" gift, and thought it best to wait.  I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again. I'm so angry right now I cannot think straight, and she's taking a nap. What do I need to do? Who do I need to call?"	Yes
149	"I posted another topic a few days ago and while reading over more, does this mean just registration for hockey is split or any expense with hockey.  Para 1 and 2 seem to be hand in hand but para 2 says hockey expense as in general and not hockey registrations.

150	We live in Ohio, and my mom said if my stepdad found out she was cheating he would get a divorce settlement and not a disillusion.  She told me he'd get half of everything she owns - her savings, her retirement fund, and most importantly the house. She'd have to sell the house so she could give him half of its worth.  The thing is, they've only been married for two years. She makes house payments to the bank, but she's not renting. We've had this house for 17 years, so I feel like he would have no right to get any of it since he only moved in two years ago, but I don't know if that's how the legality of it works.  They bought two cars during their marriage, and he's a car salesman so they came from his place of work. How would this factor into the settlement?  I'm going through a lot, so my mind is just flooded with confusion. I tried googling this stuff, but I think information attuned to my situation would be the most helpful.	Yes
151	My wife surprised me with getting an apartment, telling me she wants to get a divorce, and that she will no longer pay bills.  I can barely afford them all on my own (make about 60% of our combined income).  She wants full access to the house to get things and says I have no right to privacy bc her name is still on the house.  Obviously there's no way I can refinance it in just my name as I can barely get by.  On top of this, she took my son and wants me to have him every weekend.  I'm worried that if I try to keep the house there is no way I'll be able to help with his expenses.	Yes
152	I live in MN.   My SO was recently diagnosed with cancer. So far it is not terminal but it is not looking great. I would rather not get into the personal details of this.   He has always been a spontaneous person and so I know if he hears terminal, he will ask me to marry him. I am more of a planner and have a few concerns about marrying him so sudden and young, only to be widowed. I want to be prepared in case it does so I can give him an answer and have peace of mind myself about my future.   1. I am on my parent's health insurance as I am under 26. Am I able to stay on this if I am married/widowed?  2. Would I inherit any of his debt if he passes?  3. Would I be in charge of his estate and affairs?  4. Would this in anyway affect my taxes?  5. Are there any other life impacting/legal implications I should be considering once I am married?  This has become a reality very quickly for me and I have not had to consider any of this up to this point. I understand if this comes off as uncaring, but please don't misinterpret my tone. I would marry him in a heart beat if I knew it wouldn't cause major financial or legal changes in my life being widowed so young. If there will be I would consider spiritual marriage instead of legal.   Thank you in advance.	Yes
153	"So my little sister attempted suicide due to Cyber Bullying from multiple people her age (15-16yrs old) Obviously my family and I will be pursuing legal action but the kids are in a different state. We have account data and screenshots plus a phone number and documented conversations where she is told to ""kill herself"". They are from Michigan and we are from Florida. The internet doesn't seem to be forthcoming with information on how to prosecute between states and it would help put my family at ease if you guys could give advice on how to charge them in some way and also listing what the potential punishments are."

154	I am the biological father of a 16 y/o female. She has been living with me for over a year now since her mom died.  Her mother and I were never married.  Her mother did not complete a will. There is also a 24 year old brother.  I would like to establish guardianship so we can sell her mothers house. Can I do this without a lawyer? I'm her dad, always have been, do I need papers?	Yes
155	Hello everyone. So basically what has happened is right now I am 16 and my parents honestly hate me. They are abusive and neglect my well being and have caused a lot of mental health issues for me. Anyways I plan on leaving them FOREVER the day I turn 18 and finish school...however after today I do not think that will be possible anymore.    So what happened is that they wont allow me to buy my own car so instead bought the family a truck to use in generally, they told I have to PAY THEM BACK for a fucking 60k truck. They said once I pay them back fully It will be mine to keep however there is no way in hell i will ever be able to pay them back in fucking two years. Which means after i turn 18 i still am gonna be making them payments. I never agreed to this and I need to know   If i run away after i finish school without paying them back for this truck(which i never brough and it isnt legally mine) can they do legal action against me or like take me to court...  As of my location I live in Canada in the province of Alberta.	Yes
156	Im writting this on behalf of a friend.  A mom and dad are separated, and have a schedule for child custody. The mom sent the kids to camp at a location several hours away from the dad's home. When the camp is done, it will be time for the dad to pick up the kids from the mom. However, the mom purposely did not pay the camp to drive the kids home. This means that the dad is left to drive several hours to pick up the kids. Of course, he will drive there to pick them up. But, is there anyway to discipline the mom?  Is there anything that can be done?	Yes
157	"I live in Texas first of all. My 5 year-old son just told me that he ""snuggles"" and sometimes co-sleeps (my language, not his) with his stepfather. He also told me this happens nearly every morning after his mom goes to work and that his stepfather is only wearing underwear while they're under the covers. Apparently, they also watch videos or play games on his phone in this state.  He continued to say that he sleeps between them some nights and his mom is ""totally naked"". I'm more than a little disturbed by all of this. He sleeps in his own bed 100% of the time when he's with me, which is 50/50 on a week on week off basis. Clearly he doesn't ""need"" this.   Where does the law/judges/cps stand on this behavior? It seems like alienation at the very least to me."	Yes
158	"Hello r/legaladvice,  My brother has recently moved to a small town for work, and he has taken on a new girlfriend from this small town. Leaving aside how I may or may not feel about her, I have some concerns about how her situation may affect my brother going forward.   This girl is 24 years old, and has two young kids, each from a different father. She has had the kids taken away from her, and they are now under the care of their other respective parents. She is entitled currently to supervised visitations with the children (I don't know the particulars of how this came to be). She is self-employed part time- she does odd jobs around the little town such as cleaning, cutting grass, etc. My brother has a very good job as an engineer at the local power plant, and as time goes by, his good prospects will only go up.   My worry is this: this girlfriend currently has a dumpy little 1-room basement apartment, but is now spending ALL her time at my brother's house he owns. I can see that he is not far off from thinking, ""Hey- why does she keep on paying rent for that place? She spends all her time here anyway... She should just come and live with me!"" He is very eager to fall in love that way, and sometimes in the past, it has clouded his judgment.    So here is the question: If she moves in with my brother, they become ""co-habitating spouses, and the girl's baby-daddies come around looking for child support, will my brother's income be counted as hers for calculating support payments? Because that could make the support payments waaaaay higher than what she makes by herself, putting my brother on the hook for it. None of the people in this equation make decent money aside from my brother, and I'm worried about him becoming a target.   Thanks in advance!"	Yes

160	Hello. I am from Mississippi. My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We always used birth control. A few months ago, we were fooling around, and, out of the blue, my boyfriend suggested we try to have a baby. I was perplexed because he had always expressed disinterest in children. He started fantasizing about a wonderful family we could have, emphasizing his love and commitment to me. I was so taken aback and, after a few hours, he eventually persuaded me. I probably asked him a hundred times if he was sure, each of which he replied in the affirmative.  Well after a short while, he changed his tune and told me to go back on the pill. I was again confused but obliged. Shortly afterward, I found out I was pregnant. I felt a rush of emotions – fear, anxiety, and, surprisingly, joy. I thought it was nice to have a little person growing inside of me, depending on me for support. But I was mostly worried about how my boyfriend would feel. That night, I gradually broached the subject and eventually told him.   He hit the roof and accused me of plotting against him. I reminded him that he persuaded me to try for a baby, and he said that was just stupid pillow talk. He ordered me to “get rid of it,” to which I felt sick. He has known from the very beginning of our relationship that I am terrified by even the thought of an abortion, and he always said felt the same way. I tried to placate and reason with him, but he just kept calling me a lying slut and a bitch. He snapped that I would never get a cent of his money and stormed out.   I was completely flummoxed and scared. I know several single mothers who were abandoned by their boyfriends/husbands and are struggling immensely to raise their children on their own. I swore I would never end up like them. But I know that I cannot raise a baby on my own. I even started considering abortion, but the closest abortion clinic is over a hundred miles away, and abortion is not covered by insurance in my state.   Unfortunately, I could not even have a conversation with my boyfriend, as he kicked me out of our apartment and cut off all communication with me. I spent weeks simply trying to talk to him. He eventually relented, just in time to introduce me to his new girlfriend, seated in the passenger seat of his brand new truck. I felt defeated and gave abortion a second thought but realized I had just passed the 20-week threshold. To top it off, I was fired from my job for unexplained reasons (just days after I put in a request for a larger uniform to accommodate my baby bump).  My boyfriend was the one who coaxed me into going off the pill and making love night after night. He promised me, swore up and down, that he would always be there for the baby and me. And now that we are pregnant, he wants nothing to do with the baby or me. How can he do this? How can a father want nothing to do his own child? Our baby is our creation, and every day, I find myself growing more and more attached to it. When I feel it kicking inside of my stomach, I feel warm and joyful. But I know that I cannot afford to feed and clothe it on my own, and I know that I will not be able to give it up once I hold it in my arms. I really, really do not want to have to go to court, but as my bump grows and my paltry savings diminish, I fear that I may be the only option at this point. I don't care about myself; I only want our baby to have his basic needs met. What can I do?	Yes
161	I need legal advice regarding the no contact order.  A friend got into argument with live in partner and she broke something.  He called the police and had her taken away on charge of domestic violence.  She had a no contact order put on her but she tried to see him after that to smooth things over.  However the court doesn't know that she broke the no contact order, only the live in partner.  My question is can he use knowledge and evidence of her breaking her no contact order down the road as a way to blackmail her into getting what he wants?  Thanks for your advice really appreciate it.	Yes
162	Edit: Please read the entire thing before passing judgement  Hello, yesterday I was arrested for child endangerment because I took the keys out of the vehicle so we could stop arguing and to make sure I didn't go to jail for domestic abuse. (I was really pissed, it's a long story) yes, it was hot, but my wife was in the vehicle supervising my son. There was no harm to my son, this all happened in 5 minutes give or take. I got back in the vehicle, and offered her the keys, she told me to get out, so I got back out, and was then arrested for child endangerment. I looked at what the statutes are and my son was never unsupervised, and wasn't hurt in any way. (Less than 5 minutes in a vehicle, the AC had been going for a while, and at any time my wife could have taken my son out of the car) and I'm curious why I was arrested?	Yes
163	"CA, USA Throwaway account for obvious reasons.   Backstory:  My ex-girlfriend (currently early 30s) and I (mid 30s) had a daughter and ended up going on our separate ways when my daughter turned 3, daughter is currently 10. Ex started to go off the deep end before we split and went into a heavy depression and drugs and willfully became homeless not wanting her family's help. After months of threats of taking our daughter away from me, I took myself to court and filed papers for full custody on my own with county help, I was not doing too well financially at the time. After it was said and done primary and physical custody was awarded to me. A visitation schedule was arranged and I told my ex to get the help she needed and if she was sobered she could see her daughter anytime when she wanted and if she got back on her feet we would revisit custody.   Last year my ex had hit 2 years of sobriety after living dirty and not making forward progress for 6 years. In those years, she did not pay one dime of child support or help with any funds for our daughter, I was the sole provider. Ex's mother helped her daughter and was involved in our daughter’s life and still remains so to this day. Ex went to cosmetology school and started going to church. Ex moved back in with mother and mother provided financial crutch for her to get her life back on track with help for work, education, car, etc. Ex started wanting to visit with daughter more so I allowed it, especially being at grandmother’s house, she was there to help and supervise and at this point we were not following agreed upon visitation because we were working together without the schedule.    Ex one month approaches me and told me she wanted to have 50/50 custody and I said I would think about it. My internal instinct did not feel that 50/50 custody was appropriate due to the amount of time she was off doing whatever a parent doesn't do. I didn't bring it back up to her but she kept on top of me about it. She kept mentioning wanting to claim her on her taxes and red flags were going off left and right as this was all happening around tax time.   Eventually ex served me paperwork to go back to court. I retained a lawyer who was willing to help but was curious on why I wanted to hold back custody rights. Lawyer informed me that judge would more than likely rule in favor of 50/50 because of recent events and that if there were any further issues it would be easy to have that revoked and changed. Believing that people can change, I took a chance and agreed to 50/50 rights with no child support from either parent. Things have been smooth so far.  Current Day:  Ex is now heavily involved in church. The church is very small (10-15 people) and is just starting to grow. (another red flag for me as I get cultish vibes from small churches for some reason) She brings our daughter to service weekly and I have no issues with that besides not particularly liking small churches. I grew up in church and learned from the stories they tell. Ex meets new boyfriend in church. New boyfriend I have not officially been introduced but I have seen him and something struck me as being a bit off. Ex and I are friends on Facebook and I am seeing posts of her boyfriend or her tagging each other in places with our daughter. Having a weird feeling about the boyfriend I searched his name on the local records database for our county and found a potential match for a criminal case, but this person had a middle name which boyfriends profile did not have.  Person had a conviction for Attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and having a firearm.   Instantly this raised concern for me and I began trying to find more information about the boyfriend. Yesterday the information fell into my lap. He posted a Facebook post claiming he was happy he was out of prison and turned his life around and the dates lined up exactly with the printout i purchased from the county.   This morning I asked my child about the ex's boyfriend. I asked two questions, "" Is he nice to you and your mom?"" she replied with yes.  Secondly, I asked her if she knew about his past at all where he was from etc.   She paused and looked at me and told me that he has a bad past. I pushed a little bit further and asked what she meant by that and she told me that he paralyzed someone with a shoe and went to prison, but he is ok now because he is walking with god in his life and then she smiled. My child had no concern over the fact that her mom’s new boyfriend tried to kill someone or that he went to prison. That lead me to believe that the Ex's mother was ok with this was well so I asked if her grandma knew about his past and she said yes. I sat in disbelief that a situation like this would happen to my child.  When Ex arrived today for her pickup of our daughter I walked with her outside and asked about her boyfriend’s past, mentioning that I saw on Facebook he posted that he was a ex-felon. All she would cop to was that he had an assault charge. I told her that I found out he was in for attempted murder and she said that he has changed his life and walks with god. I asked why she did not feel the need to tell me about his past and she said she didn’t have too. I told her that the safety of my child is my concern and I think if the roles were reversed she would expect me to say something. She then rebutted that if she would have told me that all I would have said was I don’t feel comfortable with him around our daughter.   She goes on to tell me that she has no fear for her or our daughter’s safety around the ex-felon and that the grace of god is protecting them. I understand that with my ex's past being shady and the new boyfriend's past being worse they would naturally gravitate to each other and ""fix each other"" but I don't want my daughter involved in that relationship.  Drug use and attempted murder are on opposite ends of the spectrum in my mind. But to her, she tells me sin is sin and doesn't see it that way. I told her that I do not want that guy around my daughter but she said there is nothing I can do about it. She goes on to tell me that the boyfriend has people in the church that will vouch for him and the pastor will too. She also tells me the grandmother knows about the boyfriend as well as the grandfather and her brother and they all are fine with him. I have a feeling that she only told them he has an assault charge; however, I have not called them yet to express my concern over this boyfriend. I wanted to have a conversation with her first. She ended up taking my daughter in the car and leaving.  I am left sitting in my office writing this post, not knowing what to do or where to turn. What can I do to protect my child from a potentially horrible situation?  help."	Yes
164	Im kind of in a bind and really need help with my forms. I live in Massachusetts but im filing for divorce in Rhode Island. The residency requirements there are that one spouse must have lived in the state for a year prior to filing, which my spouse has. However, the first line of the Complaint asks me to verify that ive lived in the state for that period. Do i leave it blank?   Also, we don't have children so do i need to file the forms regarding children with N/A or not file them at all.   My last question pertains to the financial form.

Im sorry to put this on you guys but im filing Monday and haven't been able to afford a lawyer so doing it myself has been tough. Any help would be awesome and Id be soo grateful.	Yes
165	Hello, I'm not quite sure if this is the best place but I need to start somewhere. I, 24, have been living with my dad, his wife, and 4 kids (ages 4 and under). I am about to move out and my dad needs help with handling these children. The mother is almost non existent (stays in room and makes minimal contact), as she has a prescription drug problem... He is out of money, out of time, and almost out of his mind trying to find a helping hand somewhere to turn this situation around. My dad can't go out and make money because he is stuck at home taking care of the kids full time, almost 15 hours a day.. this situation is ridiculous and I don't know where else to go. Obviously she needs to get out but what is the fastest way to do so. My dad is afraid of reprocussions for calling CPS or setuing similar. The wife is a master manipulator.   We are in North county San Diego  Thank you, anybody, for your help.	Yes
166	Hey all,  My fiancés friend is in Cincy, Ohio. Single mother who just had her baby. She is currently drowning in medical debt, getting warnings about having her utilities shut off, and her baby daddy who has done nothing for the kid is lawyering up to get custody and child support. My fiancé and her parents are trying to help her anonymously with money and I'm trying to get a bunch of clothes and stuff together for her.   My question is, is there anything we can do to help her regarding the child support/custody case, utilities, or even medical debt? I do not know if she's on government assistance or if she has tried to have her medical debt forgiven, nor does the fiancé. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!	Yes
167	Let me first start out by saying I have legal custody. I am wondering what I can do and if this constitutes me getting more custody. Or at least seeing my son more. My son was living with his father and his stepmother. They have recently separated and my son is still living in the house. His father has moved out and refuses to speak to me or my family.  That, the no communication part has been going on for years. No communication.   My son is still there living with his step mother.  My son is now currently living with someone who has no legal ties to him. ?  We did have a court order but he refused to abide by it. Unless it helps him in some way.   I live out of state now and i want to see my son more and need to know what to do. We have gone to court before in massachusetts. I am asking if I can file here in California and send it to Massachusetts then wait for the court date? Not really sure how that works.  update- I found out today that my sons father is now moving in with another woman who has 3 children. He's still technically married. He told my son he's moving in there too.  He told my son not to tell me anything that was going on for fear I would take him to court.  My son has a phone that his father takes away from him when he's with my family. He also looks at his text messages so my son was afraid to text me to tell me what was going on. The fact my child has to hide our conversations breaks my heart.   My son says he is okay with the situation.  I am not. He says he wants to visit me but his father refuses to let him until he's 18. I don't think that's legal? My son is now 13 and I was also wondering if he can speak for himself in court if needed? I just want my son to be happy. I am just concerned with the living situation. I also just want to see him more and be more apart of his life. I go back home as much as I can to see him but I'd like him to see California. His father makes everything impossible and I don't want to start any drama I just want to see my son more and make sure he is happy. Please any advice will be helpful.	Yes
168	So a quick bit of background - I suffer from depression and back in February I overdosed. I was in hospital in a coma for a few weeks, was then sent to a psych ward for evaluation, and was released after a few days.  During this time my ex illegally entered my home, took my phone, and illegally went through messages, finding one from a random friend along if I knew anyone selling ecstasy - I have not yet pressed charges against her.  After this she then went to court to have my access to my son removed (using the depression and drug message as the reason).  Since then I've been forced to only have supervised visitations, had a physiological evaluation (three times technically, one from the hospital where I was released, once from my normal psychiatrist who actually said that drugs were not needed, and then from the court approved psychiatrist), and drug test.  No problems with any, in fact she's been the one late to visitations and had tried to get out of some.  We're now, at long last, just about to go to court to have this settled, and suddenly she wants to have a deposition. She's also suddenly demanded my financial information for the past five years, including all pay stubs and bank statements (something that I just don't have and couldn't easily get) - child support is taken out of my cheques automatically in any case.  She also initially put this demand forward for next week, without any discussion with my lawyer to see if the time would work or anything.  Honestly to me this feels like she's just trying to put insane new hurdles up, trying to push back the court date, forcing me to continue to have extremely restricted access to my son, and force me to pay even more money that I simply don't have.  But I'm also not an expert so wanted to see what you all thought about this.   I should add that currently my lawyer is away. I did talk to her assistant who is also honestly confused about why she would be asking for this now.	Yes
169	A friend is married in both Brazil and California. She got married here then registered it in Brazil. Now her ex is paying for the divorce in Brazil- does she have to pay again to get divorced here? Or will California recognize a divorce that is completed in Brazil then Officially translated? Divorce in Brazil was only $200, in California over $700.	Yes
170	Re uploaded to place state in title  Throwaway account here, if only because the obvious sensitive nature of the topic and I don't wish to air someone's dirty laundry in a way that could link to them.   My wife and I have a happy marriage and a 6 year old son, and her parents live with us in our home in Texas. Due to some medical issues that should have kept ANY kids from being possible, my wife had to have a hysterectomy at a relatively early age. We always wanted to adopt a second child and recently have been doing the research on what the requirements are in our state. One of the requirements, of course, is a background check for everyone in the family (I'm not sure if they mean just in the house or everyone genetically linked to you), which makes sense. But it raises my worry about something.   My father in law is a convicted sex offender. Now, I mean that legally speaking in that he has to go and register his location and all that, but my wife told me this early on in our relationship. According to my wife's family he was caught up in this witch hunt back in the early 90's with these two kids who lied about a whole bunch of shit and he decided to take a plea deal instead of dragging his family through the hell of a trial. Not the choice I would have made but it is what it is and I don't know what I'd have done under those circumstances.   I believed my wife and her family when this was told to me years ago, and after being around the man for almost 7 years I haven't had a single moment to the contrary to shake that. He may have his flaws, but if I thought he had ever touched kids like that I wouldn't let him live in the same roof as my son. The issue is this: would his status on the registry prevent my wife and I from being able to adopt as long as they live with us, if at all?  Thanks.	Yes
171	Hi all,  I had a look at similar posts but I couldn't find my answer. I'm a US citizen living in France who recently got married. I want to change my last name (my maiden name hypened with my married name) but I don't really understand how to do it. France won't change my name until I change it in the U.S. I'm not a dual citizen yet (just American), but in two years I will be able to do that.  California still claims me as a resident even though I haven't really lived there for 4 years. Their process for a name change requires doing it in person and it seems like it takes weeks, which I can't do as I've got a full-time job. The embassy here in Paris doesn't do name changes either.  What I understand is that I have to file a name change with SS and then submit proof to the DMV, or do a court order and show up in person. How can I orchestrate all of this abroad?  Just for your FYI: I've got an American passport, a California ID (not a driver's license), and a French marriage visa + my French marriage certificate/paperwork.  Thanks so much for your advice!	Yes
172	I am recently divorced, I have to take him to court over the stupidest things to get him to do. I couldn't get my old tax returns without a long process from the IRS because he denied me access to the info I needed, so we went to court and judge ordered him to give it to me. We had agreed that since we were married all of last year and only separated in August, that we would still file jointly, and then do it separate after that. I am 99% sure he has already filed for last year, but I never saw it and I never signed it. He also hasn't given me my portion of the tax return. Is it fair that I am only supposed to get a third of that tax return? And what can i do to find out if he has already filed? The IRS is a NIGHTMARE to deal with. I can't talk to a person to save my life.	Yes
173	Wife is currently stationed for A and C school in Texas for the Navy. She had made a deal with me to stay married so she can be accepted into the Navy and she would help me go back to school and finish my degree. She talked me into moving to Texas so she can be close to the kids.  We've been in Texas for a year now.   Since being here she has gone back on a lot things she promised. Has not helped me with school in any way. I've had to quit my job because she wouldn't help with day care costs and couldn't afford it on my own. She doesn't even see the kids more than maybe an hour a week but has loads of time to go out and on trips and hang with her friends. In fact, I'm pretty sure she is dating one of her shipmates.   I've had enough and back in California I have loads of family I can count on to help in taking care of my kid. I also have friends that have offered me jobs that work with my schedule. I can take care of myself and my kid while in California. I want to move back soon. I have friends and family willing to hope me drive my stuff back to California.  So my big question is this, can I file for divorce and consequently take my kid to California with me and finish the divorce there or just wait to file there. My wife lives in the barracks and cannot have her kids. So if I move to California my kids will not be able to stay with my wife.   My next question is what will happen to my step son? He has known me as dad for for 5 years but I never legally adopted him and his not biologically mine. He has autism and I love him but right now he's too much for me to handle; not to mention the place where I'll be moving to in California is big enough for me and my biological kid. I have his biological dad's contact information and he's always wanted to be more in his life so I'm sure he'll take him. So do I send him to his dad's or do I make my wife figure it out?   My last question is what will happen to my wife. Will it affect her career? Can I ask for support for my daughter and me since I had to quit my job for her to successfully join the Navy?  TLDR:  Can I move my daughter with me from Texas to California while my wife is stationed in Texas?  Do I file for divorce in Texas or California?  Can I get support from my wife for daughter and myself?	Yes
174	This is in Maryland.  Recently, Conover v. Conover came to the top courts here in Maryland, and a lawyer friend advised my family to take advantage of this ruling.  We have a polyamorus triad ( M -F^1 -F^2 ) with 2 children, one biological child per female. (M+F^1 = 1 child, M+F^2 = 1 child).  The lawyer friend hasn't been available recently, due to workload and whatnot, so I can't ask them questions right now.  They emailed me a Baltimore Sun article, and said we should look into it. [This is the article in question.](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-de-facto-20160710-story.html)  We have one big question in considering this.  What, exactly, are the benefits to seeking this ruling in our favor?  I'm gathering that it means that custody and visitation is assumed for all parents involved if there's a divorce or dissolving of the the triad.  And I also gather that, if something happens to one of the females and the male, the other female will have custody automatically, without requesting so from the court, since they are the de facto parent to their non-biological child.  I guess I'm asking for clarification about what it's all about, if any of my assumptions are correct, and why it would be in our best interest to do this.  If more details are necessary, I'd be happy to provide them, as I'm not sure what is and isn't relevant.	Yes
175	"I'm ready to divorce my wife of almost three years. We got married in October of 2014 because she needed to go back to her country for family issues and couldn't leave due to being undocumented. I absolutely loved her at the time but we really married for the wrong reasons. I'm so unhappy and ready to get my life back.   Anyway here's the stuff I'm worried about:  - We own a home together, but I'm the only one on the mortgage; if she tries to take the house is it true I'm also entitled to have her take responsibility for my debt? Would a judge really grant her hundreds of thousands of dollars and leave me to pay for it for the next 30 years without a home?  - I have a small retirement fund that started after we were married, is she entitled to any of it? It's barely $5000.   - She hasn't been working for the last year and a half but is perfectly able to find work. She worked while I was finishing my degree so I agreed she should take some time off when I found work in my field (we agreed to ""a few months""). She is not educated beyond high school.   - She is not a citizen, but qualifies for citizenship under our marriage early next year. Does this affect anything?  - I'd much prefer arbitration over a legal battle, what is a good way to get this?  - I have massive student debt, is it true I am entitled to have her take part of that debt? I would only use this as a bargaining tool if things got bad.   - I make just under six figures a year; do I have to worry about alimony if our marriage was so short?  Appreciate any advice!"	Yes
176	So about 4 days ago my first born was well, born. He was born at home with no health issues although mama had to go to the hospital for a hematoma that was ironed out in no time. After we got home we both had been up at this point for about 40+ hours and were exhausted. He had passed his 24 hour visit with no issues and we were just about ready for bed when my SO asked if his hands were blue. I had told her they looked red if maybe a teensy bit blue and we decided to go to the ER for our new parental Paranoia, after telling them this they brought him to the NICU and said they needed blood, some pee and a 48 hour watch. Obviously we didn't want to but we waited the 48 and as we were relaxing my SO was holding the baby in the chair and he had been angled funny and lost his breath from his head being against the his chest. The doctor knew this but it was shift change so she communicated it to our new doctor, he says 5 more days are necessary even though my baby has been told he's healthy, a good eater, and clean of any infections. Do we really have to wait the 5 days or can we do an alternative and leave. I know AMA isn't allowed but is there any other way?	Yes
177	About 6 months ago I found out that my ex wife &amp; her new boyfriend were abusing my son. I took my son to the hospital &amp; filed a police report. Son was covered in bruises when ex dropped him off. CPS got involved &amp; all visitation was taken away from ex. I previously had him 70% of the time. Ex agreed to go to parenting classes &amp; the DA refused to press charges against her or BF despite them both admiring to the abuse.  We have now moved in to the maintenance part of CPS &amp; CPS is requiring we split custody. Both my lawyer &amp; myself are not happy with CPS caliver approach to my ex, but have discovered we don't have much recourse.   Yesterday the CPS worker called me &amp; said that she has yet to do her monthly visit with my son for July &amp; said she would meet with him on Thursday. I told her she could come by my house. She told me she had to meet with him at my ex's house since she realized she has never seen it. Side note: the original CPS order said CPS had to meet with my son once a month &amp; also meet with my ex-wife separately once a month. Which the worker has admitted hasn't happened. There is no obligation for CPS to come to my house but I have been allowing it because I don't care &amp; my main concern is my son.   So I told the worker that Thursday's are my custodial time. I have him from Wednesday-Saturday. So he was already at my exes house when I spoke to CPS. She said I have to take him to my ex's house. I told her fine but I want a specific time since I will be picking him up after they are done meeting &amp; keeping him for the rest of my time. She said she doesn't have a time since she has to be in court all day &amp; is unsure when she will get out. She suggested I just take him to my exes around 2pm &amp; then he can stay through his time with her. Essentially denying my custody time. I told her no I wanted to spend time with my son during my time. I also asked her if she had spoken to my ex to ensure she would be home. The worker told me no she hadn't yet &amp; asked if I could on her behalf. I told her no because of the no contact order I got against my ex after she threatened me.   Do I have to take my son to meet at my exes house? What recourse do I have? I just want to see my son &amp; the worker seems so against that. Help please!	Yes
178	My parents are only concerned with establishing paternity before I go off to college, but I'm trying to consider the legal/financial side of things as well. For someone clueless about how this process works, is getting ahead of this thing as sound a decision as it seems? Child support is kind of a boogeyman, especially in Texas, and I don't want to jump out of a pan and into a fire so to speak.	Yes
179	My mom has been dating the same man for a few years. I am an 18 year old male in Atlanta, GA. Last night I was angry with him and called him an 'old man' and a 'loser' and he pushed me against the wall and gave me a black eye. I got up in his face but did not throw any punches. Can I attempt to charge him for assault as I fear he does the same thing to my mom?  picture: http://imgur.com/a/pkYqr	Yes
180	"I'll try to keep this short since as probably all marriage endings go, this is complicated.   My wife and i (of three years, together 9) have had problems for a while but I thought things were getting better. End of June we had a fight and she left to stay with her family in TN for ""space."" We talked every day and things were getting better. The 30th of July she came home. I thought things were good. Long story short she said she needed more time. She left August 2nd. I tried to talk and message but she was kind of distant. August 5th she told me there  was someone else. Cue start of drama.  Since then, I've tried to reconcile, now on to divorce. Now I just want this to be over as quickly as possible. There are no assets. We lived together in my mom's house at the time, so no house. No kids together. The only thing we shared was a car loan. She has the car in TN. The car is upside down on the loan so no value. All our credit cards are individual. We have health insurance under ACA but I'm paying the bill.   I packed her belongings and asked what she wanted of our shared things from a previous apartment. She said nothing except one of our TV's which is fine by me. She wants to trade the car in but its upside down and I'm the primary on the loan. Anything that happens with the car has to happen here and she and it are still in TN.  I tried to get some info for the lawyer, she stopped responding to texts the night before last. I texted her this morning and now she wont speak to me directly. Her new ""boyfriend"" responded in her place saying now they are hiring a lawyer as well and to not try to contact her again.   I thought I could get her to sign an Appearance, Entry, and Waiver so we could move this along fast and each be on with our lives. I have no idea what they expect to gain from making this more complicated. Like I said, there are no assets and we haven't been married long enough to warrant her really getting anything from me, besides the fact I don't really have anything to give her. Plus well, she's the one that cheated.   [TL;DR] Wife left for ""space"", cheated, divorce, now won't speak to even communicate what she wants out of divorce. There are no real assets and debts are individual. How does this work beyond just letting lawyers take time (equals money I don't have) to fight over stuff that's worthless? What can I expect from the process? Any insight or advice is appreciated."	Yes
181	"First off, I'm a 14 year old male, and I have a sister who is 12 years old, my sister does not feel the same way as I do and therefore would most likely stay on the same schedule no matter the outcome. About four years ago my Stepmom and Dad took my mom to court to (from what I've gathered) try to gain full custody of us. It ended with the decision being equal time where my sister and I switch every other week. The weeks where I am with my Stepmom and Dad have started to feel like a living hell. For various reasons such as my bisexuality and their refusal to acknowledge it, (other than the usual ""You're going to hell"" of conservative Christians) which has been causing a huge decline in my mental health. I have brought this up once before when in a particularly bad argument with my Stepmom and Dad where they said that they would go to court to get me back and that ""The court can't keep you from us."". What would be the best course of action?"	Yes
182	So just as a warning this will be long, and details may slightly vary due to my mom being the one going through this. If a certain detail is pertinent though I can get the specifics from her.  We are located in Indiana.  My grandma is 90 years old.   My grandma got put in the nursing home around 6 months ago. She had broken her hip and needed rehab.  She is till there because she can't go to the bathroom by herself and sometimes she feels too weak to sit up in bed by herself. My mom stays there with her every other day (all day) and her sister stays on the other days. They do this because they say if you leave grandma alone she will try to get up by herself and re-break her hip (she has done this once before).    They are currently paying the nursing home $225 per day to keep her there. They looked into getting Medicaid and apparently you have to pay a lawyer $10,000 to represent you, it won't cover costs for another year (who knows if she'll make it that long), and once she did pass they would have to pay a certain % of the money back.  She has quite a large farm they had planned on selling (~$1,000,000 my mom thinks) but a lawyer told them if they sold it before she passed they would have to pay a large amount of taxes.   Grandma's savings has run out and my mom is trying to figure out how to pay for the nursing home bill. She is thinking of getting a loan, then paying it back after grandma passes once they sell the farm. However she is having a hard time finding someone to give them a large enough loan. So my questions are:  is this the right option?  Are there options out there we don't know about?  Was she given the correct info about Medicaid?  Tl;dr need advice on how to pay grandmas nursing home bill	Yes
183	"This is a complicated situation, but I'll try to be brief.   I'm 18. I come from a recently divorced family of seven children. I live with my dad, along with one sister, while my other family lives with my mother.  Most of the children who live with her are very little, the youngest three being ages 3, 5, and 7.  My fifteen year old brother is not very mentally stable. When my father comes over for visitation, he throws violent scenes and yells in front of the whole neighborhood. Just last week, my dad told me that he (literally, not a joke or exaggeration) started jumping on top of the hood of the car and started banging on the front window.  He has issues with anger. He's had a history of violence and troubles with both anger and empathy. He has been on medication, but has stopped taking it two months ago because he is paranoid that my father is ""using it to control him"" even though it's been prescribed by a psychiatrist. We can't force him to take it because he lives with his mother, who doesn't believe in medication for mental health. He's been through multiple therapists, and always ends up fighting with them or throwing a scene.  I've heard from my mother a few weeks ago that he's been collecting knives and storing them in his room.   I don't know what I can do. I don't feel good about him being around my younger siblings. But nothing has happened so far that would warrant legal action. My mother goes to work most nights and comes home at 7. Her father watches the children, but he is old, and can't speak English very well.   Is there anything I can do? There are long stretches of time where he is alone with the children, and I'm worried that there won't be anything I can do to put the children in a safer situation until after something's already happened. Because he hasn't done anything drastically illegal, and because he is still a minor and in my mother's care, there isn't anything I can do to distance him from them. He isn't getting the help he needs. I don't feel good about just sitting here waiting for something to happen. These are vulnerable, little children with a near-absent mother.  Other things my brother has done:  •poured water on my 13 year old brother in a restaurant (on two separate occasions) •pretended to be someone online for 2 years to my sister, and pretended to be her close friend. I found out when he bragged, ""I can't believe she's stupid enough to believe it after two years"".  When I told her, she cried for forty minutes.  •has been violent to me and my sister. •steals money and other belongings from family members •regularly gaslights, manipulates people. Once tried to ""teach"" me how to lie to our father. •emotionally antagonizes and berates my sister with BPD and anxiety. He targets her specifically. This is the same sister who he pretended to befriend online.  •tried to lie to the public school administration that he was being physically abused and neglected. •regularly throws fits in public. •I've seen him screaming at my younger (7 yr old) sister, calling her a ""retard"", and I've seen him manhandling the children when they're dropped off from visitation. •stalked a teacher from his middle school until he was given an unofficial restraining order from the school. He has a notice that if he is on the school grounds again, they will take legal action."	Yes
184	I'm sure there are a ton of posts like this on here but non of my searches turned up anything. So to start off with I reside in the state of Nevada. My SO and I are currently separated. I have moved out of our apartment and am currently in custody of our infant son my SO visits with him a couple times a week but is pushing for more visits. We are currently in marriage counseling but it is not going well and I am thinking of divorce. What would I be getting myself into as far as custody goes if we divorced and I sought sole custody? Is there such a thing as having majority custody of him? I would like to move with him out of state, would I be able to do that if we shared custody of him?	Yes
185	So my father has been in jail/prison for a while now, and my mother is a narcissistic bitch who blames any problem she has on him. I don’t want to visit him with her.   She says she doesn’t want me to go with anyone except her, so that’s a problem. It’s probably been almost 8 or 9 years  My question is, if I visit him with my grandparents (his side) and she somehow finds out, can they get in legal trouble for bringing me without asking her, since I am under 18  Also if he is located in a different state does that affect laws?	Yes
186	I want to make sure he doesn't kidnap our children or kill me. I only have joint money, no job but I need to leave for our safety.	Yes
187	Parents have been married 20-30 years. Combined income pre-divorce is in the 45,000 - 75,000 range.   Father has been unemployed for over a decade and is emotionally abusive. Father also suffers from a host of disorders such as multiple sclerosis and several mental disorders.   Mother is initiating the divorce. One house is fully paid off and in both parents' names, but the mother paid for over 99% of it. Bank accounts are in mother's name (I think), but one credit card lists both parents' names. Father uses this credit card to both buy food and support his hoarding disorder.   Mother wants to settle it peacefully (out of court) by selling the house and splitting the money in half or in the father's favor. Father wants alimony to cover medical expenses and lack of a job. However, father has not been going to a doctor (even at mother's plea) and uses his sickness as his reason for continued unemployment.  Mother is currently seeing a lawyer, but I'm curious as to what you all think would happen. Is there any way she can avoid having to pay the alimony for an abusive POS?	Yes
188	"Sadly, my fiance and I of 10 years are getting separated. We have a wonderful 6 year old child and have owned a home together for 2 years. Due to her infidelity, staying together is no longer an option in our lives. We purchased a home in 2015 for approx. $275,000. The home is in a good neighborhood and the value has raised since the purchase. I believe it is now worth near $400,000 due to the crazy housing market of our city. Her wonderful father helped us out greatly in acquiring our home. He gave us $10,000 for a down payment and co-singed on the mortgage as well. He hasn't helped in any other way financially. We both appreciate everything he has done for us.  We both pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. Her and I have always split bills 50/50. I have 2 utilities in my name, she has 2 in hers. She generally handles the finances so the mortgage payment to the bank comes from her checking account. I pay her in cash every month for my share of the mortgage and we split all other things right down the middle. I would like to hope we both remain civil in this process, but there is no telling what will happen in the future.   What are my options? I love living here, and I would hate to lose my house that I have worked so hard for. I kind of feel she is the one who should move out do to her infidelity, but that means little in court. I have very little money in the bank, and very few assets. What will happen if we decide to sell it? What will happen if we can not agree on who gets to remain living here? What if we decide to remain ""business partners"" and keep the house and rent it out? I am lost and confused and don't know my rights. Any advice would be much appreciated."	Yes
189	I need some help with my abusive family and have no idea where to start on my massive list of questions, problems and concerns.  A little about me: I'm 16 and live on a small farm in Alaska, I immigrated to the US with my mother when I was 6 and have been here ever since.  My mother re-married someone in the US but my legal and biological father is in Europe. And my moms husband has not adopted me legally. I get verbally abused everyday and physically at least once a week. I have no real bruises I can show to prove of the physical abuse as it mostly consists  of pinning me to the floor and choking me while yelling at me about how worthless I am.  They are very far-right so any physiatrists or any mental health checkups are out of the question as last time I asked I was grounded for a week.  Here is my list of questions and concerns.  1. All I have is a green card and I'm not legally adopted by my father so I don't know if I will be deported back to Ukraine to my bio father who I haven't spoken to in 10 years if I run away.   2. I've heard of some law regarding living in the US and at a certain age being automatically legible for citizenship.   3. They force me to work at a small gift shop they run for no pay and without a work permit, which I know is illegal as they are not present with me at the shop and I work up to 60hrs a week.  4. I have a medium size dog who is the only reason I'm still alive as I got him during a very suicidal period in my life. If I loose him I will most likely fall right back into that pit. So I will need some suggestions about keeping him with me.  5. They homeschool me so I have very few friends and no access to a school counselor of any kind.   6. I have not penny to my name.   The only thing that's been holding me back from going to the police is my lack of knowledge about the US immigration system and my precious dog.   Please advise me as to what I should do to get out of this nightmare. Thanks :)	Yes
190	Keeping things somewhat obfuscated for safety, if you need finer details, please PM me.  This happened in upstate SC. I am now in FL.  About 4 years ago, I offered to open up my house out of the kindness of my heart to my best friend and their spouse, who have a child. The next several months after that, it became very apparent that there were things I wasn't aware of. My friend's spouse was very abusive towards my friend, mostly verbally. I found out that my friend had been raped by the spouse as well. I confronted my friend about it after witnessing abuse towards the child too, and finally my friend recognized the need to end the relationship and demand a divorce. We filed to have the spouse evicted. My friend did not leave as they did not have anywhere to go.  My friend refused to pursue charges, mostly out of fear of things not going well, potentially some Stockholm Syndrome or something going on. The spouse accused us of cheating, openly vilified myself and my friend, and claimed to be innocent of what we witnessed.  No formal divorce or custody agreement ever entered in due to the previously mentioned fears.  There was peace some time after the split. The spouse seemed to be stabilizing. There was an agreement to allow visitation. The spouse however not only has a child with another person now, but has also kidnapped my friend's child as well, and has made wild baseless accusations.  I have been asked to submit an affidavit to what I witnessed. I am concerned that if my involvement comes forward, that the target will be drawn to me and I may have false allegations filed against me, forcing me to return back to SC, which could potentially have a number of consequences for me outside of legal. However, if I don't submit my affidavit, it could potentially weaken or ruin my friend's case and the chances of my friend's child being returned to the parent who is actually a capable parent.	Yes
191	Hello, first time posting here.   I have a 5yo child whose father has never been in her life. He wasn't even there for the pregnancy because he never cared for the child, nor did I want him there because he honestly scares me.  A few months prior to her first birthday, I met a wonderful man who has since then raised her as his own. This man is now my husband as of 6 months ago, and he would love for my daughter to have his last name. However, I fear I would have to get into contact with her bio father for this, which I'm dead set against. Her last name on her birth certificate is my own as, like I said, he has not been present AT ALL since before her birth.   Do I need to contact him for this? Has he lost his rights? Advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
192	I found that my child is not my child, the mother and I got married because I thought he was mine, she told me she slept with another guy, but he was sterile. Well 9 months after the baby was born, he doesn't look like me, we're fighting, I take the DNA test, and before I get the results back she moves in with her parents and takes all his things. Turns out he's not mine, we're filing for a divorce based on results of thepaternity, but what do I do to get off the birth certificate. I've called vital records and resources and they say they need a court order to get me off. Is that the same thing I am getting with the divorce? Do i tie it all into the same court case? What do I do? I don't want to pay child support for a kid who is not mine. Also, I know the other guy's name, and where he lives.She doesn't want him to get involved, but I don't want to pay for this kid.	Yes
193	My sister's dad has had custody of her for her entire life, with my mom only having visitation. My sister just turned 18 and has a year of school left. She has moved out of her dad's house and is now living with our mother. We took her to her old school today to withdraw her and get her records sent to the school in our district, but the guidance counselor told us that since she's still in school, the custody agreement is still in place which means she can't withdraw herself or transfer herself, 18 or no. Her dad's cooperation is not an option. Are we going to have to go through the emancipation process with her?	Yes
194	"Location is Quebec, Canada  I've been living with my girlfriend for a little over a year. According to Quebec laws, that would make us common-law partners. However, my ""official"" address is still with my parents.  I want to add her to my employer's insurance policy as a common-law partner, but I also don't want to commit fraud...  What's the situation? Would I be in trouble if I added her? Are we common-law partners? If I change my address in the following days, would I have to wait a year for us to be?  Here's the relevant condition for common-law partnership according to the CRA:  &gt;has been living with you in a conjugal relationship, and this current relationship has lasted at least 12 continuous months;  Thanks"	Yes
195	My ex-wife made a gofundme fundraiser(?) claiming our son is autistic, which he is not. Is this a basis for me to get custody?  This isn't her first venture into questionable ethics to garner sympathy or make money. What legal actions can I take?	Yes
196	My (now ex)gf assaulted me in our shared apartment in nyc. I recorded it on my iPhone. Are there any laws in New York State preventing me from using it?	Yes
197	I tried searching online, but couldn't find any answers. My [23f] cousin [16f] is about to get her first job. She's already told me her mom has said she will get $20 a month to do what she wants with. The rest of the money will be put into an account only her mother has access to. Her mom is in a lot of debt and did the same thing with her older child. She does not spend the money on bills, she goes out to eat, gets new pets, and always has a different car. My cousin doesn't want her mother anywhere near her hard earned money.   Am I able to set up a bank account for my cousin? It would be only her work checks (and any babysitting money) put into the account. I would have access, but I have no intention of using her money. Is there a way where only she could have access?   Am I opening myself up to legal trouble by interfering with my aunts plans for the money?  I'm also looking into the possibility of her moving in with me due to family issues (specifically her mom), and I don't want to look bad in the eyes of the law when I just want to help her.   Thanks for any advice you have, I really appreciate it.	Yes
198	I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I wanted to get some additional info to look into about how to handle my current situation.  I live in Louisiana, if that makes a difference.  So, my mom's power of attorney is spending copious amount of money on herself and has had my mom put her second house in her name. I also know she's opened up several CD accounts, POD.  She also verbally and emotionally abuses my mom.  I was taking care of mom for 3 years, one of which was after mom's POA had been appointed, because she always had an excuse not to come down and do her job as caregiver, and I didn't wanna leave mom alone when she needed 24/7 supervision, and no one else in the family wamted to help, they would just shame me for wanting a break and saw that as me not caring about mom, even though they themselves did little to nothing to help.  So I have 2 questions:  1) Can a POA spend money on themselves? Would I be able to stop this POA from taking advantage of my mom just by having APS or legal aid investigate her paper trail? (They would not be disappointed if she is not allowed to spend money on herself- credit card bill has gone up from $2k/month when i was taking care of her, to $4k- $5k per month alone.... and all purchases are recorded by the credit card company, so thibgs like handbags, clothes, beauty products, a fuckton of junk food, hubdreds of dollars worth of food in general, whereas she took cobtrol of finances from a different city with her POA and would only send us $300 for the 2 of us to eat and get around per month, and even when she was out of state there were hundreds more than that spent on food, and she was living by herself across the state.... used mom's money to pay movers to move in, mom's money for the notary to get house transferred to her name, to be filed upon death, etc, etc.)  2) How can I protect myself from having the tables turned on me if I take mom's current POA to court? Because POA would definitely try to do this, as she has already projected all of her misgivings onto me to avoid responsibility for her actions and to threaten/shame/gaslight me into not holding her accountable... To elaborate:  Back when I was 18 (am now 21), the only option I thought I had to take care of mom's finances was to do stuff for her- including using her card for purchases and forging her signature for checks. It was mostly the essentials, but she was still of sound mind at first, and she would agree to give me living expenses, and also paid for me to go to driving school for practical reasons, as well as college, because neither of us knew my college fund information yet so I couldn't tap into that for college. I would also buy us, sometimes just me, fast food occasionally, always with permission.  As her Alzheimer's got worse, I saw that she didn't know what she was agreeing to anymore and stopped spending more than the bare essentials on myself, as I was living in-home with her and we both needed to eat and have gas, but that's all I'd spend money on in order to not take advantage. I'm worried, because it took me a while to learn how to budget and curb fast food impulses so there is a bit of money wasted on that while I learned how to grow the fuck up.  I'm worried this'll come back to bite me in the ass, even though she knew what she agree to pay for at the time.... but it's still he said she said and fact is that I used someone else's card at odd hours of the night occasionally until I started getting my health in check, losing weight, and working out for both our sakes(needed the energy).  I'm still going to pursue legal action, I just want to know everyone's thoughts on the steps I can take to protect my mom and myself, because the last thing I want is for mom to be at POA's mercy without even me as a buffer if POA manages to send me to jail or something...	Yes
199	"My summary is long but my general questions are what constitutes harassment and/or annoyance when a divorce degree is in place but you share a child and are still required to communicate? As well as what actions can I take in such cases?  Here's my summary as I'd like to know if this is harassment and/or annoyance. I live in Ohio. I have full custody of my child. My ex husband has a set visitation schedule within our divorce decree unless ""the parties do not agree otherwise"". We agreed a month ago in text messages to a small one day change in the schedule. I stated ""My birthday falls on your Friday on [my birth date]. As I allotted you to pick her up at 10 am for your birthday (not to affect any type of visitation or vacation time) I'd also like to be able to pick her up for my birthday at 10 am on [my birth date] for my birthday. "" Text in parenthesis was included. He agreed via text message. This Thursday almost a month later he came to pick our child up and requested that he be able to pick her up another day to make up for me getting her on my birthday as he doesn't want to lose time with her. Where as he's not losing time with her as his birthday fell on my visitation day and mine on his. We also ""otherwise agreed"" to a one day change a month ago. A month's notice was given and my intent was also that if he didn't agree that I could request to use a ""vacation"" day which our decree states has to be made 30 days prior. I declined his request. He asked me two more times in person. One of which I stated he's not lost any time as I gave him my time on his birthday. He then proceeds to text me this Saturday again requesting to get her another day to make up for his lost day. I again state that he's not lost any time and refer back to his birthday. I question him as to why he seems to think his time with her is more valuable than me. He denies he feels that way. The proceeds to question me as to why I'm making such a big deal and that he'd have agreed to switching days for his birthday which he had contacted me requesting to have her for if if of asked. To which I responded stating again that I already have him my answer. He then responds saying I'm being spiteful and do not have the best interest of our child at heart. Then threats that he will take me back to court since I' not being ""friendly"" (imply that if I do not comply to him he will take me back to court.) He claims that I am doing this only out of spite and I lack care for my daughter and her feelings. He made the remark that everytime our three year old daughter goes to his house she claims to want to stay with him. (Which she also tells me she wants to stay with me.) He also then proceeds to say that our decree does not state anything about either of us getting her for our birthday. Then threatens me again that if I do not agree to him picking her up on his demanded day that he will not allow for me to pick her up for our agreed upon schedule change that happened a month ago. I reminded him that he agreed to the adjustment and also remind him that he had just stated that he'd of been fine with switching days for his birthday that had fallen on my time and that I was now requesting such. He then asked me to prove where he agreed to losing a day. Claiming he never did and that he has done nothing but request the day he's now demanding. He continued to again exclaiming he is not trying to argue that he just does not want to lose time with her. Again questioning as to why I'm making such a big deal about it. I state that he said nothing about wanting to make the day up during our text agreement a month prior. Reiterating again that I'm only making up for my missed time with her from his birthday. I also state that I now have texts of his saying he'd of been fine with me requesting the times being switched to accommodate for his birthday. Yet when I request such he is threatening me and calling me spiteful. I screenshot and circled the text messages from a month prior and send them to him as requested. He exclaims that I act like I am so high and mighty like i have all the power in the world. Saying that in reality I don't know how to put my daughter's feelings first and that I only care about myself and everything in my best interest. He throws out again something from our divorce decree that we are supposed to work together for the best interest of our daughter. But that i only care about my best interest and only want to hurt him. He says whatever and that he wont bring it up again. My response was  ""Where was this best interest and working together for our daughter as well as her happiness that you keep speaking of when you were upset that her birthday fell on my visitation and I asked if you, your family, as well as your girlfriend would like to come to her birthday party the day of her birthday? Yet you gave me no response nor did you show up for her birthday. Not even a phone call. Yet I made that about myself? Did i also make it about myself when your mom picked her up on my time for [our daughters cousin's] birthday? Or how about when you asked to take her to the zoo and my plans had fallen through and I allowed you to take her on my time to the zoo ie: Chucky cheese? Or when I switched the schedule around for you because of your work schedule? Don't flatter yourself."" To which he never responded. This is the second time I've ever asked for anything. The first time was for our daughters mom and me dance recital that fell on his weekend. He initially refused my months notice to switch the schedule around but did finally come around after ignoring me and refusing to respond until he had something to use as leverage ie: fathers day when he again requested more of my time rather than allowing me to pick her up at the time the divorce decree calls for.  Does this constitute harassment? Does this break our divorve decree agreement to not annoy or harass the other party? At what point do his threats constitute harassment? Especially his exclamation that if i don't agree to his request that he'll keep our child from me on our priorly agreed upon schedule adjustment?"	Yes
200	My mother is terminal and has drafted up a will leaving me all of her money and future money she hopes to receive from a malpractice lawsuit.  However she has a husband who has been a piece of shit in a lot of ways.  She cannot divorce him because she needs him as a caretaker for the rest of her time, but she doens't plan on leaving him any money.   However, I've been informed that he is by law entitled to a third of her estate regardless of what her will says. I looked it up and it seems to be the case.  Is this true or is it more complicated than that?	Yes
201	The situation has escalated, these are the facts: - huge change in behavior - making grandiose claims - completely withdrawn from family, which is highly against their character  Essentially for almost the past year they have changed drastically.  They have a mental disorder (perhaps bipolar, they won't share their diagnosis but the behavior seems to line up with a manic episode).  Most of the family hasn't seen her in almost a year, one member saw her 3 months ago and was disturbed by their behavior.  Recently it came to light that they had sent a message to another family member speaking like they won't be here much longer, and apologizing for past misdeeds.  Both red flags for suicide.  Their spouse claims this individual is the happiest, most energetic they have ever been and to leave them alone.  When asking to visit or just talk this individual becomes irritable and hostile.  The parents just want them evaluated, if they see nothing dangerous/wrong with them we would all be ecstatic.  On the flip side, they could receive the help the they need.  I am concerned that because they haven't outright said they are going to harm themselves a police wellness check will not be successful.  Is there a legal procedure that allows their parents to force a psych eval?   Thank you for any and all input.	Yes
202	(California) My father was suddenly hit with a brain aneurysm 2 weeks ago and did not survive over the course of the next 10 days. He was transported in an ambulance and then airlifted to a hospital with an available neurosurgeon. My mom and I are expecting a 200k+ bill and afraid of what comes next. My father was a simple man. No assets (other than a used car/rents an apartment) and no debts whatsoever. Would my mom be legally responsible for his medical bills? Could not find any information similar to this situation so TIA.	Yes
203	Hi guys. Throwing away since ex is on Reddit. Thanks for reading.   I [30M] facing a situation where the [29f] mother of my son  (never married) and I are parting ways in the next month. We have verbally agreed on 50/50 custody and would like to avoid any court battle if necessary when it comes to splitting my son's expenses going forward.   I first want to understand what I should be doing on my end / what my options are as a father to try and get us to create a legal document that will end with us splitting any costs for my son (either 50/50 or according to income) as they come up (medical, daycare, etc).  There is, however, one hiccup. My ex-girlfriend is heavily set on a need for child support and gets aggressively angry at the prospect of splitting costs. I am so against this since medical, dental, and day care are all in my name and paid by me at this point. It would make no sense for me to pay her child support for her to turn around and give it back for me to pay these shared expenses.   I realize the alternative is going to court and potentially paying a lot more or, god forbid losing 50/50 custody. So what should I prepare and get in writing? How careful should I be to get our communication in writing? And, if you can spare it, how do I sell this to her/compromise fairly for the sake of avoiding court.  TLDR: EX and I are splitting. We both want to avoid court, but she wants child support and I want to split shared expenses as they come. How do we come to an agreement and what needs to be done to make that agreement legal and binding?	Yes
204	So a friend of mine is having some issues with the father of her child. The child is currently with the father's grandparents and the mother would like to pick the child back up. Father wants the grandparents to get some time with the child. Without a custody agreement in place, can the mother legally take the child back? How would she go about this?	Yes
205	Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.  I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.  Thank you all so much for your support, I am completely shocked right now	Yes
206	Hello everyone.  I was divorced about 3 years ago and was awarded primary custody of two boys (11, 10).  During my initial court case the judge awarded me a very small amount of child support (less than 12% of his income for two children).  I recently received a letter from the state asking if I would like it to be reevaluated and I had them do it.  The judge changed his payment to $625 per month.  That was in February.  Since then my ex-husband keeps changing jobs, going on unemployment, etc.  I received a payment today of $69.00.  When I followed up with the agency they told me he was on unemployment but I know he has a job (he is late to pick up the boys every time because of it).  What can I do?  He owes me well over $3,000 and I am having a hard time keeping up with my bills.  I feel like he is doing this on purpose just to make my life difficult.  Is there any action I can take to get him to pay the money he owes his children?	Yes
207	Hi there, I am 14 years old, the son of recently divorced parents who have not made/filed official custody order. My dad left for a business trip this morning, and will return in three days. (I was staying with him last, obviously.)  My mom is pushing me to go to her place tonight, telling me that asking to stay here for three days is like asking for a yard when she gave me an inch. She says that I because I'm not 18, I have to follow her instructions.   Since there's no custody case, and my dad is out of town, what can I do? I have enough money to get meals for these next three days, and I want to stay at my dad's. He is okay with it, so long as I keep the house clean. If it helps at all, my mom is a pretty horrible mom, just look at my post history and you'll see. She said she's going to pick me up in an hour, so I need advice quick please!	Yes
208	We live in North Dakota. My mother has been married for about two years. Shortly after marriage he starting showing his true personality. In any event, they've decided to get a divorce.   My mother doesn't make much money and definitely not enough to consult with an attorney. Since they've been married they bought a house (down payment from his retirement money), which he took out a second mortgage out on to pay off his credit card debt. My mother has about 10k in medical bills which they didn't touch. He now says he has someone coming buy to look at the house and try to sell it. She'd ideally like to keep the house.   He also helped buy her a car but they never transferred it into her name and he's threatening to take it away from her.   His exact finances aren't known as he won't share them.  What is the best course of action going forward?	Yes
209	Please point me elsewhere if there is a better place for this question. My girlfriend was adopted shortly after her birth in late 1994. Her adoptive mother is very defensive about any questions she asks about her birth/adoption and as a result my gf doesn't even know where she was born, although so carolina is most likely.   Are there any resources I could be directed to that could help determine her history without having to go through her parents?	Yes
210	My parents and I have a rocky relationship. I live with them. I was recently gifted $10,000 by grandmother, and they told me to give it to them so that they could keep it in the bank for safekeeping. They told me that I would be able to use it whenever with no questions asked. Now, they refuse to let me use a single cent of it saying that it's theirs and that since they're paying for my college and letting me live under their roof, I don't need it. They have had the money to pay for college before the $10,000 because we are decently well off, and it's obvious that they just refuse to give it to me. If I ask for it, they say that they don't have to pay for my college, my phone, or let me live under their house. What can I do to get my money back if I can even do anything?	Yes
211	I'm an E3 in the Navy stationed on Naval Base Ventura County in California. I'm going through a divorce with my ex at the moment and we've agreed on all the terms and all the paperwork is filed.  We're still legally married until October 26, 2017, because of California's 6 month waiting period. The problem is one of our terms is that she would take half of the credit card debt, which is in both of our names, and I would take the other half, and she has yet to make any attempts at going to the bank to take her half or to even pay me back for the past couple months where I've been the only one making payments on it.   We're still legally married, but I was wondering if I could possibly have the start of a case against her? Could I sue her now? Or do I have to wait till we're legally divorced for all of our agreements to be put into place? We filed all of the paperwork back in April. I hope the information I've provided is enough to get good answers, I'll provide more if you need more details. Thank you for your help.	Yes
212	"Specifics of the situation:  Friend (we'll call her Stacy), is married to Adam (we will call him that for privacy purposes). Stacy and Adam have been (happily, for the most part) married for 5 years, and share ownership of most things they own, such as the house they own together. Adam has 2 teenagers that he had with his first wife, and Stacy has a 7 year old daughter that she had with her first husband. Adam had gone to Saudi Arabia for his job, and decided to cut off all communication to see who would try to get in contact with him.  Originally, this seemed like a screwed-up social experiment. Had Adam called Stacy and said: ""hey, you been goofed!"" It would have been fine. After the social experiment had ended, he still kept communications with the teenagers. After a few days, the teenagers took everything from the house, including the safe with the deed (which has Stacy and Adam's names on it) and left.   The teenagers are God knows where, Adam is still in Saudi Arabia lawyering up for what looks to be a divorce? But Stacy doesn't know what to do, since Adam hasn't paid any bills since they've been together and she has provided for the family since day 1. She wants to go to a help center that can provide her with a lawyer for family law, since she doesn't have the money to afford a lawyer.  Also, a lot of evidence has been found on the phones that the teenagers left, and the family computer that shows communication, meditation, and intent between the teenagers and Adam. They had been planning to take the stuff and leave as soon as they could. They left the cars and the phones because the ownership was in Stacy's name.  Is the lawyer from the help center Stacy's best and only option if she cannot afford anything else? Are there any other steps she can take to potentially start a new life with her young daughter? Stacy still has to pay for mortgage, car payments, etc, all by herself. Is this abandonment, and if so, how can she legally, and financially recover from this?"	Yes
213	Hi, I'm hoping to change my legal name and I currently live in New York. For various reasons, I do not want to publish my name change in a newspaper (which NY requires).   Is it possible to change your name in a state you don't live in?   For example, the state I resided in for 15 years does not require a publication of name change, and I'd prefer to complete the name change there if possible. I haven't lived in this state for several years, though I visit often and have family there.   Thank you all for your time.	Yes
214	I about to start process of trying to get custody of my child. I've never had a lawyer before, but I always hear they're expensive. My job has a work life program that connects you with a lawyer, gives you a free 60 minute first meeting, and then gives you 25% off their normal rate if you choose to hire them.  I've talked to a few lawyers through this program and their rates all hit around the $210-$225 range after the discount. They all request retainers.  There is one big difference between two of the lawyers. I asked them how much of a retainer will I need to get me to the point just before a court hearing... One lawyer told me $1000 and the other told me $2000.  Is $2000 too much? ...or is that common? I do understand that this can be a lengthy process and that once reaching court, it can get pretty expensive. I just want to make sure this is a fair rate.  I was originally working with the $1000 lawyer, until their communication got spotty and he didn't reply to my email. This lead me to the $2000 lawyer, who I've met with twice and seems a bit more invested in my case.  The $2000 lawyer had a few super minor qualities that raised my eye brow. We met half way a little after hours between my job and his office at a McDonald's. He was dressed in a t-shirt with a hole in it and jeans. He also took a call during our meeting. Maybe I'm reading too much into these things.   Any advice?	Yes
215	Hey not-lawyers,  My parents have been separated for around twenty years now, but never got legally divorced. For some of that time, they co-parented me under one roof. A few years back, my mother moved across the states to Michigan to live with a new partner, and my dad remained in CA. They'd talked back and forth about divorcing a few times, but it never went anywhere. My dad is under the impression that without my mother's full cooperation, there's no way to divorce her. The thing is, my mother isn't *against* the divorce - just way too dysfunctional to do any of the paperwork, and she doesn't seem to care whether it happens.  Obviously, this is not ideal. I'm concerned that if my father passed away unexpectedly, everything he owns might go directly to her, and that if the reverse happened he might continue to be liable for her debts in some way (she has loads). Does anyone know what kind of options he might have to get the process started on his own, and what might it be like?	Yes
216	My husband and I are splitting up and we are in a disagreement over the division of assets.    I am buying him out of the mortgage and the kids will be living with me full time - at this point he won't have over night access.    My two questions are:   1) is he entitled to half of the children's furniture, toys etc  2) the appliances were included with the purchase of the house, is he entitled to half of them since I am buying the house from him?   Unfortunately things are not going very smoothly and things have escalated in his behaviour to where Women in Crisis and Children's Aid are involved. I don't want to provoke him to more anger but I also want what is fair.    My worker for WIC said that I was being more than generous in what I was prepared to give and my ex  thinks I am being unreasonable. I honestly want what's fair.	Yes
217	(Ontario-Family law) Childs father lives out of province and hasnt seen child for almost 4 years( child was only 15months old when he last seen her and shes 5 now). Well after 3 long years of court they ruled in my favor for child support and now he wants access. Do i have to give him access? Does he have a chance of winning if we go for a custody battle?	Yes
218	"Long story short but I video taped my wife and I having sex and sent it to her via Facebook messengers secret conversation. The video was 15 seconds long and she now claims that she was not a willing participant in the taping. Felony charges have been filled but I haven't actually been charged or arrested yet. I should know more in the next day or so. Needless to say I have an appointment with a divorce attorney first thing tomorrow morning. What are the chances that I will be charged and convicted of this and what does my sentence look like? I have no proof that she was a willing participant and there are plenty of texts saying ""I'm sorry. I thought you knew"" so it looks really bad on me.   I'm sure to be a nervous wreck over the next couple of days."	Yes
219	Divorce with the ex was final almost two years ago, but there is no official custody agreement as I filed in Colorado, and she and daughter live in Massachusetts. Fiance and I have agreed that we want to try to get custody (we will be married soon, that should help). Daughter has said that she wants to live with us. What steps do we need to take? Should we get a family law attorney in Massachusetts, since that is where she currently lives? Any idea how much something like that would cost? Totally out of my wheelhouse with this so any advice is appreciated.	Yes
220	My wife came to the US 2 years ago on a K1 visa. We got married soon after and obviously changed her name. Her married name is on her green card but her maiden name is on her Brazilian passport. Now she's going back to Brazil for a visit and I'm confused about which name to put on the plane tickets. I'm assuming she'll need to bring our marriage certificate for proof either way but does it matter which name I put on the tickets?	Yes
221	"Throwaway for (as much) anonymity (as is possible in this day and age).  I gave birth to my son in 2015 in Arizona (Maricopa County). At the time of his birth, my wife and I were legally married. The birth certificate forms only contain spots for mother and father. AZ law requires a birth mother's legal spouse to be on the certificate as the baby's father so my wife is listed as his father. So far, we have had no issues with any public or private agency recognizing her as our son's parent. From research I did before he was born, we were expecting to have to do a ""second parent adoption"" in order for my wife to be his equal legal parent. However, due to the Obergefell decision and presumptive paternity, we did not do so. I would like to know if it is recommended that we go through with this adoption now.  I have 3 main concerns with going through with this process right now.  1. We can't easily afford it. Hiring a lawyer would drain our savings of our often needed emergency fund. 2. There are 2 court cases in AZ courts right now that could resolve this issue in either direction. [A case started in 2016](http://apps.supremecourt.az.gov/aacc/appella/ASC/CV/CV160266.PDF) that ruled in favor of a lesbian partner having equal parental rights. [The most recent one](http://apps.supremecourt.az.gov/aacc/appella/1CA/SA/SA170028.PDF), however, ruled against the presumptive father rights applying to lesbian parents due to gendered language in the law. This ruling is what prompted this post. The 2016 case is headed to the supreme court and if it is upheld, will overturn the recent case. These cases should be resolved by the end of the year but it looks like it will be 50/50 whether the resolution forces us into the adoption route anyway. 3. As far as I have read, you normally need to sever the original parent's rights. The only original parents my son has is the two of us. As far as his donor, we used a known donor who chooses to remain anonymous in all ways. This donor coming forward to get rights, and then sever them, is totally out of the question. I don't even know how to contact him. Will this be a problem?  Thank you for any and all advice, and thank you for reading."	Yes
222	So we are both early middle age, and overall I see this as great news since I can afford it, and probably wont have kids another way.  She has a lot of family help available and both of us have family roots keeping us in the area.  We want to coparent.  Mostly, my question is: am I foregoing any rights by not  lawyering up at the moment?  So far, it has been amicable and I would like to keep it that way.  What should I consider in terms of legal options?	Yes
223	I'm about to get married. My dad just went through a really rough (second) divorce. I don't have the whole picture, but from what I gather, they each spent around $50k+ on lawyers to fight over maybe $500k in retirement savings and home equity. This sounds like an absolute nightmare and a total waste of money.  My fiance and I are both 25 and just starting out our careers. Neither of us have anything worth fighting over in terms of existing assets/savings so I wasn't planning on any sort of prenup. But, ideally in 5+ years we would have plenty to fight over, and that is what I'm worried about.   Is there any sort of prenup to make sure we don't both blow a ton of money on lawyers if we ever do get divorced? A sort of civil agreement that would benefit everyone involved? Should I bother bringing it up to her?	Yes
224	Just curious I am a step parent and father has already refused to give up parental rights.  How do I go about gaining legal rights for my daughter without adoption since he refuses to give up his rights? Dad has not been in her life at all and I have had custody the last 5 years. He lives in another state and was abusive towards the mother even though there is no legal evidence of the abuse.  We are also looking into child support but me being a step parent I support and pay for everything including insurance. Is my income and my support taken into account in court? Or just the biological parent?	Yes
225	I have an ex-fiance who is pregnant and want to get some advice as what to do. I want to get as much custody as possible while giving her as little as possible. Just like she will do to me. There is a story to this and it is a good one and a ride for sure. Please pm me if you are interested in helping.	Yes
226	First off let me state, me and my ex have a pretty good relationship, except shes very controlling and wants her way. Besides that she's an amazing mother and friend.  We're in the process of divorce and she keeps saying that she wants sole legal custody so she can make sure peyton attends the right schools and isn't raised into religion (family drama caused yhay issue)   So at first i agreed, nothing is finalized but after talking to a family friend who is works in a law firm she told me it was a terrible idea because I'd be essential giving up all rights as a father.   I love being a father and I don't want to give up my rights, but I'm extremely confused..  Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
227	I (31f) and my boyfriend (29m) are very concerned over my niece and nephew's well being. Their father (33m) is a heroin addict who is in and out of rehab consistently - was just kicked out of the last one and is not able to pay for rent or food (refuses to go to a food bank). He quit his part time job and is solely relying on his SSDI to pay the bills. He has an untreated mental illness and refuses to seek any therapeutic treatment other than antidepressants. If the situation arises where he returns to drug use and cannot feed nor house his children - I am planning to sue for guardianship/custody and move them to VA where we both work. I make close to 6 figures and can afford the childcare and additional expenses.   I have kicked the can far enough down the road due to his lying and manipulation - but those kids deserve a better life. DCYF already visited his home and did nothing about it. My parents (mid 60s) are only capable of caring for them for a short time - any longer than a few months would likely overwhelm them with stress. In addition to that, they do not speak the same language (grandparents are Deaf).   What can I expect from this process? I already have a referral for a lawyer in NH, but do I also need one in VA?  What is the best way to go about this process?  Thanks in advance for any tips or methods to help the kids out.	Yes
228	Title pretty much says it all.  I was born in Florida.  My mother placed her husband at the time as my father.  After 40 years I found out my father was not my bio father.  I have since located my bio father, completed the DNA testing and I'd like have my birth record reflect him.    Can this be done?    Thanks in advance for your help.	Yes
229	Hey everyone, hoping the title wasn't misleading or something. Im new to reddit btw! :0 Anyways, by the way my knowledge legally speaking is very amateur so please see where I'm coming from here! my wording might not be the best. Emma give this a shot and keep it very brief I am aware of the premise of emancipation in America, when someone comes of age to basically legally sever themselves from their parents or guardians. I was wondering if there is anything like this in Korea? My girlfriend is Korean and is wondering, for her own personal reasons. Ive done what research I can, but I end up stumbling into complexly worded and misguiding articles, blogs etc. Someone help me out here, i would love and appreciate any and all advice. Thank you !!  PS.Am I even posting this in the right sub? If you guys know of anywhere else I could post this question let me know!	Yes
230	My husband is a heroin addict and we are involved with CPS. He's been to detox and rehab many times and nothing is helping. While he was trying to get his medical marijuana card, I helped him fake urine analysis so he could smoke for his mental stability while he was clean from heroin. Obviously, that was stupid but I was in such a deep hole of depression I thought it would help him. I let him drive my son down the road once because I would have lost my job if I didn't show up on time that day, but his license is suspended. I fucked up and shouldn't have from the start.  Now, he's been taking my car everyday and I can't get to work (only income is my job) or get my son to a sitter. He doesn't pick me up from work and is gone for 8-12 hours. His use isn't getting any better. Every time I try to kick him out when he comes back, or tell him he can't take the car, he threatens to hurt me and then tells me if I call the cops or throw him out or not let him take the car, he will tell his attorney everything I did to help him and make sure that my son gets taken away from not only himself, but me as well. Can he do that? Or am I just being held hostage in my house fearing the worst when I could actually be doing something about it and still be able to take care of my son?  I don't know what to do at this point and I'm waiting on my attorney to call me back while I type this. Should I tell her that I helped him? I'm so scared he'll hurt me, he literally just ripped off a kitchen cabinet because I said I wanted to take out the trash first. I started crying and he mocked me and got in my face and I'm just so worn down I don't know what to do. I want my son safe, but I want it to be with me. I pay all the bills and I don't want to leave and lose my job, Ive had it for 7 years.	Yes
231	Sorry in advance for the length. I live in CT, fyi.  Seven years ago my then-wife and I bought a condo. It was put in her name but everything including the down payment was split down the middle. We divorced four years later in July 2015 (without lawyers) and we agreed that I would continue living there since she could move in with her mom rent-free. The divorce decree said I would continue paying half the mortgage until it sold and at that point we'd split the money we made (if any). I wanted to cut my losses and walk away since the condo isn't tied to me at all, but she refused to sign the papers unless I agreed to continue paying half the mortgage until it sold.  She said it'd go on the market as soon as it was show-ready. I gave it a good cleaning and bought some nice decorations and new couches for staging. it looked better than when we bought it. She said then it'd go on the market in the spring because that's when most people look for new homes. That never happened. A year ago we agreed that my new girlfriend could move in and take over paying half the mortgage until it sold. So, at that point my ex wasn't paying anything except property tax. After several months it still wasn't on the market. I told her it needed to be put on the market and sold ASAP so we both could move on with our lives. She said she met with a real estate agent friend and the condo is now worth a hell of a lot less than what we paid for it. She said we'd have to keep paying the mortgage for 3 more years until we sell it to break even.  This is unacceptable. It's been 2 years since the divorce and we've made no progress. I desperately want to move and be done with my ex once and for all, but because of our divorce agreement I feel stuck. Moving and taking on a second mortgage/rent is not a possibility -- I barely make enough to cover my bills as it is.  I'm planning on meeting with a lawyer soon to see what my options are, if I even have any. Before I do that, I'd like to hear what /r/legaladvice has to say. Would it be possible to take her back to court and have the divorce agreement revised? I want nothing more than to walk away from this damn condo and create a new life with my girlfriend.  *tl;dr: I agreed to continue paying have the mortgage of a condo in my ex-wife's name. She is no longer paying her half of the mortgage as that's been taken over by my girlfriend. Ex expects me to continue paying for another 3 years so the condo will break even when it sells.*	Yes
232	(KS) I have moved out to an apartment. We have been fairly amicable to this point. She has decided that she wants to go ahead and file for divorce now. She lives with her parents. She pays no rent. I have a fairly new job after going to school for two years and I am still getting my financial stability under me. Her answer to the budget stated in the DRA is a hypothetical budget of what she'd spend IF/WHEN she moves into a new situation. The state of Kansas utilizes third party child support and the sooner we file, the sooner I get a massive payment that will be tough to handle as of now. Any suggestions to what I can do to postpone filing or payments? I can try and clarify with any questions. We have been married eight years and have one child. Thank you for your time.	Yes
233	"I live in Sacramento California. I am a single father and have full custody of my 7 yo daughter. The court order states that my ex can only see our daughter under supervised visitation, which she does twice a week at my home.   However, I just discovered from the sac county website that she didn't show up for her sheriffs work project from her misdemeanor burglary conviction in 2016, as a result the courts issued a ""commitment warrant"" for 45 days (the time her sheriffs work project was supposed to be) and modified her work project to straight time in jail.   I want to know how i can tell if she has fulfilled her 45 day straight time conviction or if she has an outstanding warrant?  This could be an issue with the supervised visitations at my house. I went to the records office and they wouldn't tell me but there has to be an easy way to see if someone has warrants as I've seen officials announce warrants on tv.  Any help is necessary as I'm just concerned for my daughters safety."	Yes
234	I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	Yes
235	"Years ago, I made a dumb decision to get a dog with a college girlfriend. We split all of the initial costs.  Que a few weeks ago when I get served for possession over my dog. I show up on the court date, go to mediation and we agree on terms.  The terms were that I give her money for her initial costs and she keeps the dog for 10 days to say goodbye. She was supposed to meet up with me yesterday to exchange the dog and now refuses to talk to me, and I'm stuck communicating with her father as a middle man.   Between her not taking to me, her father beating around the bush and neither willing to give me the dog back, I am stuck out money and no dog.  Our mediation agreement states the following terms:  ""As of 7pm on 8/10/17 (other party) give up any claim to dog.""  ""At that time (Me) will take possession of dog in permanent basis""  ""If either party violates the agreement, other party will receive judgement.""  These were terms made in mediation. Both parties, the mediator and the judge signed the document.   We had a scheduled ""follow up"" court date for this coming up Monday which was meant for two reasons. One being that if either party violates agreement, and two if both parties follow through, we don't show up and the case is closed.  It seems pretty cut and dry to me that as long as I followed through with my part of the agreement, and because she is refusing to give the dog back that I would gain judgment in front of the judge.   This is the first time I'm going through my sort of legal case so I don't want to be naive or too confident, but looking at the agreement and terms, it seems like I will end up winning judgement."	Yes
236	My husband and I have been separated for over a year and living in different states. All finances are separate and neither relies on the other for any assistance. We have not even been in contact for over 6 months. I recently became pregnant from my boyfriend. I know my husband is the assumed father and I should put him on the birth certificate.   I have tried several times to get in contact with the husband to try and proceed with a divorce but he hasn't returned any texts or phone calls. I also know that he has moved at some point and I don't know his address or if he still works at the same job.   Could I just say that I am separated on any paper work and list my boyfriend as the father? I just want to do this with the smallest amount of stress and financial burden on myself and worried about legal fees adding up with having to try and track the husband down and having to do paternity tests.	Yes
237	My marriage was never registered in the US. If I want to get a divorce, can I just go through the religious process similar to how I was married, or do I need to go through the full legal divorce process of the state? Thanks you.	Yes
238	Last month I submitted a proposal to modify my child support. The child support was modified and I thought all was good. My ex wife said it was fair and was not fighting it. The letter I got said that no hearing is required unless one of the parties requests a hearing within 30 days of the notice and motion. I just got a summons to go to court next month over this. Why?	Yes
239	Hi! A little history, my parents divorced in high school and I am now in my thirties. Mom has no desire to find another partner, however my Dad has been married again, divorced, and then gotten back with the same woman again (after demolishing half of his 401k and assets to her) and broken up for a third time.   He is on dialysis but healthy otherwise: vegan, organic;  coming from being an abusive Alcoholic.   After retiring, the thought of his on and off again wife never coming back passed, and he joined match.com  He informed me tonight that he has met a beautiful woman. So I ask for details and pictures. He sends two pictures of a woman that seems to be much younger than him. She is apparently 60 and he is 69. I doubt the validity of that though.  He said he is picking her up from the airport next week after being abroad finalizing an inheritance. I think all of this is fishy and tell him that he really needs to know about squatting laws and tenant laws before inviting this woman into his house. He mentioned her having an apartment in a neighborhood near him but i think that is just smoke.   What references should I link him to to prepare or should he just talk to a lawyer?   Tdlr: dad met suspicious woman online. How can he protect himself from fraud if he is adamant about pursuing it?    We are in Texas.   What can my dad do to prevent fraud or a crazy trying to manipulate him?	Yes
240	My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	Yes
241	Long story short -  I'm 17 years old, the other day when i got home from chilling with some friends, i saw my step dad (who is an abusive alcoholic towards my mom and 4yr old sister) hitting my sister extremely hard, slapping her face and screaming at her because she peed herself, as well as punching my mom in the eye when she tried to intervene. I've known for a long time that he has been abusive but this is the first time i witnessed it firsthand. I pulled him off of my sister and kept punching him in the face until i got him on the floor, where i grabbed his head and kept hitting it against the ground as hard as i could until my mom, neighbour, and sister pulled me off of him. He was unconscious after that.   Seeing him hurt my mother and sister like this made my blood boil beyond belief. I have never felt such rage before, it was like i couldn't control myself. My friend said i was acting in their defense.	Yes
242	Like the title says I have to get a license in New Mexico. New Mexico has two drivers Licenses. The first one doesn't ask for proof of citizenship but you have to make an appointment to get fingerprinted. The  second one requires a birth certificate or visa, a Social Security card, and a utility bill to show proof of residency. So, I opted for what seemed like the easy option. thing is when I showed the clerk the documents, I found out that my Birth Certificate has a Jr while my SSN card does not.   So now I have to go to the Social Security office and change my name there and get a new card or go to a Judge and change my name on my birth certificate. My question is, with all my past documents not having the Jr (mortgage, marriage, Loans) would it be better to just change the birth certificate to mach all those documents even though it means having to set a court appointment or can I correct my name on the Social Security card and leave all my past documents as they are without the Jr?	Yes
243	I'm a 14 year old girl in Mississippi. My parents have been divorced all my life and family for a long time have had a good friendly relationship. The custody agreement was that I would stay with my mom on weekdays, and I would stay at my dads on weekends, but it has always been very, very loose. The past year or so my mother has become more and more touchy, and she yells at me quite often. She gets mad over the tiniest things and starts yelling, and then I start crying, and then she'll yell at me for crying, and then I cry harder, and then it kinda keeps going from there. Usually after that I go hide in my room and cry for at least another hour thinking about how much I hate her and stuff like that. My father is literally the perfect parent. He actually has a job(Mom doesn't), gets stuff done(Mom doesn't), is actually responsible, gets me to school on time, volunteers for all of my band stuff, etc.  and most importantly he never ever yells. Not once in my life have I been yelled at. I practically idolize him and I respect him, whereas I lost respect for my mother a long time ago. About a year ago, I was practically suicidal because of her yelling at me. For the past year, but especially this last week, I've been thinking about going over to dad's and simply telling him that I'm not going back. Today for the first time I actually said something when my dad told me to pack up, and he really does want to help in any way he can. What would happen if I refused to go over to my moms? With the fact that she has yelled at me this much, is a pretty bad parent in general, and that I'm an older kid who has a clear opinion, would there be any chance of changing custody to primarily if not completely my father? Are there any other paths we could take? Can someone help me please?	Yes
244	"Hello, Ex wife gets house in divorce. My name was supposed to stay on it until a Re-Fi by Jan 2019. Ex wife finds dude, gets pregnant, moves away. Attempts to sell house. Comes up that her ""refi"" she told me that she was going to do was a loan modification, resulting in a 24k lean on the house. Cannot sell house because of this. Tells me flatly ""I have no plans to pay"" after this deal falls through. Mortgage will be officially late on the 10th of this month.  Credit score is currently 745 (I work hard) and it going to tank because of this. Decree states that he has to pay/indemnify me of all damages/financial issues. Not sure how to proceed. How can I minimize the issue? I want to bring her to contempt of court. She told me she choose not to work this summer to stay home with her new baby. The irony was that I could have lived in the house and made all of the payments.   What is my next move?"	Yes
245	"My mother is visiting from AZ this weekend (I'm in grad school in DC right now). She was supposed to get in at around 10. I got a call at 9:40 from my mom's phone, and another woman answered. I thought, right then and there, ""well, my mother's dead.""  I've been waiting for that phone call for over a decade. You see, my mother is a severe, barely functioning alcoholic. Fortunately she wasn't dead tonight, but instead was being escorted to her fifth hospitalization in two years for falling and hitting her head while intoxicated. Her last? Christmas. 7 stitches. Christmas eve, I asked the ER social worker how I could get my mother help. The SW's answer? ""People are allowed to do terrible things to themselves. There's nothing you can legally do.""  I remember her falling between the train and the train tracks when I was 14 (13 years ago). I had to drive us home that night. A year later she had her first DUI (that I know of) in NY and her first court-ordered rehab. It didn't stick. She went back again in 2012 (CT). That one didn't stick, either. Between then and now she had at least one DUI (that I know of) in AZ, her current state of residence (retired). I've since had myself made her power of attorney. But while on the phone tonight with the hospital outside of Detroit that she was sent to (where her layover was), they told me that a POA means nothing to them unless they see the paperwork in person. What I need to do, they said, is make her declared incompetent so I can have her put in a psychiatric facility (or some equivalent) to have her treated properly.  My mother is 70. The last time she went to rehab she had the highest blood alcohol level of any female patient at that facility. She regularly drinks herself into a stroke-like incompetency, where she cannot recognize the faces around her. Mother's Day 3 years go, she stopped during our brunch to ask who I was. She refused to get into my car. A few years before that, she spoked to me for 20 minutes in complete gibberish. The paramedic tonight, too, noticed stroke-like (or Korsakov-like) symptoms.  How do I start this process? If I don't, I'm afraid she'll be dead within the year.  **TLDR: Mother has been an alcoholic for 20+ years. Probably should have been taken away from her by CPS. Now that she's 70, how do I get her help, and which state do I begin in?**"	Yes
246	My kid is grown and out on his own. My ex owes $30K+ in child support to me and has not paid, except for the incidental garnishment of refunds or when he had a job long enough to get garnishment paperwork completed.   My case is handled through the state, but they have yet to ever issue a warrant or impact him in any meaningful way. He has moved to another state (over 5 years ago) and has just moved to a different state.   My son was very sick for 5 years and I am still working through the medical bills. I don't need my ex's money, but it sure would help.   How do I get the state to follow through and put some pressure on him to start paying back? There are other wives/children as well. I assume they take precedence since my child is grown now?	Yes
247	Hi all,  My husband and I separated over a year ago and have been living apart since. We live in Arizona. We verbally agreed to the division of our stuff and it hasn't been an issue so far. Part of our agreement was that he could keep the house when we filed for divorce - I will sign off on the deed and he will initiate he refinance to have my name removed from the mortgage. My understanding is that this is the process and that I can't just remove myself from the mortgage.  I'm finally moving forward with filing the divorce paperwork, but I have some concerns. What if he doesn't refinance the house? I am looking to write the divorce decree in such a way that gives him 60 days to make a good faith attempt to refi in his own name and remove me from the mortgage and if he doesn't, hold him in contempt of court or something like that. Basically, since it will be his responsibility, I want it to be enforceable in case he decides to change his mind and my name is stuck on a mortgage for a house I don't own.   Is this something I can do own my own or does anyone have any experience with something like this? I'd hate to involve an attorney if I don't have to.  Thanks :)	Yes
248	"Here's the background: My ex-husband moved out of state (from OR to WA) about 4 years ago, and has visited our daughter (F, 12) maybe 4 times in those years. He has drug/alcohol/legal troubles, and is currently sitting in county jail awaiting a trial for domestic violence that will likely send him to prison for 5 years (that's the plea bargain).   We have ""joint custody"" and have since 2009, but our daughter has lived with me and with my husband (her stepfather) that whole time. I've discussed getting official full custody a few times, and it's just never seemed worth it. (He can't afford any child support; he's often homeless; he doesn't try to see her or have her for Christmas/vacations anyway, and so for all practical purposes, we really do have ""full custody"" anyway.)   But now, with this prison sentence looming, I'd like for my husband to be able to adopt her. I know I need to have his parental rights terminated, and I'm meeting with a lawyer next week to have that first conversation. Just a few questions:  We have a $100 consultation, but I'm wondering if after that, I'd be able to do most of this paperwork on my own. Does that seem reasonable? Or am I going to have to really sign up for the full deal with the lawyer? If so, does anyone have a rough ballpark of what that might cost so I can start figuring that end out? Are there any particular questions I should ask at our meeting?  And finally... this IS a good idea, right? It's possible and worth it?  Thank you, thank you!"	Yes
249	"The bio father has never been involved except with court ordered child support that started a year and a half after birth. I've been with my husband for 2 yrs, married for one yr. My toddler chose to call my husband daddy while he was still my bf. My husband loves my child as his own. We decided we didn't want her to be adopted due to her deserving the child support she currently receives. It was mostly my decision and him agreeing. He would adopt her in a heart beat otherwise. I have set up her child support in a direct deposit savings so she can use it when she's all grown up.   Now that my husband and I are fully settled in and thinking of the future, we want to change her last name so that we can all be one family unit. She is starting to learn how to spell her name but have difficulty with explaining the last name situation. Soon she will have siblings and they will all have my new last name. I don't want her to feel left out later on and personally it sucks for us when we sign her up for anything with her different last name. Maybe it's selfish on my part for wanting us all to have the same last name, but my own experience growing up with step parents I always felt like a step child and not a real family member. The odd one out. I don't want that for my child. I wish I could have had her with my husband but life is shitty like that.   I know in order to change her last name I need to fill out a petition for name change and technically I can avoid asking the bio fathers permission and just rely on the judge to decide if it's in the child's best interest.  After a brief google search, the term ""back door adoption"" came up. Would our situation be considered as such? I didn't think about it that way and hope that it wouldn't affect her ability to receive child support.   We are a military family, so I don't know how that would affect things legally. We are no longer in the original state  of California. We moved to Louisiana.   So my other question would be, will changing my child's last name to my married last name cancel out her right to receive child support from her absent father? I don't want her to lose that."	Yes
250	A couple years before I met my wife she gave away a child so that she would not have to share split custody with her physically abusive ex. She was under age and grew up in a religious home so they got married and she  tried to make it work. A few days after the child was born her ex went for cigarettes and didn't come back. My wife (now just 18 and terrified) was talked into giving up her child. Somehow the ex found out  and tried to stop the adoption so my in laws payed ex off and tried to hurry the adoptive process. Through a friend of a friend she heard about a family looking to adopt. The parents seemed to check all the boxes: the husband was well off and in a prestigious occupation, they had already adopted other children, they are of the same religion, they seemed very happy. My wife told them that she wanted to keep regular contact with some form of open adoption. They agreed. Within days papers were signed and the adoption was finalized.   In the beginning they send pics/updates every month. They had a visit each of the first three years and they brought the child to our wedding. Then things start to change. After our wedding they decided to message once every three months and we had to ask a few times for the yearly visit. They say something about other birth mom's losing interest over time and my wife has to ask for updates. We have since moved away and my wife is going back in town for a family event and asked for a yearly visit while she is there. The response was that there will be no more visits and only a yearly update.   I have never seen the legal paperwork as that obviously happened before I met my wife but is there any room to legally get more contact? This happened in Utah around 6 years ago. All conversation was through email. Should I bother trying to do something about this or are we without recourse? I don't want to put my wife and her family through an emotional fight to come up with nothing especially if the family could just go no contact on us.  Sorry for the long post.	Yes
251	So we both live in California, he's been separated for 5 years no but his divorce isn't finalized. Well our baby is due soon and we aren't sure if he can be put on the birth certificate seeing as he is still legally married. Would it be better for us to wait till it is finalized? Or can he get in trouble if we put him on the birth certificate?	Yes
252	Father has been absent to child for 4 years and living in another province but he resently was court ordered to pay child support. Well  he wants something to do with child now and i have refused due to the fact we have a new family now, the child knows only her step father as her father(hes been around since the child was 2) and 2 little sisters she loves very much, not to mention but she also has my in laws who spoil her and treat her like thier own blood. Well the bio dad wants full custody, what are the chances of that happening? Would a judge give him full custody and let him leave the province with her? Any lawa in place i can use to stop that from happening? Its been four years, does he not forefit his rights to her? Could it be considered abandoment even though she has been with me?	Yes
253	"He had previously opened a bank account in her name before, as well as accounts in my other two children's names (previous marriage, not his children). My lawyer advised me to close the accounts with his name on them and open new ones in my name. He was supposed to be putting their Christmas money into the accounts and when I went to close them I found that he never did so. He's in a financial hole and so I do not trust what he may do with her SS number. I am the primary custodial parent. What rights does he have to this information? Can I deny his reauest based on his history of stealing money from the children? He also claims he needs it for health insurance but child support enforcement is handling her medical support through him and have advised me not to give him the number. I've tried contacting my lawyer but he has not returned my call and meanwhile her noncustodial father (only granted supervised visitation for now) keeps hounding me to give it to him ""because reasons"" which just sounds suspicious to me. If he is legally entitled to it then I will comply with the law. I just need to know if he is or not in this situation. Thank you."	Yes
254	"I am 18 years old and heading to university in September. My mother has always been emotionally unstable, bipolar, bpd, and very manipulative. She never respects my privacy (goes through my things when I'm not here, steals them and won't give them back for no reason, etc) - e.g: a few months ago she stole my girlfriend and I's polaroids and wouldn't give them back because she didn't approve of me dating her (very unjustified considering my girlfriend never showed any reason not to be with her). She never lets me close the door to my room because ""I shouldn't have anything to hide"" and ""there shouldn't be any secrets between us"".  More recently I bought a watch with money I had saved for years, and she just called me to tell me she's going to take the watch and return it (and most likely keep the money). My parents being divorced I left for holidays with my father and left my watch at home.   I don't know what to do anymore: She has been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive with me for YEARS, which has caused me to develop depression, severe insecurity and low self-esteem and anger management issues. Nonetheless, I have never gotten physically agressive with her. This watch I bought is one I hold very dear, and being 18 I don't think she's allowed to steal my things and sell them without my consent.   What should I do?"	Yes
255	I've never posted here before or really even browsed because I've not run into legal issues that I did not know how to handle or where to turn locally for advice. I've recently been presented with some hard hitting information about my ex wife and her new husband involving a sex crime. Can you guys recommend a good custody attorney, I need to do something for my childrenswell being and my peace of mind. Ideally I want full custody instead of the joint we have now. I know that won't happen unless something drastic has happened, and to my knowledge it has not come to that yet.   As of right now I have a little information to go off of as to the depth of my situation but I will do my due diligence and dig deeper, quietly.   I need a good referral in he Kansas City area, I'd like to speak with an attorney to go over my options and lay out some costs and a potential plan of action. Thank you all in advance for the help.  I don't have unlimited finances but when it comes to my kids I'll make it work somehow.	Yes
256	State (Alabama) (will answer questions!!) Hi I'm 17 and been have been in joint custody for a long time and I'm tired of it!! I'm so tired of my mom and want to go live with my dad I have already been kicked out once at the age 15 and forced back into my mom's home because she can do that apperntly.I am about to snap on my mom and on my stepdad I can't stand this anymore. I go back to my dad's every other weekend and sometimes a week I'm summer when school is over.Besides that I feel like im treated really bad at my mom's and ive already called dhr many times and nothing has happened over the three times I've called them.

257	Hi all,  I located in Iowa, am a young adult and will finish college in December.   I am coming to accept that I will not be able to flee the state after graduation. In short, I do not believe my father and mother are capable of caring for my slightly younger brother with Asperger Syndrome. They failed to do basically anything at all until he turned 18, are too immature themselves and essentially throw tantrums in response to his tantrums, provide little structure in his life and my mother has this idea now that antidepressants will magically make my brother a functioning person.  I think my brothers social abilities have decreased and his anger has increased since he finished high school (he was pushed through with the help of an assistant and my parents basically doing his homework for him) and his social interaction has been more limited to our parents.  He currently lives at home, is over the age of 18 and no one has anytime of legal guardianship over him or his affairs. He is also not enrolled in medicaid, though he does have health insurance through my parents until the age of 26.   I think that for his well being it is necessary we get legal guardianship over him and have him enrolled in medicaid. Ideally, I think it would be best that I have guardianship over him as my parents have a track record of not being fit to address his needs (we have NO extended family). But, I will not make a lot (if any) money out of college, especially if I stay in this state, and I myself may depend on my parents, who have some money, to live. My goal would be to get him behavioral and life skill therapy and into an assisted living situation.. whether in this state or in another state that has better options.   I am willing to dedicate a few years of my life to this task, but I don't know if its even possible, and I can't afford a lawyer. Please if you have answers or resources on applying for guardianship and medicaid, let me know! Also, if you have any advice on convincing a judge that I am the most fit person to care for him, help!	Yes
258	Hi,  Ex and I have parenting agreement that allowed our to move to texas from california with her. As the father, i retained 50/50 legal custody and have visitation during school breaks.  Ex and i have amicable interactions. Daughter is 12 years old. Decided she wants to live with me in Cali. Ex is agreeable.  Is there any value in getting ex to sign a letter stating xyz, or is it useless unless I file a new parenting plan in court - and would CA even be the right jurisdiction since the child has resided in texas for the last 4 years. I don't exactly have the money to file it if it's the same 500 bucks everything else is to file in family court.  If there is value in getting ex to sign/notarize an agreement that says she gave me permission to take the child back to cali to live with me, would any of you have some things i want to include?  I don't feel like i need to cover my ass here, but that's usually when i get my ass kicked...  Thanks!	Yes
259	"My brother is a horrible sociopath and drug abuser. My mother has been one of those mothers who has been blinded by motherly love in the past, and has enabled him for the past twenty years. But now it has reached a point where she fears for her life. So last year she took out a restraining order against him.  However, whenever the police take him away... they seem to release my brother from custody after a few days. I don't actually know the law, but I'm told that my brother is classified as mentally-ill by the state, and according to the law, they cannot hold mentally-ill in jail. So over the past several years one of three things, happen... they release him to a homeless shelter, or the county hospital, and one time even a church. And from there he is released, and able to come back to my mother's house where he starts the abuse, and the cycles starts all over again.   In the past, she would even bring my brother home herself because, even after physical violence, she would say ""he is still my son and I love him"". But because the type of drugs he abused got harder and harder, and the physical, mental, and financial abuse got worse and worse, she finally was able to get a restraining order against him.  However, my brother has found another loophole to this restraining order law: Police can only remove people violating a restraining order if they are outside the house. What he does is hop the backyard gate and sneak into the house. According to my mother, the police have told her that they can no longer remove my brother if he is already inside the house.  My brother currently has a case against him for violent abuse against my mom, but the next court date is in late September, but I fear she won't last long in her current state.  My questions:  1) Am I misinformed in that mentally-ill persons cannot be kept incarcerated in California? If that is indeed in the case, what options do we have to forcible keep my brother away from my mom at least until the court hearing date?  2) Can the police really do nothing if my brother is already inside the house on the restraining order?  3) Can a restraining order be made null and void if my brother argues that my mother voluntarily took him back?"	Yes
260	Hi there,  I am writing this on my Fiancee's behalf and looking for advice on how best to deal with the situation mentioned in the title.  My fiancee is currently living in Texas with her mom and her daughter and is looking to move to the UK to be with me. He daughter is 4 years old and my fiancee has sole responsibility to her. The father is in another state, Mi to be exact, and is completely uninvolved with his daughters life.  Even when they were in the same state about 18 months ago, he had very little contact with his daughter, so much so, that he's not spoke to his child in over a year now. My fiancee has always tried to get him to speak to her, but has never had any luck, and now she just doesn't try anymore. He makes absolutely zero effort in her life. He does not pay any child support, never speaks to her, nothing. He is named on the birth certificate though, so as far as I understand it, as she was born after 2003, and him being in the birth certificate, he has full legal rights as a parent. His daughter no longer asks after him, and is at the point where she is calling me Dad, and this wasn't something we pushed her to do at all.  Now, we're trying to get a Visa completed so they can both move to the UK to be with me. As it stands, he verbally agreed to this, so to make sure we had something in writing, we went him a letter with all the details on it about the plan to move to the UK, and asked him to sign in and have it notarised in the local courthouse. He said he would get this done, however we've yet to receive back a copy of this letter which he said he has sent, so my fiancee is getting very stressed about this, and rightfully so.  I don't fully know the US legal system, well at all really, but wondering what our next step could be. I wanted to suggest that a visit to the local courthouse in Texas could be on the cards for her to request that she has full parental responsibility, even though he is named on the birth certificate, and try and allow her to make all decisions regarding her daughter. Or at least get court permission to allow her to move her daughter over here, even without his permission.  This guy as far as I know does not have a fixed address currently, and mixes between staying with his girlfriend and his mom, does not have a telephone or at least a number we can contact him on, contact is attempted over Facebook messenger, and that's about it.  Any advice on what our next step could be would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.	Yes
261	We have 3 kids and we're going to co-parent/joint custody. We've agreed upon splitting assets and such. We want it to be legal and for our agreements to have legal weight. Our best option? And can we waive the 90-day wait period?  Also a friend and I have recently started a company and I need something legal that she can sign releasing any future claim/stake in this. It started after she wanted to divorce and she has had no hand in it. Is there a waiver for something like this?  **TL/DR** Wife and I are filing for a no fault divorce w/ joint custody of kids. Can we do this without lawyers and keep it inexpensive?	Yes
262	Hi all.  My lawyer is on vacation for another week, so looking for some general guidance until she returns. It looks like I may need to make some decisions before she gets back.   I live in Massachusetts and am in the middle of an uncontested divorce with my husband. We are selling our marital home and I will be buying a new one in my name only. It looks like the house sale and new purchase will take place during the divorce nisi process. Is there something I should do to protect myself when making an offer on my new place to prevent my soon-to-be-ex-husband from having a claim to the title?   Thanks!	Yes
263	I am in the process of the beginnings of a divorce in Oregon, and have a question about what I might be entitled to ask for in terms of debt repayment.   My soon to be ex husband and I have been married since August 2016, and in that time, he has been unemployed 5, coming up on 6 months. During that time, he has earned 1/3 of what I do per month through unemployment, and we have accrued 13,000 in credit card debt over the course of our 4 year relationship together.   Originally we were going to have an amicable divorce and not write the shared debt in the papers (to save our credit scores), but now I think I will need to. When he gets a traveling job (we are both occupational therapists), he will make 2x what I make at my permanent job. Originally, he was going to pay off most of our debt, and save 5k each for separate savings accounts over the course of the next year or so (we would still be financially intertwined after the legal proceedings).   Now, he's saying he will only pay off half of the debt, not contribute to 2 separate savings accounts, even though he has lived off of my income and support for almost half of our marriage.   What would be reasonable LEGALLY for me to ask for? I'd like for him to pay off at least 2/3 of the debt since he's used so much of my income. Side note, with our debt and his unemployment, we cannot really afford a lawyer, which is why we had our original amicable plan and do a DIY divorce.   If any more information is needed, let me know! Thanks in advance for your help!	Yes
264	So, 24yo, about 6 months pregnant.  Long story short, I was dating this guy and found out about his child pornography charges. I left him and then later found that I was pregnant. I am pro choice in the sense that it's none of my business what another woman does with her body, but abortion is not for me.   At first we were on the same page. He told me his side of the story with the porn and agreed that he would sign over all rights to me as long as he still got some kind of supervised visitation. I more recently was given access to the full federal file and found out that the story he gave me was super watered down and straight up false in some cases. Since I've found that out, he's been super wishy washy about whether or not he's actually going to sign over the rights.  For a while I was considering adoption. He went and sent in an appeals to the federal judge here to have his restrictions lifted (he can't be alone with anyone under the age of 18 without supervision, can't step foot on school or day care properties, etc.) so that he could get full custody. He won't tell me whether or not the appeals was actually granted.   We've since gotten back on the same page again and he's agreed to sign everything over, but I'm concerned that he'll change his mind again at the last minute and I'll be thrown into a legal battle unprepared.   I can't really afford a lawyer right now and I've never had to deal with anykind of legal issues in my life. I have no idea where to even start. Help, please?	Yes
265	"Massachusetts-In the span of a very bad year, I have gotten divorced AND have sought treatment for mental health issues related to my military service.  Initially I had a minimal disability rating due to hearing damage; my veterans service rep streamlined an application for an increase due to my continuing issues.  My ex left me a voicemail that stated she ""wants increased child support when you get that bump up in your monthly check.""  I never told her about any disability monies that I receive, nor did she know I was seeking assistance for my issues.  It's a horrible, extremely non-amicable divorce.  We do not interact.  I went to the VA and asked the advocacy rep if she could have gotten this information due to the fact that she still has a yet-to expire dependent ID; *he said he recognized her and had been in the hospital last week*.

267	"A couple months ago out of the blue my husband(34) said he wanted a divorce. I (32)was shocked and I broke down. He was adamant about it and went the next day and opened his own bank account and moved over his direct deposits from our joint checking account.   I make my own money and it is still going into the joint account, but his money goes into his and he moves it over to the joint account.    He was ready to walk until I told him I'm not selling the house and plan to stay. He was hoping I'd want to sell and split the profit (I put 30,000 down payment from money I had gotten from retirement- gained while we were married). After that, he suddenly wants to ""work"" on our relationship. In reality, he is preparing for divorce. He has a large sum of money coming from some back pay and I believe that is why he moved his direct deposit over to his personal account. He's waiting on it before he fly's the coop-approx. a year from now.   Anyways, a month ago he got a direct deposit from some disability back pay and it went into our joint account. He wasn't expecting back pay and doesn't check our bank statements so I was able to transfer it into my personal account before he seen it.    I want to withdraw this money and put it into    a fireproof safe and hide it- just until this whole thing has blown over. I'm hoping to stay together. If he sees it on the bank statement, I'm saying I gambled it away (I never gamble, but its all I got to go with).   So I want to do this and then close my personal account, if a discovery is done will they be able to look at closed accounts?  missouri"	Yes
268	My ex wife's boyfriend is over stepping his bounds taking over my role as a father of my 7 year old son. We divorced when my son was 3 and ex wife garnered the relationship right then and they have been living together for over two years. Immediately, my ex wife and boyfriend established solid boundaries that keeps boyfriend out of the father like role, as I am heavily involved in my son's life. Ex-wife has been extremely reasonable with me and almost have had all weekends with my son. The problem now is that although she is taking some of that time back, which is in her legal right... She isn't necessarily making that time to be entirely with our son, instead the time is bring channeled over to the boyfriend to spend time with our son on full day excursions etc., and she doesn't care or mind it. I prefer she spends most of the time with him not the other way around.  The relationship between the mother and boyfriend is unusual, and it seems as if the relationship has more weight on the boyfriend and son side. This is because of several factors:  - ex wife did not have a romantic interest in the new boyfriend, more of a convenience relationship during divorce - ex wife has no interest in doing meneal chores for child, such as taking and bringing from school, and other school related activities. Are just some examples  Online searches are coming up short for information about my rights as biological father in the state of Florida. Although, from a high level I'm finding that the mothers boyfriend has zero rights to my child.  Can anyone point to a source where I can find out more law info? ....under these circumstances.	Yes
269	My mother and I were left behind in India by my father when I was a baby but after 18 years he brought us to USA but we came here to find that he is another mistress and his family has been treating my mother and I like slaves and maids actually worse than that. We were being mentally torched everyday for about 1.5years. But then since he kept on saying us to leave his house we decided to not live like servants and leave their place. But even so he refuses to pay for my college tuitions and my mother and I cannot save up enough to pay for everything. What should we do? Please help us. What kind of lawyer should we consult or what we should do. We have no idea. We would be grateful for the help.	Yes
270	As the title suggests, my dad is... well, not the nicest of people.  About a month ago, I ran away after a two week long series of events that included him tackling me to the ground in a parking lot, slapping me repeatedly in the face, and wrestling to wrench things from my grasp on a near-daily basis.  After my untimely and unwanted departure, I was committed to a psychiatric hospital for a few weeks.  Well, I've been out for about that long now, and things aren't much better.  Yesterday, after a yelling match, he kicked me, and out of panic I called the police.  I ended up telling them I felt safe at home because I wasn't sure what they'd do if I said something different, but he's physical often enough that at the next opportunity, should I elect to notify the police once again, something could absolutely be done.  My reservations surrounding this are probably obvious - I'm not exactly thrilled at the prospect of entering foster care, even though it'd only be for eleven months (I turn eighteen next July).  At seventeen, would they put me into foster care?  Could I request emancipation?  Would it be under the jurisdiction of my father to decide whether or not I deserve emancipation?  Would he lose custody?  Would my mother RETAIN custody if they're still married, or would they both lose it?    I guess, although I do have a few specific questions, I'm more confused about the general situation, its implications, and my options surrounding it.  Thank you in advance for the help, and I'll try to answer any questions in the form of edits!    - L	Yes
271	Let's say I have friend who is currently in an extremely abusive relationship to the point where it is affecting her work. I am also her supervisor. Would it be possible for me to ask for a restraining order from her boyfriend? Let's say she is in such a bad state the she cannot ask herself, is being forced not to. But me, along with a few other people see how bad it is and want to get her out. Therefore if we have several people that can attest to this, could this make a difference? Like can we make an argument that she has been abused so badly she cannot make this decision for herself? If this is not technically possible, what is my next best course of action?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
272	"Not getting into details why or when. Just got couple of questions:  1. confused about CIS if still living together how to determine ""mine"" or ""his"" expenses. We have joint bank account and I have mine. He is too lazy to make his own bank account. Our expenses are shared - I pay certain bills, he pays other ones.   2. What if I can't get paperwork from him to include my case, say tax forms, 401K account info, his stocks and side businesses, insurances. He stonewalls me and just ignores my requests.  3. We have 2 kids together and I have one from previous relationship. I am now citizen, but my son from previous relationship came to US with K4 visa and he was the petitioner. No amount of talking made him continue getting my son's paperwork in order and now it's a moot point. Would anyone know if there are any issues if I file for I-130 even though he was the petitioner?  Basically he doesn't want divorce, but doesn't want to be husband either. He wants to date other people, but gets the benefits of someone cleaning home, prepping food etc and I want to move on."	Yes

Sarah is 11 years old and is at Dad's house about 3 days a week.   Here are some examples of what Sarah is fed at her Dad's house:  -A single hot dog for dinner  -A single small turkey sandwich for lunch (no mayo)  -One piece of pizza for dinner  -A granola bar for breakfast   She also has told me stories of being yelled at by StepMom for sneaking a piece of cake at birthday parties.   It's important to note that Dad/StepMom are weight obsessed. StepMom is very underweight and Dad makes multiple comments about how thin women, a la Audrey Hepburn, look best. They think Sarah is too big because she has a small stomach. Sarah is not overweight (per Doctor) and the stomach is something normal that happens before puberty for many girls.   When I try to speak with Dad/StepMom they claim they offer Sarah side dishes but she won't eat them. Sarah, while admittedly a picky eater, says this isn't true.   Sarah has developed a very skewed vision of herself. Keeps telling me she's fat and now works at losing weight (she's lost 4 lbs). I'm EXTREMELY concerned about her mental health. However I'm not sure if this qualifies as neglect because they are feeding her, just not much. Thanks for any and all advice."	Yes
274	I have 50/50 legal and physical shared custody with my ex-wife. We get along fine and co-parent fine.  When we divorced, she worked part time most of our 8 year marriage, even though she has a Bachelors degree and I do not. I was the bread winner. Her income was imputed at minimum wage (although for a brief period she worked full time and made more annually than me). So, I pay her child support every month.  This isn't a huge deal, and I didn't mind, even though it was a financial burden.  Since divorcing, she began a Masters Degree program. She has also re-married.  I understand that the re-marriage has no effect on my child support payment. They're our kids, not the new spouse's responsibility.  However, she has now finished her Masters Degree, and is still working part time. She has acquired several new piercings. She has acquired a new half sleeve (half her arm) tattoo that has grown over what must be several sessions. And she is about to have breast implant surgery.  So, her education has increase, though her income and work hours have not, and she is getting a lot of voluntary and aesthetic work done on her body.  I'm not judging, and I don't care, she's allowed to do whatever she'd like....  But, I'm struggling financially to maintain my home for my children, bills, etc. AND pay a not insignificant amount to her each month.  Would any of this be grounds for CS adjustment in Oklahoma?	Yes
275	I realize the logistics of the father ending up with a child make it less likely, but I'm curious about the legality of it. I know different states have different laws, so really just interested in any states that allow it.	Yes
276	My mom has a copy of his will from 1981. The will is not notarized, therefore my family is wondering if it is a legal will. My mom's uncle, my grandpa's brother, is the executor.  If my mom needs a lawyer, which I'm assuming she does, she is in southern Cali and my grandpa died in northern Cali. Should the lawyer be by my mom or by my grandpa.   If the will is legal, my grandpa had two more kids after the will was written. What are those two kids entitled to get? My mom wants to add them to the will but I don't know if that is possible. If it isn't, I think she wants to give them what they are entitled to regardless of the will.   Last my aunt is also in the will. My aunt is bipolar. She is not really able to take care of herself. Most of the time she prefers to live under a bridge even though she has a home. My mom wants to give my aunt my grandpa's trailer but she is worried about leaving her money. She is hoping the money can go to someone who can monitor what is given to my aunt. But if the will directly leaves my aunt money is that possible?   Thank you in advance.	Yes
277	I received an order of protection and have no idea what the consequences are if it's not removed, or worse, made permanent. The order came from Family Court - which I understand is a civil matter. So does an order of protection from family court show up on criminal background checks? Are there different types of restraining order such that some do show up on background checks whereas others don't?	Yes
278	I'm currently in a volatile relationship that is toxic and destructive to me. However, I've just started a new job and I'm undergoing training that is rarely offered, so I can't miss a day of work. I need a restraining order against my former significant other. If I fill out the paperwork and give them to a friend that is free during the court's normal hours can they submit the paperwork for me?	Yes
279	"I'm in need of some advice. First I will provide some details on the situation. I live in Canada. I had a daughter with my now ex girlfriend back in 2014. The ex has severe mental health issues, she is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.   Throughout our relationship she did a number of terrible things. She would verbally attack my friends and family, and she physical attacked me and her family members on several occasions, no charges were ever pressed.  After our break up, we agreeded upon taking our daughter for half of the week. Things went relatively smoothly, other than a few minor episodes of verbal abuse against my family.   About a year ago now, I found out that my ex had become a prostitute. Knowing how my ex is, this concerned me. After texting her under the guise of a client, I learned that she was ""working"" out of her appartment where my daughter lives half of the time.  She claims to never ""work"" when my daughter is there. But my concern is what individuals might come unannounced. Or if a pedophile offered my ex money to do unmentionable things. It's obvious that a child lives in her apartment.  I contacted children's service and informed them of the situation, with screenshots as evidence. When children's services called me back, they told me that prostitution isn't illegal in Canada, and because my daughter isn't there when she's doing it, there was nothing they could do about.  It might also be worth noting that my ex is on disability and is making large amounts of undeclared income.  My question today is what should be my next course of action? Would it be worth it to try to fight for full custody? I tried to get a written custody agreement through a lawyer, but that didn't work as my ex would make unreasonable demands that would constantly change."	Yes
280	Asking for my mom, she's not a Redditor. My mother and father's divorce was settled last year. My mother was awarded sole custody of my underage sister, while my father was granted visitation rights. My mother is wondering if she is able to send my sister away to a boarding school out of state without my father's permission. In other words, does my mother's right to choose her daughter's school go to that extend? Thoughts?	Yes
281	First post. I broke up with my emotionally abusive, sometimes physically abusive ex. I found out he had been recording me with a motion detecting hidden camera. I wanted to go to the police when I first found them, but my ex and his family basically told me if I did, they'd go after my family(I don't know what that means, but my ex has threatened to shoot my family. I've asked his parents to take his gun away, but they haven't said anything.) This is where it gets weird...er. They told me how close they are to 2 former Presidents and how they'll be forced to get involved in this mess. I know they're not lying because I've seen pictures of them with a couple Presidents and politicians. Everyone in his family is either a lawyer or working for someone with a lot of political power.  Any advice on what I can do? How should I handle something like this?	Yes
282	"Good evening, /r/legaladvice.  I am a 21yo college student currently residing in Washington state. After reading some comments out of this morning's [AskReddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ohltk/serious_family_court_laywers_whats_the_most_petty/) about petty parental behavior in family court, I realized that I may be nearing a legal issue of my own.  I am using a throwaway to isolate my financial information from my main Reddit accounts.  -----------  My parents have been married since before I was born. Around the time I was born (or within a couple of years after), my parents set up a UGMA money-market account in my name through `BankA`. (I believe my mother was listed as the account's custodian, but my father may have been included as well - I am currently unsure.) While I was still a minor, money was deposited into this account - usually birthday gifts from extended family, excess chore allowance, recurring monthly deposits from my parents, etc.   By the time I turned 18, the account had accrued a balance of approximately $12,000. As I was within a few months of graduating high school and heading off to college, my parents and I decided to leave the account as-is for the time being.   As I had/have scholarships covering tuition, fees, and most of my housing, my parents paid the remaining amount for the first year out-of-pocket, leaving the account untouched. By the end of the first year, I was gainfully employed and able to live on my own in a more-or-less financially independent fashion (sparing family-wide accounts for convenience such as my health insurance and cell service) from there on out.   After the end of my first year of college, `BankA` announced it was ending its money-market account program, with services being transferred to `BankB`. As the two of us were unsure whether I would have the ability to manage a money-market account in the event of an emergency, my mother and I agreed to open a new joint money-market account between us. My mother (with my consent) opened a new money-market account with `BankB`, transferred the balance into the new account, and closed the account with `BankA`. The new account has remained untouched by the two of us since - the only deposits have been interest payments. My mother has previously stated she will remove herself from the account at my request when I feel the time is right. (Granted, this was a verbal agreement, but I trust her word on this.)  My intent for this account was to, at some point or another, take control of this account by requesting my mother remove herself as signatory and doing one of the following:  * Migrate my direct-deposits (payroll, tuition reimbursement, etc.) to the account, transfer the majority (approximately $30-$35,000) of my checking account with `BigBankC`  into it, and begin using the account as a general savings account. * Drain the account and the checking account with `BigBankC` into a savings account opened with `CreditUnionD` (opened as part of me signing up for my first credit card and currently sitting unused) and close the account with `BankB`.  As I simply haven't had time to do so, I planned on doing one of the above shortly after graduating from college in the spring of next year.   Unfortunately, I have recently learned that my parents will likely be filing for divorce before I graduate. While the divorce isn't a surprise to anyone in the family (my parents have had marital issues for most of my life), my mother previously stated that she planned to wait until after I graduate and her three children - were ready to fully ""leave the nest"" as it were. (For context, my brother and I are both biological children of the marriage, my sister adopted from my mother's late sister)  My mother has confided in me that, when her and my father have discussed divorce, he asked her to inventory and estimate value of her quilting supplies for consideration in dividing up shared property. (My mother and father both have their hobbies, each having a modest amount of property associated with them.) My father and I get along to some extent, but I believed him to be a man of better character than this. While I don't believe he will go after the joint account due to my mother being attached to it, I would like to make sure he has no legal standing to do so whatsoever should the divorce turn ugly.  ------------  All of that being said, I have several questions that I am hoping someone from /r/legaladvice can provide insight on:  * Is the joint money-market account with `BankB` at risk of being dragged into divorce proceedings because of my mother being listed as a signatory? * If my father does stoop low enough to claim the account is marital property, what can I expect to happen with the `BankB` account during the divorce proceedings? * Is there anything I can/should do to protect the account with `BankB` and its contents? Some actions that come to mind are:      * Removing my mother as a signatory earlier than planned     * Having both parents sign an affidavit stating my mother is a signatory for emergency/administrative purposes only and that the money is not and never has been hers (I will be traveling back home for Thanksgiving and could probably convince the two to sign one then)     * Considering the account as ""tainted"" and draining/closing it altogether  I have not discussed my concerns with either parent or a lawyer at this time. My university does have a a lawyer on retainer for students to talk to, but I don't believe he's well-versed in marital/divorce law. I know my mother has privately reached out to at least one divorce lawyer already, but as a young adult who hasn't had much experience with US civil courts (or any part of the legal system, for that matter) I'm unsure of whether or not I should be contacting them.  Thanks, everyone."	Yes
283	My girlfriend's dad wants to change her name. She's 16 and will be 17 soon. Next year she'll be 18. Is he allowed to change her name without consent?  I know she doesn't want it to be changed, but he can be quite abusive so she hasn't argued much about it.  If the parent wants to change their child's name without the child's consent, is that easy for them to do?	Yes
284	Ok so first off I would like to ask people to not leave rude comments.    So I was born in Texas and lived here my whole life and my boyfriend moved to Texas from Mexico illegally 9 years ago when he was 14 years old. It might be a few years until we get married but I was wondering how the whole marriage process works with an illegal immigrant.  I know there was an act passed by Obama that might protect him but as I did more reading he might be a year off from the date of being protected. I am mostly really worried about us trying to get the marriage license and the government deporting him. Will he have to go back to Mexico to get a K1 visa or can we just get married and begin filing for a green card? Any other advice or helpful comments on how this all works will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
285	I'm writing this on behalf of my mom. We live In Ontario, Canada.  A few years ago my dad created a supplementary credit card under my moms name. He kept both cards and my mom never used the card. Than, a few years bag my parents separated and my dad took the card with him.  Only a while back we received a notice from the bank the card was created under, apparently my dad has been using this card, but it's registered to my mom, so we received a letter requesting that we pay back the debt. My mom called the bank and told them she has nothing to do with the card, she requested her name be removed from the card. The bank says that they cannot remove the name before the full amount is paid back. We talked it out with my dad, and he told me it was settled, the problem would be fixed.  It seems that was not the case. On July 13th, 2017, we received a letter from a legal firm. Apparently the bank has taken legal action on my mom, an they are requesting that she pay back the full amount spent. The problem is, my mom never used the card, that is not money she spent.  The letter was sent on June 29th, 2017, it stated that we must pay back a balance of $3,945.98 CAD. The amount is to gain interest annually at a rate of 19.8%. It also stated that if arrangements are not made within 10 days of the letter being sent, than legal action will be taken. It has been 14 days, we just received this letter.  I checked out the reviews for the Law Firm, it's technically a debt collector, and apparently their service is horrible. They are known to refuse to pick up calls so that interest is gained overtime, they seem to be all about money.  So now we have a problem. My Mom owes a bank money that she never used, it's quite possible that legal action will be taken by a potentially scummy company, and I doubt my dad will do anything to help.  So I've turned to my friend Reddit, I need your help, what can me and my mom do in this situation? How do we proceed?  Thank you for taking the time to read through this, I know it's quite long, but it means a lot to me.	Yes
286	"Let me give you a backstory so maybe you can give me solid advice..  I got pregnant and we split up within days of finding out. When I delivered, the father was there and has been apart of her life ever since. I have always been pro 50/50, ALWAYS! From birth-6 months, he got her two days a week after work for about 4 hours (5-9pm), and one full day on the weekend. From 6months-One year, he remained with that schedule with the exception of keeping her overnight on the weekend visitation. When she turned a year old, I agreed to 50/50 although there was no legal agreement in place. He got her twice a week overnight, and one night on the weekend (3 overnights/week). Like I said, I have always been pro 50/50.   Well.. He started cancelling his nights with our daughter for ""work related issues"". Now some of those cancellations were indeed because of work, but some of them were an excuse so he could go out to the bar, attend a party, or go on dates. I have documentation and proof of all of this. He was also taking a week off here and there to go out of state for work. I was getting a little frustrated because even though I agreed to 50/50, I was still taking on FULL PARENTING RESPONSIBILITY, on his time and mine. I thought it was best to revert to our original schedule for those purposes. He got angry of course.. and now we have a court date in a few weeks.   To be clear: the schedule interference is not the only issue with 50/50. Every time our child gets sick and cannot go to daycare, he refuses to take of work, so i end up taking days off of work, and caring for her. She has been to the doctor 24 times in her life, and he was not present (or refused) to go to all appointments except for one. I took her to the other 23. He also has cut back on my child support severely, so he could cover daycare. I receive $200/month now. While she is on HIS time, she is in daycare a total of 11 hours on his days, whereas she is only there for 5-6 hour on mine.   He also has 2 DWI's, (one was expunged and the other he is continually getting continuances on to drop to a lesser charge.. that's the way he works). He also had a DWI on base in the navy that resulted in a dishonorable discharge.. but since he had already requested to leave the military before that incident, he somehow talked his way into it being changed to an honorable one. I also have documentation of him medicating himself at night when he has our daughter.. so he can sleep through the night and her cries when she's hungry.   Now, we are set to battle it out in court, which is the saddest thing of all. He filed first wanting 50/50 with me remaining domicile. Well when I filed my answer, he got pissed to say the least. Out of spite, he then filed that he wants domicile. And he just returned to the country from a 7-day vacation out of country. Which FUELS MY FIRE, because he can miss work and use those vacation days for his enjoyment, but not take on the parental duties of caring for her when she cannot go to daycare.  To say the least, I am frightened. What are my chances here? I absolutely want her to maintain a healthy relationship with her father, and I was thinking about an every other weekend schedule for him that includes every other Wednesday night. He is adamant about 50/50."	Yes
287	Located in Canada, Ontario, they're about 25 living with their father (friend is separate, living with their mom.) They have diabetes that they hardly treat, a failed kidney (Getting dialysis often) and a serious infection in their leg that may need to be amputated. The father is hardly doing anything to help them, and actively hurting their health (going out for fast food when instructed to have a 0 sodium diet, not making sure they're taking insulin / other medications, letting the infection develop to the point of amputation being considered) they're slowly dying and it's tearing my friend up. We spoke to a lawyer previously and we essentially told that they're an adult who is responsible for their own choices and that there was nothing we could do to help get them treated.   Can I get a second opinion? Is there anything we can legally do to get them proper treatment?	Yes
288	Basically, my sister has a dangerous lifestyle. She into doing crazy mountain climbing challenges. She has two sons, and the children's father have died doing the exact same thing. Losing her is a reality that I worry about. I also worry about my nephews who I can't abandon if something happens to my sister.  Can I take a life insurance policy with myself as the beneficiary in case she died, so that I have the means to take care of her children? I'm assuming the premiums will be high due to her lifestyle but it's a small price to at least not having to worry about the financial aspects of her getting herself killed and leaving her children with nothing.  We live in Montana.	Yes
289	"I'm currently looking to change my name, and am unsure where to apply for a name change. If I want my degree to have my preferred name, I need to change my legal name as soon as possible.  My permanent address is in Illinois, where I grew up, but I go to college for a significant amount of the year in Utah. My driver's license is an Illinois license, if that is relevant.  Utah reports that I must ""Live in the county where the name change petition will be filed for at least one year before filing."" [Illinois](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/name_change/Name_Change_Suite_Approved.pdf) reports that I must ""Have lived in Illinois for at least 6 months"".  A big worry here is the wording. I lived in Illinois for most of my life, and I have been at college at Utah for more than a year. However, I haven't lived in Illinois for a contiguous six months recently. I have lived in Utah for more than one year total, but have not ever lived there for a contiguous year.  I'm not worried about court filing fees, but the logistics of court dates aligning worries me about filing in Illinois.  What would be my best course of action? Am I eligible to change my name in Utah? Should I change it there or stay with Illinois? Is there an advantage to having a court order in one versus the other? I will be in Illinois for a short time in a few weeks, where I could do any sort of court visits, and then court visits for Thanksgiving, etc. are definitely possible. I will also be in Utah for most of the upcoming semester."	Yes
290	I haven't seen my twin daughters in over a month. She told me she was moving with them to SC but never specified when, I didn't find out until I asked to see them yesterday because she has me blocked on social media.  It really caught me off guard and I was wondering if calling the police would do anything? Can she be arrested for taking them without my permission? Is what she did illegal at all? I know I'm definitely the father but I'm not on the birth certificate because I wasn't there at the birth and didn't even know they were born until hours later. Any advice would be great.	Yes
291	I'm a Canadian citizen studying in the UK. I'd like to come back to Canada (and more specifically to Quebec -- I don't know if this makes a legal difference) in a few years (2-4) with my girlfriend, who is a British citizen. I'm under the impression that we could both benefit the legal advantages of being married (which I'd be happy to know more about; I'm thinking visa, scholarships, etc.), but we don't have the money or time to organise a wedding (my girlfriend's parents live in Australia).  Q: Can we get married now (in secret) and get married once more (not religiously) when we arrive in Canada?	Yes
292	My ex and I have 50/50 custody. We both have to agree on anything related to education or else take it to mediation. Our kids go to private school. He has remarried and now has 2 step kids. He recently was fired. Our divorce paperwork stipulates that our children will attend X school. He said he cannot afford to send them there since he lost his job. I told him I would pay for X school. He said no and that he intends to enroll them in school in his district regardless of what the court order says. He said he wants both our kids and his step kids in the same school, and since he can't afford tuition for step kids, all of the children will go to the school in his district. Can he be held in contempt? Will a judge allow them to be pulled out of X school to keep our kids in the same school as his step kids? HELP!	Yes
293	"I'll try and keep this short. My 15 year old son spends a week with me, and a week with his mother. Neither of us pay any child support to the other, we split all medical expenses, and I get to choose where he attends school. We've had this agreement since May of 2007, with previous more fragmented times at each house and so on. His mother and I were actually getting divorced before he was born, so we've never really been in the same hour. We live less than a mile from each, and both have children from current marriages.   He doesn't have history of abuse at either house. His mother and I, while having a rocky past, have tried to co-parent the best we know how. Especially lately.   Our son has been displaying very angry moods, and outburst towards his siblings at both houses, but most notably here at my house. He told his younger brother the other day that ""he wasn't his real brother"" and so on (he's 11 years old), all over anger stemming from an xbox game. This type of behavior has gone on since about January, including outbursts towards his mother, saying he doesn't want to stay with her, then he does the same with me, throwing fits over his girlfriend...and so on. He told me other day his life would have been better had I just stayed out it.   So here we are, and I'm worried about how this plays out if he just tries to stay away for good because he isn't getting his way over here, and doesn't like the discipline and consequences he's now facing.   We now have him in counseling and we all go together when necessary, but I can't help but wondering if I'm being played.  There has been no material change of circumstance to change our custody agreement, other than his behavior, and it goes back and forth. I'm just the bad guy at the moment, and I'm worried about him trying to suggest this be a permanent solution, and having to fight for my custody all over again. If I'm being honest, I can't stand the thought of basically being  told ""I hate you, now pay my mom for the next 24 months."" He thinks he deserves a truck and all that...I won't get into that.   Like I said, we are seemingly working together (his mother and I), with the counseling and our communication....but he's still getting to do things over there at the moment because he's ""acting normal"" for her. Why would want to come face the consequences, right? I'm not bashing her or the way she runs her house, im just saying. And we've some conversations about this. It's just a little overwhelming.   How should I prepare myself?"	Yes
294	I am in an on-again-off-again relationship in which I have a six-year-old who I am almost positive is mine, and a two-year-old who I have always had questions about. She has blue eyes neither of us have blue eyes she doesn't look like me she doesn't act like me. So it raised my suspicion. I decided to do a home paternity test and found out that the chances that she is my child are 0%. I am named on the birth certificate as her father. I assumed it was the case at the time. I'm currently paying child support for both her and her six-year-old sister along with private schools for them both. Her mother constantly calls me a horrible dad and says that I should be doing more. What are my legal options at this point? I don't really know that I would do anything other than support this child, because I do love her. I'm just looking for my legal options. I am in Tennessee.	Yes
295	"Okay, parents got divorced 7 years ago. Both have since remarried. I am their eldest child at 26; my youngest sister is 16.   Technically my parents split custody, with my mom as primary. My father (we do not speak; he blames me for the divorce) sees my sister maybe a weekend every other month despite my mother making her available.   So, onto questions. My father is moving to reopen the divorce, I am guessing to renegotiate my sister's custody and child support. He has never followed the parenting plan, stopped working full time in order to pay almost no child support (while living off his trust), and is now claiming that my mother is not communicating with him/keeping my sister from him. My mother has piles of emails to prove otherwise.   He has threatened to bankrupt her with court proceedings in the past. Is there a point at which  him repeatedly dragging her into court for non-issues or just made up ones becomes a legal issue?   He is also extremely likely to push for my sister (who has her license) to begin to do the 3 hour drives to and from his house, in order to make it more ""fair"". My sister has a restricted license as she has a medical condition that is well controlled but she still has occasional issues; currently he and my mother meet halfway for pickups and drop offs. This will be thrown out, right?  And at what point is my sister able to say ""I really don't actually want to visit dad and Stepbitch""?  And what does ""reopening the divorce"" actually mean?  Also his lawyer is openly bitchy, unprofessional and rude in emails to my mom and her lawyer. Can she be reported for this?  TL;DR: Dad is asshole who pulls mom back into court or mediation over non-issues in parenting plan, or flat out fabricated problems. His lawyer is openly rude and unprofessional in emails to my mom/her lawyer. What are the consequences of these two things/are there even consequences?   Also, he wants my sister (who has a medical issue) to drive 3 hours each way to bring herself to and from him on his weekends as opposed to him meeting my mom halfway. This will be thrown out, right? Is my sister old enough to say ""I don't want to see him""?"	Yes
296	The deed is still in my grandfathers name but he died 8 years ago and my grandmother took charge of the house. A few months ago  she passed away also. I lived with my grandmother all of this time and she never put in her will, nor my Grandfather, to pass the deed over to the child if they died(my Mom). We have been able to get money/estate and car transferred over to us.   my question is do we need a lawyer to transfer over the deed of the house? and if not where do we go? the clerk of courts? if any of you had to do this before, how did you handle it?  Thank you for taking time to look at this.	Yes
297	Some background: I am 17 years old. My mother is a narcissist who thinks the world revolves around her. She and my Stepdad have been together for ~14 years and have a son that age. They've been married about 7 years.  It's clear they've only stayed together for financial reasons and for the three children. My Stepdad loves me and my sister like his own, despite him not being our biological dad. He takes care of us financially by himself and has built a beautiful life for us. Over my lifetime we've gone from poverty to upper-middle class solely because of him.  My mother, on the other hand, has never worked a day in the past 16 years. She spends child support checks from my Realdad on weed, alcohol, and things for herself. (Clothes, takeout, etc.)  About a year and a half ago, Mom was arrested for domestic battery and obstucting a person trying to make a 911 call. I made the call after she attacked me and Stepdad after taking unprescribed oxycodone and mixing it with a LOT of vodka. She was in jail for about 2 days before stepdad bailed her out. We made her stay in a hotel for a week before she swore to change. We dropped the charges. ...and....she didn't change. She's always been emotionally abusive but it started to get worse. My sister, 17 at the time, just had a baby. He was ~5 months at the time. Moms bullshit caused her to move out Feb. 2017 with her fiancé. This caused Mom to be okay for a while, as she blamed Sister for all of our problems. Recently it's been bad again. It's clear she's on pills again as we know how she acts on them. (more background: She was arrested for prescription fraud about 7 years ago) NOW: Last night Mom and Stepdad got into a big fight. Stepdad had one drink with Bossman before coming home, and Mom freaks and calls him a drunk. This angers Stepdad so he tries to go to bed. Mom decides to go fuck with him and turn on the lights and slam the door to their bedroom. Stepdad breaks the lights out of anger. Mom keeps antagonizing him. Stepdad decides it is in his best interests to leave. I have video of Mom pushing Stepdad out the door. But Mom took all of Stepdads keys, including his work keys issued by his company to his work truck. She claims he's intoxicated and won't let him leave. She finally gives him his keys but won't let me leave with him because Stepdad isn't my legal guardian and claims he has no rights over me.  Stepdad is done. He's filing for divorce but we're scared of what is going to happen with me. I refuse to live with Mom but we don't know if Stepdad can get custody. My Realdad is a homeless druggie, all my grandparents are either blind or deaf, and I refuse to live with any of Moms family.  What are the chances Stepdad will get custody? What are my rights? All 3 kids agrees we would testify under oath that we fucking hate her. Is there anything we can do to give us a better chance? Stepdad is willing to give Mom alimony and half of what we own with no argument. He just wants me and my brother under his custody.   Tl;dr: Stepdad and crazy narcissist Mom getting divorced, trying to be in his custody despite no biological relation.  Sorry for any spelling, I'm on mobile.	Yes
298	I'd like to file a motion for my ex and into only communicate through a court approved site like MFW. My ex is either hostile/vulgar or ignores important questions regarding custody. He lately will only communicate with me through the kids which is not beneficial to them in any way. How do I go about filing a motion without hiring a lawyer? Does anyone have experience with MFW?	Yes
299	I need financial advice. This is to help my mother and family. Basically my father comes from a wealthy family, he was abusive financially, emotionally, verbally, physically towards my mother. His father passed away last year and he purposely makes sure my mother and none of my siblings have anything to do with his side of the family. He has a massive paranoia towards my mother, because he is mentally ill, his whole family do. He did not tell any of us that my grandfather passed away or that he was having a funeral, we found out a week later after feeling something was wrong. My grandfather did not agree with the way my mother was treated, and wanted her to be treated fairly, and his grandchildren within the family. My father lives alone, and has joined a very expensive gold club, which he denies, and I imagine he has his inheritance hidden, since that side of the family have been up for tax evasion previously. I talked to him yesterday after he didn't communicate with the family for a year, which he blames us, but he impossible to communicate with. He said that he has gone back to work because what else would he do, but he said technically he doesn't have to work anymore. He did ask if I am okay for money and was going to throw me a few hundred euro, but I didn't accept his offer, because I don't think it is good enough, he abandoned the family financially for years, and my mother had to work extremely hard to put food on the table. I also have a feeling my grandfathers will has been tampered with. The reason I believe this is because he told me when I visited him, that we are getting nothing, because it has been set up that way, and that it is out of his hands. He had alzheimer's for years and tried to hide it, so it would have been very easy for anyone on that side of the family to get him to sign anything. I have no idea what is going on with my grandfathers inheritance, but would like to get to the bottom of it. He won't tell me much information because he is paranoid about what will go back to my mother. He only gives my mother 350 euro a month, which is ridiculous considering the fact he told me he lives very comfortably now. My mother had to pay a solicitor 20,000 euro of her money she earned this year, because she owed him from when she had to get legal help to get him out of the house years ago. She is also paying five thousand for my brothers braces, while my father claims he doesn't have enough money to help her. She is suffering financially while my father is well off, and is hiding money, probably in his mothers name, or someone else's. Do you have any recommendations of what I can do? I am willing to speak with him since he allows me to communicate with him, but I have to be very careful with what I say, because he could easily choose to have nothing to with me, if I push it too far. I want to help my mother, but am not sure the best way? I could try and convince him to speak to my mother, but he is so against her and mistrusting of her, it would be very difficult.  Thank you.	Yes
300	Hello. My fiancé (30F) and I (37M) have been together around 4 years. We live together and have a 2 year old daughter. We have joint accounts including checking and credit cards. For the past 3 years I have been supporting her and our daughter exclusively. My fiancé was a full time student and recently graduated from college. I'm currently only making $30k annually. In the 3 years my fiancé had been going to school, I payed nearly 100% of all living expenses including rent, utilities, food, etc. After she graduated she was offered, and took, a teaching position making around $44k a year. She talked me into buying her a new car last month. The car is in both of our names as I am a co-signer. Our current credit card debt is around $25k. All credit card debt is in my name with the exception of one credit card, which she is an authorized user.   So a few days ago things got weird with her. She started going out partying and yesterday tells me she wants to split up because she's not happy in our relationship. This has devastated me because now I'm loosing everything. She's sticking all of our accumulated debt directly onto me while she will be also taking our daughter. She said she hasn't been happy for around 6 months and was contemplating on leaving, meanwhile here I am digging myself deeper and deeper into debt, living almost off of credit cards. She basically used me to get through college and now that she's accepted a job, she's going to leave.   I'm not sure this is relevant, but she's currently on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, of which lately she has been throwing away. She has become unstable.   So here I am. I'm asking for advice on what I can do legally to force her to pay for half our accumulated debt? Do I have any legal recourse? I know I should seek an attorney but I really really cannot afford it right now. Please, please don't berate me on my situation. I know I messed up. I made many mistakes financially. I can blame my fiancé for her continuous false promises of stability financially, but at the end of the day, it's all on me. You have to understand, I'm in a really really low end of my life right now. The bottom just suddenly fell out. In the past 72 hours we went from talking about buying a house next year and living comfortably financially to: my family being torn in half, my daughter being taken away and being on the hook for $25k in debt plus a new car loan on top. I'm asking for advice not asking to be belittle for being a dupe. I already feel like crap and cannot handle anything else. Thank you for what help you can provide.	Yes
301	"My daughter is 5, my ex and I have not been together since she was a few months old. I have always had full custody, he did not request anything regarding visitations, etc. I filed for child support after we broke up. A few months later, he went to prison for a little over 3 years for domestic assault. I was under the impression that he could have had the child support modified due to the fact that he was no longer working, but the money kept coming every month and I never questioned it. We use the state child support system, and the amount was very low as he was not working very much before he was incarcerated. It didn't seem crazy to me that the payments were being made.   He has been out of prison for a little less than the same amount of time he was in. I had a RO against him for a year after he was out, but I let it expire because I did not feel that he was a threat (lives several hours away, made no attempts to contact me, etc). His mother sees her granddaughter a few times a year. She has mostly been pleasant enough, but is convinced her son is completely innocent and that I've ruined his life. I'm fine with us pretending to like each other for the sake of my child for a few hours every 6 months or so. We've never had any major problems.    I remarried while my ex was still in prison, and my husband and I have decided that we want to move forward with him adopting our daughter. We had the child support order terminated about 6 months ago. My ex did not show up to court, and we basically just said that we are a 2 parent household capable of supporting our child without support from an absent father. It was pretty easy. A few weeks ago, we had our lawyer send a letter to my ex's address that he was served his court summons at requesting that he comply in terminating his parental rights.   His mother has recently sent me a long and vicious email basically stating that she has been paying his child support the entire time the order was current and that she 1. wants all of the money back and 2. is planning on hiring lawyers to dispute parental rights termination for her son.   We are meeting with our lawyer next week, but I am just sitting here thinking of all the worst case scenarios in the meantime. I was honestly expecting this to go smoothly. My ex has never shown any interest in being a father, and I had figured he would be happy to no longer pay support.   I am having trouble finding any information online about the legality of paying somebody else's child support order. It seems to me that his mother made a conscious decision to pay every month despite having no obligations and me never asking her for anything. I can't imagine that she would have any right to this money back.   Furthermore, could this potentially help our case if we do have to sue for parental right termination? I basically have proof that my ex was not paying child support. This seemed like our biggest deterrent if we did have to sue, because the payments were made on time every month. I was just banking on the fact that I thought he would just sign rights over without issue.   I still do not know if my ex has even received this information. His address is a duplex that his mother owns, and she lives in the other unit, so it's possible that she intercepted his mail. I know he was served with the child support mod papers, but I can't say that he received this letter. I think our next step may be to send another copy through certified mail, which we probably should have done in the first place. I did not anticipate any of this happening.   Is there anything to do right now besides wait until Monday to talk to our lawyer? I feel like the answer to that is probably ""no"", but I feel really helpless and attacked right now and that's a shitty feeling. Any advice is appreciated."	Yes
302	"My parents are going through a very nasty divorce. My mum has announced she wanted a divorce in February, but my father didn't accept it. He simply said no. She insisted, went to several marriage counselors and relationship therapists. It has finally gotten to the point where they have signed to go through mediation.   My father and I never really got along, because he is a very dominant person, with several narcissistic personality traits. He has never accepted any opinion other than his own. My mum has been ""suppressed"" by him for over 30 years and it has drained her, making her depressed. Ever since puberty, when started to not blindly accept his opinions, we haven't gotten along. When I'm stating my opinion/interest whatsoever, he has to bring me down and disagree. But I digress.  My father is doing all the technical things in and around the house (even though I'm convinced I can do it more efficiently, he won't let me) so also our email provider. He created all our email adresses for us with our email provider. I immediately changed my password afterwards, but I used the same password as my computers, which he also knew, because he set that up too (stupid me).  Today he had to leave the house in a hurry and left his computer and light on in the office. He becomes really pissed off when someone leaves the light on in the house because of electricity costs or whatsoever, so I went in his office to turn his lights off, when I saw his email client open on his computer. I glanced a bit, debating whether I should turn his computer off too (because he turns off mine when I leave it on when I've left for 10 min), when I recognized my own emails in his email client. And emails addressed to my mum (and my mum only), and emails addressed to my sister. I looked into his email client and saw that this has been going on since the end of April, so roughly two months after the divorce decision. My father did not ask me for consent about this and I am wondering if this is legal or not and what I could do to make this stop. I already changed my email password again to something I'm 100% sure of he doesn't know.  TL;DR - My parents are going through a nasty divorce and I just discovered that my dad has been reading all emails, including my own, my mums and my sisters, without our consent. I consider this a serious breach of privacy and secrecy of correspondence. What can I do?"	Yes
303	Hi Reddit,  Sorry if this is lengthily there is a lot of background info. I live with my boyfriend and he has a 5yr old from a previous relationship. Last September it was discovered that the bio-mom's boyfriend was beating up the son and the mom was aware of it and also admitted to being complacent in the abuse. The DA refused to press charges saying that these cases are hard to get a convection on. The son was taken away from his mother and my boyfriend had sole physical custody for a period of two months. Then CPS agreed that the mother should get visitation rights and set out other guidelines she needed to follow. Note my boyfriend still has full legal custody.  The mother was told she had to attend parenting classes, attend personal therapy. That the cps agent would be doing monthly home inspections. She still lives with her parents, and that cps would meet with her once a month to check in. They went to court in February and the mother had done nothing. CPS recommended giving my boyfriend sole physical custody and determined she was an unfit mother. The court overruled that and gave her an extension to start the program. My boyfriend was obviously upset and tried to appeal but CPS told him they would follow up and ensure she was doing the things and that there would be home visits.  Since the last court date there is a new CPS worker and she is terrible. The son disclosed to my boyfriend that his mom was still dating his abuser and my boyfriend reported that to cps since it was violating court orders. CPS worker said there was no way to confirm it. A couple weeks ago when I was babysitting the boy he told me how if he doesn't listen his mom will hit him and that his grandpa beats him with a wooden spoon if he doesn't listen. I told this to cps &amp; put her supervisor on the email and never got a response. Also almost fot the whole month of June the mother refused to pick up her son at the scheduled times: while we obviously didn't mind the extra time my boyfriend had his lawyer file a complaint so it would be on the record. In response to this the CPS worker told my boyfriend he needs to take co-parenting classes to learn how to negotiate with his ex better.   They go to court in two weeks for another check in and today his ex sent him part of an email exchange she had with the worker asking some questions but the earlier part of the exchange is the worker and his ex talking about her getting more custody and some tax stuff which is not even in CPS' jurisdiction.   My boyfriend and I are very upset about this, not just that his son could end up spending more time with an abusive parent but simple because the worker has been in communication with the mom while ignoring any communication we've had. So my question is is there someone else to bring this up with outside if cps? Or should we have the lawyer bring it up in court? Also neither of us has dealt with CPS before so is there a way to appeal A decision from them?  Thanks!	Yes
304	"I am in the military. My wife is a veteran. We have two children (7 and 5). We are currently in Camp Pendleton, CA, but we submitted our wills to base legal in Quantico, VA (not sure if that is relevant).  When we were filling out our paperwork, my wife listed her younger sister and sister's husband as the guardians of our children should anything happen to us. I had listed my own older sister and her husband on my own paperwork. Unfortunately, when we went to sign and file the paperwork, the guy had recommended that she and I list the same people for guardianship. I changed the information on my will and my wife was upset with me because, I admit, we had agreed a few years prior that her sister would take the kids.   Then it turns out my wife had listed my sister in law as our children's guardian if anything were to happen to her (my wife) alone. She reasoned that because our daughter is high needs autistic, I would not be able to juggle her therapy appointments and my job in the USMC. I agreed reluctantly and a clause was added that I would get my children back when I ""stabilized"" enough and my SIL and/or a judge agreed that I had all my shit together in order to handle the kids and my work (it was all worded professionally, I just cant remember the exact phrasing).   I am considering filing another will (easy to do as it is a required item before deploying), but with my actual wishes depicted this time (MY sister gets my children if anything happens to us, handles their ""inheritance"", etc., and I get to keep my children if anything happens to my wife). Do I have to let my wife know if I do this?   Now, I know the odds of both my wife and I passing away at the same time are relatively low, but, in case it did happen, whose will would be honored regarding the kids' guardianship?  I know I will not be able to get my wife to change her mind about giving guardianship to her sister. Wife thinks my sister is much too busy with her 4 kids and she also takes care of our father, but that is why I think she would be perfect. My kids would grow up surrounded by family. I think her sister is not fit because she doesn't have any children and does not wish to have any. My children would grow up technically isolated because that is how my SIL and her husband live. They live in TX and are 300 miles away from any of SIL's and wife's family, not mention, three states away from CA where all of my own family lives. While, currently, my kids are much more used to my SIL than my sister, I know they will get used to my family in the coming months since we can now visit with them every few months.  Will it create much of a mess if I do anything I have written above? What *can* be done to try and change the first wills? Is there a way to cancel out my wife's will if I no longer agree with what is supposed to happen with our kids?  I know I was all over the place, so I will try to answer any questions that will help anyone get a better picture of the situation."	Yes
305	I am a naturalized citizen and have been planning to change my first and last name for quite a long time. Unfortunately, I am currently going through a divorce in the state of Illinois.   Will the court reject my request for a name change if I am going through a divorce?	Yes
306	I filed for custody for my 2 year old daughter in June 19. I received a letter from respondant's attorney stating that I failed to provide blank forms for a continuance. After going back to court they confirmed that I did not include it and advised me to contact a lawyer on how to respond. I do not have $2500 to hire a lawyer and they don't allow a payment plan. I'm not sure what to do. Please assist. Thank you.	Yes
307	Document - no. FDI-16-785520 Order to show cause regarding family centered case resolution   I got this in the mail last night due to mail fowarding. I cannot afford to go to California on Monday from my current state of Washington. I also have work on Monday. I'm scared of being thrown in jail if I do not appear. What can I do?    I only filed. My spouse was never served nor was any action taken beyond that initial filing.	Yes
308	"My husband likes to tell me that if I were to divorce him I wouldn't get any alimony. He seems to be under the impression that if I were to ""abandon"" the marriage then I'm not entitled to alimony. It's only if he were to divorce me that I would be given it.   I'm a stahm with only a high school diploma, so I wouldn't be making as much as him were I to get a job. Divorcing him would be me voluntarily giving up his pay and the lifestyle we have, so I wouldn't be awarded any alimony.   I don't think this is true. But I thought it couldn't hurt to ask r/legaladvice to find out for sure."	Yes
309	"First time asking for legal advice, so forgive me if this is maybe the wrong place?  Firstly im 24, living in Michigan. I was adopted privately when I was 2, after being removed from my birth mother's home for child endangerment.   Now, my adopted parents and I are estranged. My birth mom is actually deceased, she died in 06' and I have no idea who my birth father is as my parents have denied me access to my adoption file. My birth father also walked away when my birth mom got pregnant.   I'm wondering if its possible to legally unadopt myself? I identity with my birth name, my birth family  (who I found and am in contact with). I'm currently married so this wouldn't even effect my current last name, only what my legal ""maiden"" name is. Personally I want to be as completely removed from my adopted ""family"" as you can be. My adopted brother basically gives no fucks about his parents and I know for a fact I will be saddled with any sort of care for them, funeral costs etc if something happens. They are not my parents and I want to be untangled with them.  Is there any way to do this?"	Yes
310	Hi there, this is really sad and scary, but I think we've reached a point where we would no longer be helping our kids or ourselves to continue living together, and our goal will need to be divorce for everyone's happiness. That said, before I talk to my wife about this and we formalize a plan, I am looking for some advice about things I need to pay attention to to ensure equitable treatment around custody and financial wellbeing should things ever get to a contested divorce or otherwise acrimonious.  Children: My wife and I have child together (2) and a stepchild (7) (she is bio mom). We are on good terms with the father and he sees his child on weekend days.   Finances: We have separate accounts. My wife holds over $30K in debt on various cards and student loans. I have a few thousand debt on a line of credit. My name is on all the house papers and mortgage etc., hers was left off at time of purchase because we couldn't qualify for the mortgage with her debt. I can't see either one of us being able to hold onto the house if we divorce, we will need to sell it.  My fears are specific--that my wife will go on an out of control spending/gambling spree (she has a historic gambling problem) during a year of separation. She gets bitter and grudgey and this clouds her thinking when she is angry. Or, that my wife will play some unbeknownst to me card that allows her full custody of our child.   Any advice about steps to take before, during, or after discussions of separation would be appreciated.	Yes
311	"I live in Dallas, TX.   The mother and my child and I have a standard visitation court order. We got it made in Beaumont, TX because that's where she was living at the time. My rights are I get standard visitation: weekends, certain holidays, summers, etc. I also pay child support. Since our court order, my child's mother has been on a downhill slope. She's a stripper, a prostitute, she's on drugs, constantly getting new numbers/addresses/boyfriends. My son (4 years old) stays with his younger half-brother's (2 years old) grandparents and dad. They do not even live with her at this point. He's not potty trained, can't speak that well, hits himself when he's angry, isn't in school, has marks on him from her hitting him with a wooden solo on his butt. She isn't aware that we know all of this and have been keeping tabs on her. We've had multiple people tell us she's suicidal and need to take my son away before it's too late.   Today when I went to get him from her, I secretly video taped her giving me permission to keep my son while she ""takes some time to get her life together."" Now, what steps do I need to take from here? I want to get primary custody of him and have this documented so she can't have him. I'd honestly like to limit his visitation from her until she gets her life together. Do I call CPS, the courthouse where we got the court order? Also, if she wants him back sooner than we expect (we imagine she will change her mind quickly), do we have to give him back since she stated on video we can keep him or are we forced to abide by the court order regardless? Please give me advice on where to proceed from here. Thank you."	Yes
312	I am unable to locate my ex-spouse.  We are in contact with their lawyer; however, the lawyer will only accept service if we delay our case conference--I would like to maintain our case conference date so we can start filing motions.  However, they have mail forwarding from the house to their new address.  Can I send registered mail with return receipt / signature to the house, and let Canada Post deal with forwarding it to their new address?  Is this acceptable as service?  Does this make sense?	Yes
313	I'm self representing right now. My ex got an attorney and asked for a continuance. He was arrested but not charged since it was his first physical, and an apparent minor, offense. I have over 70 pages attached to the restraining order detailing the abuse, however, and the statement I wrote that I was going to say today included more dates of verbal abuse and threats.   I have a few questions.   My local DV legal aid may not be able to represent me due to having so many other cases, but I'm not in the financial situation to get a lawyer otherwise. I have called a few places to see their rates but I'm pretty sure it won't be possible. I'm also 32 weeks pregnant right now, 35 weeks when we go back.   So, my questions are:  - What should I do in order to be completely prepared for what this might consist of if I cannot find an attorney to represent me?   - I've googled and googled and googled. It seems honestly hopeless, but are there other organizations that can help me? (Trying not to name drop. It rhymes with Steve.)   - What should I expect from his attorney, if anything?  - His lawyer offered me a stipulation of a 6m-1y temporary restraining order. I've heard it's not wise to take it. Why?  Thank you in advance.	Yes
314	"A young friend of mine is 19 and has been bouncing around from house to house since she was around 17 because of her father and brother abusing her. She's constantly worried he'll find her and force her to come back like he did when she'd run away as a young teen. I've let her know that as she's an adult, he now has very little legal control over her. That was a relief to her, but her big fear now is he'll find a way to change that. I know that an adult can take the actions to legally have ""custody"" so to speak and control over another adult if that adult is mentally disabled and unable to make their own decisions and care for themselves. That's where the problem is. Part of his abuse was convincing everyone she's crazy. He would talk to her friends behind her back to tell them she's crazy, talk to all the adults she might report to with a sob story about her manipulative nature and tendency to lie, even talk to the therapist he got her after each session and tell her ""his"" side of everything and how it ""really"" happened. He had her on tons of meds with tons of diagnoses and going to a bunch of doctors. He covered it up when her brother sexually abused her and told everyone she made it up/ asked him to do it. Bottom line, she's got a VERY small circle of people who believe that she's NOT completely unstable. Right now she's lives with her boyfriend and is safe. Her fear is that he's going to convince everyone that she's so unstable that she can't care for herself and needs him to still be her guardian even as an adult. Is this legally possible and if so what should she do? She currently has very little money as she's been on the run and does not have a license (her dad wouldn't let her get one - he told her years ago she was going blind and could never drive because of it and that one day she'd loose her vision entirely. She only discovered she isn't going blind a year ago after an eye doctors appointment as an adult)."	Yes
315	"My sister's husband received his fifth DUI about a month ago while working out of town in Wisconsin. The court has ruled that he has to return to WI to serve time in September for six months to a year. This is his second time in jail and it has left him bitter and unpredictable towards my sister.  Last Friday night, he took the two kids to his parents house and refused to return them. He told my sister she could not have them and would not give her the gate code. She ended up calling the police and they told her since they were not separated, they could not bring the children back. This was the first time she ever called them because she feared that he  was lying and attempting to run off with them. When she let them know that he was an alcoholic about to go to jail, they told her they would investigate and if he had alcohol on him then they would call CPS to bring the kids back. Except, the police told him they were coming to check on him so he and his family hid any alcohol before they got there. The next day when he finally came back with the children, the oldest told my sister that his father had been drunk all night. He and his family claims my sister is ""crazy"" and that the police agreed. Now we fear that if the police truly said that then we have no help.  His actions make me fearful for the kids. There was a time once when he was caught trying to put one of the children in the backseat of  car while he was intoxicated. My sister caught him and stopped it. Though once they are separated and she's not there to monitor him, I'm afraid he'll do it again.  Now my sister refuses to leave because she wants to keep the house (even though I doubt she'll be able to pay for it with him gone). Does she have any rights to kick him out or keep the house while he's in jail? She is already filing for separation. The house is in a loan under his name but her name is also on the deed. What are her options for the next year as far as establishing custody and child support? I know documenting everything is an option. I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything else I should know."	Yes
316	Hi everyone, I (22f) have a question on how my husband and i should handle child support. So my husband is the military and we stationed in VA, he was recently contacted by social services about a former girlfriend who claims to have had his kid. Now we haven't done a paternity test yet, (we will have one done in about 2wks), but we are 98% the kid is his due to timing. So since we are pretty sure, my husband contacted the woman and spoke to her and discussed what it is she wanted for support and they both agreed to a few terms once the paternity test is completed and positive. So here is my question. The kid and mom are in TN and we are in VA, how do we go about through the court systems to sign something that states what we have agreed on since we are in different states?	Yes

I claimed myself on my tax returns last year, meaning my parents couldn't claim me. They proceeded to file an amended return on my behalf (without my knowledge/permission,) which caused me to owe the IRS $1200+, and my return to be garnished this year. They refuse to pay it. My mother also broke into my bank account yesterday, and transferred my savings into her account. When I called the bank to report fraud, she shut my phone off. I am planning to walk there myself (they hid the keys from me... yes, they're abusive narcs with whom I will be going NC when I move in a few weeks,) and my mom is saying she will report me as a missing person. Help!	Yes
318	This crap is so confusing. I'm sorry for the long winded stuff.  In the final hearing, the judge granted that her ex husband can have the internal PC components he wants by a third party. This was granted because there is no faith that he will not damage the computer and claim no knowledge. His brother is under his guise and affiliated and related to him. Is he a true third party or is this stoppable?	Yes
319	Hello everyone,  I'm located in Pinellas County, FL (city of St. Petersburg). I'm looking to add to my middle name/hyphenate it.  i.e. first, middle-middle, last name.  Do I have to file a petition for change of name to legally add this additional name to my middle name only?  I'm debating whether it's worth filing the paperwork, paying the fees &amp; investing the time.  Thanks in advance!	Yes
320	My wife served me with divorce papers last weekend. I have 30 days to file a response with the court in the county that she lives in.   My quick question is: when they say 'file a response with the court', does that mean I have to go in person, or can I mail it in? It'd take me three hours each way to get to the courthouse, so I'd rather not go there in person if I can avoid it.   Court is Washington County, Oregon.	Yes
321	I have an 18 year old brother who lives in the house with us. I'm 14 years old and very small for my age. Today I've been home and he gets home and I go outside and sees me once he's inside and looks at me and locks the door so that I can't get inside of the house. I dont really do anything but I do the same thing to him later on and while he was outside he grabbed my expensive mountain bike and threw it. I let him inside the house and he grabs me and shoves me. Then we're outside and he shoves me down a hill. Then I try to get inside and he grabs me and throws me back. I don't know what to do at this point. My mom says she can't punish him because she's not there?!? What do I honestly do? Can I press charges?	Yes
322	I received an order of protection (harassment, not stay-away) and a court date for family court. I cannot afford a lawyer and the public defender only talks to you when you show up to court. So I don't really know what's happening. I didn't do anything and I don't know what I'm charged with. What are the possible outcomes? Can I be convicted of a misdemeanor or felony in family court?	Yes
323	"Okay, so there's this huge conflict breaking our family apart right now, a lot of information is being thrown and I have remained neutral through all this.  So a few days ago my cousin, let's call him Joe. Joe started sending the female cousins sexually explicit text messages (not too sure of the content, but they've all said it's dirty, inappropriate, and flirty. Joe is I'm his 30s married for 10 years with 2 kids. All of the female cousins are over 18, and we live in Illinois, the United States. Joe also helped the eldest female cousin involved, we'll call her Sally, by helping her with her résumé. She sees the résumé being bait for starting to message her. The messages went on for a few days and even spread to other female cousins. Yesterday, Joe came on to the Family Whatsapp group chat and said his phone/account was hacked and to disregard any messages accordingly. His phone passcode is pretty easy and doesn't do 2-step verification. Joe and his wife left the group chat shortly and blocked a lot of people on social medias. Soon after another cousin, ""Simon"", said he was ready to kill someone, and me not knowing about the situation yet thought he was joking. So I commented, he then said now is not the time implying he was serious. Simon has a firearms license, but doesn't own any of his own (that I know of). He lives with his parents still. This morning, a few sentences were said that especially needed legal backing:  ""The police can't get involved, everyone is over 18 so there won't be a case""  ""Whatsapp encrypts all their data, if the government can't get in, a hacker can't""  Is there anything I can do to clarify anything? Especially those last 2 sentences were especially peculiar. Please help by any means. Thank you. I will answer any extra questions needed."	Yes
324	"Hey, so I just turned 17 and am in a kind of predicament with my parents. They think I'm a ""sociopath"" and a ""conniving whore"" (long story) and basically they want to kick me out. I am able to move out around Christmas, but my father has just informed me that he wants me out NOW. He made it sound as if he could just wave his hand and have me either sent to jail or committed to a mental institution. I tried to explain to him that in order to do any of that I would have to have committed a crime or actually be insane, both of which are not true in my case. However, I'm not sure...I told him ""I have a right to live in this house until I'm 18 unless I commit any crimes"" but I don't know if that's actually the case. So what are my rights as a 17 year old in PA? I seriously just need 4 months to raise enough money and graduate from high school, and then I will leave and hopefully never speak to these narcissists ever again.    Thanks"	Yes
325	"Going to try to make a long, complicated story short.  I had a brother, will call him ""Luke"", and his wife whom I'll call ""Lois"". Luke and Lois have been together since they were in middle school, and have had a long, happy relationship that resulted in their marriage. For years, they tried to build a family, and due to his low sperm count were unable to. Luke died in a car accident over a year ago, which devastated Lois.   Lois approached me recently, telling me that she and Luke had tried really hard to get pregnant, and were about to try fertility treatments. They had allegedly discussed the idea of asking me to provide sperm in case Luke wasn't able to. Lois says she still wants to have a baby, and wants it to be as close to being Luke's as possible... That's where I come in.   Lois wants me to be the baby's father. She says she wants nothing else from me, just the sperm.   Lois and I discussed this with my parents. They both seem really eager to get this done. You see, I never want kids of my own. I hate kids, and I hate relationships/women in general, so I'll likely never get married or have my own family. If I don't do this, our family's bloodline ends, and Lois will never have a baby related to Luke.   We haven't ironed out the details legally, and would like to know if it's possible to sign all my parental rights over to Lois, and if I can avoid mandatory child support and visitation. Again, I don't want to be involved in the child's life, and neither does Lois. Lois stated the child never needs to know that I am the father either if I desire it.  So any help/advice on this front would be great. I'm leaning towards doing it, mostly to help my parents and Lois out. State is New Jersey."	Yes
326	I can support myself because I get SSI and now I could be my own payee.  I just don't want to be conserved again.	Yes
327	My father was diagnosed with a form of dementia three years ago. He had also some problems with his heart and died approximately six months ago. My mother is also elderly and my sister had moved into their house under the pretense of helping my mother take care of my father.  My father had a whole life insurance policy which he'd been paying into since my sister and I were young children. He had always told us that the value was 600,000 and that we would each receive 300,000 upon his death. When I politely inquired my mother and sister about the policy, my sister told me that she was sole beneficiary of the life insurance policy and would get all of the proceeds.  I was very surprised since I had been promised the proceeds my entire life. My mother told me that she and my father could not afford the payments, and that three years ago my sister took over the payments and started giving my parents money to pay off the value of what my father had already put into it. This was in exchange for being made the sole beneficiary. My sister showed me the paperwork under extreme duress.   She didn't even get close to putting in the money that my father had put into it. I think that she took advantage of my father's dementia and my distance from the family and manipulated him into making her the sole beneficiary. Is there any way I can get the half of the policy that was promised to me, because she took advantage of the situation?	Yes
328	Hello! My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force. Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	Yes
329	Okay so there is a lot to this situation so I'm going to try and explain make it as easy to understand as I can. Also thank you ahead of time for any advice possible.  So I'll start with my sister which is who is inadequate of caring for my nephew. She has been on and off of drugs since before he was born. Though she did have a period of sobriety that lasted from when she found out she was pregnant up until my nephew was about three (he is currently about three and a half. In the past few months she has went completely off the rail. From doing drugs while she home alone with him, to have different men over while her fiance (I refer to him as my brother) is working out of town through the week. So about two months ago he found out about everything that was going on and that she had cheated on him in his own house. So as expected he told her to leave. So eventually it had been decided (and she finally agreed) that her and my nephew are to go out of state to live with my oldest sister and the father of my oldest sisters unborn child. This was thought to be the best situation for everyone in an attempt to put my nephew in the best situation considering the circumstances, which was to be with his mom in a safe environment and so his father could continue his work out of town. So that is just the beginning and sorry to how long the post is.  So in the last three weeks this is what has happened. She has decided to sleep with my oldest sister's father of her child, while also doing drugs with him. So my oldest sister left the house where they were living and moved out of state back home. So for about three weeks my younger sister, my nephew and the father of my oldest sisters unborn child were living in the house together. Yea I know, fucked up and trashy situation. So just two weeks ago my brother (father of my nephew) took time off work and convinced my sister to let him have my nephew for a week, with every intention of not letting her have him back due to the living conditions he was in. So now to the point we need some sort of guidance on what steps we should be taking so that he does not return back to her and that terrible situation.   Thank you to anyone that has any advice.	Yes
330	OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A THROWAWAY  Long story short, we reconciled after a period of not talking and went out drinking with one of her friends. Me and her went home, both pretty drunk, and during an argument (after a sex/kink scene that went really poorly and I ended up bleeding and in serious pain with no aftercare on her part), she smothered me with a pillow in order to get me to stop talking so she could sleep. I finally stopped fighting and she let up, and we both went to sleep. Later, I woke her up telling her how much she hurt me, and she said if she hurt me so much, then I should just get out and press charges.  I know she wasn't serious about me pressing charges and she was just trying to be mean by saying that (she knows I have a history of being the victim in a violent relationship and being scared about getting legal intervention) but I'm thinking about it now a week later. I remember thinking I was going to die at the hands of someone who said they loved me and how scared I was. Every time I've confronted her about it since then, she's ignored it and I have the screenshots for it (all confrontations were via text).   I don't think I have enough evidence, especially a week out, but I'm really scared that she will do this again to someone else. I know she is seeing someone else and I already warned them anonymously, but I'm still scared that she will do it again to someone unknowing. Should (can I??) press charges, or do I have no power in this situation anymore?	Yes
331	Posting for a friend since she doesn't fully understand Reddit. My friend is from Mississippi and struggling with depression and a recent suicide attempt. In an attempt to help herself and get better, she made an agreement (not in writing) with her mother and stepfather that they would look after her child, while she moved temporarily to Alabama to live with her father while she's working.  Recently she drove back to Mississippi to visit her child but her mother wouldn't allow her to see her child. An incident occurred where the police were called and she was told they couldn't keep her from the child, and if she needed them to they could go get her child for her. She elected not to do this because she felt it would traumatic to the child. She went back to Alabama without seeing her child.  Today, her mother emailed her father [this](http://imgur.com/a/qfvW8) and told him to print out page 6, have her sign it and get it notarized and then faxed back to her mother. My friend was not given the rest of the document until she pressed for it. Now her mother is telling her to sign and notarize the document and if she tries to take the child from them, she'll never see him again. She has text messages of this.  So what should my friend do? I told her to cease communication with her mother until she gets a lawyer and have all correspondence be between the lawyers. But she says she can't afford a lawyer and her mother knows that. Apparently her mother has hired one of the best in the state or something. I've linked her to lawhelp.com. She has not signed the affidavit, and refuses to. But she is scared that her mother and stepfather are trying to take her child away from her. What legal recourse does she have? Please feel free to ask questions and I'll try to respond in a timely manner to clarify anything.	Yes
332	My sister has asked me to post about this.   • She is 8 month pregnant and is about to give birth in Thailand.  • As the title has already stated, she is Thai (Bangkok), her husband is Chinese. (Yunnan province, Kunming city)  • My sister and her husband have only sign their marriage certificate in China; they didn't sign one in Thailand.  • She has asked a Thai lawyer who is her friend about this. The lawyer has said that in China, the child can only get the Chinese passport if both of the parents are Chinese. Therefore my sister's son will automatically only be qualified for Thai nationality. The lawyer, however, does not specialize in this field of legal matters.  • On a Thai platform, another Thai woman said that she has asked the China Embassy in Thailand and they said that if the birth certificate states that the child is Thai, they can only provide China's visa with annual renewal terms. However if the birth certificate states that the baby is 'not of Thai nationality', then the embassy can provide the child with the Chinese passport so the family can bring the child back to China to continue with the proceedings. When the woman went to ask at the district office, they said that since the mother is Thai, they can only state in the birth certificate that the child is Thai and cannot state that the child is 'not of Thai nationality'.  • My sister's in-laws have told her to not get the birth certificate at all and get all the proceedings done in China so the child gets the Chinese nationality. They are trying to force/convince my sister to make her son's nationality Chinese. They are using money and legal reasons to convince her but my sister doubts their knowledges dealing with legal matters as their have previously lie and made up stories to convince my sister of various things.  Questions: 1. Will my sister's son only qualify for Thai nationality?  2. If my sister is to have more children, will the terms be different if she is to give birth in China instead of Thailand?  3. Can my nephew, who is Thai, inherit his inheritance from his father who is Chinese? (My sister is worried that they may use this as reasons to force her to give birth in China and force her son to get the Chinese nationality.)	Yes
333	Hey, I thought I'd turn here for an answer to a question that I've been curious about. If someone aged 16 or 17 in the U.K. we're to get married, would they be automatically emancipated? Or would they still be under control of their parents?	Yes
334	In the final stages of a divorce as the defendant. She has a lawyer but I cannot afford one. Things have been pretty simple. Agreed on most of everything and planned on signing papers out of court. The papers arrived yesterday and there are a few things I don't agree with mostly being taking my son off of my insurance. Thought this was a harmless act but it added $150 to my child support. She won't budge on keeping him on mine. I really just want this all over with but I also want to stand up to this because I feel taken advantage of due to my ignorance. Is there anything I could do? Would I even have a shot if I took this to court without a lawyer?	Yes
335	Me and my sons mother are about to start our custody battle next month and in Virginia the judge usually sends parents to meditation first. We have talked about 50/50 custody before but now she is talking about her only wanting me to have visitation after filing a false protection  order against me to give her an advantage with custody. With the video evidence I have I expect that order to be dropped when I have my chance to present the evidence in a few days at the Protection order hearing.  My question is there is usually a discovery period where both parties present the evidence they plan to use at trial. Should I send her all the video evidence I do have, which is not good at all for in order to encourage her working everything out through meditation?	Yes
336	"Hi legal advice, let me first say thanks for any help you can give me! Secondly, I want to be clear I have done nothing yet, and I'm not sure I should, hence why I came to you.   My ex girlfriend and I have two kids together. For the most part we get along, but we have some serious flare ups from time to time. We didn't go to court because she has a past with DYFS (NJs more extreme cps) and we feared that we might both lose the kids if it came to a court fight. During our most recent argument I was at her apartment arguing with her over texts while she was at work and she had left her iPad there. While I couldn't access it, the main screen still shows texts messages as they come in to her.   So I'm sitting there fighting with her and I see her 2 sisters start texting her advice to take my ass to court, nail me to a cross, take all my money in child support and, best of all, ""we will have him with a gun in his mouth"". I of course took pictures and all. The sister advocating most harshly to break me and force me to suicide is actually a registered therapist.   I have a two fold question: first, she's registered in NJ, can she actually do anything besides provide advice to her sister?   Secondly, with the texts can I do anything to stop her? Last I heard she worked with at risk youth, so would her job do anything if I showed the texts to them?   Let me be clear, I DONT want to do anything, up until this situation I got along with my exes family. Even if I can do something, would it be worthwhile, as I'm sure there would be a serious shit storm? But are my hands tied?   TL;DR: my exes sister is a therapist and wants to make me commit suicide. What do?"	Yes
337	"I have been divorced for many years.  During the divorce I was ordered to pay my ex $300 a month and he was ordered to refinance and take my name off of the house and loan.  After an extended time of him not doing this I contacted my lawyer and asked why do I keep having to pay and he hasn't done anything he was ordered to do... after me nudging the attorney he finally let the judge know and the nudge put a ""Stay"" on my part of the order where I used to pay the $300 a month.  Years later and he (my ex) still hasn't done anything.  Does this mean years from now if he finally takes care of this I'm going to have to start paying him again while living on Social Security retirement or is there a time limit for someone to complete what a judge has ordered.   Needless to say I did not want to contact my attorney from years past he was worthless and I learned later he doesn't do divorces but only doors court cases for marijuana rights."	Yes
338	I'm divorcing my husband due to his alcoholism and verbal/emotional abuse, I have witnesses/recordings. We own a home, and had a joint savings account. He took all the savings, and wants to take over the house. He wants me to sign my half of the title to him, so I'm left with nothing. Plus he wants to jointly file taxes together so he gets half next year. I left a month ago. I paid my half of the bills for June, but he wants me to continue to pay my half. I'm lost and don't know what my rights are.	Yes
339	"I am 18 years old and decided to change my name for a fresh start along with starting a new college and moving away after coming to terms with how traumatized I've been for years because I was repeatedly trafficked and exploited at 12 years old by a stranger and wasn't honest with myself, my family, or the authorities about it up until it started eating me alive once I turned 18. Luckily I'm alive and healthy. There is currently an open case against him. When I testify, will he find out my new name?   I wrote this as the reason why on my petition and the lady judge said to me, ""not only am I granting this- my clerk is going to seal it""   I appreciate that. I didn't know that was going to happen. I have all my copies stating it. I'm happy because now I can start my new college under my name in 2 weeks, but how sealed is sealed? Like nobody at all can access this?   My father is actually a criminal lawyer but since he doesn't agree with this name change regardless of the reason I haven't been able to ask him for any advice and the clerks aren't really that friendly so I was in and out."	Yes
340	We all know how men get the shitty end of the deal in marriages and divorce. And we all know more and more men abandon the idea of marriage altogether. So it begs the question, if the court system isn't fair to men with no resolution in sight, how much can the marriage prenup be expanded such that it IS fair?  Example 1: Article about man having to pay $65,000 in child support for child that is not his.  I want to preemptively include, in the prenup, that in such a case I will not be responsible for aforementioned situation.  Example 2: Man makes more money than wife. Because I make more money, I can better support the child. Therefore, I want to include preemptively, in the prenup, that the child custody is solely mine.	Yes
341	He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.   He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there.   Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday.   What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.   TL:DR; Will trying for a green card marriage as a US citizen hurt the fact that I haven't been working legally (according to the IRS)?	Yes
342	I love and support my husband, despite the betrayal I feel after 13 years together (married 10) and 3 children.   Many problems arose in our marriage due to the secret he kept (I know it wasn't malicious, but still). The secret  caused me many tearful nights and physical stress, because he was generally critical, in bad moods, short with me.   My question is based on the 1 year separation clause that is required before divorce. There is zero chance of reconciliation, as he is not into women AT All.   Can I claim mental cruelty in this case? I feel that society has been cruel to him, but hiding this from me all these years has been cruel to me. Please see my posting history if you would like more background.	Yes
343	My sister is pregnant and she wants to get an abortion. In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.  So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.  Ideally they wouldn't ever know about it but let's assume they figure it out somehow, can I (or her) be in any legal trouble here?	Yes
344	Guys need your help. 💪🏼  Paternity test results came back &amp; says my DNA matches 0% with alleged daughter.   Shocked.  Wife says I'm the father (lie). But if the test was wrong &amp; it's true, let's take another test. She won't do it.   Takes my money, takes my music gear, runs away with daughter. Calls me from LAX airport trying to flee the country, but can't leave without my consent. I deny her exit. She hides. Still in USA somewhere under tourist visa. Scary. Just want this all the be fixed, and she's not cooperating.   Anyone know any good lawyers for divorce/visas?   A little embarrassing, but any help/advice is appreciated, please send me a message. 🙏🏼 Going through a crazy week right now &amp; need your support, please reach out to anyone that can help. She just threatened my life. This is serious.	Yes
345	Pretty much what the post said. It's been a month since he moved out. He still has a job and makes a little over 3k/mo. He has stopped paying our cellphone bill, our credit cards, taken me off all the bank accounts, took our car and stopped paying our rent (July is now way past due).   Once his grandmother found out she immediately paid out rent to stop the eviction process and started paying for some bills and school supplies for our two oldest children. She says he is going to pay her back and that I should not seek reimbursement for back hold support this month because of it.  Could any of the money she has given us be considered child support from him, even though it hasn't come from him personally? He probably won't even pay her back, a mutual friend said he's saving up to buy a motorcycle.	Yes
346	"Hi,  I just posted to financial advice and was told to post here too.    A little back story, my dad has fucked around on my mom, lied, cheated and hidden things in the past. My mom forgave him and he ""rededicated himself to her and god"". She loves him, and has always forgiven him, but now it's just too much.   So about three days ago my mother found evidence that my (step)father was trying to contact the woman with whom he has previously had an affair. She found the many searches for this woman’s phone number, address, social media, and so forth on his phone.   She has also found out that he has a secret credit card. It has a 6k limit with a 2.5K balance, last payment made a few weeks ago. He has always been in charge of finances, he makes over 100K and she, a school teacher now, makes only 28K. My father has always been in charge of the household bills, finances and is basically head of household in that aspect.   My mother has been under the impression that all bills were being paid. They have not.   My mother has a nervous system disorder which landed her in the Mayo Clinic for quite some time, running tests, spinal taps and so on. Recently both were involved in a car accident together. My father has stated that all the medical bills are being taken care of, however after recently checking my mother has found that his medical bills are paid and hers are not.   When my parents met, 16 years ago, my mother was in college. He helped her pay for her doctorate in molecular biology. She went on to work for NCAR, and to publish papers. My father decided it was time for him to pursue his dream and together they moved to florida. My mother could not find any work in Florida in her field and so decided to teach instead.   I bring this up because she has around 120K in student loans, none of which have been paid, and now works in public education. She has been out of the science world for so long she fears she will never find work that will make ends meet.   She has also found out that they have a “joint IRS lean”? I'm probably saying this wrong…so basically again, my dad said he was paying the taxes, he spend a lot of time as a contracted worker, and hasn't paid taxes at all. its 17K in back owed taxes. Again, I'm not familiar with this at all.   They own a sail boat that has both their names on it. She has currently taken up residence on the boat. I have asked her to change her DL and mailing address to the boat.   They do not own a home.   One paid off Explorer, maybe worth 5K   Her Mini Cooper is in my father’s name, not paid for. 17K owed.   Her credit score is now screwed because he has not paid anything in her name. Its maybe in the 400’s She really scared and wont talk with me at length about it.   28K a year.   120K in student debt.   5K in retirement in her name   Father has 401 K unknown amount   around 3K medical debt.   Terrible credit.   Not sure if she can afford a lawyer.   ANY advice would be so helpful. I love my mom, and she doesn't deserve this. I love my pops too…but right now I’m angry and he shouldn't be allowed to get away with this.   Contested divorce in state of florida runs 5-20 thousand, which she doesn't have. She does not qualify for legal aid, she has informed me."	Yes
347	"(Florida) I had our parenting plan modified in court and there is a paragraph that my ex and her attorney claim is ""open to interpretation"" I think that it is crystal clear but I would like to get some opinions.  Do I have to meet her half way when she picks them up AND when she returns them home or only when she picks them up (initial exchange)  Here is the paragraph in question: ""The father shall assist with the travel only for the initial exchange and  the mother is responsible for returning the children home. The father shall meet the mother at [location] to do the once per month exchange; the mother is responsible for picking up and returning the children for the summer and holiday timeshare.  The mother did not file a petition to relocate so shall bear the brunt of the burden of continuing the long distance timeshare."""	Yes
348	Hi, I am an 18 year old female who lives in NJ. Recently my mom discovered that she misplaced an envelope with almost all my legal documents. I could use some help finding in which order I should replace them and how to do so. Things I have: Birth certificate Bank statements A debit card with my name on it. Things I lost:  Drivers permit Social security card Passport Student ID from high school Don't have a state ID  Should I wait until I get my college ID to start trying to retrieve my permit and SSN? I'm really stuck on what to do.	Yes
349	Overview  * he's 24 * Got this girl pregnant, they dated maybe 2 or 3 weeks * She's 6 months along now * He lives in one state, she in another  I'm trying to get things situated from a legal standpoint so I can help make sure he has his ducks in a row. I'm going to operate under the assumption that he needs to be looking out for his own best interests (and also the baby's) and not assume she will..  What state laws apply for child support? What are some common things that he can get in order to help his life less hectic?   He's the type of person that will ignore hard decisions or conversations hoping it all just works out.  Any input is appreciated.	Yes
350	"She got a PFA against him for sexual battery or something along those lines. He was told in the paperwork for the PFA that he isn't allowed to contact her, their kids, or her family members. I don't recall if it said that he can't contact us to inquire about her or just at all.   Well I have been ignoring his texts and calls because I don't want to be involved but I have watched her mother and sister continuously respond to him.   He is very clearly violating the PFA by showing up there and dropping off coloring books for the kids. He texts and calls her. He also thinks that he will be able to return to her when the PFA ends.   Then he is texting her mother asking things like ""is she working today?"" ""Can I come by and see the babies?"" (When she is gone from the house). ""Can I go and mow the lawn?"" And just today he asked if her mother could text her and ask if he could have some money. Her mother has been responding and she said today that he could not because she (his wife) had to pay bills. Then he asked what bills.   Her sister gives him rides to work and gives him pictures of the kid and tells him how they are and such.   My question is, are they breaking the law by doing these things? I have already talked to both of them and told them that they aren't supposed to be doing this because he is violating the PFA.  They insist they want to keep him talking to find out if he has a lawyer and see if he files for divorce or not. Because apparently if he files for divorce first he gets the house and more pick of what he wants??  TL;DR Are you breaking the law by being a line of communication between someone who has a restraining order against them and the person who got the order?"	Yes
351	The kids are 9 and 15. Dad has every other weekend plus mutually agreed upon time. Mom is an alcoholic, usually in varying stages of recovery and relapse. She does have a parole officer and a record for beating up Dad.   She had an episode at the beginning of June and the kids have been living with Dad since, every other weekend with Mom. The PO was involved and she was to get treatment, but last i heard she didnt start said treatment until last week. She has a track record of asking for extra money from Dad for the kids or for herself. Sometimes she will take money for the kids and not spend it on them. The little one wanted to do softball in the spring, for instance. Dad gave her money, softball never happened. The little one also has some alarming anger issues (some sexual abuse years ago by the adult child of Dad's then girlfriend), and Mom hasn't kept him in counseling as agreed.   The big kid plans to move in with Dad, so there's bound to be some court in the near future, but what are the chances that Dad could get custody of the little one, too? I've heard that Minnesota is very friendly to Moms in custody cases. Dad isn't perfect by any means; he got a DUI a couple years back, but has no further record. I'm not sure the little one would say he wants to live with Dad (rules and chores and things).	Yes
352	I have recently gone through a really bad breakup and me and my family are being harassed by my ex. She calls from a blocked number, she somehow sees what I post on instagram even though she is blocked and I'm sure she doesn't have a fake account to follow me because I am on private and know who each follower is. I would just change my number but it goes beyond calls.   I don't want to have to do it because her family is cool and her dad works in the prison system but I really don't have a choice. She has physically hit me on multiple occasions, the night we broke up she ripped my shirt off and threw a cup at my head, she once started yelling loudly that I was physically hurting her and to stop hurting her even though we were just arguing (I called my mom and told her what she was doing in case she called the cops and I was arrested), it's just a total nightmare. She is diagnosed bipolar and has been 5150'd. When she was 5150'd I let them know she had been physical otherwise they wouldn't have take her.   Do I need to put all my family on the request for protection? Can I fill out the domestic violence one if I don't have proof of the violence? Also this seems like it should be the last of my worries but I have no time I can use to take off work because I've used it all from all the stress that has caused. Will the court let me request a specific date so I can not miss work?  Any help is appreciated. I can go a week with no calls and then once they start I get so anxious and sick to my stomach. I'm already in treatment for depression and anxiety and her contacting me is the only thing that causes it to flair up.	Yes
353	Alright so, my fiancee and I were dating pre turning 18 for me and she is a year younger. Before I turned 18 she got pregnant and now we're lost as what to do. We've been told since I am now 18 I can/will go to jail no matter what if I'm put on the birth certificate right away. So i cant sign it and have my ID so we can take our child home. But she was born on 29 Palms Naval base, and the Operation? was performed by a foreign doctor. Who left back to his home country with all his paperwork and she never had a birth certificate issued. now she would have to file a delayed registration of birth which will most likely take up to 6 months and still then get her idea. Our child will most likeyl be born by then. Any suggestions?	Yes
354	He has an attorney.  There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her.  Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	Yes
355	"This is a strange situation. I feel like I am being harassed in a really weird way.   I broke up with my ex (we'll call him ""John"") 6 years ago. Recently, I've been getting mail (bills, mostly) in John's name sent to my address. Debt collectors are calling my cell phone looking for him. And I even had a man come to my door to deliver a court summons to him! Whenever this happens, I return the mail to the sender. I tell the debt collectors they have the wrong number, etc.   For what it's worth, he was highly abusive. We went no contact after I kicked him out. But that didn't necessarily keep him from harassing me. He eventually stopped. But now he's using my mailing address and phone number as his contact information, and I think it's just a weird way of maintaining some ""control"" over me.  So what on Earth can I do about him using my information? Is this fraud?"	Yes
356	I recently filled for joint custody of my daughter in the state of West Virginia due to the mother not letting me see my child. The court date got set back and since then she moved out of state without the judges approval or filling for relocation. Me and her were never married. Is she able to do that ?	Yes
357	Parents of biological child mentioned were not  married, but the father abused his biological child's 10yo autistic half sibling (but not the neurotypical  biological child, toddler) and there is proof (yelling in face, cursing, pushing in video, sounds of hitting heard in another room but not seen on video, child heard/seen screaming, beung pushed around while naked because of bm accident, obviously traumatized in video) but no charges filed at the time of incident. Mom reported 1.5 years later when finally got courage to leave relationship (d.v.p.o).  Because of the evidence of abuse to the biologocal child's half-sibling, what are the chances of termination of father's rights to the biological child?	Yes
358	"Firstly I'm on mobile and my apologies if this is the wrong sub.  I have trouble cutting long stories short sorry. I have a 4 year old nephew who is the son of my sister. She is still legally married to the father but they haven't lived together since before nephew's first birthday. Husband lives with his mother in a house full of garbage because they're hoarders. There's literally garbage trails throughout the house. The dog goes to the bathroom in the house and it isn't cleaned up for days if at all. Husband has a minimum wage job and I believe his mother does as well. She is severely bipolar.  My sister, nephew, mom, and moms boyfriend all live together in a 3 bedroom 1 bath house. Sister and nephew share a room and a bed because my mother wants her own room. My 71 year old disabled grandma lives in the in law suite that used to be the garage at one point before we moved in. I'll call my grandmas part the ""downstairs"" and the main house the ""upstairs"" for less confusion and it's easier for me.  Nephew has to go downstairs to eat because no one upstairs feeds him real food. They give him chips or cookies if he says he's hungry. My grandma makes him actual meals and sits at the table with him. He also is still kind of potty training and he goes downstairs to go because my grandma doesn't yell at him to hurry up and stands on the other side of the door to reassure him, which he likes. Grandma is also the other one that takes him outside to play. My nephew doesn't go to any kind of school and he isn't vaccinated. He had almost all of his teeth pulled due to rot before he turned 4. The rest are capped and he's due to get a couple more pulled and capped. Kids got like all his teeth already. He hasn't been to a doctor in more than 2 years because of his unvaccinated state.  Everyone upstairs smokes weed and cigarettes constantly with the windows closed. That's another reason nephew likes being downstairs. They're careless about leaving things out where nephew gets to them. More than once he has picked up a bong and put his mouth on it or picked up a joint and ""smoked"" it. They yell at him for touching their stuff. My mother has burned him on the face with a cigarette and claimed it was a cold sore and then when she was called out she said she didn't realize he was behind her when she was talking. Nephew was 3 and he isn't a quiet kid. She also let him climb on the furniture and when he fell she yelled at him and made him lie down. When my sister and I got home 2 hours later his head was swollen and he had thrown up. We took him to the hospital and he had a concussion; he was also 3 at this time.  My sister just got a real job for the first time in 4 years after her second denial for disability happened. She worked under the table for a couple people through the years but claimed that she hallucinated and couldn't drive. Said the reason she left her husband (he left her) was because she couldn't get out of bed sometimes and needed her family's help to raise nephew. Heh.  My issue is I live out of state now and have for a year. I talk to my grandma and sister everyday so I know what's going on in the house. I didn't call when I lived there because I was in the house and I didn't want my nephew to be sent to a foster family or have cps come against me. I don't think if he was taken from my sister that he would go to his father because of the hoarding and animal issues. He has an uncle on his father's side but I don't think his wife would want to take on the ""burden"" of my nephew. She isn't a nice person. I will trek across the universe for my nephew in a heartbeat and have the space and means to care for him. He knows my fiance and I and we FaceTime about once a week. My fiance and I lived downstairs with my grandma for over a year before we moved here and everyday I took care of my nephew. My fiance works full time and makes good money to where I don't have to. I am worried though that my calling the state will come back against my grandma or worse they'll take nephew away and put him with a foster family because I am out of state but only a 5 hour drive."	Yes
359	So, I am dealing with a wife who is emotionally and physically abusive towards me. She will start yelling about a very minor issue and it can quickly turn to her breaking things, assaulting me, and destroying our personal property. She has gone as far as threatening to kill me at times. Once, it was over me telling her that we had to wait a couple days until I got paid to buy her some new make-up.  If I divorce my wife of less than three years, what generally happens as far as paying her any kind of support? I work and bring in our primary source of income. She receives a little bit of Social Security Disability every month for mental health issues (schizophrenia, paranoia, anxiety, and depression). We have no children together, but she has a twenty year old daughter who has never lived with us. My was previously married for 20 years. This is my first marriage. There is a considerable age gap between us. I am 26 and she is 43. We live in an apartment, have two older vehicles with no payments on them, but we are $18,000 in debt. I have no problem taking on the debt to avoid spousal support.  Is it okay for me to set up a hidden camera in the living room of our apartment that can record video and audio? I want to do this for a couple of reasons. First, I want to be able to press charges if she physically attacks me again and because of the way males are treated differently in domestic violence investigations, I want to have clear cut proof of innocence. Second, a personal protection order seems in order if I can document her threatening my life again. Basically, I need evidence for legal purposes. If I can set up the camera, would I have to tell her about the camera?  Disclaimer: I am not asking these questions to avoid a lawyer or chicken out of a divorce if it looks rough. Rather, I ask them because I want an honest opinion from someone who isn't trying to sell me their services. This will better help me prepare myself financially and mentally.   Extra details: I need to do this, and I know it will hurt, but it has to be done. She has refused all attempts to address the issues as a couple. She even shot down marriage counseling, which is provided completely free by my health insurance. No matter what she does or destroys, it's always my fault according to her. I will feel guilty for kicking her to the curb so to speak, but she refuses to get help. I cannot even spend time with friends or family unless I sneak out to see them because she will lash out at them for seemingly no reason as well. This is not at all healthy. 70% of the time, she is a good wife. Cooks, cleans, and takes care of everything at home. The other 30% is toxic. The problem is, you never know what will make her blow up and when it will happen.	Yes
360	Background: This one is tricky because I am in the army(until Nov) and my younger adopted  14 year old brother resides with my mother in California. She has a great heart at times but it is no secret her mental health is on the decline. And she is prone to tantrums of extreme anger in which she takes it out on my brother. My little sister and older brother that live there will attest to it. Our father passed away 9 months ago and so she is worse than ever but so are all of us and the tension is high and I constantly worry my little brothers emotional, mental and physical will being around her.  Questions:   How could I go about getting custody of him?  If I succeed is there a way for me to be given the state support she receives for him(that she frivolously spends away) after my father passed?	Yes
361	I fall 2016, my cousin lost custody of her children due to drug and abuse charges. My parents chose to foster them, and they lived with us for 4 months. However, we had to let them go back into the system, as they were in danger from their mother. DSS wouldn't supervise visits, she would show up announced, high or drunk, stole from us, among many other things. We made the hard choice to let them go into the foster system to try and protect them from their mother. Out of spite, their mother refused to allow visitation or any contact between us and the children. However, since then, the mother has lost any and all parental rights. I want to know if there's any way I, as a family member and former caregiver, could gain rights for visitation. I want to maintain a relationship with them, so that hopefully, once I have the means, I could adopt them and get them out of the system. I have no contact with their mother or their biological grandparents. TL;DR- I want legal visitation with my cousins who I fostered, as their mother has lost all rights.  Would this be possible? What channels would I need to go through to receive legal visitation? Thank you!	Yes
362	"Hi all, my wife and I bought a house in Silicon Valley almost a year ago.  I was on deployment so I was not home.  We used my VA loan, I put down $10k and she put down $72k down payment; this was after we had a joint account.  He family, mother, father, brother live in their house rent free for almost a year now.  Her uncle lives there with $1,000/month rent.  I'm back home now, and our relationship is very rocky.  I can't handle the constant verbal abuse and her caustic nature day in an day out.  I want out.    The problem is she cut down 4, 70ft birch trees in our back yard while I was gone, tore up all the grass and did the same to the front yard.  She wants to remodel everything.  I feel suffocated in this this house.  Should I wait to finish the remodeling and file divorce or do it now?  I'm going to get a divorce, but I want to hear your advices too.  I can't pull equity on the house until one year and as it is, the property price probably dropped due to her ""renovations""."	Yes
363	My ex-husband and I have been divorced for two years. Communication has always been challenging. I feel I have tried and tried to take the high road and handle any conflicts we have had in a mature manner. As long as I keep my mouth shut, things have gone smoothly but anytime I speak up at all, it becomes a massive problem.  He was verbally/mentally abusive when we were married. Controlling and angry. He is still very angry at me for things that happened while we were married, things that happened ten years ago are still brought up and thrown in my face. He calls me names, cusses me out, hangs up over and over only to call me right back to continue berating me for various things.  Right now we have joint legal custody, I have primary physical custody. He sees them fairly consistently, every Wednesday for 4 hours and every other weekend from 4pm Friday - 4pm Sunday.   I am strongly considering petitioning the court to modify our arrangement in hopes of following a parallel parenting plan. I am regularly taking our oldest child to therapy as it is and the kids are being negatively affected by our inability to communicate.   We've never modified anything since our divorce in 2015. What do I need to do to request and be granted a parallel parenting agreement?	Yes
364	What is the procedure to name change legally in MS. I have a minor who wants this before his permit next year. What paperwork do you need to present to license bureau for the name change on permit. How do you get gender marker changed for a child born in MS?	Yes
365	I'm a 30m in Florida dating a 30F. We were discussing what would happen after marriage and she mentioned that she would want a prenup to protect her parents.  I currently don't have many assets. My biggest asset being a car. I'm currently renting a house. I have about 15k in student loans. I have a good job. I can go into more detail if I need to.  Her income is currently significantly higher than mine. She's a very successful person. Her and her parents bought some property that's probably worth about 1.5mil. They both own houses on that property. She has two kids.   The issue: She would want a prenup to protect the property. I'm ok with that but I'd like to protect my best interest too. She wants me to pay rent and help her take care of the kids. I'm ok with that too. I'm just scared what would happen 10 years down the road if we got a divorce. Would I walk away with nothing after having helped raise her kids and pay rent for 10 years?  I was really hoping to not pay rent the rest of my life with nothing to show for it. Where is the middle ground in this?	Yes
366	I am 32 years old in Las Vegas, Nevada, and I saw my birth certificate for the first time when obtaining a new Real ID. While my parents are married now, they weren't married when I was born, and the father field is blank on the form.   I did some research, and I found that the certificate can be amended to add him. However, it's not something I want to bring up if there's no benefit to it.  Some information I found online indicated I would not be entitled to social security benefits if he were to pass away, which I'm not worried about.  What are some other consequences of him not being listed on my birth certificate?	Yes
367	A close friend of mine (16y) lives at home and is dependent. She has severe depression and PTSD. Her parents refuse to see this as a mental condition and rather see it as a plea for attention or just simply a mindset. They also refuse to take her to see any sort of doctor, to be prescribed any medication, or even to allow therapy or counseling. My question is this: Is what her parents are doing illegal? Would it be considered neglect or abuse? Are there grounds for talking to a lawyer?  TL;DR Read it, darn you.	Yes
368	This is gonna be a doozy.  I just became married on New Years. My wife had started working at a cell phone store to help with the bills. We have two girls. I have a step daughter from her previous marriage and a daughter of my own.  Things had been getting weird ever since an old friend came back from the Army and ended up getting a job at the same store.  All of her paychecks would go missing and she always had the craziest stories for instance: someone took her debit card at work and had been stealing money.  Fast forward and I just flat out ask her where all of her money has been going and why she was always acting weird. She finally admits to needing rehab. She and some of her coworkers had become addicted to pain pills and when she couldn't get pain pills she and her manager would shoot up with heroin.   I stick around to help her get sober a month goes by and things are still weird.  My friend/her coworker is also around a lot saying he just wants to help us through these times.  Out of nowhere I get pictures of them together (hes naked and kissing on her) and screenshots that were taken on her phone between my wife and my friend's messages talking about how they planned on getting married once she left me, how much they love each other, etc. These all came from a third party who ended up just being jealous because my wife wasn't sleeping with him instead.   This had apparently all started back in March.   I have friends saying I should fight for custody of my daughter, that I should get an EPO, and here she is saying she's done, admitting her mistakes and asking to move back in tomorrow night.   What legal routes can or should I take?	Yes
369	Hello my sister has Down syndrome and was recently put into a civil commitment by the court. We the family do not agree which is why it went to court. The services provider now is her temporary guardian for 1 year and has a lot of control. They have denied my sister coming to visit family which she really enjoys and desires. They have also controlled the visiting schedule. They say that she is being neglected when she comes to visit which we think is absurd. Basically I want to know our rights as family members and her rights as an individual in her circumstance.  In court they said they didn't want to cut out the family which is exactly what they are doing. Any help is appreciated.	Yes
370	So long story short. The final document was supposed have me taking Thanksgiving break parenting time on Odd years and her on Even but somewhere between all the drafts it got switched i didnt notice. It may not sound like a big deal but My Fiance's family always has their reunion here in GA (they are from Texas) on odd years. We were also planning to get married this year the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  Needless to say My fiance is pissed that I made a legal mistake that has compromised our plans and my Ex is pissed just because.   My Ex has been really easy going ever since she was granted permission to have the kids visit her for 3 weeks in MA. They just returned from their visit and everything has been civil until we recognized this error.   What can I do to fix my fuck up?	Yes
371	My father left when I was young and never paid any child support after the split. He has reached a debt of about $50,000 and is somewhere in Georgia or South Carolina. I still have a way of contact and could find him if need be. Being in college, I could really use this money he owes me to pay the bills and make a down payment on a house after graduation. My mom won't pursue the issue herself, despite him using my sister's social to rent homes only to not pay on them. What can I do to begin receiving payments or put him in jail? Thanks Reddit.	Yes
372	My friend has a 3 month old child. The father is someone whom she was in a relationship with, but they broke up before she found out she was pregnant. She didn't want his help so she didn't tell him, but a couple of months into her pregnancy he found out and begged her to let him be with them. She decided to give him a shot. He moved in with her a month before she gave birth to help out. He didn't help at all, actually the opposite. About 2 months in he hasn't fed the baby, changed a diaper, or got up once at night to help. She kicked him out a week ago after finding out he had been cheating on her. He made a huge scene and was refusing to leave. She had to call the cops to get him to go. He is now threatening her that he has a lawyer friend (this is true) and that if she doesn't see him every once and a while he will take her to court to get full custody. Does she have any outs in this situation, and what are the chances of him getting full custody if he does take her to court? She cannot afford a lawyer.	Yes
373	27, male, married for 11 months here. No kids or assets besides the house, bought in my name before marriage with all of my own money. Unofficially separated at 6 months. (Have a letter she wrote agreeing to leave if I asked her. I did, she changed her mind.) I make around 90k/year. Wife's name is not anywhere on the papers. She does not work and has never held a steady job. I filed for a no contest divorce, as we have no assets or children together. She was served two weeks ago. She says she is going to respond that she does not agree and wants to attempt to pursue a fault case on the grounds of adultery. She says she is going to go after the house and half of what I earn. Right now we live in the same house, although half the time I live with parents because I do not want to be around her. My lawyer has told me that I cannot kick her out of the house, but I also cannot afford both the house's mortgage and a new apartment for me to live in. She pays nothing toward the bills and is living in the house full time, as she has done throughout the whole marriage. She is able bodied but just refuses to work because she feels she doesn't have to. Is there anything I can do? How do I get her out? If  judge finds me at fault, is she entitled to the house and half of everything I own?	Yes
374	"Hello legaladvice! I am a long time reader, but this is an obvious throwaway because my main account is easily connected to my real name.   I have a 10 year old. ""M"" They are diagnosed with things that make their life a little more difficult, including being on the spectrum.   M called me upset over the weekend to tell me that they had been ""kicked out"". I asked M to clarify, thinking it was a game. M explained that they were having a disagreement with their stepparent ""SP"" and the SP got frustrated and threw M's clothes all in a bag, and then outside the door. SP then told M to go outside as well. When questioned further, the other parent was in full support of this action. M was brought back inside, after being asked if they were ready to be a good person now. They proceeded with the rest of their evening and M called me per our usual schedule, and that is when they let me in on what was happening.   There is more to the story - but that is the gist of it. When M's therapist was informed, the therapist reported M's other household to Child Protective Services. From what I understand CPS took the report very seriously, and I should expect contact from them.   Onto the current issue. As I was tucking in M just now, they stated that they did not want to go back to the other home. They said ""I am scared to go back, I don't feel safe there, and I don't want to get kicked out again.""   Our legal custody agreement is that M goes to the other parent before art camp tomorrow. Then afterwards we are all go to the regularly scheduled therapy session.   I can't really contact his therapist for advice, or even call a lawyer because it is so late. Hand off is before things open in the morning as well - so there isn't anything I can do between now and then.   The only two options I have thought of is: a) to take M to the pediatrician when they open and let M go in alone to tell the doctor how they are feeling.  b) to take M to the courthouse with me in the AM, missing the hand off, and getting an emergency order from the DA.   I also thought of just heading to the police station now to see if I could ask an officer what to do, but then my spouse reminded me of this sub.   So... am I totally screwed? How can I protect my child?"	Yes
375	"I got my son back from his fathers 2 weeks ago (The divorce papers say he is to go to his dads every other weekend). He had bruising on both upper arms. (They looked like hand prints) I asked my son what happened and he said ""Daddy grabbed me by both arms and threw me on my bed because I hurt my baby brother"" I directly took him to the doctor and the doctor felt it was necessary to call DCF (Department of Children and Families). When I got home I called the police. The police came and took a statement from me and looked at my sons arms and took pictures. The cops felt it was child abuse. The next day I call the Child Abuse Detective and he said this was corporal punishment not child abuse. So I told my sons father, to protect my son from it happening again or worse, that he will not be seeing my son until he takes me to court for it. Of course he got mad and said my son was lying but the proof was there. So that's the back story. My question is that  I'm wanting to move to Oklahoma to be with my sister and her husband. I will give my sons father summers and every other Christmas for visitation. I need to know how I go about doing that. Does anyone have any experience moving to a different state from Florida? How did it work out and what did you have to prove? I'm a medical assistant and would have a lot more job opportunities than I do here. Most places want bi lingual (Spanish and English) or 2-3 years experience. I do not have this skill or experience. Im also certified as a phlebotomist (blood drawing). I could work in a hospital or doctors office. I have looked up the jobs in Oklahoma and there's millions. In Florida, not so much.  Any advice on how to go about relocating would be very helpful."	Yes
376	My parents are bat shit crazy. They use to help watch my kids while I worked, but I didn't like their influence. We finally had a big blowing up with my parents and we haven't talked or seen them in 2 months. Now my parents are threatening to take me to court for grandparent rights. My kids have two married, financially and emotionally stable parents---do the grandparents have any sort of case here? I live in Kansas.	Yes
377	I'm hoping this will be coherent but my head is still kind of spinning so we'll see.   My brother(M21) and his fiancé(F26) have twin boys (6 months). They are not married, they rent an apartment together. He is sole earner, she stays home with the kids. He is an alcoholic, he's textbook abusive (gas lighting, emotional abuse and two weeks ago he pushed her around enough to leave bruises) and it has come to light he's been cheating for who knows how long.   My SIL (for lack of a better term) is at a loss of what to do. She's at her mother's with the kids, but apparently there is nothing legally stopping my brother from forcefully taking the kids and going to NJ. SIL is concerned for the kids safety, my brother consistently drives drunk. She has photo evidence of the bruises he left, the cheating, the horrible things he says to her. But she doesn't have the money to retain a lawyer. And he has grandparents who are well off and have paid his way out of trouble for 21 years. He keeps threatening her that if she leaves, she'll never see the boys again and that his grandparents will pay for the best lawyer to destroy her.   Please help me find resources for her. What options does she have? Will she lose her kids to someone so toxic and harmful?	Yes
378	Im Located in Florida, USA. Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old.    I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.    My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.   This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be safe with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.   I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The long litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!     tl/dr: ex wife keeps winning custody battle even though she knowingly is filling false accusations	Yes
379	"I am in awe that there is a subreddit for legal advice. August 1st will mark a year since I've seen my daughter. Her mother for no reason other than to hurt me stopped ""letting"" me see my daughter. We have never been to court for custody or child support and I am not concerned with having to pay child support. My daughter is now 6, ive missed her birthday Christmas thanksgiving first say of school!!! Easter Halloween new years everything. I've texted and pleaded with her mother to try and co parent with me. Ive asked Her several times why she is doing this and I've never gotten a reply. The only reply I've ever gotten is her telling me if I want to see my daughter I had to pay the last few months of child support which was 5 months after my ex stopped letting me see her. I live in Georgia, sorry I know I should mention that. I could keep on literally all night long but I have always done everything I could for my daughter. I've been employed the entire time, always split everything with my ex, took my daughter to school (picked up daughter from ex's house and took her to daycare) every morning, she stayed with me on the weekends and some nights during the week. My daughter and I were so close it absolutely wrecks me to think that maybe she thinks I'm not there because I don't love her. I have no idea what she's been telling my daughter but my daughter and I love each other more than anything in the world. She made me promise I wouldn't leave her there and I would come back the last time I saw her. I have not been able to be myself for a year now, such a huge part of my life and heart missing. Thank you so much for any advice I have been lost about this and have always hoped her mother would stop doing this. can anyone tell me what I need to do and how it would go? Thank you so much!!"	Yes
380	All involved parties live in Georgia.   The following language exists in my divorce agreement (signed and executed by a judge) revolving the submission of expenses for reimbursement of child medical expenses. &gt;  &gt; “Following the execution of this Agreement, if the Plaintiff incurs any out-of-pocket medical expense for the minor children, she shall submit to the Defendant, within thirty (30) days of receipt, an Explanation of Benefits, bills, receipts, or other documentation showing: the date of service, the Minor Child for whom the expenses were incurred, the provider, the amount of the expense, and the purpose of the expense. Such documentation must be complete copies and shall be posted to OurFamilyWizard as described herein. The Defendant shall then have thirty (30) days from the posting of the Documentation to OurFamilyWizard to reimburse the Plaintiff for 35% of the out-of-pocket expenses. If the Plaintiff fails to provide documentation of payment within thirty (30) days of herself receiving the Documentation, then she shall have waived her right to seek reimbursement for said expenses.”  My X made a medical payment on June 16th, at which time she received a receipt and the standard documentation of the medical service. She sent me pictures today (1 Aug) of the dated documentation. There is NOTHING else in the agreement that references this type of issue.  **QUESTION: She claims that her “30 day timer” doesn’t start until she gets the EOB, which she says she still doesn’t have.  I believe that her “30 day timer” started the day she received the receipt and documentation from the medical provider. Who is correct? If a lawyer answers, could you possibly provide a case?**  *NOTE: I'm still going to pay my portion of the child's medical expense because it's the right thing to do.*	Yes
381	Hey all. My girlfriend's brother (17) is currently in custody dispute between his mother and father. His father is abusive both physically and emotionally, but has the legal right to him. He moved with his mother at the start of the summer and was supposed to start school in the fall. The father now wants him back.   The mother is convinced that there's nothing to be done about the situation, and he has to go back with his father. He has lived with his mother his entire life, but he had been struggling in school and was held back a year. The father lived in a better area as far as schooling for children like him was concerned, so the mother gave him to his father and paid child support last year to see if things would turn around in school. Her brother now wants to live with his mother again because of the abuse, but his father wants him back.   The father is also in custody of a baby girl whose mother is a drug addict, who is not in the picture. Her brother does not really want to go to anyone and say he abuses him because then he could lose custody of the little girl, whose mother doesn't want her.   I had asked him to talk to his father and tell him that he wanted to live with his mother, and he needed him to sign the papers or he would get the courts/law involved. If he wanted to keep the baby, he would have to sign, and if he didn't, then that's not a parent the baby needs either. He is now convinced that if he were to do that, the father would tell everyone who is in his house (a few other people, mostly adults,) that he was lying and he's not abusive at all.  What can my girlfriend's brother do about this? LEgally, if he does go to the cops and say he's afraid to go back, and the father had people vouch that he wasn't abusive, what would happen? I want to be able to help him out, but I don't know what rights he has, and what he can do at this point.    Thanks for any help. This is in Michigan if that matters for state laws.	Yes
382	So this is a bit of a shit storm my  gf got me into. As stated above we got into an argument and the cops were called. my gf is an alcoholic, and started to tell the cops about how i hit her in the past even though these were very false allegations. now i wasn't talked to or even approached by the police. she signed a waiver stating she didn't want to have me arrested. we received a letter in the mail yesterday from the local police dept trying to get her to contact a detective to gather evidence against me to get a warrant for a crime i didn't commit. she said she would call them and let them know she didn't want to press charges or anything against me. should i lawyer up? can a case be built against me if i wasn't even talked to that night and my gf doesn't want to pursue it?	Yes
383	I'm posting this on behalf of my girlfriend to find some answers. My girlfriend (23) is a single mother of a 3 (almost 4) year old. Her daughters father went to prison a few months before she was born (Child Sex Offender). He's now being released fairly early cause of a new law in California to let non-violent criminals out, something along those lines. My girlfriend didn't look for any government assistance or legal help during these 4 years. She's received no financial support from her baby daddy or his family and raised her daughter on her own with help from her own family. The father isn't even on the birth certificate.   It's tough for her right now. She has 2 jobs but doesn't make nearly as  close to what she needs. Her parents don't financially assist her aside from helping her pay for insurance. Now her baby daddy's family is buying him a house and car when he gets out of prison. She freaking out cause she has a car payment, credit card payment, rent, etc. while trying to support her daughter working minimum wage at 1 job and works event scheduling at the other. So fairly inconsistent.   I always tried pushing her to find legal advice, but she terrible looking for help, especially with this situation. Her baby daddy's mom promised to send money her way for support but never did. Now with him getting out of prison, she wants to take action against him. I can go a bit more in depth if needed.	Yes
384	"Location Ohio  I have a friend(45 years old) that has a 16 year old daughter with a woman(42). He is not on the birth certificate, but has accepted financial responsibility for the past 16 years through child support payments and has been granted limited rights. ie 2 weekends a months and some holidays. The daughter and her father have a great relationship as in amazing relationship. The mother and daughter have a very strained relationship.  Part 1: Well it turns out, that he is potentially not the father. The supposed bio dad has shown up and apparently did a DNA test without a court order, but at a known medical facility, with the bio dad, daughter and mother present and ""claims"" the DNA test matches the supposed bio dad. No proof has been submitted to the court. Although the mother claims that the bio dad intends on fighting for his rights.  What could possibly happen to my friends relationship with his daughter. He's worried that he will lose his rights to spend time with her.  Part 2: My friend claims to now have proof that the mother defrauded my friend this whole time and knew that my friend was not the father, but allowed my friend to believe that he was the father because he is financially well off. At this time the Bio dad is MORE well off than my friend so now the mother is trying to get the Bio dad established as the ""father"".  Are there any options that you can explore if you have been tricked into supporting a child that is not yours, without jeopardizing any rights to that child.  Part 3: My friend wants to buy his daughter, now 16 a car, keep it in his name, pay the insurance and allow her to drive it.  Could the mother take away the car, not allow her to drive it and more importantly call the law if the daughter drove this car to my friends house, outside of the court ordered visitation?  TY =)"	Yes
385	"In the ugliest of all ugly custody battles: The mom accuses the dad of stalking (not true), and says he's not allowed to go near her house.  There is no court order to enforce that, but she's said in text messages ""you are to stay away from my house."" There was one time he went to drop them off and didn't see until afterward that she had texted him to stay away, and she told him ""you are now harassing me, you have been reported to the police.""  The kicker is - he never goes into her driveway (because of past demands to ""GET OFF MY PROPERTY""), he parks on the street to let the kids out.  So if he doesn't go into her driveway, is he doing anything wrong? Isn't that city property?  He obeys usually, it's just that one time that he honestly didn't see the text that worries me because she said it ""was reported.""  And all he ever does there is pick up or drop off the kids so they don't have to walk.  Can he get in trouble for this?"	Yes
386	I'm not sure if this is the proper place to post but I'm really lost and need someone to help me. I want to get a job, the problem is that the only documents I have to my name are my birth certificate and my social security card. In order to get a job I'll need more than only that according to what ive found on the internet. here is what I was going off of https://www.vec.virginia.gov/docs/generaldocs/documents/i_9.pdf now this says that I can either obtain an item from list A or B and have enough to get a job. I was looking into getting my Permit / ID card but those require more documents I don't have https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/webdoc/pdf/dmv141.pdf . I'm really lost as to what I can do about this, I think in most states id be fine but since VA has laws requiring you to provide proof of legal presence im going to need to find some form of identification.        Here are some bonus details -    1. I'm 18.    2. I've had jobs in the past, before i was using a school issued ID card but I don't go to school anymore.    3. I dropped out of high school, but I did earn my GED.        from what i can tell i need documents i dont have to get the documents i dont have, there has to be a way around this problem. any help would be greatly appreciate, thank you in advance!	Yes
387	My boyfriend is the person in question. His parents had an extremely messy divorce 8 years ago; they have had joint custody (physical and legal) since then, with the kids switching houses every week. The legal battle has been going on all of the past 8 years. The parents are very hostile, and they hardly speak to each other.  His dad is a hedonistic, power-obsessed monster, and he's been consistently emotionally abusive. He is also an attorney, which is what worries me. His mom didn't work during the marriage, but she's since started her own business helping autistic children. She's not without her faults, but she truly cares and wants the best for him.  Recently, things have escalated greatly. My boyfriend is transgender, and he came out to his parents very recently. His mom is very supportive. His dad is not.  His mom had a major lung surgery earlier today in Boston (we live in North Carolina). My boyfriend is staying with his dad. His dad has taken away his phone, computer, and car, and he's not allowing him to leave the house.  I've talked to him on the house phone, and he's very scared and doesn't feel safe. He talked to his mom who said that they could fly him up to Boston tomorrow, but his dad has said he can't go. He doesn't want to live with his dad; he's repeatedly said that it's not healthy for him to be in that house anymore.  I'm seventeen years old. I have no idea what to do. First step is getting him to Boston. It's his mom's week, so I don't think his dad can stop him. Then there's the custody piece. This might have an easy answer, but I have no idea. Please any help is enormously appreciated; thank you so much.	Yes
388	So my husband left me basically overnight for a coworker of his. I've tried to be nice and let him see our son and even take him to his house that he shares with his new girlfriend.  My problem is that he will not see him unless he can take our son there and I'm uncomfortable with this because I don't know where they live or what the house is like therefore I have no idea where my 3 year old is when he's with his dad. His girlfriend is only 18 (he's 26) and has friends over etc. I don't know any of these people so I'm uncomfortable with it.  I have no money for a lawyer yet don't qualify for legal aid. I don't know what to do. I understand I can do a temporary custody order but I don't know how fast those are effective or how to fill out the forms or anything... any help would be appreciated I'm lost.	Yes
389	Just a few days ago, on the 26th, my wife assaulted me and my 8yr old daughter and jeopardized the well being of our 1yr old daughter.  She was recorded as threatening to kill herself if her daughter was taken away.  She was charged with assault in the 3rd degree and domestic mischief in the 4th degree in King County, Washington.  The next day I left with my girls for my father's house in Oregon while I processed what happened.    There is a no-contact order the state put in place for me, but currently nothing protecting my daughters.  I will be going to court tomorrow to file a protection order.    For the last two days she has been contacting me through her third-party advocate, which she's entitled to, to try and schedule visitation with our daughter.  When depressed and angry she has taken our daughter away unannounced and without telling me where she was going or when she'd be coming back (never overnight and no official record of this) and because she is Turkish and without a job or any family here I'm exceedingly concerned that she will try to take our daughter out of state or out of the country.  She is saying that I am preventing her from seeing our daughter and am violating her motherly rights since there isn't any court order preventing her from being with her daughter.  I want to facilitate their visitation, but I believe it needs to be state supervised because there is no order in place preventing her from leaving with our daughter.  The volunteer state advocate I spoke with this morning assured me that I do not need to provide visitation and didn't think that it would look bad in the eyes of a judge who will inevitably be ruling on custody to wait one extra day to see the court.  My daughter is my #1 priority and she is doing terrific without her mother here.  She is sleeping and eating well and in good spirits.  Her mother called an officer to my father's house yesterday morning to perform a wellness check on our daughter and he verified she was well.    I can't help but be terrified that I'm doing something wrong and jeopardizing the upcoming custody battle.  Being Sunday I can't talk with an attorney, so I'm reaching out to you, Reddit.  Am I doing the right thing or is there something else I could do or haven't considered?	Yes
390	"My biological father left my mother when I was about 1 or 2. I've met the man a total of 2 times in my 22 years on this Earth. This man, still owes about 8k in arrears. Since I am now over the age of 18 and living on my own and now that he has 3+ other kids, he wants me/my mother to sign away the remaining child support balance so he ""doesn't have to deal with us anymore."" All I want is for him to leave me and my mother alone and to pay his dues. I will not sign anything away, because I firmly believe he needs to act like an adult and take care of his problems instead of trying to take the easy way out.  Since the initial contact months ago, he had managed to find out where I worked (I have a new job now) and had harassed some of my coworkers, trying to get information about me. He has also tried on multiple times to pay us off a portion of the money so we will sign away the remaining balance. Do I have any option of taking this to court since he is essentially trying to bribe us into signing? Or is my only option to get a restraining order/no contact order to stop the harassment?  TL;DR Biological Father trying to avoid paying arrears by trying to bribe my mother/myself with a lump sum of cash."	Yes
391	(NC) - A GAL has been assigned to our case, per my ex-husband's request. I have paid my half of the fee and signed the contract - he still has not. Court is on Aug 24th to determine if I can move out of state and if yes, grant a temp custody order. A custody hearing will be held Nov 22, my ex filed a counter-motion seeking full custody in my response to my motion requesting to move to another state. What impact will it have on the case of HR continues to procrastinate on the GAL payment/contract in order to force a delay? Will a judge see his ploy or just grant the continuance even though it is a red calender date for both hearings?	Yes
392	Maine, USA  My exhusband and I purchased a house while married, however when we got divorced he agreed to continue making payments on the property and that if in a year he was unable to refinance the house would be put on the market and sold. This was in November of 2016.  However, I recently discovered that he has not made a single payment on the property since we split up in June 2016. The reason I wasn't notified earlier was because he changed the address they were sending past due statements to without my knowledge.   I received a forwarded letter to my current address from the bank that our mortgage is through with an intent to foreclose slated to be done on August 4th if the current 13 missed payments, interest and escrow is not paid by that date. Recently I have come into money that would allow me to pay this debt off and continue making current payments on the house to keep it out of risk of foreclosure again in the future.  To my knowledge my ex spouse no longer lives there at the property but has tenants. What he is doing with the tenants check every month I couldn't tell you.   My question is that even though in our divorce agreement he was going to take ownership of the house, is it possible to go back to court and use this information to take back the property and evict the current tenants? And would the court be willing to have an expedited court date to speed up this process? The loan is still in both of our names.	Yes
393	For context, my friend turned 18 at the end of October 2016. This drama didn't begin until well after that, around March 2017.   Her mother and step-father are not nice people, nor are they particularly intelligent (I'm putting this very, *very* lightly). For years, she's been told by doctors that she has both depression and anxiety (unmedicated until a couple weeks ago), but due to religious reasons/political differences, her mother insisted she be tested for autism. So she was, and the results came back saying that she has provisional aspergers; this means that she showed some symptoms, but those could just be byproducts of her unmedicated depression/anxiety combo. Her mother does not seem to grasp this at all, and insists that she 100% has autism, treating her as if she's a young child.   During a certain event a month ago (far too long to explain here, as it goes too far off topic), police were intervening, and her mother was howling about how she had paperwork proving that my friend cannot make her own decisions (we were trying to pick her up to take her to a comedy show), so she cannot decide to leave with her friends, and threatened to press charges on us for attempted kidnapping. She merely showed the cops the paper that diagnosed my friend with provisional aspergers and the cops had her go home with her parents, no other arguments permitted.   However, after chatting with someone this week whose parents/younger brother have actually gone through the process of gaining legal guardianship over someone 18+ years old, it came to my attention that her mother might be lying, or that she's forged some documents. We're not sure. I've done some light digging (some of which was very confusing to read), and it seems that, on the basic level, certain paperwork needed to be submitted, court dates needed to be set up/attended, and above all else, my friend should have been informed that all of this was happening (if it actually was). She received no notice whatsoever of anything like this.   So my big question here is: Is it AT ALL possible that her mother was able to sneakily obtain the legal stuff necessary with ZERO consent or knowledge from my friend, since she is not a minor? (And a second less pressing question, which you can ignore if you want since it's not the main focus: Are there any important things we should keep in mind if her mother presses this further, or if there's a confrontation over it?)	Yes
394	Hello. My father is abusive not physcially but is down right evil and awfull.  We are stuck in this shitty situation. My parents never taught us how to drive. And we never went to college. Cuz no money. Now im wondering the house was given to my mom from her father. All the bills are in my fathers name. My mom and dad have a shared bank account but hes the holder. I dont think if we went to any law for help it would be in our favor because of that. Any help? Do i need to start recording his crazy antics?	Yes
395	My ex files a motion and somehow convinced a judge that I have something that belongs to her. I am in another state and I don't have that thing. Will that make me automatically in contempt ? The order she sent me before the hearing (which was decided on the papers) called for issuing a warrant for my arrest if I don't return that think.  What will probably happen. Is the worst case scenario of actually being arrested a possibility ?	Yes
396	[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)   Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!  Long version:  If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.  She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.  The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.  So I have my baby daughter!  Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job!   As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.  Thank you all.	Yes
397	My aunt died of cancer a year ago in August. She left behind my niece with her father. He immediately threw everything that belonged to her mother out and quit his job a month later. We are not sure if my aunt had an insurance policy or if they are receiving death benefits, but he hasn't not worked yet, but the cars and mortgage are still being paid.  He never got my niece counseling, and doesn't take her anywhere; she takes the bus to school. He doesn't buy groceries and is in the garage drinking all day, or at his families drinking and he leaves her alone. He doesn't have insurance on her, not even Medicaid. My mom can't get her healthcare because she doesn't have any documentation, and my niece doesn't have access to her documentation like her SSN and birth certificate.  My mother went to visit with my BIL and my niece told her she had no food. My mother and BIL both checked and there was nothing but a bit of frozen chicken. When my mom confronted my cousin (he is my cousin on my Dad's side, who married my mom's sister) he said there was food and freaked out. He was cursing her out. My mother ended up buying groceries and hiding them in my niece's room.   My niece was raised at my mothers house until she was like 6 or 7 as her parents were staying with my mom. What can my mother do to gain custody of her sister's child? My mother is very financially comfortable and has more than enough room for her. My mom normally takes care of her for the summer and she is here now. I know my cousin will put up a fight, and my niece is counting the years left until she is 18 and is very lonely and depressed.	Yes
398	This is in Canada. A friend of mine recently got through a relationship with an abusive boyfriend who emotionally abused her, threatened her, and leaked her nude photos after they broke up. There's strong evidence of him being a pathological liar and generally a sociopath.  He recently got a new girlfriend (a few months ago) and proposed to her. She broke up with him (told us about it and was okay with it because she already was getting the suspicion he was a sociopath), and two days later she committed suicide. She suffers from depression, but it seems really unlikely that she'd commit suicide out of the blue unless her ex was threatening or abusing her.   My friend doesn't want to go to the police about her own experience with emotional abuse from him because she was a minor at the time when she was dating him (she's not a minor currently), and believes that the police will be forced to notify her parents.  So my question is twofold - first, will the police search through the recently deceased girl's phone, facebook, and other messages to determine the reason for her death if not prompted? And if not, is it possible for my friend to tell the police about her own situation without the police informing her family?  tl;dr: Very likely that abusive boyfriend made his recent ex kill herself. Will the police investigate without being prompted? Can someone give information to the police without parents ever being notified (they live at home)?	Yes
399	Hello community. I need some advice how to proceed. I cannot afford an attorney. Been there, done that, came away with a huge hole in my pocket and nothing to show for it. I share a son with an ex husband. At the time of our divorce the halfway point for pick ups and drop offs was designated in the court order. I've since moved and as such so has the halfway point. My ex husband is now outright refusing to meet me in a new location. Just keeps stating pick up/drop off is in court order, blah blah blah. Can I contact the court directly to ask to see a mediator to rectify this? Any and all advice is much appreciated. Thank you in advance!	Yes
400	"So my mother is going after GPR here in Idaho, my wife smoked pot about 2 weeks ago, when I was upset with my wife, I casually mentioned this fact to my mother and now she wants to go for grandparents rights. Yay. So, if my wife took a ""trip"" to a state where it was legal, could it be held accountable against her in court for a follicle test if when she did it was technically considered legal?"	Yes
401	"My son's father has his visits in WA state (for the month of July), I reside in FL. I found out through my son they were planning on taking a plane flight to CA without telling me. I can't pinpoint my question but I feel there's something not right about leaving me ""out of the loop""."	Yes
402	My wife is mentally ill and is flipping back and forth between being a loving, caring wife to not speaking to me for weeks at a time. I am aware of her illness and I have been trying to take us both to counseling, however she refuses and sabotages my attempts.    We do not live together any longer, she is with her parents and I have my own place. I am employed (two jobs) and her main source of income comes from webcamming (nude/masturbation shows) and although she still makes a substantial bit of money she is refusing to move out of her parents house.  I want to gain sole custody of my 2 sons, yet I cannot afford a lawyer at this current time.	Yes
403	I have been the victim of what was deemed a case of domestic violence. Specifically, my SO was charged with Domestic Violence 4th degree for some injuries I sustained while he tried to restrain me over the course of 3 hours during an alcohol-fueled psychotic break.  I was hospitalized in a psych facility the following day and spent 5 days there in recovery, where I was (after some time of knowing something wasn't right) finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features and prescribed a heavily sedating antipsychotic.  During those 3 hours I mentioned, which are fragmented in my memory, a witness described me as being extremely combative toward others and myself while also trying to hurl myself into traffic. That witness was my own mother, who arrived an hour into the incident. The responding officers, however, refused to formally interview her and I was too disoriented to give a detailed account of what had happened at that time (I blacked out).  I wholeheartedly believe the situation was more suited for an ememergency psychiatric team, and while my SO should have called the police sooner, he feared for my well-being and put it off for much too long. He took the blame for many of my self-inflicted injuries when the police eventually responded to the scene, as I could not recall what had happened.  Now that I am in a more clear mental state, I would like to do what I can to help him plead his case. That is difficult, however, as there is currently a no contact order in place. I know that it cannot be dropped prior to the hearing, which is on the 20th, but I want to know what I can do to ensure that it is dropped then and that my mental health can be taken into account.  I lived with my SO, and he was my sole supporter prior to this incident. I do not currently have a job. And I cannot go home. I don't fear for my safety around him, and I would like things back as they were, but I don't even know where to start.  If you have any advice for me, it'd be greatly appreciated.	Yes
404	"Short and sweet. My husband screwed around behind my back a lot in the past. I'm 9 months pregnant.  I had a bit of a moment today and texted my mother saying pretty much ""kinda wish I could Leave him I can't get over the shit""  He saw and has decided we need to do something so we are discussing a marriage consoler but he also would like to put the baby up for adoption to avoid ""getting trapped"" and child support. Is there a way to put his fears to ease and avoid him paying child support? I am some what attached to the baby by this point and have already started a nursery and have a baby shower in a week so im a bit commited. Financially if I were alone with a child I would be doomed but I will have family who will help.  He has a great paying job and doesn't want to feel like he's getting screwed.    *TL;DR* I want to ensure my husband doesnt have to pay child support in case we do divorce. Is there anything I could do?"	Yes
405	Like I wish I was making this crap up.    My mother who has several mental disabilities just dropped it to me that she is trying to run off with some stranger a few states away via plane or train or car. Abandining her apartment and younger son/ might be forcing him to go with her.  The thing is she is currently in trouble with CPS and has other programs like disability and government mental health services.   Is there any way I can keep her from running off? Or at least making it a lot harder for her too.	Yes
406	"Location:  Virginia  I (mother) have full legal and physical custody of son (Father wanted neither).    Father has visitation every other Sunday as well as visitation on holidays.  He also has visitation every tuesday from 5-7 (to take kiddo to dinner).    He is also supposed to call our son once a week and also email me once a week to ask for updates about him.  We aren't best friends, but we are cordial, there is no arguing or fighting.  What is upsetting me is that the father isn't doing anything other than his every other Sunday visits, and even on those, he shortens or cancels fairly often.  The father lives 20 minutes away.  There is no good reason for this...when I confront him, he just says ""yeah, I know I should do better"".  And that's it.  Kiddo is 8 and is good friends with another boy with separate parents, and that father lives in NYC.  That father and son skype daily.  My son is beginning to notice that his dad is choosing to be distant, and I'm seeing his disappointment.  He's also mentioned he doesn't want to see dad anymore...all his dad does is take him home and sit him in front of a TV while dad does stuff around the house.    Is there anything I can do legally to make his dad step up?  I realize that's not the best way to go about it, but I'm getting desperate.  I've tried being as agreeable as possible.  I've offered overnight visits.  I've offered to drive.  I've had a heart to heart with him letting him know he's missing out on the opportunity to share these moments.  Anything to get him to participate with his son more than the little bit he does.  The way the custody consent order reads it looks like he is ordered this visitation - that he is required to visit/call/etc.  I can't tell.  Can I submit a show cause for every time he hasn't done these things?  Again, I know it's not the best way to handle it.  I just wonder if he can be scared into caring, sadly.  Or at least making it look like he cares.  Thanks.  TLDR:  Can I do anything legally to get my son's father to be more involved in his life?"	Yes
407	Hey everyone,   Here's the situation. My mother is recently widowed and I'm unable to get her down into the bay area where I live (she lives 3 hours away from me) so that I can stay with her and look after her. My niece suggested that she could look after my mom but I need to get her over here into CA first. My niece is from the Philippines and I don't know where to start. I'm unsure what Visa she needs, what hoops I need to jump through/she needs to jump through, etc. Any advice or starting point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone! :D	Yes
408	"I am using fake names for privacy as this was a rather public and controversial incident. This takes place in Georgia, USA. Also, I will try to list everything in a timeline to avoid ranting and biases as much as possible.  - 4 1/2 years ago Jane gives birth to Matt, while using multiple legal and illegal drugs and consuming alcohol throughout her pregnancy.  - Almost immediately leaves Matt in the care of of the first couple who won't report her for abandoning her child weeks or months at a time. It should be added that she would stop by every other week to take the child support check out of the mail box and leave.  - Matt is 1. The financial strain is too much for them so they solicit the help of their best friends parents, my aunt and uncle. This includes them paying for daycare, clothes, etc, and watching him during the weekends.  - Matt is 1 1/2. My aunt and uncle take over care for Matt. Matts mother has been reported for abandoning her child whilst in their care.  -Matt is 3 1/2. Jane has, up to this point, visited Matt every couple of months which is largely due to the aunt arranging it. There is an incident where she wants to take Matt but when she shows up she is obviously impaired, they believed it to be illegal drugs, and refused to let her leave with him. No police report was made.  - Matt is 4. Jane has a ""coming to Jesus"" moment and aunt and uncle sue for custody around the same time. Jane does not show up to court. So the judge grants aunt and uncle temporary custody while Jane gets supervised visitation that she must pay for. The next court date is scheduled in 4 months.  - During the four months, she visits twice, paid for by the aunt, and encourages harassment of aunt via social media and spreads lies, including abuse of Matt. Aunt does not respond to any of it.  - Final court date. Judge says Jane has absolute custody and aunt and uncle will not be allowed to visit Matt unless Jane approves, which will never happen according to her.  I guess I'm just shocked that a judge, who saw proof of abandonment and total lack of care for this child, thought taking him away from the only family he knew (he is just short of 5 years) to hand him back to a mother who clearly failed at being a mother (my aunt and uncle wanted her to take her son back until it became obvious she was endangering his life and sought legal ways to keep Matt safe). How is this legal? How can a judge think she is the only possible guardian (with a clear history of abandonment and drug and alcohol abuse she admitted to) after this child grew up enough to remember the family that took care of him?"	Yes
409	I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday.   So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably.   She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony.   Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers.   That sparked a heated argument.   Long story short;   *Sshe got in the car with her kids  * I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers   * She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety  * I stand in front of the car as I call the police  * She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way  * I jumped on the hood  * She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably   * She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me  * Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures    .................  This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed.   Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?  What charges can I have against her?  I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.	Yes
410	"My big brother has been chronically homeless and unemployed due to severe alcohol and drug addiction for many years. He was recently diagnosed with a serious condition that is unrelated to his substance abuse. He has also been diagnosed with depression and PTSD, and CTE stemming from a tragic car crash he survived as a teenager as well as sports related head injuries.  He has lived in a series of charitable homes and mental hospitals in Maryland in recent years. He recently got the first of a 3 part surgery, where they knicked an artery and had to operate on him a second  time. The botched surgery has caused further complications that have made him very sick.   He was approved for disability shortly before that, and was owed a bunch of retro disability. He assigned a ""payee"" who has access to the account and the money. He trusts this person not to run off with his money. He was afraid he'd binge on alcohol and drugs with all of the money.  He is constantly having to move from one facility to another because either he relapses or they have strict rules about leaving, but he will have to leave for follow up appointments at the hospital.   My family and I have made a ""no enabling"" policy in the last ten years, but I feel my brother's issues have gone so far beyond his addictions. I believe he is slipping further into mental illness from years of drug use and doctors seemingly using him as a guinea pig. He has had every anti depressant and anti anxiety med under the sun as well as ect (brain shock therapy) treatments.   His recent surgery complications have weakened and endangered him greatly. One more relapse could be the literal nail in the coffin, and I'm wondering if leaving him to his own devices isn't actually the correct approach anymore.   I have been considering trying to convince him to make me his payee and move him back home to NJ. I also wonder if I should get medical power of attorney, and all that that entails: ie, Would it allow me to admit him to drug rehabs or make medical decisions on his behalf, things like that. I think it would be better for him to live near his relatives and not bad neighborhoods in Baltimore, so even if he does relapse, we can be in the know about his whereabouts and condition, and he could have his housing funded so he wouldn't be living with us, but nearby. I also don't know if he could continue to get disability benefits in NJ based on meeting the requirements in MD.   If anyone can at least steer me toward some resources, even if you don't know of something I could work out, I'd greatly appreciate it."	Yes
411	My father wants a divorce (and all of us children want it too), but he hasn't filed one because he would have to give up half of what he has and my mother doesn't work. She will never initiate the divorce because of religious reasons. I honestly think it would be best if they split up. They have never been happy for their entire marriage and it has only gotten worse and worse.	Yes
412	"My spouse and I are getting amicably divorced and own two houses. One is being used as a rental property that we intend to sell, with most of the proceeds going to her to cover her ""half"" of our assets. I am keeping the house we are living in.  She almost certainly cannot assume the mortgage on the property we intend to sell. I intend to assume the mortgage on our current house.  What should we add to our divorce decree to best protect ourselves?  * I would like to ensure the other property is sold so I'm relieved of the mortgage.  * She would like to ensure she is no longer liable for the mortgage on current house and gets most of the sale proceeds from the other house.  * I want her to quitclaim the current house.  * I also want to pay her from the sale of the house proceeds so that I don't have to liquidate other assets for her half.  I honestly don't expect any if this to really be an issue (we're still friendly and just want what is best and fair for us both.) We can probably do all of this without anything in the decree, but it seems like we should have something in place, just in case one of us loses their head."	Yes
413	She said that it will automatically default in divorce this month unless we do something.  What are our options?  I haven't signed anything to be clear.	Yes
414	Some context.  My father and mother split apart five years ago.  I occasionally keep in touch with my father.    My father got arrested last weekend for domestic abuse.  Now I don't know the whole situation but I don't condone domestic violence.  My father spent the weekend in jail, and bailed himself out.  In the meantime his girlfriend took a restraining order out on him so he cannot return to the house to get his belongings.  He has personal artifacts (items he had long before he met this other woman), some jewelry (again he had long before he met this other woman), and his passport.    I want to know what my father can do to retrieve his rightful items.    P.S. My father and the girlfriend just bought the house he has been exiled from.  I would also like to know if this could be taken away from him or what his rights are.	Yes
415	This is post ended up having quite a few questions but they're all  in regards to money.  I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ?   My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?  This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.  Please help me, I want to live my life on my own as soon as I can, I don't live with physical abuse or anything too bad but there is some problems and it's just one of those homes where you don't want to stick around past your due.  The day I turn 18 is going to be a great day and I want to get an idea of what I have to do.  I appreciate anything you can help me with even if it's only one thing, thank you in advance to/if anyone that can help.	Yes
416	We have a 1 year old baby girl. Have been living together 13 months. He is the father on legal documents. Live in TX.  I want to move out. I don't know what to do legally. We aren't married. House is in his name. Some bills are in mine.  I pay for the majority of her stuff (she was on my taxes).  I don't know where to start or even what my question is I guess.  He is not attentive and I don't want to leave her with him on the weekends. Will I have to?  What's better, filing for full custody or not filing for anything and waiting until he gets a lawyer? I need someone to talk to who knows about this stuff. I don't think he's going to want her on the weekends - he will have stuff he wants to do. Don't care about child support if it means I have full custody.  Thinking of filing while I still live there so he doesn't  know. I'm in grad school and will graduate in May. I may wait to leave.  I  don't know how much more I can take and don't want her to see such a sad mommy.  This sucks.  Please let me know if I need to clarify anything. And this is my first time posting here.	Yes
417	I'm 24 years old and just completed my degree with a job lined up in a few months. My other brother is out of the house. However, I came back home and discovered my parents on the brink of divorce. I've been living here for a month and got to see all what's happening first hand.  My father is a narcissist who completely controls my Mom and she is reaching her breaking point. He controls everything: money, who she can talk to, expecting every meal perfect, etc. He is a narcissist and will use any opportunity to make people feel sympathy for him.  My mother is hesitant about going through with divorce because she is a stay at home mom for over 30 years. She doesn't have the money to pay for a lawyer. This is seriously the only thing that's holding her back. It's devastating to watch her because the psychological fear has taken a physical, stressful toll on her well being and I'm super concerned.   What should we do?	Yes
418	State: Alabama To keep things short, my girlfriend is currently 16 (I'm one year older so don't make any assumptions, reddit). She's been living with her dad for the past five years of her life, and its been tearing her apart. Her father is an asshole who hates her and keeps her in the house 24/7. Currently she is with her grandmother, but because her father is still her legal guardian he wants to take her back into his home. Her dad also does things such as hit her, and recently he slipped up and hit her in front of her grandmother.   Now that he's threatening to take her back into his home, the grandmother is threatening legal action on him. What I'm wondering is if there may be any way that a judge will allow her grandmother custody without having a trial. There is no way he would win a custody battle in his current state, and definitely after both her, and the grandmother can testify that he physically abuses her. I was also made aware that Alabama recently changed the age in which a teen can leave the home of their guardian from 17 to 18.   I just want to hear all of you guys' opinions on this and what may be a good course of action that would prevent her from having to even look at her father again because he's truly a monster.	Yes
419	Hello,  I am reaching out to get some help for a friend. She divorced her husband in May 2017 (finalzed) and had no stipulations regarding assets in the divorce papers. Only that the townhome would be signed over to him eventually and that he would sign a car over to her, neither of which has been done since the ex-husband is not cooperating.   She has been wanting to get some of her items out of the townhome but he changed the locks and ignores her requests to get her items. Items include: motorcycle helmet, deceased father's toolbox and tools, a few other small odds and ends that she owned before she met him.   I have come up with the brilliant idea to call a locksmith to let us in when he us working, load up her stuff, and then take off. Her name is still on the deed to the townhome and her license still has the address to the townhome. Now this seems straightforward to me but my friend is insisting that her ex-mother-in-law would use her lawyers friends to go after her if we do anything that isn't completely legal, or even of it is.   So what are the concerns with takong items from the townhome that we hers before they met?  Is it legal for us to call a locksmith to let us in since her name is on the deed still?  Is there any other concerns I have completely overlooked that we should be considering?	Yes
420	Hello, I just changed my name and got my updated license and social security card with all the new information. I plan to update my bank accounts and credit cards next. I just want to cover my bases and make sure I'm not forgetting anything important.  Is there any sort of checklist after a name change? I graduated from college a few years ago, do I need to contact them and have them send me an updated diploma or something just in case I need proof of graduation in the future?   Thank you for your help	Yes
421	I'll try to keep this brief.  My parents' divorce paperwork from 1989 in MO says that my father is supposed to pay for my wedding, if I have one. My mother says it is in there because she is very poor (she works for a non-profit), and my father's very wealthy, (He retired at 40).  While my father and I aren't super close, we're not estranged either. I live in CA so we see each other once a year, unless there's a major family event. I didn't know about this being in my parents' divorce agreement, so I'd saved up the money to pay for my dream wedding myself, but when I called my mother to tell her about my engagement, she immediately brought it up, even sent me pictures of that section of their divorce paperwork.  I'm not sure whether or not to ask him to honor that part of the divorce agreeement, but my mother is practically SALIVATING about it. (Their divorce wasn't exactly amicable.)  So while I'm weighing other options, I figured I'd ask so I have a clearer view of the situation. Is something like this enforceable? And if it is, what are the steps for pursuing it if he refuses when asked? If I don't ask him to pay for my wedding, and just pay for it myself, does my mother have the option of going after my dad?	Yes
422	Ex-wife and I have been divorced for a decade. Children reside with me and she receives standard visitation (Arkansas). We have a upcoming court date to show cause for contempt for her non-payment of support and ordered medical costs (as covered by our current orders) and her maltreatment of the children during her visitation.   During the children's visitation, she has taken their phones and intercepted and read text messages intended for the children. They were not of a sensitive nature. She also pretended to be the children and sent messages to myself and others in an attempt to hinder our communications. She also used the devices to attempt to (unsuccessfully) read my confidential e-mails and snoop on social media, in an attempt to gather evidence against me.   I have screenshots of this as proof, and the children themselves are the ones who told me what she was doing.   Had she been looking at the phones to determine if the children were engaging in risky internet behavior, I would understand, but she instead directly intercepted, tampered with, and interfered with my confidential communications.   Is this against the law, and what can I do about it?	Yes
423	I hired a lawyer to help me out with a legal name change. I submitted to him all my relevant papers and documents. Now it's been two weeks and I haven't heard anything yet. I'll probably ask him for an update, but is this amount of time normal? How long should it be before I hear back about making a court appearance, etc? Is this timeline consistent with usual expectation?	Yes
424	I live in Florida. With my consent I agreed to allow my wife to take our two children, 6 and 4, on a quick vacation to NH to stay with friends and come back in a week. I did not go as I had a job interview during that time frame. A few days after leaving she advised me she wants a divorce and wants me to list our home with a mutual friend who is a realtor and she doesn't know when she is going to return. I've had limited contact with her and the children as she states she is too busy to talk. A few days ago we got in a dispute regarding minor mutual property I wanted to donate to Goodwill we had already saved for a garage sale. She's since blocked me on her phone from calling or texting her. Unfriended me on FB and changed her last name on FB. I plan on contacting an attorney this week sometime. What recourse do I have to make her bring the children back?	Yes
425	"Okay, so, basically my kids dad had me served with a civil summons yesterday petitioning for joint custody with him being the primary. For some backstory, we were together for 8 years, have two daughters, 5 and 7, and have been separated for four years. Never married. No prior legal agreement in place. Since we separated I have always been the primary parent. He never had them more than a couple days a week, has never paid child support, never there when I needed him, everything has always fallen on me. We have been having issues for quite awhile now. He has always been very unreliable. Doesn't pick them up when he says he will, doesn't answer calls or texts, never says when he'll drop them off, will be set off by the most random things and threaten to keep them and not give them back. From July to October of last year all of this kept escalating. My oldest picked up lice from school and gave it to me and her sister and he berated me for being ""filthy,"" refused to give my kids back but eventually relented and gave them to my mom after insisting they had lice again after I had already treated them. They didn't. He was erratic with the days he wanted to keep them, was late getting our oldest to school and couldn't pick her up so I had to drop what I was doing to rush to get her. Eventually I stopped asking him to help me out and my mom and I worked out a more reliable  schedule because I just couldn't depend on him or trust him to help me and be a partner. This was fine for about a month until he started demanding I change my schedule so he could see them. He wouldn't work with me and I got scared so I cut off contact while I saved money for a lawyer.  We have been back in contact for about a month now. He showed up at my moms house, said he was going to call cps on me, the cops, that I am unstable, etc. I talked to him and he told me all he wanted was visitation. I sent him a very long text outlining my issues and concerns but telling him I was more than willing to work with him and go to a mediator but I wasn't comfortable with him taking them until there was something in place. He never responded and instead had me served with this summons. I'm calling lawyers as soon as possible to formulate a response to the summons since I only have 20 days but I guess what I am asking is what are the chances I would lose primary? I have had some missteps in my past which play into why I did not seek out a legal agreement sooner, I was a stripper which I thought would hurt me and I did mess with substances. (Nothing major like heroin or anything and I was never addicted or did anything around the girls). Now though I am steadily employed since November and have moved up quickly at my job. I have been clean from any and all drugs for almost a year. I don't smoke and I rarely drink. I have a reliable paycheck and benefits. The girls go to school in my district, I have a stable home, I've had the same boyfriend for four years and we don't even live together, I provide everything for them emotionally and financially. He has never provided support or had them more than a couple days a week in all the time we have been separated.  I believe he's trying to file this way to get out of child support and to hurt me. He is a very manipulative, vindictive person and I know he doesn't like me standing up to him so he is going to do everything he can to drag me down. I'm afraid me cutting off contact will play against me. In his summons it sounds like he is going to go after my environment and emotional stability. What do I need to do to prove what he is asking is not in the girls best interests? What are the chances he will get what he is asking? Is there anything that will hurt me going forward and that I need to do to prepare? I am fine with working with him on the joint custody part but I absolutely do not want to lose primary. I'm scared and need some reassurance. Thank you guys."	Yes
426	(This is in Indiana)     So, my dad passed last April, and he was in talks for disability. After he passed I received mail from the Social Security office that I was able to receive his back benefits because he had been accepted prior to his death.     Now, I've filled out all manner of legal documentation, medical records, release forms, you name it, all addressed to me, courtesy of or on behalf of my father. Court is next week and the SSA is saying they need proof of kinship. I do not have the slightest idea where to look, as he's not on my birth certificate, and my (his) lawyer isn't exactly giving me great ideas. He had no will, nor any paperwork bequeathing anything to me, but after he passed I signed his estate over to my uncle because he's way smarter than I am and didn't, and still don't, have any idea how to deal with that.    What would work as proof of kinship?	Yes
427	W.V.  The cops called me completely out of the blue, saying that my ex-girlfriend is wanting to press charges for phone harassment. I leased a vehicle for her before we split and she stiffed me on the bill. I did try to contact her a few times about the bill (nothing heated) but eventually gave up.  The cops want me to bring my cellphone in so they can hook it up to their comp and get all the data off of it. What should I do?  Also, what data are they going to get? I don't want them having access to all of my conversations on all platforms and stuff. I also hear they can get all keystrokes that have ever been typed on your phone, which would give them my passwords.  The cop told me she didn't have much, but I'm assuming they tell everyone that just to get their phone.	Yes
428	I have an LLC which has never made any money. I wanted to make video games, and did, but nothing sold. There's like $300 in the bank account for said LLC.  I'm going through a divorce, and we'll put in that I own everything about that company, but obviously it's at most going to be a sentence, the lawyer is not IP specialist, and I don't want to use lawyer time on this.  I'd like to continue making games, but I don't really need to use the same LLC,I could open a new one. (There's no name recognition, nothing really of value except it's already there.)  If I keep using this LLC would my ex have an easier time claiming that she part owns it in the event I actually ever make money on it in the future?  Basically should I close it and open a new LLC, or since there wasn't anything in there at the time of divorce it won't matter anyway?	Yes
429	New account for privacy.  Some background: I am 17 years old. My mother is a narcissist who thinks the world revolves around her. She and my Stepdad have been together for ~14 years and have a son that age. They've been married about 7 years.  It's clear they've only stayed together for financial reasons and for the three children. My Stepdad loves me and my sister like his own, despite him not being our biological dad. He takes care of us financially by himself and has built a beautiful life for us. Over my lifetime we've gone from poverty to upper-middle class solely because of him.  My mother, on the other hand, has never worked a day in the past 16 years. She spends child support checks from my Realdad on weed, alcohol, and things for herself. (Clothes, takeout, etc.)  About a year and a half ago, Mom was arrested for domestic battery and obstucting a person trying to make a 911 call. I made the call after she attacked me and Stepdad after taking unprescribed oxycodone and mixing it with a LOT of vodka. She was in jail for about 2 days before stepdad bailed her out. We made her stay in a hotel for a week before she swore to change. We dropped the charges. ...and....she didn't change. She's always been emotionally abusive but it started to get worse. My sister, 17 at the time, just had a baby. He was ~5 months at the time. Moms bullshit caused her to move out Feb. 2017 with her fiancé. This caused Mom to be okay for a while, as she blamed Sister for all of our problems. Recently it's been bad again. It's clear she's on pills again as we know how she acts on them. (more background: She was arrested for prescription fraud about 7 years ago) NOW: Last night Mom and Stepdad got into a big fight. Stepdad had one drink with Bossman before coming home, and Mom freaks and calls him a drunk. This angers Stepdad so he tries to go to bed. Mom decides to go fuck with him and turn on the lights and slam the door to their bedroom. Stepdad breaks the lights out of anger. Mom keeps antagonizing him. Stepdad decides it is in his best interests to leave. I have video of Mom pushing Stepdad out the door. But Mom took all of Stepdads keys, including his work keys issued by his company to his work truck. She claims he's intoxicated and won't let him leave. She finally gives him his keys but won't let me leave with him because Stepdad isn't my legal guardian and claims he has no rights over me.  Stepdad is done. He's filing for divorce but we're scared of what is going to happen with me. I refuse to live with Mom but we don't know if Stepdad can get custody. My Realdad is a homeless druggie, all my grandparents are either blind or deaf, and I refuse to live with any of Moms family.  What are the chances Stepdad will get custody? What are my rights? All 3 kids agrees we would testify under oath that we fucking hate her. Is there anything we can do to give us a better chance? Stepdad is willing to give Mom alimony and half of what we own with no argument. He just wants me and my brother under his custody.   Tl;dr: Stepdad and crazy narcissist Mom getting divorced, trying to be in his custody despite no biological relation.	Yes
430	"My mom left my stepdad after months of complications and having problems from raising his intolerable kids for eight years.  The day after she left she went to pick up her stuff; they had hidden mostly all of it, such as her laptop, iPad, mini iPad, her work iPad, and all of her chargers.  To make matters petty, they even hid her coffee, which she needs for her strenuous job.    She said she'd be back to pick up my great grandmothers china and china cabinet, and, quoting my stepdad, ""You'll get what I tell you you can get.""  My mom works hard; she raised three out of five of his kids, who did nothing but disrespect her the entire time; and when she got sick of it, she left, and now he's basically stealing from her by not letting her get priceless family heirlooms.  Any advice on what we can do about this?"	Yes
431	Over the past couple of years my husband and I have decided that basically our relationship isn't enough for us and we don't anticipate staying together for too much longer. We've both been dating but it hasn't gone anywhere with anyone and we don't currently have dating partners. However, we also both want a kid. We're debating doing a co-parenting thing, where we have a kid soon, stay living together for the first few years, and then dating other people again. I got my fertility checked recently and was told I needed to have a baby basically now or it wasn't happening naturally/with treatment. Given my history it's going to be impossible for me to get into a romantic relationship within the time it'll take to have a kid biologically, plus my husband and I really like each other platonically and would be good co-parents. Frankly, it seems like this could be good for a kid as they would have two invested parents who would live close by and who both make enough money to live a comfortable life, and it seems loads better than a lot of children of divorce go through. I know a lot of middle class women are supposed to say they'd rather not have a kid than raise it alone, but we'd split custody, and frankly having a few days off a week from the kid sounds fantastic. So redditors, what practical and legal things do we need to think about?	Yes
432	"The matter is important, and only came to my attention a couple of hours ago. I made a promise not to tell anyone, but I do not feel it is a promise I can keep. I require advice of a legal nature, and I hope Reddit can help.  The individuals in this story will be thus: L, nine year-old boy. R, five year-old girl. They share a mother with different fathers. E, the mother. H, the mother's current boyfriend and father of R. C, who is E's ex-husband and L's father.  It was explained to me during dinner earlier that L and R were caught engaging in sexual activity together at the home belonging to parents of C. This activity included things, as explained to me, such as ""Kiss me down there with your tongue"" and ""Do what you want with me, baby"". Stories appear to differ as to whether they were unclothed, clothed, or partially clothed. After some questioning, it was revealed that they had been doing this for some time. Kissing each other regularly, with L sometimes sticking R's hand down his pants. He has apparently also tried once to put his mother's, E, hand down his pants as well. E says it is possible, though it is not sure, that he touched her in the middle of the night when she was laying in R's bed and when discovering it was E instead of R, inquired where R was. L was made to call E by his father and apologize for what he had done, while R sat in the back of the car with her head down and ears covered by her hands. Stories appear to differ between who was initiating with whom, with some indicating L and some indicating R.  This is not the first time this has happened. Some time ago, perhaps a year or two, L and R were caught playing ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" at the home of C's parents. As the story was told to me, they were naked and R was ""bouncing"" on L while he was laying on the bed. She made references to ""taking care of him"" after he ""came home from work"". I was disturbed then, but I was eventually convinced that it was a case of kids playing doctor and it wouldn't happen again. Apparently, it has been happening again a lot.  The general motivation of the other parties in this situation, and those few who are privy to it, seems to be trying to figure out the ""who"" and ""why"" of it. L seems to be getting accused the most, being as he is the older. My motivation, and this is why I feel I cannot keep my confidence as I promised, is that both children are potentially victims. At the very least, one child has behavioral issues that need to be addressed immediately and one child needs victim support, whoever may fit which role. I was never sexually abused, but I have lived a life plagued with depression, suicidal thoughts, and self-loathing due to years of emotional and physical abuse that were never treated. I know the damage that caused me. I know the scars I carry.  My immediate advice was that E should get both children to a child psychologist as soon as possible. I am well aware that acting out in this matter is often a sign that a child has been molested, or has been exposed to sexual displays which are inappropriate for their age. It is possible they are both victims of child molestation. E seemed inclined to debate me on this, citing on reasons for which I come here to seek advice. Her stance, as well as H's and C's, seems to be ""We'll talk to them and this won't happen again"". Aside from the fact that was the plan the first time, if they are being sexually abused by another person this does nothing to solve that issue. I don't want L and R, whom I love very dearly, to grow up damaged as I did. I don't want them to hate themselves the way I have. I cannot live with myself by remaining silent on this.  My questions, then, are as follows. I would appreciate any advice that can be given.  1) E currently lives with H. C lives with his current wife and their two teenaged children. C's parents live just up the road from him, and regularly babysit the children. My sister is scared that, once CPS becomes involved, her children will be removed from her custody. I informed her that CPS would only do so if they could demonstrate that her custody was dangerous to the children's well-being, which I do not think is the case for E nor H. Even if they were temporarily removed, I have no doubt whatsoever that she will be cleared. Also of concern is the presence of D, a three year-old boy, son of H and E. Assuming what I have explained here is true, and assuming H and E are guilty of no wrong-doing, how likely is it that the children will be removed from the custody of H and E?  2) Assuming that it is discovered that one of the children is identified as the initiator and no signs of abuse by other family/friends/etc is present. Would L or R face criminal charges? Would L be more likely to face charges, since he is the older of the two? If one is initiating, and the cause is solely some sort of behavioral problem, I do not want the party to face criminal charges. I understand such things are outside of my control. Therapy is obviously needed, but I also want to make sure I know of potential consequences before I act. I cite issues of underage teenagers sending nude pictures to each other and finding themselves charged with possessing/distributing child pornography. I want them to get help, I don't want their lives ruined. I know that sounds awful to say, and believe me when I say I feel awful, but I honestly don't know what to do here. I'm afraid acting for what I feel might be right may just cause an avalanche of wrongs.  3) Who should this be reported to? My goal is to convince E to take L and R to a child psychologist, as I feel that will make this process much easier for everyone involved than if I initiate it. If she refuses, then I will do so because I cannot stand idle while this goes on. The State Police? CPS? My primary concern is making sure the children get the help they so desperately, and obviously, need more than anything else. I don't want to pile trauma onto trauma.  4) Assuming I am the one to report this instead of E. Am I liable for civil suit? It may seem ridiculous to ask, and obviously such liability would not stop me from reporting this, but I am currently unemployed. I have no money, and currently live with my father who is on Social Security. Neither of us could afford an attorney. If this blows up and goes horribly badly, could fault be brought back to me? Are there steps I need to take to ensure myself and my father are protected after the children are seen to? What kind of attorney would handle such a matter? Suppose E reports it, could C and/or his family take civil action against her? It sounds stupid, but I see a lot of stupid posts on this forum about what people sue for or are sued for.  This post probably seems all over the place, and I certainly feel all over the place. When the situation was explained to me, I felt quite calm and withdrawn from the matter. But after I left dinner and came home, this awful fear and dread has just been building in me and I know it's going to eat me alive soon. While I'm here trying to figure out how to handle this, two kids are hurting and I love everyone involved. I want them to be protected, cared for, and taught how to heal. I want them to have the tools to be healthy that I didn't get. I can't live the rest of my life knowing I sat by while their scars got deeper and more numerous. The thought of anyone hurting them fills me with such rage, but I am trying to fighting down the emotional aspects for now. I want to act in the best of interest of L and R. How can I best do that? Thank you for any advice.  I hope none of you ever have to deal with anything like this."	Yes
433	My grandma is 88 years old, and despite having three children, she suddenly only feels comfortable sharing her finances with her eldest. My grandparents had major dollars in the bank a few years ago, the last time my mom was allowed to see their accounts. My aunt has always been under financial pressure, and we believe that my aunt is taking advantage of their fortune to pay off their huge debts and allow her son to pay down his gigantic mortgage. My aunt, who was given power of attorney, has her own debit card under my grandmas account and sold our cottage without notice or allowing us to see any documents. Despite the will showing that the cottage should be split evenly between the three children, we only received a fourth, and no explanation. When we ask were the other fourth went, my aunt told us that it was going into my grandmas bank account (the one she has full access to), even though my grandma used to have more than enough money to cover living expenses for the rest of her life a few years back.  Before my grandpa passed away a few years ago, he warned us that there was money missing from his bank account, and told us to sue my aunt. He informed us that someone was making purchases with his money. After he told us this, my aunt and her family shut down all communication with us. Then my grandparents stopped talking to my family, and grandma has barely contacted me or my family for years (mental illness is a huge possibility). Every time we go over, my aunt insists on being there, not giving us a second alone with her. The scariest part of this is that is could have been resolved easily, had my aunt brought us to the bank and showed us that she hadn't taken unfairly from my grandparents account. My uncle has tried to sue them in the past and has not yet been successful. When I see them at family events they can barely look us in the face. It is very clear that they had been getting away with taking large sums of cash from my grandparents bank account without them or us knowing. Do we have a case of elder abuse or abuse of power of attorney?	Yes
434	"I am 19 years old and living with my 61 year old disabled aunt. Also living with us is my 30 year old cousin (let's call her Kayla) and her long term boyfriend. Kayla is living here under the title 'caregiver' under section 8. Her boyfriend is not supposed to be here, section 8 is not aware of him living here. Kayla has threatened/blackmailed my aunt that she will report her to section 8.  Anyway, Kayla and her boyfriend are supposed to leave by the end of the month. My aunt said if they're not gone by August 1st she will call the police on them. The housing manager also did give them a 10 day notice last week.  Just today my aunt noticed they had put a lock on their bedroom door without permission. Days before they're supposed to be gone. Also I don't see them packing... what are the laws about adding locks without the head of house approving?  Another thing I wanted to mention is I thought about reporting my cousin for vulnerable adult abuse. My aunt has done so many favors for them, including letting them live with her for very cheap. They never pay rent on time, they haven't paid the last two months rent I believe. They have stolen $160 worth of narcotic pain pills for my aunt, her weed, her cigarettes, and tons of food. They told her ""your food is yours, ours is ours"" and constantly eat her food, then lie about it.   They have argued and yelled and caused her so much stress. She has been trying to quit smoking but can't, she gets hives from the stress. She can't sleep most nights. She can't wait for them to leave. I feel like they do use and manipulate her for money and things/favors, especially since she's lonely after her mom died a year ago. Should I report this? Is there any point since Kayla is about to move out?"	Yes
435	My father needs to file some court papers about a domestic violence incident.  English isn't his first language, so he has asked me to help him fill out the form.  Do I need to know any particular legal terms, or is the form pretty self-explanatory?	Yes
436	I got married on July 2nd. We are a same-sex couple, and so instead of assuming names or hyphenating, we want to create a new last name that combines our two names into one. This is possible within Canada, and we plan on doing so, but this does change my wife's birth certificate, so it's permanent rather than an assumed name.  As a permanent resident in Canada, I am not sure how this will apply to my information in the US. I am a US citizen with a valid US passport.  I know that I need to apply for a new passport - will they accept the Canadian name change form? Do I need to get my name changed on everything in the US as well? I obviously have SS in addition to a student loan account and a bank account, but that's about it. I've been living in Canada for 5 years now, so there isn't much left in the US in my name. I will also be selling my car before we are able to complete the name change officially, so no need to worry there (the title), and I have a Canadian driver's license (already forfeited my US one).  Any advice or information would be appreciated.	Yes
437	Hello all, I'm based in the UK, my grandmother recently underwent a lung transplant, things have gone south as she had a heart attack and is now in a critical condition. My mother is looking after my cousin (as she lived with my Nan) and my Aunt who has downs syndrome. I'm posting on behalf of my mother on if the power of attorney (or what is it and we aren't completely sure) would apply. This is because my mum's step-father has been taking money off my aunty (with down syndrome) for himself whilst they've been staying with us, and we believe he may/ or may not, have taken my grandmothers stash of money she hid away in the house alongside her will. What I'm trying to ask is if there is anyway we can hold/take ownership over my Nan's and aunties bank accounts (as they're both in my nans name) 1. whilst my Nan is in her critical condition 2. If she doesn't make it through. Mainly to stop him getting ahold of any of their money (my mum is the executor on the will if that means anything) as he's began to say that he is looking for my nan's pin to pay for stuff whilst shes away (they had separate accounts for a reason and he isn't in the will whatsoever).  Any advice on what to do in the situation would be greatly appreciated- once again we are in the UK. Thank you.	Yes
438	I'm 27, out of school, and not well versed in this type of stuff. I do have a fiancé and my mom (my dads ex-wife/friend) that can give me support mentally thankfully. I do have power of attorney for if he is incapacitated. He needs someone to pay his bills on time, keep track of doctors appointments, and paperwork. He currently lives with me, but is on a waiting list for a senior living place nearby.   I just found out today his license was canceled on July 5th, due to not reporting any updates on his vision. He used to have cataracts but had surgery for them in June. They gave him 30 days to reply to the letter but he forgot about it. It says he could have filed a petition to get it back with an eye exam, but he didn't. He did not show me the letter until today, more than 30 days later. It says his license is canceled indefinitely and the letter says if he doesn't give his new eye exam he has to surrender his license. This was sort of the catalyst for this discussion. Also, what do I do if he tries to drive? Can I just hide his keys? I wasn't keen on him driving in the first place cuz he is really frail anyway.   We live in Glendale, WI.	Yes
439	"I'm sorry for how long this is but I don't know how to make this situation any simpler.   Some background: I'm 19, my brother is 17, and my parents got divorced ~15 years ago. The divorce was messy, drawn-out and complicated by my mother's mental health problems, and the fact that she wanted full custody and our dad out of our lives completely.  Though the court awarded 50/50 shared custody, my dad was ordered to pay child support because he'd been supporting our family by running his own business while my mom stayed home. A year or two after the divorce my mom (still unemployed) moved to a town hours away in an attempt to force the custody issue, and took my dad back to court seeking full custody again. She lost and after that point only saw my brother and I for three weekends a month and every other week in the summer, though she retained 50/50 ""rights and responsibilities"" and so continued collecting child support from my dad. In the intervening years my dad has had to close his business and file for bankruptcy (thanks to legal debt), go on food stamps and pick up multiple extra jobs just to keep our family afloat. My mom was well-employed for several years, but has also gone through several long periods of unemployment where child support was her only income. All my health expenses, school supplies, extracurriculars, clothes, food, etc. was paid for by my dad; my mom bought me food when I was with her and that was about it. Any kind of support from her stopped when I was sixteen, when I moved out and cut contact with her due to a violent incident.  Throughout all these changes the amount of child support paid has never been reviewed or modified from the original amount (I don't know the exact figure but it's hundreds of dollars a month). I've talked to my dad about it on and off for years, and he is terrified of going back to court and the effect it will have on our family. The last time my parents were in court my mom falsely accused my dad of abusing her, sexually abusing me, stalking, etc. He also can't afford another costly court battle and believes my mom can- though she's since become estranged from her entire family who backed her financially last time they went to court, she's currently dating a fairly wealthy guy who spends a lot of money on her.   This is all complicated by the fact that two years ago when our financial situation was extremely bad my dad stopped paying my mom child support. I'm really angry with him for doing this because I know it's illegal and could look bad in future legal proceedings, but my dad suffers from his own issues and I know he didn't see any other options at the time. My mom eventually reported it to the state and now they are garnishing his paycheck. The amount he owes continues to grow, in part because the state is still collecting child support for me even though I'm 19.  I want to get my dad off the hook for child support, at least for me (my brother still visits my mom a few times a month, although she cancelled last-minute on spending christmas and a couple weekends with him this year). I'm sure there's little chance of getting the child support adjusted for the years she didn't support me at all, or adjusted for my parents' changed financial situations without having all their tax paperwork, but is there any way I can inform the state that I'm not a minor anymore and to stop collecting child support in my name? Alternatively, what are some good legal arguments to convince my dad to try to modify the child support himself? I have no idea how long he's planning on letting this go on, and our family could really use any extra money (I'm putting myself through college because the bankruptcy/debt means my dad's ineligible for loans, but he's still helping out with groceries so I don't starve, and with my brother going to college soon we don't know how we're going to manage). It's ridiculous, at this point it feels like we're just throwing cash into a bottomless pit.   ***tl;dr:*** My mom is collecting child support she doesn't need or deserve. Do I, the 19 yr old child, have any grounds to put a stop to it? If not, what can I do to convince my dad to take action?"	Yes
440	My spouse kept her last name after marriage (outside the US). Then, a few years later, she became a naturalized US citizen and she changed her last name to mine during the application process (in Los Angeles, CA). Now, she's applying for Green Card for her parents, and USCIS asked for a evidence that the person applying is the same as the the one on the marriage cert (different last names). They allow proof by affidavit, but only if I have proof that there's no other evidence. What is the best evidence to present (old driver's license &amp; new passport, or just affidavit)?	Yes
441	Hello all, This is a pretty straightforward question, just not really sure where to start.   My wife and I can't make it work and we're looking to file for divorce. The complication is that she is a Japanese national, I am a Canadian national and we both currently live (for the last two years and for the foreseeable future, at least in my case) in California.   We got married in Canada, about 9 years ago. No kids, 2 cats. We still have a few assets (investments) tied up in Canada, and a few in Japan. I can't speak for her, but she would be very likely moving back to Japan after all is said and done.   What would be the correct avenue to file, in this type of case?	Yes
442	"I know, I know, but my friend is looking into getting a divorce.  She is a natural-born citizen who lives in Pennsylvania, and he is in the end-stages of getting his citizenship (from the UK) through their marriage.  As far as I know, all assets (house, cars) are in her name and she has been paying the bills.  I helped her with his citizenship paperwork when it was at the point where he was switching from a green card to a citizen.  The fact that he had joint pay-in to their bank accounts was included in the final interview paperwork.  As far as I know at the moment, he is waiting on the final decision.   His original UK passport however has lapsed.   There have been problems cropping up in their marriage.  He is ""threatening"" to go back to the UK.  Regardless of what he ends up deciding, can anyone here recommend what, if any, type of specialized lawyer she might need in case of a divorce?  Any kind of advice would be very appreciated.  Thank you in advance for your time."	Yes
443	"I'm looking to get advice on regarding what to do. I know the best way to get legal advice is through a bar approved lawyer, but I would like to have some second-hand advice on what I should do regarding this situation I'm currently experiencing.   My Grandmother has been ""ill"" for a while (see can't be by herself and someone has to always watch her) and currently has her house for sale. My Oldest brother has been taking care of her primarily (Being at home with her to watch her while he tries to live out his own life) and also my mother. (She can't be alone with my grandmother due to her inability to take care of herself.)(Tdlr she is a severe alcoholic and has really bad short term memory due to it.)   During most of the time, it has been my older brother taking care of her. He even transferred household utility bills in his name (Gas, Water, Electric, Comcast, ext) and additionally paying for other expenses. (Groceries, living expenses for my mother and grandmother to survive). A Few months ago, her oldest daughter (my aunt) started giving her vitamins/pills/ect in other words ""alternate medicine"" (Whatever Steve Jobs did before he sought out real help) and in my past couple months watching over them I've notice she gets a tad better, but a bit worst each time.   In regards to what I want to ask, just recently my Aunt made herself Power of Attorney (Even though she is not the oldest sibling) even when my grandmother is in current state of mind. Her current state of mind consist of ""flashbacks"", random hysteria episodes and the inability to do the basics of living (Getting up from her bed, using the bathroom, washing herself, ect).  When she became POA she recently informed me that when the house sells that she (my aunt) will get all the money and then presumes to tell me I have to find a place for my mother since ""I'm her son"" when I can't even take care of myself in the 1st place.    So tldr - Aunt makes herself POA, sells my grandmother house keeps the money for herself and then my mother, brother, and myself don't have anywhere to go. Honestly I'm pretty scared about this and I don't really know what to do so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
444	I'm in Colorado. My ex and I have a parenting plan in place for my son that says I will claim him on taxes since my ex only has him on weekends. This was placed in 2011. Now all the sudden he would like to start claiming him on his taxes for the child tax credit. I said no and at first he said we need to go to mediation. Tonight I received a text from him saying I need to sign the document to allow him to claim my son on his taxes and if I choose to go to mediation he will tell the courts I'm committing fraud (which is bullshit). Is this extortion?	Yes
445	I'd just like to say that I live in a rural area. The road I'm speaking of is off the main road, it is more narrow and unmarked. There is a sharp turn with a lot of trees and grown up weeds, so you can't see anything until you're going around that turn.   My neighbors have a few kids, none of them high school age. Middle school at most, probably. Amongst those kids is a handicap child. Not sure how old he is, just that he is in a motorized wheelchair. The parents let their kids go for walks to their friends house, so sometimes the handicap kid is supervised by them. However there have been multiple times where I've gone around that turn and had to slam on my breaks to miss the kid in a wheelchair and he was alone. I drive pretty safely but that is such a blindspot and I'm terrified of hitting him.   I was going to make a post about this awhile back and if it'd be calling CPS worthy, but it had stopped for a long time. I assumed someone had talked to them.... Until now..  Tonight, DARK OUTSIDE, on the turn there was the dad pulling a trailer with a riding lawn mower with no lights on, and the kid in a wheelchair was riding in front of him (also no lights, obviously.) Only thing that prevented an accident was a car that came from the other direction flicking their lights to signal to slow down before the turn.   I don't know the law, I don't know things that should be called in to CPS, or things that are perfectly fine.	Yes
446	"I am eighteen years old, in Oregon USA. moving out of an abusive household, I leave Thursday but mom, has my social security card, my passport, my birth certificate. All things I need. I understand I could duplicate them but that is difficult as you'd need verification from an adult that I exist with their documents (correct me if I'm wrong please) and think it'd be easier. (Especially for the expensive passport that my dad paid for three years ago if that matters at all) Anyway, I know she is not going to give them to me when I ask for them when I leave. Is there any legal matter in this? I need things now for learners permits and trying to acquire things to get on with the ""adult"" (haha 18) aspect of my life. Can't get a bank account without some form of I.d and fafsa is coming soon for college. Can't get I.d card without birth certificate or social security number. I don't have much money and so requesting would be a long process and I cannot go that way as I need to desperately get these things done in a matter of weeks. Can she really withhold all those things from me even if their not technically hers? I understand birth certificate and ss card was given to her in her possession but at some point it's for me right? My parents are not married either and he purchased the passport. Does that play into me getting that back? It's good for two more years and useful as form of identification."	Yes
447	Child support in Washington state. I was paying support for 2 kids. The temporary order was just that temporary it had no foresight into my oldest aging out or graduating high school. My soon to be ex wife tried to change support in April due to my new job and wanted more money. The judge opted not to change anything then because I was supposed to have trial in July. The trial didn't happened solely because she failed to give her discoveries in time to review them. Two boxes of accounts on Friday after 2pm and trial scheduled for Tuesday morning. I went thru the paper work that weekend and found their was 7 additional accounts listed in the transactions of deposits and withdraws. It is believed that she is hiding money in these accounts. It's been now 60 days since the formal request and two weeks since the request for additional accounts and my trial rescheduled to November. I have read that in most cases when paying support for more than 1 child if the order doesn't specify it is understood that you stop paying support for child if they age out and only request to change the temporary order to prevent confusion.	Yes
448	"Currently separated, going through a very ugly divorce battle with my (hopefully soon to be ex) wife...neither of us can afford attorneys because of financial troubles (excessive debt) accumulated by her when we were together.  Not to mention, she cheated on me for a year before I found out.  During that time, she got herself in to legal trouble (related to the cheating) which caused additional financial hardship.    However, she has managed to get an attorney through a women's legal center somehow by lying about me and how I have treated her.  When, in truth, I endured about 10 years of mental/emotional abuse from her before I decided the marriage could not be saved.   Now that she has an attorney, and I don't, she is trying to ""stick it to me"" with a vengeance.  She has kept the children from me on occasion (to be vindictive) when it was my rightful visitation time, and she also says negative things about me to our daughters.  Are any of you aware of lost cost / pro bono options for a father that has been taken advantage of but is still trying to do the best he can for his children?   It doesn't seem fair that she can lie and get an attorney for free, and I, the law abiding father that has never missed a child support payment and see my kids as much as possible, can't?  Thank you in advance for your time, I appreciate any advice you can offer that might help me find an attorney, or an organization that could help me find an attorney."	Yes
449	To start off, neither me or my spouse have any sort of record what so ever, we have a hard time even giving our toddler a time out let alone physical discipline. We could easily have 50 or more people testify to the care of our children who have spent several hours with us. We've never gotten any notifications from DHS, CPS or anyone prior ever about concerns with our children. No record of substance abuse or mental illness.   In May my infant daughter had a bloodshot eye, our daycare provider informed us and sent a picture. We asked if it seemed to be bothering her, she said it wasn't. We told her if it got any worse to let us know and we would come get her and bring her to our pediatrician. It cleared up in a day or so, so we didn't seek medical attention for it.   A couple weeks ago my wife was in a car accident with my son, the vehicle was totaled but my wife and son were perfectly fine. My son was sleeping, he woke up for just a second then went back to sleep. A ambulance came and checked him and my wife out, they said he was perfectly fine and didn't need to seek medical attention unless he was acting odd and to look out for any odd behavior. Which we did. He acted 100% as normal so we did not seek medical attention.  My daughter started crawling and is borderline obsessed with standing up, she has an accident in the kitchen where she tried pulling herself up my wife's pant leg and as she went to pick her up she slipped and unfortunately fell on her face. It left a decent size bruise on her face, she contacted me at work and we looked out for the normal warning signs, she was fine.    A few days ago my wife got a phone call asking how soon we could get our children and meet at the E.R. It was CPS, they wanted us to have them there in an hour. We went and got our kids, my daycare provider had called about these instances, because she said her licensor was there and they made her, someone else had contacted her.   We were at the ER for almost 9 hours, they checked out my son, did a CT scan, X-rays and blood work on my daughter.  About 4 hours into the visit the DHS lady said we had to make arrangements for our children to stay with for the night. This was too much for us and we came to the conclusion that my parents would come down for the night. The DHS lady agreed and did background checks and left to access our house after we agreed to a 'safety plan' where my parents supervised us with the children.  We were discharged and got home around 1am.  The next day we had to take our kids to an abuse center where a doctor interviewed us and evaluated the children. In addition to having to go to our pediatrician for more blood work because the original was clumped and there was an error.  Later that day we were informed that we no longer have to follow the safety plan and there was no suspicion of abuse or neglect. Every test came back normal and that Pretty much that we were all set.  We asked the lady if we were going to be responsible for the ER visit etc. and she said that our insurance should cover most of it, we explained that it was a $8000 deductible between all to us. Her response was that typically the people that she deals with were on (state) care and that they didn't typically have to worry about it.  We got on the phone with a lawyer to ask a bit of advice, he said that typically they send a letter to the parents first and do a parent interview and go from there and that he has never seen someone go to such an extreme.  He said we should sit down and draft a letter about how mistreated we were, and that if they try to make us pay the bills to contact him immediately.   Additionally, another parent at the daycare used to work as a CPS supervisor and think that she may have made the call and that's why it was escalated so much. She knew that the kids were taken to the hospital and asked our daycare provider if they were kept overnight, without having knowledge of any of this.  Am I worrying too much? Having to have our kids in the ER for nearly 9 hours was more abusive than anything me or my wife have ever come close to doing to them, we are  in horror, it was a nightmare. We're terrified that it's going to happen to us again anytime my son gets a scratch riding his bike or something. Should we do more legally? Can we? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.	Yes
450	I have a friend who has been staying at another friends house for nearly two months now. His mother was manipulative and he lived in unsanitary conditions, so he came nearby to live and prepare for college in a more quiet environment where he can be supported. His mother has been upset with him but recently threatened to call the police and call him as a runaway, as he did not leave with full permission. He does not want to return, if he turns 18 and she calls the police, will they do anything?  Or, if he accepts her buying a plane ticket now, but is booked after his birthday, would there still be legal referendums for either my possible runaway friend, or my friend who can be accused of harboring him, if he decides not to go, and she still calls the police on him despite him being over 18 now?	Yes
451	"Now that we have just applied for my wife’s 10-year green card I suspect she may file for divorce. The ~3 marriage has struggled, due largely to factors stemming from unemployment (at times *both* of us have been unemployed). Finally and thankfully, we both have good jobs now, though they are in different states (I am in CA, where we married, she is in NY) so it’s now a long-distance marriage. I love her but I think she has checked out and I have to agree that with our new jobs if there were ever a time for a ""fresh start,"" now is it. If she files, I anticipate a ""peaceful"" separation. There's no rancor between us and not much to divide up--no kids, few assets, just a few thousand $ in the bank. If she took everything in the bank it would just be an inconvenience, really.    However, if there is one thing I have learned from this sub it’s that relying on the goodwill of an ex-spouse is asking for a disaster, and I wonder if I should be on-guard for something? For instance, could she somehow come after my future wages? Also, during one particularly difficult stretch, my parents gave us some financial support, can she go after them somehow? I think it impossible she would ever attempt such a thing even if she had recourse, but really sad things are reported on this sub every day.    One last thing: If I've accepted the inevitability of divorce, why don't I just file for it myself and get it over with? One is that I do hope this marriage might rebound and her family is emphatically behind me. Another is that I want to put all my energy into my new job and don’t anticipate acquiring much in savings or significant assets this year, I personally would prefer to defer the divorce until it has to happen.    Thanks and blessings.    TL/DR. I feel divorce is inevitable. Can I just wait for it to happen or is it urgent that I pre-emotively lawyer-up?"	Yes
452	21 year old child living in parents home. Child has quit college and is not paying rent. Child is not following rules of the home, such as chores and cleaning up after themselves, and has recently become destructive(smashed outdoor grill and threw others property away)as well as verbally abusive towards minor child in the home.   How would one go about removing him from the home? Is it possible to do so without causing him to have a criminal record? Thank you.	Yes
453	"Hi /r/legaladvice,  I am posting primarily on behalf of my boyfriend and his newfound daughter.  To preface the situation, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years and have lived together just about as long with full intentions of marriage someday. We have a very stable household and both have steady upper management jobs with reliable incomes.  For backstory, my boyfriend and a woman were dating in California around 2003. Right before he deployed, she became pregnant. By the time that he returned from deployment, the child had already been born. He says that he never signed a birth certificate, but the child has his last name. He cared for her for 2-3 years after birth as if she was his own. When she was 3, he was PCS'd to Georgia and the mother then denied that he was the father entirely, that she had been with other people, etc. It was messy, but there were no legal proceedings then. He took her word for it and moved to Georgia, while the mother and child remained in California.  About 2-3 weeks ago, we were served child support documents (after a few months of notices via mail). When the papers were served, my boyfriend was incredulous because the mother had explicitly said that he was not the father of the child. The child is 12 years old and the paperwork came out of nowhere, nearly a decade after their last contact.  Within days, the daughter found us on Facebook and sent friend requests to each of us, as well as several of his family members with the same last name. Looking at her profile picture, the resemblance is undeniable -- they are 100% related. He accepted her friend request and they have started a relationship via Messenger. While most of the conversations revolve around favorite snacks, animals, innocent stuff, he has uncovered the following things: (1) She does not actually live with her mother, who filed the child support paperwork, (2) She lives with a young woman (older sister or younger aunt, I can't remember) who is ~19 and has two other children of her own, (3) She is often dropped off at Grandma's in a CA/Mexican border town and is allowed to freely walk around alone despite child abduction being all too common, (4) She has a mild case of scoliosis that is not being treated, (5) She commonly eats non-nutritious food and is very thin, including as ramen and ice cream, (6) She is often sad and yelled at by family. One instance involved a woman (whom I believe was her mother visiting) who yelled ""fucking"" at her about 18 times in a 30 second span while on video chat with her dad. The family members with whom she is staying know that she has started talking to her father and accept this and several have encouraged it via comment on a cover photo she created with a picture of her dad, and (7) She has repeatedly asked to come to Georgia over and over and over again.  We have reached out to a GA lawyer with no reply and he has also reached out to an old military buddy in law about the child support, but we are still a little frazzled (understatement) about where to get a foothold. He has decided to petition for full custody, and I am behind him 1000%. But where do we begin? He has already agreed to pay the $1200/month child support to the mother she does not live with, and we also received a petition for health insurance yesterday.  I am assuming we would need to instead find a lawyer located where his daughter lives? How does that conceivably work when we are located 2000 miles away, court-wise? I feel like we are lightyears behind, having waited 3 weeks when she needs us.  Thank you all in advance for any insight and direction."	Yes
454	We recently sold some of my personal property and are working to get our debt under control and credit score up. My husband had $13k in debt from his previous marriage, which ended about 5 years ago, and was split evenly between them. It is affecting my credit (yay marriage) and I want it gone and I know she has no plans to pay for it because she has no intention of needing or getting credit, so it doesn't matter to her, and it's been 5 years. I'm pretty sure even suing her for the $7500 will come to nothing (she spends money like it's on fire), but I want a record at least that it was paid and she owes me. Petty, yes, but it's a lot of money to me and I want a record of it. How should I handle this, legally? What steps should I take?	Yes
455	"My SOs (he's the father and shares equal custody with the mother) daughter (9 y/o) is in and out of the hospital. The maternal grandparents like to butt in and force themselves into her hospital room ""for support"". However they are incapable of being civil to SO, which causes stress and discomfort to his daughter. They are openly rude and disrespectful, even with the daughter watching.  Ex wife is a doormat and lets them do whatever they want. Can my SO ban them from visiting if they cannot be civil? Even if his ex wife consents to them visiting?"	Yes
456	So I am 18 and will be starting my senior year and I have 3 classes left taht I want to take online. If I move out will my dad still have to pay my mother child support? If you have questions I will answer thank you.	Yes
457	My brother has had sole custody and legal decision making for his two kids for 3 years.  Their mother was arrested for drug distribution, plead guilty, and only allowed supervised visits once a month starting 8 months ago.  She's now taking him back to court to try and get 50/50 custody.  We know that's more than likely not going to happen but she wanted to have the kids interviewed to try and see what they wanted to do.  My brother found out that his oldest daughter (16) said she wanted to live with her mother during the week and come back to him on the weekends.  His younger daughter (14) said she wanted to stay with him during the week and only visit her mother on the weekends.  I guess the question is would the court take their wishes into consideration and allow for this?  I've seen kids split up per their wishes before but I don't think I've ever heard about a court order for it.  Also,what would a split like that mean for child support?  Right now he's getting support from her, though she owes about six months worth of unpaid support.	Yes
458	"SWIM is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this."	Yes
459	I am an adult looking to simply change my last name to my mother's instead of my father's. This is due to uncovering things about my father and things he did to his family members that I find completely and utterly unforgivable. I've found reviews online but all they talk about is the cost. What I want to know is, what is the convenience? Can I take care of the entire process online or will I end up needing to go to court anyway? And how long will the process take?            Thank you.	Yes
460	"Hello,  Let me start by saying, that I know very little about any sort of legal process or have even been in a court before.    I know this is poking my head into issues that don't involve me, but I feel like my mom and my aunt are rather neglectful of my Grandmother, and are about to offload their responsibility onto me.  Late last year, before the winter, she and my aunt moved out to Arizona, and my Grandma bought a trailer in a trailer park for senior citizens 100% on her dime.  My Aunt, who is the medical POA, lives with her.  She has done nothing with such power.  My Sister, who is a CNA at a nursing home, has implored her time and time again to declare her medically incompetent.  However, my aunt shows no interest in doing so, and this is the woman that was originally given this power because 'she'd be the one with the courage to pull the plug'  Now, my Grandma is coming back home to West Virginia, while my aunt gets to stay in her house on my Grandma's dime.  The second home she has done with this, but that's a different story.  Last week, my Mom went out west to bring grandma back, and time and time again complained on Facebook about how difficult it is to take care of Grandma and her dementia.    Before she moved out west, my Grandma said that she would like me to watch over her house while I complete College.  The last of the classes I need can be taken Online, so I gladly took her up on this offer.  However, now that she's coming back, my Mom has explained how I will save her so much money by no longer needing to put her in a home because I am up here for the time being.  I am in no way a medical professional, and honestly have a hard time taking care of myself.  I explained to her that I will have a trip to go on in the second week of August, and someone should watch over her while I am not here.  She simply responded with 'if she falls, she falls"", which is disturbing to me.    The worst thing is that my Grandma told both my aunt, my mom, and me that she's been thinking of giving me the house, since I've always liked it growing up, am currently taking care of it now, and long before my Grandma had moved to Arizona, *and*  the she didn't like the fact that her daughters will be selling it before her body is cold.  My Mom told me before she went out west, that she would do everything in her power as the legal POA to prevent this, as 'this house is my retirement plan, and I'm not going to let you take that away from me.""  If there is nothing that can be done, at the least I will treat my mom the same way she treated her Mom, in the future."	Yes
461	"Im 13 and live in missouri. My mother has hit and threatened to ""pound my a** into the ground"" and one day it got so bad i had to grab my knife because i feared she would attack me where my life could be at risk. Because of these things, i was extremely suicidal for a time, and tried to kill myself twice. But then today, she had scissors because she said she would cut the cords to my tv and xbox. This was because she lost her keys to the fridge (they keep a big metal lock on the fridge). She always does this, yelling at me saying i took something, then 2 minutes later ill see her pick it up off the counter. She always tries to find some excuse to yell and argue and fight. In the morning, its never ""good morning, son"" or ""how are you son"" its ""son get your a** in here and get me something to drink"" (im saying son here in place of my name, i wasnt comfortable putting my real name publicly). Anyway, she had the scissors, and as i went to unplug my tv and xbox and throw the cords away from her (so she wouldnt electricute herself trying to cut them), she sliced down with the scissors, and cut my hand, badly. It was about half a cm deep, probably needed stitches, and she said ""if you give me my keys, i might do somethin about your finger"". So shes literally neglecting my need for medical attention because of a stupid f****** key. I want to file child abuse against her, but i dont want her to go to prison. She has a metal rod from her hip to ankle so her leg doesnt bend, and i can see her making it in prison. I just want to either live with just my dad (but he and my mom are still married. He just stays out of these things because he doesnt want to be yelled at), or have my mom lost custody temporarily so we can try to fix all this and have a normal family. Please help with this if possible. Thank you"	Yes
462	(Posting this for my uncle)  Some family friends (A&amp;B) have been taking care of their family member’s (C) children for the last 8-9 years. C has not helped A &amp; B with the children (age range 8-11) and has had very little contact with them. B has quite a few children, 1 of which they are responsible for (4 children in total). A &amp; B have decided that due to the financial burden &amp; C going back on the promise to help with the children, it is time to get proper custody of the children but they are unsure of where to start.   C’s home environment is not good due to C &amp; their spouse favoring the other children in the household, (spouse has 3 other children from another relationship) the children having to move schools, and C &amp; spouse tend to be abusive to the children and each other. A&amp;B have had guardianship of the children for the last 8-9 years, have taken them to all of their appointments, and been to all of their parent meetings with school and whatnot. The children’s teachers have never met C. C has stated before that if it’s too much of a ‘burden’ they can pick up the children and A&amp;B could wipe their hands of the situation. This is not in the children’s best interests due to them being treated badly in C’s household.   Where should A&amp;B start? A&amp;B are both older, and aren’t very wealthy. The children live peacefully with A&amp;B due to them not playing favorites and they were raised by A&amp;B. C has stated that they would help financially &amp; visit the children but have not done so. It has come to the point where the children don’t care for their parent and they don’t want anything to do with them. A&amp;B do not want them to go into a toxic environment nor have them lose out socially. I was giving them the advice to see if they could find a pro bono attorney, though I’m unsure if anyone would take this case. A&amp;B fear that the legal costs would burden the children &amp; them greatly. They are also scared that one day C will take the children away due to tax benefits and government assistance. That’s another reason that A&amp;B want custody (besides concern for the children’s wellbeing) C gets a good amount of government assistance but doesn’t help with their other children. Any advice is much appreciated.   TL;DR: A&amp;B have raised C’s children for the last 8-9 years. C isn’t helping as agreed. A&amp;B want custody. The 3 children don’t want anything to do with their parent (8-11 y/os) C probably has never heard of sterilization, at this rate they’ll have enough kids to start a baseball team.  (A&amp;B are grandparents/aunt or uncle to C’s children.)	Yes
463	"My sister recently passed away under some very bothersome circumstances. My family has been involved in a lawsuit over this, which is reaching its end point. We were recently informed that before everything is finalized, my father is legally entitled to inquire about his possible share of the settlement. This naturally caused a collective ""WTF?!"" moment throughout my family, as he his an absentee deadbeat who hasn't had contact with the family in well over a decade, and even when contacted about becoming a co-executor of my sister's estate, he waived his rights by not giving a fuck and ignoring it. Here are some key points:  * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate.  * My sister passed away as a legal adult; after emancipation.  * This lawsuit was initially filed by my mother as an individual, and soon turned into it being on behalf of my sister's estate, as she became the sole executor.  * My father waived his rights when it came to becoming co-executor of my sister's estate. He had an opportunity to pursue it but didn't, and has absolutely no association with the lawsuit, my sister's estate, or the family.  * My father hasn't had any contact with my family for almost 13-14 years, and has never made any attempt to make contact. He knows very little about us, made no effort to contact us and seek information regarding my sister's passing.  * My father owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support, and is a tax dodger. He's been to jail several times over both. Our attorney and the judge handling this knows, as we've provided extensive documentation about this."	Yes
464	"This is quite a long one.  Please excuse poor grammar. So 5 years ago I started custody on my son.  At the time he was 8.  While this started his mother refused to go to any court dates till she was handed with a contempt of court months later.  So during the next 2 years there were over 100 days of missed parenting time.  Our judge had enough of us constantly being in front of him.  None of this was due to me.  I had always done everything that was asked of me.  During this time his mother was charged with 7 drug felonies. She was allowed to use a 7411. Which means if she successfully completed her terms. That she would be charged with possession of non-narcotic.  During this time she had moved 90 miles away. And we had to meet half way which she despised doing.  Ok so now this is where the story picks up.  So on a Tuesday before my weekend I get a call from CPS.  I tell them that I will inform my lawyer and we will meet.  I work nights so mother goes to pick my son up.  The next day I ask my son what CPS was in regards to. And he says ""none of your business"".  Me and my son were really close prior to me starting custody.   We spent time together when she wanted a babysitter.  So we go to my parents house.  I tell him that he can go sot at his desk. For being disrespectful to his grandmother the weekend prior and me just then.  He wanted to get up so I tell him that he could write a report that his school was offering for extra credit.  He chose not to so I told him to continue to sit.  He was allowed to get up but I told him no TV.  He ends up watching TV with my father.  I tell him to sit back down he says no and what are you going to do about it.  I get up and I pit my hand on his ear and he walks in front of me and sits down.  Say an hour passes and I tell him he is done being punished.  We watch some soccer and go about our day.  Next day we all go to see Ghostbusters.  He has a younger brother and my ex's son who I raised since he was 1.  After we go to my house and they all play and go to the park.  We drop him off later that day.  So on the following Thursday I get a call from a detective and am told I am being accused of breaking my sons arm.  So when he was age 6 &amp; 7.  He had broke his arm in the same spot.  Now that January he had broke it for 3rd time throwing a dodgeball at school.  I call my lawyer.  And he says normally I would say not to talk to them but in your case we should.  We go and meet with him and tells me the allegations. The story was that  got mad at him and dragged him from one room to the other and threw him into the wall rebreaking his arm.  There are no accessible walls in the room.  Running a pornographic household.   For having a sex talk with a 13 &amp;12 year old.  Showing a Playboy and having a serious talk with them.  Both mother's had agreed and known about prior to use sitting down.  And then of course my wet preserved specimens were brought up.  Oh and I did this when CPS already had a investigation from her call the week prior. So during all this my children have been interviewed multiple time prior.  I have never hit my children.  I dont even yell at them.  So I go to court and I end up losing custody of my son.  If more back story is need on why I will provide.  But basically my court appointed lawyer set it for a bench trial.  And I was deemed unfit.  I did switch to my regular lawyer but the deck was already stacked. So during this time about 3 months later.  I find out I am being criminally prosecuted.   I get depressed about everything and stop going to work and make some overall bad choices.  One was having sex and getting a woman pregnant.   My youngest son was 9 and I had no plans on having any other children.   Well this woman is an addict.  While pregnant she was taking pills.  She goes to jail and then rehab then to methadone clinic then back to jail. All in her 1st 6 months.  So the baby is born. He maconian comes back positive for opiates.  CPS is involved. They find no reason to continue since she had a prescription for her last pregnancy.   Which was like 5 years prior.  Oh yea she signed rights away to her first son to her mother.  And gave her 2nd son up for adoption.  So CPS tells her that if she lives with me that they will be involved and want them out of my home.  So I still see my daughter when the mother would come over.  Till I ask for some things she took from the home.  I had bought everything for our daughter but was for the home.  The mother was essentially couch bouncing with our daughter. We stop having physical contact after this fight as she wasnt welcome in my home.  Over the course of her firat 16 months CPS had been involved 4 times.  One alleged incident involved her boyfriend shaking the baby.  These were always dismissed regardless of my concerns.   When we go for custody.   She received sole legal custody and I was denied parenting time.  I was also denied parenting time for my son. The reason was alleged abuse.  Even though the criminal charges were dismissed against me.  So last week CPS gets ahold of me and tells me the new case.  That the house she lives at is selling drugs.  Unknown number of people living there.  She smoked weed at 630 and at 1030 was in a single car rollover. 300ft of skid mark.  She was taken to jail for dui, driving suspended and child endangerment.  So today when I called they told me that our daughter was placed with her mother.  They are petitioning to remove custody from her and place her with the grandmother.  I have fought for my children endlessly. And continue to be disregarded.  Do I have any options?"	Yes
465	A friend of mine recently married a man who had a rather questionable past with the ladies. To my knowledge, he's never had any run-ins with the law, but he has 7 children from 3 or 4 different women.   It genuinely seems that he is maturing and wants to develop a relationship with all of his children.   He has a child from a one-night stand who is 9. A paternity test was done when she was an infant and he has been paying child support since then.   He doesn't have a relationship with the child though. As I have been told (for whatever that's worth), the mother won't allow him to see the child unless it's just the three of them (mother, father, child). She has a history of only wanting him around when he is single. When he is with someone, she won't allow him to see the child unless the 3 of them go out (very reminiscent of a forced date), and she will not allow him to bring any of his other children or his wife.   He doesn't really have a relationship with his daughter, and the mother refuses to let him introduce the girl to her siblings.   For awhile he just threw his hands up, and said whatever. Now that he's married, and really focusing on his family, he's upset that his daughter isn't a part of that, but he is also not sure how to approach this, as he's not had a real presence for the greater part of the 9 years she's been on this earth.   What are his options? What is the best way to proceed? And what obstacles will he likely face, given the lack of relationship?  Thank you in advance. I genuinely appreciate this sub, and all you offer.	Yes
466	I am filling out a fl-300 RFO form to request spousal support or a portion of my ex husbands 401k. I was married for 20 years in Northern California to an acholholic. When I finally left the marrige (no children), out of fear, minipulation and intimidation I didn't ask for any support in the divorce. I only left with a few boxes of my personal items and credit card dept. I lost my job last year after 9 years with the company and can't find work. My unemployment has run out and I'm broke and staying with family. I'm not sure how to request for what I deserve on this form. I'm not even sure what his yearly income is at this time. I know that when I left him two years ago he made $80,000 a year and had over $200,000 in retierment. I can not afford a lawer so I'm trying to do this myself. Any advise will help. Thank you	Yes
467	In order to fully understand the level of confidence I have in the opinion that my daughter is being abused psychologically would take a very long time. I will give the highlights.  My ex and I got divorced due to deployment related stress in 2010 when my daughter was 2. She moved back and forth between TN and NE during my deployments and eventually, after the divorce, she settled back in NE because of better schools and better standard of living (Omaha vs Memphis).  During the time that she lived in NE, I was unable to see my daughter frequently both due to a refusal to cooperate from my ex and my continuing deployments.  I got out of the military and hoped it would be a good opportunity for me to make up with lost time, but I was met with the same lack of cooperation as before so I really only saw my daughter a couple times a year (always only at her mom's house).  I filed for a custody hearing, my ex never responded to the notification so we had the sheriff's office serve her. The day after we got our receipt of service, she moved to TN.  Since the proceedings, the lack of cooperation because a full force of loathing and spitefulness from her. Her dad wanted to fight me in front of my daughter and told me I wasn't allowed on his property. My ex has sworn at me and called me things like an asshole in front of my daughter. My ex's mom has said, in front of my daughter, that I abandoned her.  After many proceedings and a trial-style hearing on the record I was able to secure some visitation times including the school vacations. I was so excited to get her for the very first extended period since she was 2 years old, now she's 8. That excitement and blissfulness of being with my daughter is now accompanied with total anxiety.  My ex got our daughter a phone, she said that she's supposed to have to have the phone on her at all times both in TN and in NE, but I have a lot of evidence suggesting that she doesn't get her phone in TN (i.e. a complete wipe of my text messages and phone calls from her phone when she showed up here this summer).  Through conversation it is fairly obvious that my daughter has been coached about a lot of this stuff with the phone (i.e. how to always keep location on, to call her mom every morning and every night, and not letting me or my wife see the phone as well as password protecting it).  All things considered, it was really easy to get access to my 8 year old daughter's phone and the things that have been going on this summer are startling.  My ex has interrogated her nightly about her situation and what me and my wife do, more so than asking about what all she's been doing and if she's having fun or not.  She has consistently thrown shade on me over and over, though that is to be expected I guess. I am the type that tells the truth to my daughter unless it could negatively impact their relationship, I'm not about that bullshit shade-throwing.  She told my daughter only to speak to her when she can be away from me and my wife and is always asking if either one of us have had access to her phone.  In the last few weeks my daughter has really warmed up to being here and has put her phone on the back-burner most of the time. She's fucking 8 years old and she doesn't give a shit about the phone, she just worries that she's going to be in trouble if she doesn't keep it on her (she's told me so).  During those few weeks she has been unresponsive at times that she's having a sleepover or she left her phone at home. On nights that she doesn't respond, my ex is very harsh.  During a vacation to Texas my daughter left her phone in the car overnight. The next morning, my ex had sent her a text before she went to work saying that she was up all night crying and didn't get any sleep because she didn't hear from her.  Tonight, she threatened to call the cops because she wasn't responding and had her FBI ex-boyfriend blowing up her phone as well.  1) I have all of these things from her phone backed up, but I don't own the phone. The communications are taking place in my house and concern my child. Is that information admissible in an informal hearing setting... I know that if I were able to subpoena the records from the phone company that would be admissible during a trial, I just want to know if I'm going to be breaching any privacy laws by having the information (hence the throwaway).  2)I'm legitimately freaked out about what my daughter is going through, what the fuck can I do to stop it?  Thanks for the help.	Yes
468	"My child support payments are going through a review and I was wondering if anyone would know how the net resources are calculated. I've already searched online and found numerous ""calculators"" but they don't explain what percentages are deducted as far as federal and state taxes. Is this a simple math question or is there more to it?  For example, if a person makes $50,000/yr and the state needed to find out net monthly income, what would it be? I live in VA so state taxes are 5.75% and according to TX federal tax rate is whatever it would be if a person filing as single with one dependent plus the standard deduction would be.   I just don't want to sign anything and not know what I'm looking at, then regret it.   Thanks for any help and I apologize if this isn't the right sub."	Yes
469	it's a little complicated but my fiancé has had his 16 year old son full time since pretty much right after birth. his ex-wife/child's biological mother gave him full custody, didn't battle it, and signed the papers from a lawyer in Kentucky.   the original divorce agreement has her agreeing to place money into a savings account for him and she never did.   Since 2010 his father and I moved with him (and her approval) to Ohio for better job and education opportunities.  She only sees him about 3 times a year, and doesn't really express any interest in him.    After the move we came to a verbal agreement (nothing in writing other than text messages) for her to chip in $150 a month to help him with school fees, health insurance and whatnot.  we had spoken about her eventually chipping in for car insurance and whatnot as well with a verbal agreement.   she's had some rough months (she's not the most dependable) and my fiancé doesn't really push it, but with his junior year of high school approaching she's stopped helping her son out. she's moved to Atlanta. Myself and my fiancé can afford our son, but his increasing fees for college, car and activities are becoming a strain since he wants to do more than what our means allow us to do at this time.   i know it's all on legally shaky ground since we have nothing in writing other than the divorce agreement. i'm just trying to figure out the best path for my son and my fiancé. i really do appreciate it.	Yes
470	Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this, first of all. I will go direct to the point. 1) My ex has blocked me from contact with my daughter for the past 3 weeks. 2) She moved out of state without my permission and has left the country without my authorization as well.  3) My daughter and adopted son ( my ex’s son) are being home schooled, without me knowing about it. And I thought they were going to a regular school.  We got divorced 6 years ago in NH, with her having primary physical custody (Not the same as sole custody according to NH parenting plan form). We also have joint decision making over the two kids. The divorce decree mentioned that she will be able to relocate to Arizona, and so they did. Throughout the 6 years, I signed a consent once when they moved to Dallas, another when they lived in California, the times they have traveled and so on.   I just found out through my mother (who lives in southamerica) that she arrived to Peru last Saturday. My ex contacted her a day before (maybe so that it doesn’t seem like child abduction? ). My mother, since she doesn’t see her grand kids as much (maybe once a year), agreed to have them for a few hours and they had a great time.  My ex's mother also lives in Peru but in a distant city, and it is worth mentioning that that city has had mayor flash floods and slides which have destructed some of that city this past summer (winter there), making it a dangerous place to be at. This is where my kids are currently and I don’t know for how long exactly, although they said something being around Christmas to my mother as well.  Apparently according to my daughter, they have been living in Hawaii since May, last time I saw her was on January and I have always thought they were in Arizona, since that’s where they have been living for the past year and a half or so ( I am not entirely sure at this point).   I’d really like to know what the best next steps are and what can I accomplish. Ideally I wouldn't like to separate them from their mother but I am starting to doubt that it'd be the best for the kids to be with her long term with this type of upheavals; this is the 7th time or more that my ex and her bf move with the kids in 6 years. I cant let this go on and I have been passive enough. What are my options? I have done some research but there is a lot of contradictions even with lawyers.  Is this abduction? Child kidnapping? I read the definition of both and somewhat it fits. Would the fact that my mother having been in contact with my daughter and son contradict the fact that could be a possible abduction?  I also want to put a stop to this and not just be in touch or see my kids whenever they decide it's ok (my ex and her bf). I honestly have put up with a lot, I also have tried the “maybe later on my daughter will reflect and look for me”. I think this is has been enough.  Thank you in advance for the advice and thank for taking the time to read this.	Yes
471	So I hired a lawyer last year to help me with my child support case. Back story, I was a SAHM for three years and also a full time student. Ex and I decided to mutually split and split our times with the kids as well. After the separation, ex was acting childish and stupid so I started getting my evidence together to take him to court to get primary custody of the kids and child support as well. Of course, I had to get state support since I was not working after the separation and they referred me to their 'go to lawyer'. I contacted said lawyer and her paralegal. They assured me it would be an easy case and to send everything their way.   Long story short, I didn't get primary custody, but shared.  50/50 was what the judge ordered. Even though I had multiple proof of him not being fit to have the children for 50% of the time. Anyways, after the judge ruled the shared custody, we were supposed to go over child support. Here where I'm at, the child support services will not talk to me since I'm being represented by my attorney. They will only speak to her and will only accept documents from her. I've tried calling, emailing and even stopping by the office but they've cut me out cold.   What can I do? Our contract is different because I was referred to her by the state. I paid a one time fee and she said it would cover ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Even if I needed her a few years down the line, as long as it was about my case with my ex. I feel like she's trying not to help me since she's technically losing out on money.  Any advice?	Yes
472	My wife filed for divorce 8 months ago in January.  I never signed any papers but she said that she received an email saying that as of yesterday the divorce was final.  Is there any way I can contest this?  She is having second thoughts and wants to work it out.	Yes
473	"Hi everyone!!! I have no idea if this is the right place and I'll gladly delete if not!!  Short story my husband and I married at 18 about 6 months after I got sick. I was still able to work part time and did so until he asked me to quit for the wedding and then we were stationed in Japan for 3 years. I didn't  work while there because we didn't need the money enough/it didn't seem worth it with my health. My husband has hated me from day one because I'm sick and I tried my damned hardest for 5 years to be good enough despite it all but I failed. We moved back to the states and I had a part time job for a couple of months and then quit while he was in school so I could go back home with family while he was away. About a year and a half ago I came to visit family and just take a moment to try and figure out why i was so unhappy and how to be better for him. (After he continued to be mentally and emotionally abusive for 5 years and refused to seek help with me) Well when I got back home we started counseling online and i became insanly sick in January less than a month after being back. I was vomiting constantly, in severe pain, couldn't eat (I lost 70 pounds in 5 months) as well as a few other issues. I wasn't able to travel but we continued counseling online. Well my husband decided he didn't want me to come home. I found out a few months later he was cheating on me and he had moved from our home and in with her without telling me. I've been to countless doctors where i live and I'm currently waiting on an appointment with a group of doctors at a major hospital because no one can figure out why im so sick. My husband's continued to support me financially (he pays my car payments and cell phone bill as well as a little money for food/groceries).   Well his ""fiance"" gave me a call letting me know I should be expecting divorce papers shortly and he's done with me completely. I have noooooo idea what to do. I don't want to screw my husband over because despite how god awful he was to me I just hate the idea of making his life more difficult etc. HOWEVER I'm freaking out about the fact that I'm going to have no money no possibility of working even part time and from what i understand if I even qualify for disability without a formal diagnosis it's going to take a while.  Do I have any options here?? Can i be ""rewarded"" some sort of alimony or spousal support or something until I'm able to work?? We're living in different states at the moment so do I see a lawyer here or call somewhere from the last state we lived in?? How the f can I even afford a lawyer?!?! 😓 please please please any tips or advice would be very welcome!!!  I'm ""living"" in ohio right now. I've been staying with family but i haven't done any formal address change. Hes currently living in North Carolina."	Yes
474	"My wife left me for another man and filed for divorce on May 1. The 60-day waiting period came and went, and she has still not signed the decree. I have removed her from the car insurance (including the vehicle she is driving) and various other household services, and will be removing her from the phone plan on Friday.  She is claiming that because we are still legally married, I am obligated to provide her with car insurance.  I have offered to pay her legal fees and provide six months' spousal support if she signs by Friday, which she is considering ""blackmail"". I have let her attorney know of this offer and my terms. (I am pro se.)  I have also told her to see her attorney and get a hearing date, and I would cover her insurance up to the hearing date.  There are children involved; I have almost-full custody but am providing her with nominal child support once the decree is finalized so she can take the kids. I am also making the payments on the van as a form of spousal support so she has means to take the kids somewhere. She currently is renting a room and does not have a ""house"" to take the kids to during her custody periods. She cannot currently afford her own place and expenses; she works a near-minimum wage job (by choice; she has turned down at least three job offers since the separation).  I believe I have a leg to stand on here; she doesn't. Even though we are still legally married, I can't imagine anybody would consider us married and force me to put her back on the insurance. I feel that she is milking me for money intentionally at this point, whereas I just want her to sign so I can move on."	Yes
475	(Ohio, USA). Despite being a minor, does the kid have any rights or privileges after the divorce is said and done? i.e. can they decline going to the opposite parents house, choose whose house they want to be at, etc.	Yes
476	We are divorced, obviously. I have primary custody and he has visitation that includes two full weeks in the summer (one in June, one in July. We live close to one another so I often help out sometimes during his time when work emergencies or what have you pop up. My schedule is way more 9 to 5 than his and we both care deeply about our child so it works out the best.   My family owns a winery so I have some amazing local wines around the house.   My ex is vehemently against drinking on principle.   I don't drink around our child at all but I do drink when he isn't there. Not all the time but often, either socially or alone.   This past week was his week. Because of this, I was trying to fit in some training at work to keep my professional license. It was pretty intensive and boring and by the time I got him on Thursday, I was exhausted. I had a glass of wine and then checked in with my ex to see how our child was doing. I try to check in at least once daily by text. Sometimes, since we live so close, our child wants to come home for the night or come home early from his week so I always like to check.   I didn't get a response back so I had another glass and ended up falling asleep on the couch. I am not a particularly heavy sleeper but I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep the night before and I had just had two glasses of wine so I slept heavy.   I awoke the next morning to find a ton of texts and missed calls from my ex-husband saying our child wanted to come home. They had apparently stopped by and knocked on the door for a good 20 minutes and I hadn't answered.   I feel bad that I missed the texts and calls. I feel bad for not being available. I even feel bad that it could have been a legitimate emergency.   But it wasn't.   I called him the moment I woke up. He didn't answer so I drove over there to see if I could help with the issue and apologize for not being available.   My ex-husband was very upset and understandably our child was sad that he couldn't come home.   I did get my ex-husband a copy of my house key to help prevent that sort of thing going forward but it doesn't seem to be enough.   He threatened to call CPS because I am the primary parent and was not available. He said I admitted to having a bit too much to drink (I said I had two glasses of wine not too much).   Apparently my son wanted to come and had been upset and cried a bunch while they were waiting outside.   I just now got a missed call (I was in a meeting) from someone who wants to talk about a complaint that was filed with their office regarding my child.   Do I need to call them back? Will they just call back? What do I need to say?   I am completely lost here and could use some help.   I do have bottles of wine in the house. They are in a child lock cabinet and he can't work a cork screw but they are still there so I can't deny that I drink.   Right now, our child is in the workplace sponsored daycare at my work downstairs and I am worried they will just show up and take him.	Yes
477	[IN] moving out of state custody issue   Serveral years ago my girlfriend, let's call her Jamie, divorced her ex husband. They had joint custody and remained in their home living there week on and week off with the kids to try and preserve normalcy for them. After sometime, he started coming home on his weeks off and one night hit her. He was arrested, and she left with the kids to a relatives the next state over. Her ex husband having money took her to court and was awarded custody as she had no home or car at the time.    In the year since then she and I met, she moved back here and we have bbeen living with my family, getting jobs, getting a car and recently a home. She was spending weekends with her kids every week.  A couple months ago her ex said he met a girl in New York state and was thinking about moving, he told her he would tell her more if it was gonna happen. Well he didn't and we found out from the kids that he was moving in 7 days, and he did. He said he wanted the youngest boy 8, bit was going to allow the older two a boy 14 and a girl 15 to stay with their mom here in our home. My wife was always going to fight for the youngest too but we were gonna have to have time to save money up...   Well the kids went to visit him and now he won't let any of them come back. He says she is an unstable mother because of the past year and he is currently the custodial parent.    He did not file anything saying he wanted to move. The kids have no friends or extended family there, and driving 13 hours to visit is impossible for us. They are all living in a one room apartment with their dad, his girlfriend and her 5 year old with serious behavior issues. They all want to be here with their mom.    What do we do now? Can we do anything since he didn't file a notice that he was moving? Should she just apply for legal aid? Any input will be great. She knows she hasn't done everything perfect, her life went into a tailspin and none was there to help her, but she's a wonderful woman and mother we've lifted ourselves up and are ready to fght for these kids even if that means taking on 2nd jobs to be able to afford it.	Yes
478	"For as far as I googled, you only can really change your name if youre a) getting married/divorce, b) on the run, or c) are transgender. I just really hate my name, and pretty much every nicknamed derived from it for my entire life. It's not an abnormal name, I just feel like it doesn't fit me AT ALL and hearing other people call me it/derivations of it always makes me cringe. It has been and still is really hard for me to imagine the rest of my life hearing others calling me that, thinking about that name being the one on my degree, and seeing it on my IDs and associating it with me. Is there a way I can word or a name change request form for a judge to not think I'm being stupid or having a phase. The name I want to change into is fairly common (I'm thinking ""Cody"" or ""Ryan""), but I am female so I don't know if it will be taken seriously."	Yes
479	Hello.  I think this is a simple question; just trying to work through language on a support agreement with my husband and his ex to make sure we do our fair part.  he and his ex  split the costs of dental coverage 50/50, per their support agreement. They decided to use ex's insurance since benefit was slightly higher.  She told him the cost to add the 2 kids is $63/mo.   Rates show something like this:  Insured (ex): no charge Insured + 1 dependent: $50 Insured + family: $63  Ex has a new husband and another son covered on the plan.   How much should my husband be paying for his 2 kids (@ 50%). Ex insists half of $63 is HIS portion, making him subsidize her husband and son, as they are covered, too.	Yes
480	I got married really young and now I want to get a divorce. Ex says he doesn't want to get a divorce lawyer and wants to kinda just get papers and sign off because he's in a hurry to join the army and not allow me benefits (which I'm not fighting for). We have a house under both our names and he kicked me out a year ago and I've jumped around living here and there since.  We live in Indiana and I don't know what to do. I want to sign off on the papers because I don't want to have connection anymore to him. Even though I'm not fighting for much anymore I don't know if a divorce lawyer is still something I should do. I've never dealt with this stuff before.	Yes
481	I am living in a house with my half sibling (we can call Richard) we have been living together for 3 years. Currently working on getting Richard evicted but that is another story. My main concern is I don't want retaliation against me living in the same house with Richard when then notice of eviction comes around. Since I have lived here Richard has threatened to hit me once. Broke the cable on the outside of the house that give us internet twice. Told me to move my stuff out of my room by Saturday of last week or that Richard would move it himself. Threatened to kick me out twice. Yelled at me to stop talking to our grandmother. He has decided to repeatedly pull the power for my internet modem (I alone pay for.) And has now slid open house flyers under my door. (I assume he wants me to move.) I am having a lot of anxiety because Richard has been known to have anger issues. I also know he owns a firearm and I really am afraid of what would happen when the eviction notice comes around because he will take it out on me. Do I have to wait for something more to happen, what can I do?	Yes
482	So the title says my STBX and I are getting divorced. There was a domestic incident tonight and I'm filing for a restraining order in the morning. I've read the documents online but I'm still confused on whether or not I need to file for temporary custody of our son separately or if that will be granted with the OFP?  I'm in MN.	Yes
483	Her ex's only visitation rights are one 2-hour supervised visit per month, and he hasn't paid child support nor requested to see the child in 6 months. He is apparently extremely verbally abusive and narcissistic (compares himself to a god, etc.) and will undoubtedly dispute it when he receives notice due to his pride. Will he have a chance in court? I hate the thought that some horrible person can affect my life so negatively if he's somehow able to say we can't move and I miss out on a great opportunity for myself and my new family.  I am begging anyone for any insight, my wedding is set for less than 2 months from now...	Yes
484	Hypothetically speaking, I live in Des Moines, Iowa and my soon to be ex-wife lives in North Carolina. She is having a lawyer draw up divorce papers. I have a feeling she's taking advantage of the joint checking account that we have and I can't take her off of the account because the nearest bank is in Chicago. Is there anyway, without a lawyer, that I can have her taken off of the account?	Yes
485	So I have been separated since 2014, filed for divorce in October 2015. I have sent several offers to hopefully soon to be ex wife's attorney to end the marriage. Never once has she countered any offer or given her own offer of what she wants. All she has done is fight against things I have tried to keep (children visitation).   I am a veteran and retired in October 2016. Didn't have a job when I got out due to hiring freeze at military shipyard where I lived due to Obama and approaching election. I paid support of what I could until I got job in February. I was half a month behind in support and she tried to get me for support in arrears. I had to use tax return to come current. And again no offers from her. Started new job she again took me to court for support modification since now making more money. Sent her offers and still nothing to try and settle this.   Now my question is it seems to me something is keeping/making her want to stay married. It's not my military retirement she only has under 17 yrs based on agreed upon date of separation which equates to about 37%. She will never get her own tricare health plan under the 20/20/20 laws. The best she can get is one additional year of benefits from tricare under the 20/20/15 law if divorce is after this august.   So with that information, what would be the odds a judge in Washington state would allow me to pull my petition for divorce, I am the one who filed, and she has done nothing to get this done. I don't really care if we stay married so she gets medical benefits, I'm just tired of spending money on attorneys that I don't have. She is still in Washington state and I now am in Maryland working at my new job.	Yes
486	Hi all, thank you in advance for your help.   Long story short. A woman and I are about to determine custody of a 1.5 year old in Vermont. It is a complicated situation, but the bottom line is that I would like Zero custody or visitation rights. I would like her to have sole custody. I think this is sincerely best for the child and the adults in this situation. I understand that I will owe child support and that is perfectly ok.   Initially she was on-board with the idea of me giving up parental rights, but she has change her tune lately and wants me to have some form of joint custody and seeing the child on the weekends. Can a judge force me to have custody?  Can a judge force me to have a relationship with this child?  I sincerely appreciate your help. I was waiting on a call back from a lawyer, but they must have gotten tied up. :(	Yes
487	I'm in the process of divorce, thus far it's been amiable and I have legal council which I pay by the hour instead of a full retainer. Boulder, CO  I'm looking for ways to structure the maintenance that I can then present to my lawyer and say this is what I'm thinking is it on the level or do I need to go a different route.   Details are this: I'm in sales, I make a salary which alone is about the average household income for Colorado. I also get a commission. I'm new at this company so commission is small and will remain so for 1-3 years based on what my coworkers have done. Once I develop my book of business, my commissions will be double or triple my salary amount.   For these questions I'm asking; can I (legally) do this, and would I want to? Set up a maintenance plan where I pay a flat amount based on my salary and then a % of my commissions as I receive them?  Can I put a hard cap on the amount I pay of my commissions; eg I pay her 40% up to a certain dollar amount in a year, at which point I only pay the agreed upon amount based on my salary?  She currently owns two businesses, one is as a real estate broker (buying and selling houses), she hasn't done it full time but has extensive related experience and the right personality.  She also owns a small ag business. This is where things get sticky, she has put about $15K of our money into it. Plus it has been her full time job for nearly 2 years, so there have been childcare expenses and other indirect spending. She has raised funds from small investors ($5K-$20K each), which I think is around a total of $150K, but that could be +/- $50K, she has pitched the company as having about a million $ value in about 5 years.   She has yet to collect a dime in salary or income.  I think I'm entitled to half the company (as an asset), but how to I get a value for it? How do I impute her income for purposes of finding maintenance?  I'm looking for resources and sources of information as much as actual answers to the above questions. Thanks	Yes
488	I can give details if you really need them, but the short of it is, I want to leave my husband but he's threatening me with taking away financial help (for me. He says he will provide for the kids). We have two small kids under 6. We live in a high cost state, I have been a stay at home mom all this time. I am lucky to work from home part time and currently bring in $600-1000/mo depending on how busy my client is (job is in administrative medical field). While that may seem like a lot, I use this money for all my own personal stuff (I'm talking clothes, shoes, sanitary items, even occasional medical care as I am uninsured), and all activities with the kids, some clothes for the kids, I paid for everything for their recent birthday party, etc, you get the idea. Husband now pays all bills (I previously made more, he made me pay a lot of bills, long story). He has been ragging on me about GROCERIES. What happened is I had to stop paying for bills and food because I don't make that much money anymore. I do ALL cooking, cleaning, chores, doctor's appointments, grocery shopping, etc.   Sorry getting too long just trying to give you an idea. I am leaving, and he's threatening me with with holding financial support. He cancelled my credit card today (literally the ONLY access I have to ANY financial info. He has everything on lockdown. Getting a clue why I'm out?!) He now is threatening to turn off my phone, take me off car insurance, etc.   I know this cannot be legal. I do not have money for a lawyer. I was denied legal assistance through a program in our state. I feel paralyzed. I applied for housing but there is a long list. I have the divorce paperwork ready to go, asking for interim spousal support, but that takes time too. I have a job lined up, but I have to take a certification exam and that isn't until July 31. I do have family I could stay with an hour away, but with no car and no money how do I make money (can still work from home, but would like to start a really good job with good pay)? I am willing to start applying for assistance but I'm at a loss. The first thing to do is divorce but with kids it's this huge web! If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be helpful.	Yes
489	"My wife and I recently got married and headed over to the social security office in our city to change her name. She decided that she ""hates"" her middle name and thus requested it to be changed to her mothers first name. Normally, they don't ask you questions about a maiden name change if you have your marriage license on you.   Long story short the name got changed and about a month later, which is today, we headed into the DMV to update her license to a newer version with her new name on it. They told us at the DMV that the name was changed without a petition of the court indicating a lawful name change. How can I get this fixed? Why did the social security office allow us the get the name changed if it is unlawful? What course of action should I take?    Thank you for reading my long post.    TL; DR: Wife and I got married, tried to change her middle name to something unrelated, social security did it, DMV told us we messed up and sent us to the clerk court, now we either pay money to fix it, or change her name back."	Yes
490	"Alright so I'm in a weird situation. I've been with my kids mom for several years now and it has never really worked out. We've stayed together for our son. Anyway, she hates my guts and I don't really enjoy hers, I live in her apartment(her aunt pays for) and I pay rent. It's been this way for a long time now. My name is not on the lease and hers is. My question is this; she is telling me that she is going to have the cops come tomorrow after I get off work to kick me out. I've told her that I need a notice to have some time to find a place but she's adamant in the fact that she doesn't need to give me a notice and she can ""do whatever the fuck she wants because it's HER apartment."" Am I wrong for thinking that a notice is required? I pay bills and I am here for my son. She's guaranteed me that the cops will come tomorrow and make me leave. I've tried to reason with her but she isn't having it. We agreed a few weeks ago that I will leave the first of September(which I'm COMPLETELY ok with) and now she's doing this. Do I have any rights in this situation? I'm the breadwinner in this household, it's not like I don't contribute. I'm just trying to figure out what to expect IF the cops get involved tomorrow."	Yes
491	My husband has decided to leave me. Even though I don't want or agree with a divorce I have to accept that it is happening. We don't have kids, house, etc. Very little in the way of assets and we mostly agree on how to split everything.  We have decided that an uncontested divorce is best. My husband thinks that we can share a lawyer but I wasn't sure. I have extensively googled and not gotten a definitive answer. Any idea?	Yes
492	State: North Carolina  As the title says my mother is having her children taken away from her, she has 6 children I am the oldest (23) so I no longer live with her. I have two brothers and three sisters ages range from 2-14. My mother, Stepfather (were divorced years ago but live together for kids) and his mother all lived in the same house. A month or so after my stepfathers mother died my stepfather has taken it upon himself to give my siblings to my grandmother (mothers side) and he is planning to pay no more bills on the house they've paid upwards of $100,000 on and is letting it be foreclosed upon and he simply wants to move into his place of business and drink/smoke the rest of his life away (Age 70), this is ruining our family, my mother was told to find somewhere else to stay which would put her and my two year old sister on the streets. (She was born after divorce, different father) My mother cared for my stepdads mother for months before she passed away (was 92) taking her to Dr visits, bathing her, feeding her, cleaning her room, washing her clothes and linens ETC, and now that she has passed my stepfather is basically self destructing claiming he will let house be foreclosed on (It is his own house that was handed down to him after his mother passed) and is separating my siblings apart by letting them stay with my grandmother, when my mother and stepdad were divorced he won custody but she retained her parental right. My grandmother moved in to assist with my siblings when my mother moved out. After 2 years my mother moved back in  to care for his mother and my grandmother moved out.   My siblings went and stayed with my grandmother for the weekend (as they normally do), when they all left on Friday my mother was told that she would bring them back Tuesday, well, that turned into two weeks and about 50 missed phone calls from my mother to my grandmother, when she finally got in contact with her she was told they  were living there now. This was all done behind my mother and my back, we were completely unaware that my stepfather/grandmother were planning this.   Is there anything at all my mother can do to keep her children (take them back from my grandmother) and continue living there? If not living there just get her children back?     My mom does not have money for a lawyer and is really side  swiped by all of this as we didn't see any of this coming.  I really do not know what to do to help her so I'm posting here, Thank you so much to whomever can give me some advice.	Yes
493	We live in Nampa, Idaho. My husband asked for a divorce during this May 2017. He filled the petition for divorce not long after that. I got a lawyer because he was acting very pushy, just expecting me to sign and part ways. Once he got my answer for his petition from my lawyer, he apparent got so upset he and his new girlfriend went out drinking, with her friends, in downtown Boise. He had a couple drinks and told me he didnt know they were 'double shot' drinks or whatever. He, his girlfriend, and 3 other people got into our car and he was driving. He then drove the wrong direction up a one way street. The cop said he failed the test and the breathalyzer  and he got arrested.   My husband said that because he didnt have his glasses with him that he couldnt tell it was a one way street. I have been married to this guy for almost 8 years, that is a flimsie excuse.   This is his first DUI and his lawyer had him plea 'not guilty'.  Everyone says it will be a slap on the wrist for him. He will get away with it and he is 27 yr old should know better.  So basically, will he get a slap on the wrist because it is the first time misdemeanor and his lawyer is skillful?  If i provide all the court documents and arrest report to my lawyer to submit to the judge about my husbands poor moral character? Does any of that matter?   My husband lied to me saying that he wanted to be on his own when he asked for a divorce. But ive found out about all this stuff on Aug 3rd, including the fact that he wants to divorce as fast as possible so he can be with his girlfriend (23 yr old).  He just got out of the Marines and i qualify for the chapter 35 school support opportunity because of hisva disability status. We had both planned for me to go to paramedic school for over the last year and use the Chapter 35. Then he asked for the divorce two weeks after I got my acceptance letter.  What can i do legally to fight back? I feel like a doormat. I have 3 jobs, no friends, and have about 1/3 of the money I need for school. He goes out and breaks the law and gets his license suspended.	Yes
494	Hello,   I have a 15 yr old sister in Arizona who is being neglected. She spent the summer staying at my 21 yr old sisters boyfriends parents house and they were okay with that. Now that school has started they are not okay with housing a 15 year old. My mother is never home, she has a bad hoarding issue and the house is a terrible place for anyone to be living. She has said that she does not want my sister living with her and is not helping to try to get her situated. I am 26, work full time, engaged and living in Nevada. I would like to bring my sister here and enroll her into a new HS but I don't know where to begin.   Any advice?	Yes
495	My uncle is married to a women who has a child. They were married when the child (F/16) was about 8 or 9. Her bio dad is not involved in any way (I am not even sure he has ever interacted with or paid support for her).   There have been a few concerning moments that I have seen in the past. When she was 15 she was dating and 18 year old, and having sex with him, all with her mothers approval. When he broke up with her over text because he was apparently also sleeping with a different 15 year old her mom's response was that it wasn't a big deal, and there was no reason for her to have to talk to the child. I have also seen the mother freak out at her for no apparent reason to the point that my cousin was in tears, and for years they have locked certain rooms in the home (like the master bedroom and some other general living spaces) just because they don't want her to have any access to their space. I know her mother also has another child that lives with bio dad and mom has not seen in 5+ years.   Now the current problem is that they have apparently kicked her out of the house. I have no idea why but knowing all parties involved it was for something ridiculous. My cousin is a great student and, besides the one horrible dating choice, is generally responsible. She isn't doing drugs or anything like that. I only found out about this because she was meant to come to a family event and told me that she couldn't make it as she was currently working two jobs and crashing with friends.   Is the correct person to contact about this CPS? or the RCMP? They live in a very small community in BC, Canada.	Yes
496	My mother is ready to begin separation/divorce proceedings against my father. What are some general immediate steps that need to be taken to get things started? What sort of professional agency or council should she consult with first and how should she look for this? Money is definitely an issue (they are not wealthy and she has been a housewife her entire life). I feel like talking to a lawyer is probably the best first step to take ASAP on Monday morning but not sure how to go about finding a reputable lawyer for her locally. If there is something she should be doing first otherwise I would appreciate the guidance.      Thank you!	Yes
497	Asking for a good friend who works with me-   He has 2 younger children with a lady in Maine now he's living in ny. She's on drugs and he wants full custody, he just got off the phone with a lawyer who quoted him 5k upfront and who knows how much total. Is this cost a necessary thing? He doesn't mind doing whatever leg work is required but he's not really good for that amount. Just looking for some advice in his situation. The mother has never been arrested or anything like that	Yes
498	"Two weeks ago my ex-fiancee left me standing at the alter. I'll spare everyone the squishier details, but after not hearing a word from her since our wedding day, she has been texting me. I asked for the engagement ring back and she said no, saying she wanted to ""cherish the memory"". I then asked her about the wedding shower gifts and the money that was donated to our honeyfund (an online registry where guests buy you honeymoon experiences as a wedding gift) and she flat out ignored the question.   My question is that if I have a right to get the ring back (its valued at 8K) and whether I have any rights to the money that was donated to our honeyfund. I would prefer to return the money to whoever gave it to us instead of funding some stupid girls trip for her and whatever insipid friend she wants to take with her."	Yes
499	Hey, the STBX and I have filed and we were hoping to take care of things ourselves, but I'm getting more and more nervous about some personal decisions she is making, and may need to try to get majority custody. Either my google-fu is weak or I'm having a bear of a time finding decent listings for divorce lawyers/mediators. Is there a website out there that has a comprehensive list of attorneys in my area? To be more specific I live in central Wisconsin, near the Wausau area.	Yes
500	Hello Legal Advice, Thank you ahead of time for your time and help.  In short, my mother is going through a divorce with her abusive husband, and is at the stage where discoveries for both parties has been made, and before any court dates.  The strange circumstance is that her husband gets away with lots of different crimes due to his mother working in the courthouse. This is a small county with a very small county courthouse, and everyone there talks to each other. I realize that it sounds slightly outlandish, but both lawyers and judges have been swayed by her, and it is not a fair court system for my mother to get divorced in. He has been pardoned of his fifth DUI today, and my mother is now that she is afraid to talk to this county judge about having what is fair to her from the divorce.  Therefore, is there anyway she can have her lawyer move the case and any future court appearances to a different county courtroom, with different personnel?   Thank you all again, and have a good day!	Yes
501	I had no idea how to title the post well, because it's all very odd to me. I've been separated from my husband for over 4 years now. I haven't seen or spoken to him in over 3 of those years. I have no idea where he's living, and divorce has been complicated to try and start. This isn't about a divorce though. I just had a child with another man, and I didn't know anything about paternity laws in my state. I live in Oklahoma and found out after delivery that if I'm married my husband is the legally presumed father of my child and my childs actual father cannot be put on the birth certificate or be the legal father. I now know he has to sign a denial of paternity and the biological father has to sign an acceptance. The issue is, I have no way to get my husband to sign the form. To my knowledge, he's still living out of state in California but I have no idea where other than the state. What actions can I take to get him to sign this form? Is there any service that can help? Do I need a lawyer?  Edit: A nurse in the hospital suggested that if I absolutely cannot find him to go and file for child support against him because the agency could find him and he could come and deny paternity. I don't exactly think that would work because I'm not sure you can even get child support while still married, plus I know he's not the father and that would make the whole ordeal odd.	Yes
502	"Let me start out by saying that I very much would never leave him alone while I ran an errand. Or went into a store. I just stepped out at the mail slot to grab the mail.   He is 6. He can open a door. It wasn't hot. Both doors are open. He is in a seat that he can get in and out of with ease (He puts himself in, in the mornings and takes himself out).   We live in an apartment complex and it has a roundabout, curve thing where you get the mail with no parking spots so people drive up, stop their car for a second, get out, grab the mail from the slot and jump back in.   I pulled up, turned off my car, got out and went around and opened the door on his side. He was playing his tablet so I just left his door open and stepped up on a curb where the mail slot is (maybe a foot away or two) and grabbed the mail in our slot and walked back to the car. The whole exchange took maybe 15 to 20 seconds. I even left my drivers side door open. So two doors were open.   During that time one of the other residents drove by and got her mail  and saw this and reported me to both the office (who said there isn't anything they could or would do) and called me into the police. She wasn't on the phone when I left. But my door was wide open where you could obviously she a 6 year old and no one else. But I didn't stay and chat. I was there just a few seconds.   No officer came by or stopped by. We were home about 1 minute later.   I actually didn't even know anyone called. I found out when the person left a note on my door saying she had my license plate number and had called it in. I also got a call from the office saying someone had reported me for leaving my ""baby"" in the car. They just wanted to follow up.   My ""baby"" is just a month shy of his 6th birthday.   I haven't gotten a call from the police.   What do I do? Do I call them? Are they just going to show up and talk to me one day? Do I have to worry about an arrest here? Losing my kid?"	Yes
503	I'd like to apply for legal guardianship of my girlfriend's daughter, the father is out of the picture and in prison for molesting a child. I'd like to apply for guardianship but I'm not sure which form to use. I found all these forms [here](http://www.nycourts.gov/forms/familycourt/custodyvisitation.shtml) but I'm not sure which one is the right one. I'd like to eventually adopt her if that's of any help. I'm also in Queens county.	Yes
504	Hi! Will like to seek advice on the above issue. My husband was diagnosed and warded for clinical depression and anxiety 2 months ago and remained uncontactable since.   From what I heard is that he has been staying with his parents and has been working since the day he was discharged from the psychiatric ward.   One of the last things he said to me was that he is not able to look after our 9 months old baby both physically and financially then became uncontactable.   May I know how long should I wait before seeking legal advice for maintenance?	Yes
505	I was born as a 2nd child in china when the 1 child policy was still in effect. I became an american citizen in 2016.(Seattle, WA).  My parents changed my birthday when i was born so there wouldn't be any legal consequences. The only correct birthday is on my Chinese birth certificate. Is there a way i can legally get my birthday corrected? What would be my first course of action?	Yes
506	"About two years ago my wife found out that she had an older sister from her father and an old girlfriend predating her parents marriage. She was excited to meet this older sister. Her father decided to take her out of state to meet her. Upon arival she was greeted by his ex-girlfriend of 30 years prior, who he had told my mother-in-law and wife would not be there.    During their stay they had decided to go out ""for dinner and a few drinks"" which turned out to be a swingers club.. My wife witnessed her father cheating on her mother with his ex in this sleazy place and was nearly in shock the entire time. They ended up staying longer than they had told my wife and she was very shocked the entire time and having panic attacks. She has been close to her father and neither I nor her would have ever expected this from her father, who was a seemingly cool guy before this. I have known them for 11 years.    A month after the trip back home the ex-girlfriend and older daughter moved to our same state, in the same town. The divorce ensued at nearly the same time, and then her father went to vegas with his ex and they remarried.. A shocking and tragic end to a 30-year marriage. The father continued to move in with the new/old family in the same town/same state as us.     He used my wife as an excuse to keep her mother from thinking anything fishy was happening. She has suffered greatly from this, after having been closer to her father than her mother her entire life. She has been diagnosed with anxiety disorders amongst other things and was rushed to the ER for trying to take her own life about a year ago..    He hasn't paid any child support the entire time, he didn't show up for court, they went and got him, he still didn't pay, according to my mother-in-law, for support per my underage sister-in-law. My mother-in-law got the house, he kept his truck, he gave his old truck to me before the divorce...He was also lying about how much he was getting from disability, while my mother-in-law worked two jobs to support them for nearly 10-20 years.. He remained on disability and got checks for each child and ""managed the money"" by lying about how much he actually got, and spent nearly all of it on his own personal interests. We found out he got a lot more from papers he left behind in the house..    We found online he was linked with an address out of state where his 'secret family' had stayed - it actually says it was in his name, and in the old truck he gave me we found dozens of reciepts spanning years for possibly rent for his secret families apartment(money orders to the same out of state town of his secret family). He also didn't give me the title to the truck, just a bill of sale saying he sold it to me for one dollar, and my mother-in-laws dad was the previous owner.. I don't think I have a way to get the title, but that's for another question..    He seriously messed up his whole family emotionally, and the older daughter is a crack head whore prescribed adderall and xanax bars, and tried to bribe me with drugs to sleep with her.. That's when my wife ended her relationship with her, while she was still visiting her dad after the divorce.. Her dad also supposedly has a painting that my wife made when she was 9 years old that was very sentimental to her, and some other personal posessions..    My mother-in-laws lawyer has cut off contact with her for whatever reason.. My wifes dad has done a lot of work for the state and city politicians here, like manual handyman stuff, and supposedly he has some kind of dirt on the lawyer.. I reccomended getting another lawyer, I'm just tired of all the drama and would like for her to get her stuff back and for him to pay child support.."	Yes
507	She talked me into staying with her because she said I had commitment issues.  She made herself my personal caretaker isolating me away from professionals, church, friends and family.  I trusted her more than myself because of dogmatic Mormon views of Husband and Wife and benevolence of mental health professionals.  She talked cryptically about gas lighting, life insurance and suicide protection but ducted out at the idea that she pay it incase I am instituted and can't.   She lastly brought up a polyamorous marriage. I said she was cheating when she left for weekends without contact. She gave me 30 days to get out of her parents house (she was already pushing her parents into nursing homes for).	Yes
508	This is an extremely long story so I'm getting to the point. My girlfriend went to the police because of her mostly emotionally abusive mother who drinks every night and takes her anger out on my girlfriend. The police did not do anything except force my gf back in the house with her mother. They took her to a different town, took all her forms of communication, her mom left her with an aunt (very sketchy about how this all went down and I can elaborate if needed), and her friends and I have all agreed she's in danger. The issue is that the family has turned against her and would deny everything, we have a lot of proof of what's going on at home, but at the moment we just need to get her out of her aunts house. We don't actually know if she's there or what's happening because she can't contact anyone. She's 17 years old, and we live in Nebraska. What is going to be the fastest and most full proof way to get her out? We have screenshots of her saying depressing and suicidal things since she arrived there. Any help appreciated.. we are in deep need of help because her family knows the law pretty well. We have proof of her Guardian being unfit and plan on showing that, but we  we are scared for her at this moment and need a way to get her out.	Yes
509	My parents got divorced when I was about 6 months old. As part of this agreement, any part of college that is not scholarships is supposed to be split 50/50 betweeen the two. Now, recently (and by recently I mean the past 4-6 years) our relationship has ceased to exist due to large disagreements between me and the rest of his family, and him, as in nobody really talks to him anymore. I just recently graduated with my Bachelors, and today received a Bill for his payment plan saying I need to pay it. In the past, he has always taken the route where he could not pay or steal what he can in regards to me. I.e. my college savings, avoiding medical bills, etc. Now that I am a completely independent adult, can I still go after him for this? Would it be worth it? For reference, its about 2 grand, and I make enough to make it go away within 3 months or so. But I have to pay back the amount of government loans i did take soon, and this may be rough if I do so.	Yes
510	Seven years ago my sister [f30] pleaded guilty to a count of manslaughter of her then abusive boyfriend and received a sentence of 5 years. In her absence, my grandmother took custody of her three children, the two youngest (males, now ages 8 &amp;10) were the children of the deceased, and therefore received minors death benefits. My sister was released April 2016 and as of December 2016 my grandmother essentially kicked out the children and placed them back into their mothers care, despite her living with a guardian and only having one bedroom between the four of them. Being a convicted felon, she hasn't been able to get a job (and therefore her own place) and legally doesn't have custody of her children, and yet is responsible for all care for her children while her grandmother receives the money for the two and doesn't help out at all from food, clothing, transportation, etc. Btw we are in NC.   What options we have?	Yes
511	"We didn't have lawyers and went the mediator route, everything was pretty standard and even got a little more than most. I pay 20% for child support, I get him all summer, every weekend and Thursdays, most holidays, rotate Christmas break etc.   We live in Central Texas and she is in school. When we were deciding where she could take him the options were this and surrounding counties or 'without regard for geographic location'. I didn't want to rule out Dallas and Austin since those are her best bets for work, that was the discussion we had and that was the understanding when I signed it - certainly no word about moving out of state. Now, however, she's threatening to move to Connecticut and laughing at me for being stupid and signing it - which....she isn't wrong. I was trying to think about her finding a good job so my son would have a decent place to live. Now it seems ""I've made a huge mistake"".   We only have the custody and child support agreement at this point and neither of us have filed for divorce (she needed an operation and my insurance so we waited for that to be over with).   What are my options in getting that one part changed in the custody agreement? Is that something that will be revisited when we get to the actual divorce? I'm retired military so I don't have a whole lot of money for a lawyer but if it's my only option is there anything I can ask for specifically to cut down some of the costs?"	Yes
512	Long story short: my ex wife broke my wrist and I am almost 2k in debt because of it. We had TRO's on each other and she had a harassment charge against me. Everything was dismissed, the deal was I drop everything if she drops her TRO and harassment charge and pays my medical bills.  She agreed and my lawyer sent her lawyer my bills. It has been 2 months and I still havn't gotten a dime. My lawyer is an old dude and I just dont wanna bother him anymore about it. He gave me copies of the agreement, I talked to my ex-wife but as expected she completely ignored it.  What legal course can I take?	Yes
513	I'm 17. My parents are divorced and my mom has full custody of me. I'm not in contact with my dad. I'm trying to change my first and middle name, but the judge asked for contact information for my dad and said that he needs to be aware of it. Does this mean that I'm going to have to wait until I'm 18 to change my name?	Yes
514	I'm looking to change my name and gender marker. It costs $435. I looked into waiving the court fees and I'm not sure if I can qualify because I'm a dependent. A foot injury from 6 months has prevented me from getting a job in case anybody says I should just get a job. Does being a dependent affect the possibility of waiving the court fees?	Yes
515	My daughter is turning 18 in a month. She wants to quit school and has just started her senior year. I am very against this. I know I can't force her to go since she will be legally an adult, but what other options are available to me? Can I tell her that she has to move out immediately? Join the military? I want to make life very hard for her if she does quit, but legally I don't know what I can do.	Yes
516	"CA/Alameda county/Bay Area So long story short, I am posting for my brother. He is getting a divorce and she won't leave until he signs a paper saying he kicked her out with is untrue. A little backstory: they got together when she was in high school and then had a baby so never finished high school until some time later. fast forwarding, they got married and had kid number 2. They have been living together for quite some time but obviously unhappy. I mean I'm not rude or anything but she's a 2 and he's like a 7 at least right so how they got together is still a big question.....anyways the point is she's stuck in her high school mentality or something, never grew up. When they got together she became a ""housewife"" because she has no job and doesn't do anything with her life. She sits at her house watching netflix all day/facebooking all day. Her kids are usually dirty, her house is always a mess. Literally her dishes would be piled in her sink and she would leave them there for weeks! The house would smell like sewer because if the rotten food on the stove! Half of her food in the fridge was always decomposing!The kids clothes are small and not to mention the kids clothes smell rotten because she washes them and then dries them days later. Im pretty sure they shower every other week too! Now my brother works graveyard shifts all the time. He comes home and wants a hot meal and a clean home and clean kids! but no. So of course he would be unhappy! mind you she can go to the store anytime she wants she has a joint debit card with him. Theres so much to this story but i guess thats the basics. Now. I wanna know what can he do incase she tries him in court. I mean he brings in all the money, he provides for them and she's a stay at home mom. never had a job before and doesn't even clean or do anything at home. She wants to get full custody of the children. She wants him to sign a paper saying my brother kicked her out so she can pull it up in court. He told her if she wants to leave the door is open, but he will not continue to pay her phone, bills, buy her stuff , etc. I think she's crazy and honestly i don't know how they have lasted years of marriage, its been around 10 years. OH! and they have a new house together and of course the house is not paid off yet so its legally not theirs yet but i also am curious about the home. Someone please tell me what could happen and whats the best way to go and etc. Thanks!!"	Yes
517	So me and my ex wife filled out all the paper work for a divorce, (No lawyers) nothing contested, we did it jointly, have everything sorted out already as we've been apart since 2012. Sent it in, judge sends it back saying I need to send in affidavit and 2 years taxes and a reason why I'm not paying the full amount per month. Me and my ex wife have agreed on amount that works for her and I contribute with the purchasing of what he needs when he stays with me on top of what I give her per month. My question is we have both agreed and signed off on an amount that works for us, how do we say this to the judge without him making me pay full amount?	Yes
518	I gave my friend money to lend and believed her story. Today, I thought I was dropping her off to see her mother, but I drove her to pick up heroin from her drug dealer. I had no idea this was happening, and I'm scared and worried for the child. The grandparents are likely to get CPS and the police involved.   I just would like to know what to expect from my end; will I be called in to give information or have to testify in court, if it happens? What is the process involving opiate addiction and pregnancy? Will I get in trouble?  Thanks.	Yes
519	"After three years together, my wife (32) and I (36) have decided to get divorced. This is her third marriage and my first. She has 4 children by her two ex-husbands (we have no children together, thank God). She moved out a few weeks ago, and I haven't gotten a divorce attorney yet.  Yesterday I received a settlement proposal from her attorney. I'm pretty much dumbfounded. She wants $40,000 cash and spousal support. I make a very good living, and when we got married she quit her job (working as a hairdresser) to be a stay at home mom to her children, which I was fine with. We have no joint assets. She and her children moved into my home, and I paid for all of our bills and most of her kids', although she gets a decent amount of child support each month from her exes.  I'm more or less in shock over this. I am hiring an attorney asap, but what can I expect from this, realistically? I've never gotten divorced and neither has anyone in my family, so I don't know what's standard. Would I really have to pay her ""support""?  She quit her job by HER CHOICE to take care of HER CHILDREN while I supported her to do that, so I didn't think I would have to be paying support for the decision she made. I can understand and expect it if she wanted to stay home with our children. I figured we would just go our separate ways with the things we brought into the marriage (no big purchases like homes or cars were made while married), and now I feel completely naive.  tl;dr: Getting divorced from wife of 3 years; she wants spousal support and $40k even though we have no children together"	Yes
520	"I am friends with this girl who was a 7th grader last year and was supposed to enter 8th this year. She was held back a little while ago and so all us are now freshmen and she's stuck in middle school. Her parents don't care much. They don't live in a normal neighborhood, but in a house kind of deep in the woods where you wouldn't expect to see one. She just smokes pot all day and hangs out with a bad crowd. This year she says she's doing ""homeschooling"" online. I know for a fact her parents haven't contacted school officials or taken any official steps to be in a online program. Her cousin (15) did the same thing a while back and hasn't gone to school of any kind the past few years. I know she wont do anything. Any way of the schools or boe finding out? I hate to see someone ruin they're lives like this. Any way I can do something?"	Yes
521	Ok, so a few months back I met this white girl from GSU on Tinder. I fucked her ONCE but nothing serious and haven't heard from her since. Now she messaged me on Facebook and says that she's pregnant and that I'm the father which is BS and she wants me to pay for the expenses and pay child support. She's a huge slut and has probably slept with dozens of guys and there's no way I'm the father I used a fucking condom. Anyways I'm broke and here on a scholarship and can't afford nothing and even if I could I wouldn't as I'm not the father. She said she'll get a lawyer even though I don't know how her redneck ass can afford one. So how can I deal with this bitch?????	Yes
522	Sorry about the formatting, on mobile.   I am a 16-year-old student who lives in South Dakota. My friend, who I'll call Cassie for the purposes of this thread, is also 16 and lives with her parents. She has a younger sister who is 13.  In public, Cassie's parents act like some of the most wonderful people you could ever meet. However, in private they are very abusive towards their daughters. Most of the abuse is emotional, but Cassie recently admitted to me that her parents have hit her and her sister multiple times. They'll insult their daughters until they cry almost every single day, constantly berate Cassie for being dumb (despite her having straight A's) and a disgrace to their family, and tell Cassie and her sister on a regular basis that they are never going to amount to anything if they don't become exactly like their parents. These are only a few examples of the kind of emotional abuse that occurs every day.  Cassie has a whole host of health issues (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and ADHD), many of which are untreated because her parents refuse to believe that she actually has these diseases despite her positively testing for them multiple times. I am concerned that she may be suicidal or will become so in the future.  Her parents are also in a constant surveillance state. The mother has an app on her computer that allows her to look at her daughters' phones at any time, and she constantly goes through their internet histories. Her parents also search her room on a regular basis. This surveillance makes it very, very difficult for her to collect any evidence of their abuse.   My question is this: Is there anything I can do, as her friend, to get her out of this abusive situation?	Yes
523	I'm gonna try and keep this short. 3 years ago my parents separated. I had to live with my mom because my dad was deployed. I wanted to live with my dad for w years after that point and finally got my wish a year ago when they divorced and my mom gave my dad custody. well turns out he lied about everything. He had a new fiance and she had 2 kids of her own. I hated living there for the past year because my dad told me up to that point it would just be us and the fact that his fiance is insane. She controls him and  tells him what to do and constantly controls everything. Every notices this including my own sister. .This past year of my life has ruined me in every way possible. Emotionally mentally physically I'm just exhausted. This summer in July I was sent down to TX to visit my mom for the summer and it's been amazing and I am 100% certain I want to stay here. Problem is my dad is going back on his promise saying he would allow me to come back if I wanted to. My flight to go back to VA is on the 26th of this month and he's made it clear if I don't go he *will* call the cops on my mom. I don't wanna go away and I think I'm just gonna run away on the 26th tbh. I've expressed all of my emotions and that I will run away and he still doesn't care. I told him the only way I'm going back to VA is in chains because there's no way I'll willingly get on a plane. My mother said she filed for emergency hearing or something like that a couple days ago but it may not go through or something or not in time so she said I have to go back until then. What do I do? I won't go back. Please, any help is appreciated and forgive me for how horribly this was written and formatted I'm just writing fast and I'm desperate.	Yes
524	My partner and I are divorcing in San Diego California.  We agreed to go our separate ways, divide our stuff on our own, and just end it.  I moved out and filed the paperwork, and they lawyer-ed up and are now asking for more than agreeing to.  My question is can I, as the petitioner, amend what I am asking for from the court?  There are no children together, or anything too complicated like property or large 401K's.  We make almost the same amount of money, the marriage lasted 2 years.  Just dept and assets acquired during the marrage.  I have an appointment with my own lawyer next week.	Yes
525	Ohio: OK, so a friend of mine is in the middle of a HUGE cluster and I could really use some advice to pass on. I'm not even sure where to begin… My friend is 19 and a completely disabled quadriplegic, his mother is his full-time caregiver, but she has become very estranged to her husband (yes they are still married) and they lived under the same roof up until recently. My friend has three younger siblings, all of whom were just taken by the dad to another town and he won't disclose where they are staying. The mom called the police and they said they can't do anything unless there are court documents filed. Isn't this kidnapping? Since he has taken them, they have come back to the house couple times, but only for a couple hours.    One of the biggest problems is that the mom is my friend's full-time caregiver and is completely dependent on the dad to pay bills and take care of things financially, but he doesn't include her on any of the financial information. This makes finding a legitimate lawyer very difficult. There is a lot more to this whole situation, including years of manipulation and mental abuse. It seems his main goal is to discredit her and threaten her with getting full custody of the kids and making her out to be the bad guy. It sounds like he has been able to turn the three youngest kids against her and is using money and gifts to manipulate them. The mom has no idea where the dad is getting the money to afford a second home or these gifts (including a car), especially because the dad recently put the family on Medicaid and food stamps.    What are the first steps I should recommend for the mom? Thanks in advance for any help/advice you can offer.	Yes
526	I caught my husband cheating today. I'm still in shock so please excuse my grammar and other mistakes. We have a 2.5 yo son and I'm afraid of how this could affect him. My husband has been carrying on an affair with a coworker who is also married. I do not work and have no skills or means of supporting myself or my son. My husband is threatening that he can take full custody and deny me rights to my son for this reason. He is using this as leverage to prevent me leaving the state to seek comfort in the company of my family. Or to even leave the home we share because he insists he should get to see his son every night.  My little boy means everything to me and is all I have now. I can't lose him. My husband would likely lose his job if I made this public but would also beat me to death. (He has beaten me before but I have never had the courage to report it or save photos). I don't know what to do or how to get away without risking my life and my son's. I want to leave but I'm so  afraid. Please help.	Yes
527	So I am moving out next week and my parents are becoming increasingly bitter over it. They told me I have to take literally everything that's mine with me when I leave (which I will not be able to do, I have a small car and also the house I'll be renting at has no space for anything and is already furnished anyways).   I'm wondering from a legal perspective if I have to do this? 90% of the things that would be considered mine, there would be no way to prove that it's actually mine (bed, nightstand, tv, etc).   I have a week to get rid of all this shit and I'm kind of freaking out. Most of it is unimportant to me and I wasn't planning on taking it. Do I legally have to?  I am 20 years old if that matters.	Yes
528	"I'll try to keep this short. My boyfriend has been pressing for an open relationship for months. I told him no. Finally, two days ago he said that we were now in an open relationship.   I told him it doesn't work like that and that both of us had to agree.   He said he owed our boss a favor, and I was going to help pay it off. My boss, last night, told me to stay late and told me my boyfriend said I was ""fair game"". I told him I didn't consent to have sex, which of course didn't stop him. He made me shower when we were done.  He sent me home with my boyfriend, and I have been there since ... I don't know what to call it - the rape?   I want to leave, or press charges but my boyfriend won't let me do either.   Can I even press charges with no physical evidence?  Do I need his permission to break up with him?   My parents gave me to him when I was 17, like to date... Kinda like an eventual marriage.  We are now 19 but not married. I don't know if this affects anything.   TL;dr: my boyfriend told my boss to rape me and won't let me break up with him. Please help.   Dallas, Texas"	Yes
529	Hello, the home I share with my husband has cameras inside it that we put up to protect expensive equipment. I recently found out he wants a divorce; he logged me out of the cameras but I was able to log back into them. I have video and audio of him cheating with another woman when we were together. I also have audio after he asked for the divorce telling his friend that he was happy that I was okay with settling and giving him the house. He also admitted to other incidents of cheating. Will I be able to use the audio and video in court? He has no idea that I have them. My belongings are still inside the house which we jointly own.	Yes
530	"Before passing, my husband's grandfather made his son (my husband's uncle) the executor to his estate to help make sure bills were being paid on time etc. In doing so he added Uncle to his bank account. Grandma does not have a bank account nor is her name on Grandpa's bank account.  He started off by paying off Grandpa's $10,000 credit card (which he quickly maxed out over the limit to $15,000 + stating it was insured and would be paid off when Grandpa passed so he thought he'd just blow through it - all stuff for himself and his family / some purchases were made day of / day after Grandpa's passing.)   Grandpa was in the hospital for a little over a month and then placed into in home hospice before passing. When he was released from the hospital Uncle informed Grandma that the hospital bills were over $3,000,000 and insurance barely covered anything so they were putting a lien on all their accounts and assets. To me this raised a huge red flag because I've never heard of anyone leaving the hospital with a bill - and even if so wouldn't they give you a chance to pay your bill before trying to seize everything? Anyway....sounded like bullshit to me. He has yet to produce any proof of these liens. No letters, nothing.  Grandma and Grandpa had 2 CD accounts that Grandma is the beneficiary of - one was $50,000 and the other was $115,000 - Uncle suggested they cash the CDs out early so the hospital/insurance couldn't take the funds for Grandpa's bills. After fees they cashed the CDs out for $47,XXX and $112,XXX - the day they were deposited into Grandpa's account the funds were transferred into Uncle's personal savings account. We know this because my husband decided to set up online banking for Grandpa's accounts to try and help Grandma figure out what was going on.   Grandpa also had around $30,000 in his savings account and $5,000 in his checking account before the CDs were released. One day when Uncle was over at Grandma's house she decided to call the automated system to check the account balances. There was about $2,000 in each account. Shocked, she asked her son where all the money went and his response was ""Oh, uh, I don't know. I gotta go."" and promptly left her house.   We've estimated he's taken around $180,000 that was supposed to be left to Grandma to live the rest of her years out without having to rely on anyone. Grandpa worked very hard to make sure he was able to leave her money and all his kids and grand kids money.   Grandma babysits for Uncle every week and has noticed he purchased a new safe, new RV, playground, used cars, home improvements, packages showing up every day ""Uncle's Name C/O Grandpa's name) etc. She also noticed that every time he has someone over at the house doing work he goes to the safe and pulls envelopes of cash out to pay them.  To me it's pretty obvious he's taken the money for himself and is leaving her high and dry. What's not obvious is what we should do about it. We are scared that if we are not prepared when going to the cops and they speak to him that he's going to hide/get rid of the rest of the money that's left.  Please keep in mind Grandma is on a very tight budget so finding a lawyer to help for little to no money will more than likely be very tricky.  Since we do have online access to the Grandpa's bank accounts we have printed out the statements, transaction history, and check images. Grandma also has the letters stating she is the beneficiary of the CD accounts.  If it helps, we are located in Oregon."	Yes
531	Hello everyone. I have a friend, she is 17. She lives in a Muslim household that greatly restricts her freedom. She is not allowed to leave the house for anything but work or school. She's had a history of self-harm, eating disorder, and various mental illness. Her parents have actively berated her for these issues, saying 'you're a disgrace to this family' 'you ruined our lives' etc. She's gotten in trouble for sneaking out and smoking cigarettes, sure, not right, but the punishment was a closed hand beating every time. She was caught trying to sneak out last night, and in a weird trance, told her mother everything she's done. She admitted to not believing in God, having multiple boyfriends (which is not allowed), and still smoking.    Now, her father, who is a pilot, is away for now, and she wants to get out before he comes home. There's been multiple instances of the mother having to stand between her and the father to stop further harm being done to her. Her life is genuinely in danger, as not believing in God is about the worst thing she could've said.   What should be done here? She wants to run away and call the police, will they help? Or will they send her back, as she has no markings from any previous beatings. Any other course of action to take here? Sorry if this isn't the right sub.	Yes
532	I'm asking this question for my boyfriend. Several years ago through a one night stand my boyfriend got a girl pregnant. About two years ago he found out it was his and has been paying child support since, but has not had or wanted any interaction or custody. The mother was fine with this arrangement and would still be. However, it turns out she has a pretty serious drug problem. The child has been taken from her and dcyf is demanding that my boyfriend take custody. He does not have the means or the ability or the inclination to care for this child. If it were up to him he would give the child up for adoption. He works full time and is about to start going back to school. But they say he has to or neglect charges will follow. I'm hoping somebody here can tell me what his options might be from this point and what possible consequences could come from those actions. Should he bother with a lawyer (We don't really have the money, but could probably fit it on a credit card)? The mother is being given a year to get right before having her rights terminated. The child is currently in foster care	Yes
533	Hey everybody My fiancée has the greatest kid on the planet and i want to know what I gotta do to adopt her in the state of Georgia. I have read that the dad would need to sign a form relinquishing him of any custody. My issue is that he hasn't been present for a long time. He doesn't hold down jobs or pay child support. He is violent and has been arrested for it more than once.he has also had to stay in psychiatric hospitals more than once. When my fiancées daughter was younger, he abused and neglected her and when my fiancée found out, she left him. She didn't press any charges or anything like that unfortunately, but what I'm wondering is, if we could prove as much as we could,would we have enough to go on to bypass getting his signature? I wish I could write all this out better. I'm sorry. Thank you so much in advance for your input.	Yes
534	SIL loves in Texas and is in a unfortunate situation. She's married with one kid. Marriage isn't going well. Could she take the kid and live in another state? The husband would know where she was, it would be to simply get her in a better position and maybe fix their marriage.	Yes
535	I am engaged to a prisoner who is being held at a detention center in Maryland. He is currently awaiting trial. For a number of reasons, we would like to be married as soon as possible.  I do have an appointment with a lawyer of my own later this week but wanted to see if anyone could advise if our plans would result in a valid marriage.  I have gotten a family member ordained online already. Our plan is for me to pick up the marriage license, and after the 2 day waiting period, have the ordained family member pronounce us married during a visit.  Would this wedding be considered valid? There is a chapel and he can put in a request, but we prefer to do this as outlined above.  Thanks for any insight you can offer.	Yes
536	hey, so to make this a short long story, my father has never paid child support even though my mother had got it in writing what he was supposed to pay (the amount slips my mind as I was 3 when this all happened and I have lost all the paperwork). but as of now I am of age of majority and still wondering if i have any entitlement to that money. I'm also in Canada, British Columbia. So I guess what I'm asking is where I stand with all this in a legal level, what my options are, what kind of lawyer to look into. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this. Will update with any info as needed.	Yes
537	Located in Oregon. Over a year ago I tried to file a restraining order against an ex boyfriend I had recently dumped. I'm going to try to recall exactly what info I gave before, and update on what's progressed since then -- it was denied last time, and I'm pregnant and expecting a daughter, and given his highly inappropriate behavior towards me I want to keep my family safe from him. I have moved twice since then as well.    I also want to state up front I will reference him harassing me on social media a lot -- I want to say I have changed my name multiple times on mediums I can not afford to delete (work purposes), I have made new social media platforms and blocked all his known accounts on all of them and have tweaked all privacy settings to the max. I have *no* public social media any more, strictly reviewed friends lists on all of them, etc. I can't get rid of things like my work email address and he's utilized those too -- like I said, I block him, but he uses different and new accounts to contact me so there's nothing I can do but avoid them. He still finds ways to contact me persistently by making new accounts and tracking my new social media accounts down through known friends and family . For work purposes I kind of have to have the basics like twitter/FB/instagram, but all are privacy locked within an inch of their life and not connected to one another.      This ex was super emotionally abusive to me -- controlling, manipulative, tried to tell me I *couldn't* break up with him, threatening self harm and suicide when he didn't get his way, pressuring me into sex stuff I wasn't comfortable with or into snorting adderal (something I did not like and have never done since.) After months of emotional abuse, it escalated to what I told the court about: He screamed and berated me for about 18 hours while refusing to let me leave my apartment or call anyone, and kept me silent by threatening to tell the police I had marijuana in my possession if I screamed or anything. He threw things at me during this time, told me I was a piece of shit and to kill myself and that I was worthless. I begged him to leave and offered him money for a cab, for a hotel, for gas, anything, and he wouldn't go. He also eventually implied if I had sex with him he'd be on his way, so I did that willingly but not because I wanted to, but I was too scared to tell the police that, or about the pressures to do drugs in the past.     I also told the court that for months following he's been making new accounts and contacting me-- telling me I'm being immature and to talk to him sometimes, other times just adding me with no message at all. I told him repeatedly to stop because he was upsetting and gas lighting me and he just flat out won't. When I tried to file a restraining order, they told me he didn't pose a real threat to me so like sorry he makes you sad but suck it up.    Smash cut to a year later after that rejection. 5 months ago, he found and added a new comment to a BDSM 'contract' he had us make together while we were dating, telling me it was fucking good work and that he was going to use it with his new dom. I told him clearly again to never contact me and to fuck off. He does. Until a few days ago, when he adds me on a new Instagram account, featuring him wearing his fetishwear of choice, womens clothing. The creepiest thing?? In the past week, he's posted photos *I * took of him, or that he took wearing my girly clothing, or in my apartment from years ago while we were dating. He added me. I used the messenger feature and told him he was being gross and to delete the pictures. He basically said they 'mean a lot to him' but that he will (I checked today -- they're still up. Ew.) He also claimed he didn't search out my account, that he 'added all of his contacts' (on his fetish account? sure. Also, I checked, he has 0 new followers /followees, so bullllllshittttt.)     He has stuff on me that would ruin my life it it came out so I can't publicly out his account, as satisfying as it would be. I still rely on my parents for financial and emotional support and he knows things and has evidence of things that I dont want to explain , but that would effectively make them cut me off immediately in every way.    I have been trying to record all interaction we have, and tell people close to me every time it happens . I want to try to file another restraining order -- is there a point, or am I going to get the same hand-wavey answer as before? Should I send a cease + desist? Will that do anything, and how do I do that? I can't afford a lawyer.     I know I sound pathetic and poor and whatever, I just really would like some answers and to not be told I'm overreacting. Thank you.	Yes
538	Both my sister and I have undiagnosed ADHD. It's extremely apparent in both of us. We desperately need a diagnose so we can get help. My sister is honest to god a genius, but she can't focus in class and it impacts her grades. She also has anxiety. Personally I am high functioning, but it would really help if I didn't lose focus so much myself. We want to seek treatment, and my mom has been trying for years, but our dad intervenes, because we need his consent to start a diagnosis. He doesn't want to give his consent unless we go live with him full time, but we don't want to live with him because of the emotional abuse we have suffered there. Is there any way we can get a treatment without my dad having to consent?	Yes
539	I have a family member that is buying and redistributing mass amounts of fake ids from various places in China to college students. He posts frequently on the fakeid subreddit, but other than that is relatively discrete. I'm not okay with this family member doing this kind of activity in the same household as me. I also recently found out that he got fake ids for a student that passed away at college last semester due to alcohol poisoning. It could have been from the alcohol he bought with the fake. If he does not stop this activity, how should I go about reporting him to the police?	Yes
540	I'll try to briefly sum up the situation. Brother was with his wife 17 years (Caifornia which I believe does not recognize common law) and married for six. He owned the home prior to meeting wife and paid most if not all of household expenses including wife's education during the relationship. Wife came into the relationship with nothing. Simple question...does she have a claim to a portion of his home? Her name is not on the deed or mortgage. House was underwater at the time of marriage but he has a healthy bit of equity. Thanks in advance.	Yes
541	He constantly holds it over my head that I am going to be left under a bridge without my children once he does get this money. I don't know what to add other than I've worked less than him throughout our marriage. Mostly because of childcare costs. There was a time that i was working two jobs and he wasn't.   Please ask me for details... i dont know what to add that is relevant	Yes
542	United States, Michigan  I am 24.  At this point in my life I have severe mental illness.   I have enough control that I can hold down a job, but I can feel myself getting worse.  I don't want to get to the day where I'm going to do something stupid and there's nothing to stop me. I want to talk to my parents about having myself redeclared under their guardianship so they can legally tell me what to do.    What term is used to have a parent reobtain legal control their child over the age of 18? I would like to do some research on the topic.  If anyone has knowledge of the system in Michigan I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for your time and help	Yes
543	Here's the deal, I've got 50% physical custody of my kids. Initially she stated she wanted no child support, and the divorce decree was written as such, with the issue of child support reserved. Six months after that was final, she filed for child support and our court date is Wednesday. She insisted the children go to school near her, and instead of going to court, we had a mediator act as an arbitrator. The kids school is 25 miles from me, we both live in a suburban area, so it's quite far. Currently, for child care, I have my mother take the kids to school and get them home, and watch them while I work during the summer. I pay her $5/hr, and reimburse her for the tolls and $0.535 per mile per the IRS rules. Not wanting to be caught off guard if something were to happen to my mother, I used Care.com and described the hours and mileage required and I'm getting salaries back that are twice what I currently, actually pay.  Will the courts consider what actual market rate is for my necessary child care or do they typically only care about realized expenses?	Yes
544	My boyfriend has been separated from his wife for a while now. They are finally going to go through a divorce. He isn't completely legal in the states. They were working on immigration status to have him become a permanent resident. That eas halted when she began to refuse attending the appointments.  Now that they are going to begin the divorce process how will this affect him? He works at a job, has a social security number, and has 2 kids under the age of 18 that were born in the US. He and I have a baby due in October and I'm terrified he might be deported.	Yes
545	I'm a male with a girlfriend. Her male friend accused me of abusing my girlfriend in a public area and the rumors have spread. My girlfriend has shot down many if these untrue rumors but should I take any legal action?	Yes
546	I'll try my best to keep this brief, but I am looking for some direction.  I was born in 1978, by 1979 my parents were divorced and my dad bailed on us and moved to Florida. My mother re-married several years later and had 2 sons with her new husband. In the early 90's when I was 12/13 years old my mother asked if I wanted to be adopted by my step-father. I agreed, and they took the legal steps to adopt me and change my name.  Now, one important factor here is that step-father was extremely abusive to me specifically. I have no fond memories of this man. In fact, I chose not to burden my children with the same last name as it's synonymous in the town I grew up in.  Also, when I reached the age of 21 my real father reached out to me for the first time. I've since built a good relationship with my real father and have come to regret the adoption that occurred when I was young.  The adoption took place in NJ, where I was born. I currently live in PA and would like nothing more than to reverse the adoption, or at the very least, get back my original name.  My step-father died nearly 15 years ago at this point. My real father is very sick and I'd like to get this done ASAP but I have no idea where to start.	Yes
547	So, my half sister (same mom) has been staying with her half-sister (same dad) since their dad passed 4 yrs ago. They told her today that the money she gets isn't here, and they've been spending it. She was ordered into their custody by the state, she's 16 now and wants to move out and figure out how she can take action against them to get her money (or at least some of it) back.	Yes
548	I am not sure if this counts as child endangerment, I think it does... So someone I know just had a child. The child isn't even two weeks old and they moved the child into a damp home with wet walls, mold, and in some places holes in the ceiling. The make shift baby room is a space with one side of the room completely clear and the other packed ceiling high with junk. It's really not safe for anyone to be in there... Now the parents were warned by family not to bring the child into that house because it's unhealthy but they did it anyway. They have the means to live elsewhere but choose not to. Quite frankly I think it's time they grow up. Should I report this to child protective services?	Yes
549	"I am currently a 15 year old female living in Nevada and I'm having some problems with my family. My parents have hit me occasionally (never hard enough to leave a mark) and my older brother is verbally abusive. These issues have lead me to self harm (I have stopped thanks to some wonderful friends on the internet) and I have also had a single suicide attempt. I have a friend that lives in California who is 23, who often says he would take me away if he could in a heartbeat. Is this possible? I don't know if my parents would agree either, since I have brought up the idea of letting me go during fights and they have said no. What are my options here? I do not know if I am capable of living on my own, but I also don't know how long I could live in that house before I'm driven to self harm again or even possibly another suicide attempt. Could I get my friend or his parents (if he isn't financially stable enough) to adopt me? Could I find a friend's parents to adopt me? Could an adult friend adopt me? Could I even marry said 23 year old? (I dunno I think I came across something about marriage while I was looking up emancipation laws) I'm even more at a loss because of the whole ""different states"" thing. Remember, I live in Nevada, but my closest friend lives in California. My other possible options live in Seattle."	Yes
550	Hi, my mother and I are co-guardians for my father and are closing on a rather large settlement. I was just wondering how the money is allowed to be managed/used legally? Currently we only have his SSA disability to manage and it is wholly used to provide for our rent/food expenses and easy to report. He is currently in a nursing home and unable to take care of himself and is mentally incapacitated permanently. If a large settlement is agreed upon we plan to buy him a home and hire first class home care for his needs but I am lost on what I can legally do with the remainder of the money. This isn't money that I feel comfortable using frivolously or irresponsibly but is it legal to gift myself a sum of money from the settlement to be used for my own living expenses and future needs(such as purchasing a home)? Could I report it as such or would there need to be a meticulous accounting report done for every penny spent? Of course I will discuss this with appropriate professionals when the time officially comes but after searching on my own I can't find any insight as to what to expect and I'd like to know what the general rules are so I can somewhat plan ahead.	Yes
551	Hopefully someone here can help me out. I'm looking into adopting my stepdaughter. The biological father isn't in the picture at all. Didn't sign her birth certificate. At one point in time my wife had a restraining order out against him.   Are there any special steps that I need to take in regards to him? Or is it simply between my wife and I?  Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to give!	Yes
552	My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	Yes
553	I'm filing for divorce in TN.  We have no children, I bought a house before we were married and car in both names. We are  filing but can we do agreed divorce? He wants the car but is fine with not asking for anything from house.  What all do I need to do besides fill out paper work , get it notarized and file at court house?   I'm trying not to get lawyer being it seems pretty straight forward	Yes
554	My SIL and her husband moved to Texas less than a year ago. He took a job and his whole family is there. Her family is in the PNW. She's miserable and is contemplating divorce. The one hiccup is the fact that they have a child.   She hates TX and has no support there. Could she legally take her kid with her to her parents house and file divorce while in another state?  Now that they live in Texas, is she essentially stuck there as long as her husband stays there?  Would it be better for her to encourage them to move to another state before filing for divorce? The husband hates his job.  Thank you!	Yes
555	My mom suffers from bipolar manic depression. My wife and I went to go stay with her 7 years ago. She threatened to call 911 on me when she was having a manic episode. I called 911 to get them to come take her back to the hospital to get her some help. She lied to the police and told them they pulled her hair. My wife told them she didn't see me do that. They took me to jail anyway. I plead no contest to get out of jail because I was pretty ignorant at the time and had my ability to purchase a firearm prohibited. I still can't afford a lawyer. What should I do to get the false conviction off my record and restore my 2nd Ammendment right to purchase own and carry a firearm. I want to be able to defend my family and myself in an emergency. Please help. Thanks	Yes
556	"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."	Yes
557	My gf(30f) needs a good divorce attorney but has specific familiar issues with regard to her ex-husband's religion. I am curious if this is a semi-common issue with divorces and also if anyone could point me in the right direction. If the answer is a simple Google search, I shall apologize and hang my head in shame. Thanks!	Yes
558	"I have a 4 year old son. My name is not on his birth certificate and paternity has not been established. This is an agreement between his mother and I, I have no custodial rights and they live several hours away. This, to her, prevents me from ""trying anything"" and also prevents me from being responsible for any child support.  I pay half of his health insurance premium through Florida Kid Care to help out.   This coming enrollment period I will be adding my 8 year old son to my insurance, the difference between Emp+Child and a family plan is minimal.   My question is, can I add my 4 year old son which I, on paper, have no rights or custodial duties for to my health insurance while keeping our arrangement?"	Yes
559	My soon to be ex wife is divorcing me after we got into a fight after being drunk. She stated that she is not pursuing alimony. Could she pursue alimony for one incident that did not result in any impairment? We are meeting with an attorney where we both sit down and discuss terms this weem. Do I need to lawyer up on my own? We have no assets as we are in college. Just electronics and two cars and furniture. Any advice is appreciated	Yes
560	Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
561	So my wife and I just had our second child yesterday and now because my wife told our doctor that she had used marijuana throughout her pregnancy they want a social worker to talk to us. The baby was full term and she is healthy as can be. I would just like to know what my rights our in this situation. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you in advance.	Yes
562	My ex-wife and I separated nearly 3 years (8/2014), we were unable to file divorce paperwork due to a lack of finances. I was laid off a couple days after we split up. We eventually gathered the money ($200 ea) to file and I sent it to her along with my side of the paperwork as I was out of the state. This was in 03/2017. After she received it, she filed indigent and ended up only paying $10 in court fees. Unbeknownst to me, she was pregnant at the time and gave birth just prior to our 1st court date sometime in May. The court ordered her to filed an amended petition stating the child was not mine. The case manager would not provide me with a copy of the amendment, nor would she. I went to the clerk of the court where she reaffirmed that the new petition has the child as being not common to the marriage. So I went ahead and filled out the Answer Waiver and Request for Copy of Final Judgement and filed it with the clerk. Since then, I've now received a general form informing me about child support and their website. Then just today, I received another Case Management Conference date. This is asking me to file a Financial Affidavit and a Certificate of Completion of Mandatory Disclosure prior to the next court date in 2 weeks.   So my questions here, is this standard protocol for divorce proceedings with a child? I'm not sure if she's trying to come after me for child support or if this is the normally required paperwork. Also, why would I be required to fill this out, when in the initial Dissolution paperwork, we both signed that our finances were being taken care of between us. Now, if she is trying to get child support, can I get the judge to order a paternity test and have it thrown out? And I've been without any steady employment for nearly 6 months and I'm a full time student. What can they possibly expect to get from me for child support. If it makes any difference to the child support, she's already engaged to be married to the guy she cheated on me with and it is his child. Would this help me get out of paying child support for this kid?  Sorry for the wall of text, obviously just don't want to get stuck making payments for someone else's kid for the next 18 years.  Thanks for your time	Yes
563	I (28M) was involved in an altercation last Sunday morning with my boyfriend (28M) that resulted in us both going to jail. I need to know how much trouble I am in and if self-defense is an option. Here is the backstory:  Saturday was a great day for us both. We had been to the pool with friends and decided to go out later that evening. Once we got to the bar, he noticed some friends and asked if we could buy his friends a drink, so I ordered 3 drinks and a water for myself. Once the bill came, he noticed the total and started yelling at me because he thought I was only paying for water and the rest was a flirtatious tip for the bartender.  Not true.  He forgot about the three drinks I ordered for him and his friends.  That was enough for me to say I wanted to go home.  Upon leaving the bar, he was still irate with me because of the bar tab, which was US $18... I ignored him which set him off even more so he sideways punched (think slap, but with a fist) me in the face, twice.  Trying to get away from him, he ripped my shirt off of me. I ordered an Uber and he grabbed my phone and cancelled it.  I was able to use my Apple Watch and ordered another one.  Embarrassed and heartbroken, I just wanted to get home.  Once we got home, I asked him to leave.  I didn't care about my phone at that point.    I thought he left so I went to my guest bedroom and locked the door.  I thought being in the guest room I would hear him as he would enter the master first.  I was wrong, he broke the door down and pounced on me while I was asleep punching me repeatedly in the face.  Scared to death, I reached around for whatever I could find while he was choking me and grabbed a metal table decoration and began striking him.  Blood started pouring everywhere.  The decoration caught his forehead and backside of his hand.  Once he realized I wasn't backing away he got off of me.  I begged him to give me my phone or his so I could call 911.  He refused so I immediately started to run outside to get help.  He stopped me and said he was calling them from my phone.  I went out into my courtyard to wait on the responders, with the decoration piece in hand because I was afraid he might try to harm me again.   Once they arrived, he told them I was trying to kill him bc I was mad at him due to a bar tab... I couldn't believe it.  The guy I thought I was falling for was absolutely trying to ruin my life.  We were both arrested.. me for aggravated assault and him for battery.    Fast forward to now.  He has been trying to communicate with me through friends and directly.  He still has my phone and wallet but I was able to get a new phone.  He has told me he was going to be honest and let the prosecutor know I was defending myself but he wanted to talk to me first.  I have not responded to a single message nor have I sent messages through friends to him.  We both have no-contact-orders.  If he tells the prosecutor the truth, will the charges be dropped?  A few details to consider: He is at risk of being deported to Brazil.  We have only been together a few months.  Yes the signs were there and I just thought we could get past it.  I have a previous charge of failure to report an accident and currently on probation.  I have never been involved in a fight or an abusive relationship until this.  I have been financially supporting my bf and he is currently involved with another case where is seeking support from Georgia Victims of Crime. I think he's trying to do the same using me.	Yes
564	Is it illegal for a parent to ignore consistent physical abuse by one of their children their sibling?  My older brother hits me a lot, and always has. I'm not talking about sibling ruff-housing. He hit me constantly, daily, for any reason, repeatedly. It would leave marks sometimes, and he'd dig his nails into my skin, making me bleed. I fought  back when I was younger but he's very strong and heavy and I was much smaller and weaker. It still happens now, even though he's 21 and I'm 19. It continued from when i was a toddler up until he left for college under my mother's custody of both of us, it happened right in front of her. She never made a significant effort to stop it, never sent him to therapy for his anger problems or anything like that. She'd usually just tell me to not be annoying to him, even though little kids are annoying and he'd hit me for other reasons. I remember getting the lyrics to a song wrong and he punched me.  They have both been emotionally abusive (screaming at me, manipulating me into feeling guilty, etc.) my mother has anger issues as well. I have mental disabilities that are diagnosed and I assume legally recognized (bipolar, stuff like that). I'm not sure if that combination makes things different?  I'd really appreciate any info, thanks.	Yes
565	My girlfriend and I were wondering if in Indiana state she can transfer the deed to her house that's only in her name into my name so we can force him to stop coming over and causing trouble. Little background  State is Indiana  County is Allen  City is fort Wayne They have been separated 2 years, he's an abusive stalker with tons of money from a settlement from a death in his family.  Twice now he has put protective orders on her to get possession of the house temporarily and go through and steal our stuff.  The divorce is still a ways away as there is a lot of fighting of tons of assets.    Is it possible to put the house in my name to keep him from coming over?	Yes
566	I'm 17 at the moment and want my baby's father in the delivery room. My dad threatened me saying he will call the cops if my baby daddy showed up and I'm scared because BD has statutory rape charges since he is 21. After my baby is born I know my dad wont let my BD see his child either. My mom is on board with my dad. Is there anything I can do? I don't want to be at home because my parents are emotionally abusive but I can't move out since I'm 17. I know in Texas it is legal to move out (I love in Texas) but I have to be financially responsible for myself and my baby. I rely on my partner, but my parents have and will try everything they can to make sure my partner is in jail. Is there anything I can do? Or he can do, considering he has statutory rape charges?	Yes
567	Hello r/legalavice, You have been helpful in the past, and I am now one the verge of solving a major headache in my house.  Here is a little background: My daughter was born when I was 17.  I am now 33.  I was able to pull my life together, her mother was not.  Approximately three years ago I took full physical (shared legal) custody of my daughter in order to remove her from a toxic environment.  She is now 16 years old.  We have been dealing with a wide range of behavioral issue, some which got better and some that did not.  It boils down to that we have high expectations and rigid rules in our house, and she is either unable to unwilling to follow them.  My wife and I are constantly fighting with her, and our marriage is also taking a lot of collateral damage because of it.  My daughter's mother is a very toxic person.  She has 9 children to 4 men, she has stolen money from my daughter, she give my daughter panic attacks when my daughter refuses to let her borrow money now, she lives in a very small 2 bedroom house with a rotation of unpleasant men etc. etc.. When my daughter moved out of her moms, it was because her mom was drinking heavily, having intercourse loudly in the living room, and yelling incoherently at my daughter.  This has been documented in our previous custody modification.  Since she moved out of her moms house three years ago, her mother has had very little contact with her and rarely gets her on her scheduled weekends.  I will answer any more questions that anyone has, but for the sake of brevity I will move on.    My daughter, me, and my wife are constantly fighting.  My wife only really got to know my daughter when she moved in three years ago, and despite their best efforts they have been unable to form a relationship.  My daughter is constantly lying to us and breaking our rules.  She came to us last week with a proposition.  A mutual friend has offered to let Jasmine rent a room at her house.  Our friend's daughter is also best friends with my daughter.  I would pay the $300 a month rent, my daughter would be about two miles away from where I live, and she would not have to change schools.  The family friends suggested we try it for six months and see how it goes.  I am familiar with her house and neighborhood.  She lives in a well appointed condo.  She is a single mom with a teenage daughter of her own and a 12 year old.  I am presently working out the details, but it looks like this could be a good solution for everyone involved.  I texted my daughters mother to let her know about the arrangement, and instantly she went on the offensive.  When I took custody of my daughter, I removed a chunk of child support from her income stream.  She has never quite forgotten it, and I think she would jump at the opportunity to get the income back.  The problem is that she is an absolute nightmare of a person, and my daughter living in her home would guarantee my failure as a father.  I have screenshots of the conversations where the mother is trying to borrow money and my daughter is begging her not to be mad at her.  I have the original documents I filed telling the story of how we found her on the side of the road at 11pm the night her mom had alcohol fueled intercourse in the living room.    If I allow this move to happen, am I opening up the potential for losing custody?  If this goes to court, what are the chances a judge would side with the mother?  Can she stop this from happening at all?	Yes
568	"As stated above, I am getting married and we are both signing a prenup. I don't come from any significant money, but my partners parents own several successful businesses that will eventually be passed down to her (she manages them currently). I have no problem signing a prenup excluding me from any inheritance or spousal support (I make good money, and have a good career), and my ""almost"" wife and I make very good income combined. Is there any legal shenanigans I should watch out when looking over this agreement? I obviously want to protect myself as well in the event that we get divorced. I am mostly looking for suggestions for things easy to overlook, before I sign I will go see a lawyer to look over it with me of course.  Thanks in advance!"	Yes
569	It seems that adult life has been set up in a way that makes things kind of complicated if you're trying to make financial decisions with someone who you are not married with. Some of the benefits of marriage include:  - Your spouse can make your medical decisions hassle free - If you're married your spouse can get health insurance through your job and you get the family rate if it's offered - Family leave is an option when you're married - Making big purchases is simpler  There seems to be so many benefits but I have no interest in getting married. Are there legal ways to get some of these benefits without getting married?   Location: Fl, US  Thanks reddit.	Yes
570	...just tell the judge that he is a roommate so it doesn't eliminate your spousal maintenance. Divorce is not yet finalized and obviously this would be a sticking point for the final decree (going in a few days).  What do I need to prove that he is a paramour and not just a roommate? What can I submit in the future to have spousal maintenance reduced/eliminated once this happens, assuming it happens after the final decree is submitted and approved?	Yes
571	Hey guys! Hoping I'm posting this in the right place! I'm a transguy from the Tampa Bay Area (in FL) and I need someone to point me in the right direction here regarding two documents I desperately need amended. First being my birth certificate, second being my marriage certificate.   FIRST: I called the county courthouse for my area and spoke with a lovely supervisor, who all but told me I'm fucked in regards to having the name changed on my marriage license, despite the fact that, according to Social Security, the DMV, and the court system in general, the person my wife married technically doesn't even exist! Flabbergasted and dumbfounded here, friends. I NEED that marriage license amended for my wife's second round with USCIS in 1.5 years so she can get her permanent green card, as I was her primary petitioner, but in my OLD name; very fearful of that screwing with our case / invalidating our marriage!   SECOND: In regards to the birth certificate, I have a doctor who can vouch for me, in addition to my court order for my name change, but I cannot afford (and don't necessarily even desire) the complete list of gender confirmation surgeries Florida seems to require an individual have in order to have their birth cert. amended - soooo, I'm in a bit of a pickle here. The wife did some digging and found out that an underage transguy in Miami went to court over this, won his case, and to be honest, I'd be willing to go to court over it but I don't necessarily want to have this thing drag out.  So maybe I'm just missing something here, but does anybody know if there are any ways around these two issues so I can get my documents amended to reflect my actual identity? Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated!	Yes
572	My ex filed a petition for protective order against me claiming harassment. I don't deny I called and texted her multiple times. However, the last time we spoke she said she was planning to move back in. The very next day she filed the petition. Also, on a couple occasions she contacted me first to begin communication. She never ignored my calls or texts and would call or text me back every time. I have evidence through call logs and messaging as proof.   How good of a defense is this to prevent the judge from granting the order? How do I go about articulating she was sending me mixed signals? Please help me, this is seriously stressing me out. I can't afford a lawyer and intend to attend the petition hearing to defend whatever she is claiming I did.	Yes
573	Ok so somewhat of a long story so bear with me! My younger brother has been dating this girl for a couple years and they have a 16mo old son together. They currently were living with our mother to save up some money. Normally they text all day while he's at work and one day he noticed she wasn't responding or answering any calls so he panicked and went home to check on her (she's a school bus driver and currently isn't working) and when he got home all of her and their stuff was gone and her phone was wiped clean and left on the counter. No note, nothing else left behind. Immediately he panics because his child and the person who he thought was the love of his life had vanished with no idea where or why they were gone. I advised him to go to the police (obviously) to which he had been sent back and fourth from CT police to Massachusetts police because they live in MA. Although their licenses say CT (a bit of a confusing mess because the baby technically lives in mass) So both PD'd basically tell him because they were never married that it's a civil matter and needs to file for a court date. He also decides to report her vehicle that she has stolen because it is legally his, registered and insured in only his name, or so he thought. CT police determine that its registered to her now, which means she forged his signature on the title and registered it in her name. After learning that he decides to file criminal charges for forgery, so an officer begins to help him with that. He also calls dcf to try and see if they will help to find out that she has claimed that he's is abusive, which is a lie, she has already admitted to falsely claiming abuse from him once before. She was arrested back in February for hitting him with a car, to which he felt bad and decided to drop the charges and take her back. He attempts to go to MA court and they tell him because they have licenses in CT that he needs to file there, and dcf had been in contact with her but cannot tell him where she is. He believes she might have gone to Virginia to be with a guy she cheated on him with once before. He decides to go through her phone she left and managed to find a way to contact her and they started talking through messenger in instagram. This whole time before that he's attempting to contact people who he knows would be in contact with her to relay messages that she's going to have felony charges in the hopes of her just deciding to return. It sort of works because he ends up getting a call from her saying basically, how can we make these charges go away, so he tries to say, bring my son to my house tonight and I'll call the officer and see if we can get the forgery charges stopped (he called the officer after to tell him she said she'd bring him home and told the officer to move forward with the charges still). So later he tried to contact her again to find out she blocked him again and changed her number, so it was all a ploy to get him to drop the charges. The CT officer advises him to apply for emergency custody at the court so that way the police can get involved with finding his son and maybe even put out an amber alert.  He goes and applies and is denied the emergency custody and receives a court date (August 10th) and here comes the next problem. He has to have her served, he needs to know where she lives to have her served. The dcf officer knows where she is but cannot legally tell him. The police tell him if he calls the marshals that they can get in contact with dcf to determine where she is to have her served. He contacts the marshals but they say that they cannot do that and he needs to give them an address. Today he receives a call from the police department that she had returned and dropped the vehicle off at the station and took off (she parked it and then called the station later to tell them it was there) so we know at least as of the last 12 hours she's back in the state, he calls the dcf officer and she was not aware she was back and tried calling her but the number was changed. The last time she spoke with her they video chatted and she claimed she saw the baby and he appeared to be ok, but she hadn't heard she was coming back and can't get ahold of her.  Today he called a lawyer and she claimed that if he can't get her served they'll just drop the case and he will have to re file, but that will be futile unless he can get her served, so basically she can just disappear with their child and there's nothing he can do about it because even with the warrant for the forgery he can't do anything, the officers told him it wasn't a charge thy would go over state lines for. He can't even manage to hire a lawyer because it's just too expensive. He's feeling a bit deflated and beaten down because he keeps basically not getting any help at every turn. All he wants is his son back. We are all so worried about the baby and I truly feel like if the situation was reversed there would have already been an amber alert and authorities everywhere looking for him.  She has a history of depression and other issues and we are honestly worried about the child. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the extremely long post!	Yes
574	"My Uncle was recently admitted to the Hospital in Houston and it took the Hospital 3 days to contact us, his family, because he was dropped off by a woman claiming to be his spouse who did not show back up until today wanting to pull the plug. We believe she is an illegel immigrant who has another valid marriage in Mexico, sorry for the lack of details I'm trying this as fast as i can because of the situation at the Hospital at the moment, he is located in Houston Texas and my aunt just made it to the hospital. We don't know who this woman who is apparently his spouse is, but we suspect it's some prostitute who was trying to become a citizen. What rights do we have as his family, can we stop her decision? Will she inherit everything he owns as he has no children?  What can we do as his family, nobody wants to unplug him except for his ""spouse"" who NOBODY know who she is."	Yes
575	I'm getting ready to file for divorce in Arizona after six years. We agree on everything, already live apart, are friendly, have no children, and the only asset is the house we purchased and own together. I'm keeping the house, and she will file a quit claim deed sometime after the divorce when I'm able to access some funds to give her half of the equity.   I'm going to file the petition, and she is going to complete an Acceptance of Service. We then plan on filing a Consent Decree after the 60 day waiting period. My question is, how do we handle the Response? If she files one, it seems the court automatically schedules an Early Resolution Conference. If she doesn't file, I have to request default which looks to add an additional 4-6 weeks to the process. Is there some other option, or is it one or the other?	Yes
576	Hey everyone and thanks for any advice in advance. I have already contacted two lawyers that specialize in this kind of thing. I am waiting to hear back.   So last sunday my now ex went back to the hospital to be admitted for the 5th time because of her refusal to stay in treatment for her bi-polar and psychosis.(im using that as a catch all because eash time she goes in they call it something different. Schizophrenia, schizophreniform and a number of other things)   I am just tired of it. We have put alot of effort into this and she drops out of treatment every time. This is the first time she has gone twice in one year. Just last month was the other time.  I really don't want her having full physical custody of the children because i dont feel like she will stay in treatment again anyways. Besides some of the stuff ahe tells them when she is having an episode i dont think she has the means by herself.   I have supported her for years, someone always has. The support she wouldb get from me would no where near enough to raise two children in a decent setting.  The other complication is we are moving out this week and she wont be welcome. I wont be staying in this house anymore and neither will the children. I told her i would give her a key to getv her things but the electric and water will be off on the 26th. So there is no point in her staying here. The only place she could go is her dads and he has begged me not to pawn her off on him. .  As far as the boys go.. I offered to do an unnoficial agreement where they live with me and she can come get them whenever she wants. But i dont know how well that will work. Or if it is even legal.  With the info i provided do i have a chance? This is scary because i have heard so many stories of how men get screwed on this stuff.   Isv there anything i can do to prepare?	Yes
577	Current Custody is 70/30 with my ex husband.   Transfers are only delegated by Mother (myself)or Father.  The majority of the time his mother has our 2 daughters ever other weekend during the school year.  He is suppose to have the girl's during the summer.  But with the current conflict of my 6 year old stating grandmas boyfriend 'touched' her down there I refuse to let grandma do the transfer.  There's a DV case open with our current custody battle enforcing a restraing order against this man that the girls had spoke of touching them down there. First in 2015 and now 2017  Needless to say the father hasn't shown to pick them up after school ended. That was nearly two months ago. In alaska I know after 3 months of no contact with the kids is considered abandonment.   But I'm afraid the judge favors the father over the best interest of the children.  The fathers statement on why he wants his mother to pick up and drop off is that he has to work.  And he's not willing to co-parent.  But I know plenty of parents that wake up early to drop their kids off at day care and pick them up after. Or dropping them off with their family members for help but do their duediligance and pick up their kids and take them home. He refuses to do this.   Leaving the girls in his mothers care for nearly 25%-29% of his custody.   But yet the judge says if he doesn't come and get them on his physical custody during the summer and stay with me, he is not doing anything wrong?  I don't mind having them.  But its not fare to our daughters and I don't understand how this has gotten out of hand. How is it legal to do so??   I need further legal advice on where to go or what to do. We have our next court date on 08/07 but I have a feeling nothing will become of this.   Thank you.	Yes
578	"First of all sorry for the bad English I'm working on it and for the wall of text, but it's a very delicate situation.   Background: We are a family of 5, very poor, living in a Villa near a small town in South Italy. Since I was a child I remember violent quarrels between my mother and my father, he hitting her, screaming on her face, insulting her, spitting on her...   The quarrels are always the same, he started spitting on my little sisters, hitting them, hitting me. When I started growing up i began defending my sisters and my mother; once he said this to me ""get off my way or I will kill you too"", I'll never forget these words.   Nowadays: Since my father has discovered Internet he basically lost all interest in living with us, getting more and more confident with his own smartphone (payed by us, his 3 sons- he cried for it, he wanted the money else he would have just screamed like a mad and maybe got violent). Now that he's 60 he still retains that violent nature, but I'm here now, 24yo, stopping him, helping my mom (who had an accident caused by him hitting a parked car because he had a sleep blow due to him never sleeping spending all night on internet), my sisters are new adults -19yo-. I'm afraid one day we'll come to hitting each others and there will be only one of us alive.    He started cheating on my mother with other people online, chatting with them, meeting with them (i suppose) and calling them (heard one of those names  this morning).   He has his facebook with no privates settings, so I accidentally stumbled upon his profile. All my doubts were solved, words like ""i love you"" ""The place I'll stay with ***** forever and ever"" (that place was the photo of our Villa...)   I wanna lock him outside of the house as soon as he leaves for a reason, what would the consequences be? Is this legal? What should I really do?"	Yes
579	I have struggled with drug use on and off for the past several years. My drug of choice was opiates. Recently after losing my job I had a brief lapse and consumed a few ecstasy pills and unfortunately my high state was noted. To make it clear, this whole issue has risen on the accusations of me being addicted to and using drugs regularly again.  About a month and half ago, I was asked to find another place to live by my mothers roomate, for a completely non drug related reason. He has no idea of my past or anything , it was a long time coming.  I moved back to my hometown (Tacoma, WA)  with my son, but unfortunately was not able to find a home for both of us suitable enough in time.  So my son went to stay with my dad, and I stayed with friends. I continued my search for a home, obtained a part time nanny gig, and signed up for benefits (food stamps), all while diligently visiting my son everyday, or pretty dang close.  I found a place to live with my son and was set to move in on july 20th. I informed my parents and continued visiting my son. One day he is not at my dad and I'm told he's at my moms. Nobody plans anything with me my mom didn't even grab the car seat nothing. I already know it's going on but I give it some time. My parents continue to lie to me about when he's coming back when I continually ask. Finally I get my mom to tell me what is going on and she says that I'm going to be served with papers next week and that she has filed for emergency custody. Today is July 23, 2017.  I have some custody from the father, he is not in the picture currently. If was to come in the picture, could he retrieve my son? Could he over ride their custody so to speak?  Can I go and retrieve my son since I haven't been served yet?    I can't afford a lawyer.   What is the process of this situation?  What are the steps I should take?  What can I most likely expect?	Yes
580	I'm currently paying child support to my ex-wife for our 3 children.  My income comes from railroad disability, she's an RN and makes at least double what I do.  She's getting married this coming weekend.  I'm just curious if her spouse's income gets considered in the child support amount?  Also, what if she voluntarily decides to stop working and become a stay at home mom?  I just got an apartment about 20 miles from my kids, after living in VA for the past 3 years.  I scrape by each month, so I was just wondering how the new marriage will affect things.  Thanks for your help!	Yes
581	I have a friend who recently divorced and moved into a new house with her children and new boyfriend. She is listed as a tenant on the lease.  A couple of weeks ago, the new BF gave the youngest child a smack on the butt and apparently the children told the vindictive and sadistic Ex-BF/Father of the children and he wasn't very please. Eventually, a couple weeks went by and the Ex decided to file for a protection order, on behalf of the children, based mostly on lies and fabrication (they feared for their lives) against the mom's new BF.  Well, the protection order was served and instead of the new BF finding a place to crash, he essentially said that her and the kids needed to find a new place to stay until the court hearing.  Is there any legal recourse or way around this? She's listed as a tenant on the house, but I believe the BF is the lease holder. The Ex is trying to make the mom's life miserable and really gives no cares about the welfare of the children, as is evident by the fact that they are likely going to have to sleep in the car until the court date as the protection order is keeping them out of the same house as the new BF and he won't leave.	Yes
582	So let me preface by saying that I am in no way defending my actions, or the way I behaved. It was completely unacceptable, and I feel horrible and stupid for it.  Saturday night my girlfriend, lets call her Vee, and I went out for a couple of drinks. At the end of the evening we both had gotten a little tipsy, and started having an argument on her porch, which then escalated into the kitchen, with the door still open.  In my drunken idiocy I knocked over a pile of glasses onto the floor.  At this point we both notice a cop car with lights on coming down the street. They say they had a report of a domestic dispute, put me in cuffs, put me in the car. All the while she is saying she does not want me arrested, to release me, and that she is refusing to press charges.  Of course they don't let me go, I spend the night in central bookings. When I go before the judge, he tells me that I have an order of protection against Vee. I am in no way allowed to contact her, to speak to her, to be within 100 feet of her, if I do, and should I be caught, I will be arrested and charged with contempt of court.   The judge let me go on my own recognizance, no bail, and I am scheduled to appear back in court in September with a lawyer of my own - furthermore, I don't even know what I am being charged with?  My question is Vee and I have no absolutely no desire for this order of protection. We get along, love each other, and are planning a future together. This was just a stupid spat that got escalated way further than anyone ever would have thought. We practically live together, and spend all of our free time together.  At this point, how exactly should we proceed? I am at a complete loss of what to do. How do I even find out what I am being charged with, and when I contact a lawyer what should I tell them, will they be able to find out what my charges are?	Yes
583	"My family recently held an intervention with my sister and her husband about emotional and verbal abuse to their children. We have since been barred from having access to the children in any form.  - Is it illegal for us to talk to the children in a public place, such as a swim meet or at church or other places? We live in a smaller community and see them all over without any intention of our own.   - Is it illegal for us drive down the street and say hello to the kids if they are outside playing?  - Do we have any legal precedent to gain access to the kids? Someone recently mentioned to me ""Grandparents rights"" but I'm unfamiliar with what that is.  Thanks a lot!"	Yes
584	I'm 16, 17 in October. I want to leave my house as soon as possible possible after school starts in August. I will have my driver's license and possibly a vehicle then.  I just wanted to know about getting myself a job and a place to live if I'm underaged. Can I consider myself an adult without parental consent?	Yes
585	Hi, this is taking place in Idaho. I am twenty years old and, for various personal reasons, want to be adopted by my step-dad. Unfortunately, I was told that I would have to notify my biological father to be do this. I haven't seen him since I was 3 because he lost custody. The dude is a giant, abusive cocksucker, and I don't want to see or talk to him again, or bring him back into the picture. I don't want my family involved. I want to cut ties completely and get adopted by my step dad. Please help me find a loophole so I can get adopted without telling him!	Yes
586	"Hello!  My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force.  Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.  What are some factors that could allow him split custody?  Sorry, just stressed out about this. We don't know how this stuff works. Yes we are seeing an attorney we just want to know if others have been through this.  Advice?  ""Corrected title from Disney Dad to Deadbeat Dad"""	Yes
587	"Hi all,   This is my throwaway because obviously. This all happened in NYC.  My ex and I had a tumultuous relationship, we separated in May of 2015 after a year of marriage, a full no-contest divorce followed in early 2016.   We had a huge wedding (100% her choice/decision, I wanted something smaller and much less grand). Neither of us were making much money at the time, and she had received a large inheritance from her grandmother previously which she used to pay for the wedding.   When we separated and ultimately divorced we stayed friendly-ish, but she always carried a resentment over the money she spent on the wedding. I told her (though never in a documented format) that should I ever be in a very comfortable financial situation I would be happy to repay her a portion of the wedding fund.   A little current add on, I am technically homeless, make very little money, and although I have prospects on the horizon by no means could you call my situation comfortable, something closer to strained.   She emailed me recently about a ""financial situation"" she wanted to discuss with me, after some pressing she explained that she was threatening legal action to recoup half of the cost of our wedding as well as interest starting from our separation in 2015.   I'm sure the main advice would be to get a lawyer, which is rough as I literally have little to no money. My main curiosity is, is it even possible for her to sue me for that, especially since that's something she would have had to have handled during the divorce, and without any documentation of me stating explicitly ""I will pay you such and such"" does this threat have any real validity? My main assumption is that she's hurting for cash and knowing my situation thinks if she threatens legal action she will be able to squeeze a few pennies from my well.   Thank you all in advance for any advice you can offer."	Yes
588	We married in 2016. She has about $50k in student debt. She has family about an hour, hour and a halfish from her school, where she also works part-time. We have split rent about 75%:25% since we moved in together.	Yes
589	Hi,  My mother's ex is a sole trader and receives cash in hand for his work. He claims he only earns £7000 per year which is untrue. He charges £25 per hour and employs a couple other people to help him out which already suggests that the £7000 per year figure is inaccurate. As a result, based on his stated earnings the court only demands he pays my mother a mere £9 a week which barely covers my little brother's school dinners, let alone the other expenses of raising a child. But how can we prove that he is really earning a lot more? Or is it pretty much impossible to get evidence?   Many thanks.	Yes
590	"Maryland. I ride a motorcycle. last summer i took my son (was then 9) for a short ride while we went out geo-caching. his mom doesn't want him to ride the motorcycle. she threatened to take me to court so i agreed to not put him on the motorcycle until we further discussed it. I intentionally left it open because I wanted it to be a possibility in the future. My son has now expressed interest in riding the motorcycle and also a small dirt bike that I own that is suitable for a kid his age.  I have informed my ex that I intend to allow him to ride my motorcycle as a passenger and teach him how to ride this dirt bike next summer. He will be 11 going on 12 at that time.  Dollars to doughnuts I will get a letter from a lawyer saying I am not allowed and that she will take me to court if this happens.  If she does take me to court I am fairly certain I am well within my rights here to have him ride with me. I still have parental authority, and the only reason we dont have shared custody is because she moved to maryland and it is too far to have shared custody. most likely this will be filed in a maryland court, but the riding will all take place in quebec. he is legally allowed to ride with me in both (and everywhere actually) locations.  what kind of legal grounds do i have here? I know family court can be a grab bag of ""depends on the judge"" but I dont have any traffic tickets, and have been riding a motorcycle for over 20 years now. though this current license is about 4 years old."	Yes
591	"So my dad is trying to evict me, he doesn't have anything legal. He wants me to work for him, and is consistently harassing me until I do (I'm in between jobs and I'm looking for one ACTIVELY.) He was harassing me this morning in his room, yelling into mine. I went to his bedroom calmly. I asked why I have to work for him and why he is trying to take my car away (he bought it, pays for everything for the car), when I am actively looking for a job. He got angry. Shouted, charged me, and I backed up. He was pushing my hands away and spitting into my face. I backed up into my room next door, and he was still in my face arguing with me so I threw a punch and it landed. It busted his lip open. He's trying to file a police report. He took my phone and my car away from me.   This is not the first time we have had a fight. Last time I accidentally closed the door on my mom's finger during an argument, so he dragged me out of the bathroom by my hair and stomped on my back - knocking the wind out of me. The police that came searched my room for drugs, and they ultimately told my father he has every right to put his hands on me if I'm ""being disrespectful"".   So the police WILL take his side. They told me if I don't like it, get out.   He IS verbally abusive. EXTREMELY so. But he rarely fist fights with me.   How do I avoid going to jail?"	Yes
592	"My older sister has always had mood and mental troubles, but they are getting steadily worse as she ages. I'm getting very, very worried about her and I think it's time to step in with her common-law spouse and get her help (whether she agrees to it or not). She has a small child (age 4) in her care to worry about, as well.  Some of the things going on with her: 1. She thinks I call up her sister in law and brag about how I tell everyone that she didn't breastfeed her kid, that her and her partners are only common-law and not officially married, and that she's a cam girl. I have never met this person and I have no idea how to get into contact with her. 2. She thinks there are cameras and microphones in her home, placed by her in laws to spy on her. 3. She sits around all day looking at people's social media profiles, applying make up, and taking selfies. 4. She picks at zits until she tears up her skin and scars herself. She bleaches, dyes, bleaches, and dyes her hair until it's fried. 5. She stopped speaking to me before the birth of her second child (the 4 year old) because I casually asked her about her birth plan and she formed a delusion that I was going to send social services to the hospital to take her baby. 6. She ruined her relationship with her common law spouse, and blames it on him ""being into trannies."" 7. She has a certificate in assisting in a health field, but refuses to work. She insists she needs more certifications to make more money. When she interned in her field, she posted on social media about how disgusting the patients were. 8. She thinks everyone is jealous of her, out to get her, and constantly talking about her. 9. She thinks a guy she romantically rejected in high school (as in 20 years ago) installed a key logger on her computer to spy on her for revenge.  She lives in a different state than me (Colorado) and is not communicating with me after her last aggressive, delusional episode. How can I get her to a psychiatrist or in for an involuntary psychiatric hold (if that's what it takes)?  tl;dr: My older sister in Colorado is delusional and has a small child in her care. I might need to force psychiatric help on her. How?"	Yes
593	So, I slept with a friend of mine a while ago, and she hasn't talked to me since we broke up four months ago after dating for about a month - the day we broke up, she told me that she was pregnant - and long story short, it's starting to look like there's a good chance that I'll be a parent within the year.  I've met with a few family lawyers in the area, and thankfully, it sounds like there's a fairly good chance that I can swing joint legal custody when I'm sued for child support in the next six months to three years, as long as I don't make any major mistakes.  However, the friend that I hooked up with is still incredibly upset, and never wants to see me again - I spent the better part of three months trying to get in contact with her, but, it's no use - every time I try to talk to her, she tells me how foolish I was for leaving her.  That being said, if a joint legal custody agreement is reached, but we assume that she retains primary physical custody, can she arbitrarily move anywhere that she likes without my consent? That is, could she move hundreds of kilometres away to avoid me, and not be worried about things like parental child abduction?  Would my only recourse be to spend tens of thousands of dollars in court to get her to move back, or move closer to her?	Yes
594	"This is my first post so I'm not quite sure how this works, but, I think I get the gist of it.  I'm a 22 y/o who got married at 20 years old. My husband and I have always had a very tough relationship, sometimes we have good days but a lot of the times it's very imbalanced and doesn't make us nearly as happy as we could/should be. I feel like a POS because to be quite honest I shouldn't have married him. I was unhappy a lot of the time leading up to the wedding and even the day after we got married we were already back to fighting. I'll save the rest of the background info for somewhere other than legal advice but yeah, essentially we were never really happy. Now, 3 months after getting married I found out I was pregnant with our first baby. We fought most of my pregnancy, and in a particularly explosive fight he shoved me. Mind you, I had slapped him earlier in the fight which I know is totally wrong and fucked up, so I accept my wrong there. But yeah, I thought about leaving him and I didn't. There have been a million times when we have ""broken up"" or come close to it, within and prior to our marriage, but somehow nothing changes and we just keep moving along.  I have come to the decision (for the millionth time.......) that we need to divorce. I don't want to be in this relationship, however, he has always been the bread winner and we're currently stuck in a rent-to-own situation where we have $12,000 (that came from his trust fund) invested as the down payment. I am a stay at home mom and my mat leave has ended, so the only thing I bring in money wise is my few hundred dollar a month baby bonus. Now, a bit ago when we talked about splitting up, he said he wouldn't want anything to do with me and would never cohabitate/split up our current house. But, we have a shared vehicle, (which he uses because we never cared about me getting my license since we were together all the time anyways), and we literally are in a 2-3 year agreement with this house, paying really really high rent in hopes of being able to apply for a mortgage and the end of our term and own it. If we don't get approved at the end of 2 or 3 years, we lose the rent/monthly savings from the program we selected, as well as our $12,000 deposit.  He has also made claims that he will not be the ""weekend dad"" and even though he currently works days as a contractor, he would want to split custody evenly, which would mean our baby would be in child care during the days that he has her, instead of being with me. I am currently taking a course that costs $500 monthly for the year, which is really what any money I have goes to, so I'm scared that if he won't cohabitate I won't be able to afford living on my own and paying for my course. I'm really scared because he gets very uncooperative and vindictive when we talk about divorce because he personally thinks we should stay married. Does ANYONE have advice on any of this?"	Yes
595	If a couple is married, can one person file bankruptcy on their own? I'm married but have past premarital debt. My spouse doesn't have debt or bad credit. Would it be possible for me to file bankruptcy on my debt that occurred before our marriage without him having to file with me or be effected in any way? He has a security clearance to think of and his job depends on having good credit to keep his clearance. I need to protect my husband from my debt. I have a disabled child whom l stay home and care for, so me working to pay off the massive amount of medical bills and hospital stays my childs disability racked up with me being a single mom before I got remarried and got health insurance is impossible. My credit is shot. I'd really like to start new if could. My ex-husband doesnt contribute a dime for our son and never has. I've had hell trying to get the court to enforce support beyond the order, so all the bills are on me and hurt my credit. I can't afford to take the ex back to court again, not that he'd get a job and contribute anyway. What can I do?	Yes
596	My sister and her husband are getting a divorce and he told her he enrolled their kids in public school and will be sending the orders in the mail. Right now they home school and the kids are VERY smart. She fulfills all the state requirements and they score very well on the standardized tests. Also neither of their work schedules would work very well with dropping them off and picking them up. He was the big proponent of homeschooling and is just doing this to be a jerk.   He has an attorney but my sister can't afford one. She has tried calling the number for free legal advice but hasn't been able to get through. The hours they are open are limited. I could help pay if an attorney would take monthly payments and wouldn't be horribly expensive.    Can he even do this without her permission? What can she do? She already filed for divorce but I guess the next step in the process (court date?) isn't until September. School starts in August. My sister is trying to be agreeable and wants joint custody. We don't know what he's even after.   I know there may be negative comments on homeschooling but it has nothing to do with me and wouldn't be very helpful. Oh also we are in Washington state. Thank you in advance for your help!! I will be at work so probably can't respond.	Yes
597	"Before I start, this is not about me.  I know a certain someone, let's call this person T, who just got married.. Let's call the person T is marrying ""SO"". Maybe like 3 days ago. NOBODY approves or know about this marriage, besides a handful of people. I found out that the ""SO"" cheated on T. There are a lot of other signs that screams NO to this marriage.   I'm wondering what are the consequences of T getting a divorce. What can T do so that there are a minimal amount of consequences for T? What are some advice for this fool?"	Yes
598	"I am in the process of a 730 evaluation for primary custody of my kids.  Two kids 7 and 5 Today, was another doozy of an exchange...and I am fearful for the kids  I don't know what my options are here... if any  My Ex was 53 min late to the exchange today. at 4:24 she sent me a text stating she was exiting the freeway That is 2 miles from the meeting spot arranged in Co-parenting for today. she doesn't show up until 4:53  Exchange goes ok. But I know something is coming, because if she is ever in the wrong she has to lash out and blame someone else or invent a scenario where she is the victim.  I had to wait all of 4 min.  I got a text stating ""I just drove by your car, and the back seat was empty. where are the kids?""  I said ""Wasn't my car. I have two kids"" then knowing where this was going sent a picture of them in the car.  Response: ""when did you have time to take this? because I had plenty of time to look at the stoplight. You were alone. It's ok if Donna (my current wife) has them. It's totally legal, just weird to hide it.  I then called her. She answered. I said. Hi, she said Hi, and then I asked the kids to say Hi. I then asked the kids ""where are we at kids?""....at this point She started saying ""hello, hello? is there anyone there?  I then got a text ""Thank you for the phone call. But there was no sound  I responded. ""I am turning off my phone now. these accusations are bizarre""  I got back: ""Not as bizarre as pretending to pick up our kids. Just tell me who has them""  I called again. Immediately with the ""hello? hello?"" I knew for sure it was a game at this point. I just ended the call  She responded ""You can't just keep ending conversations because you don't want to deal with the facts."" ""If this turns into another 49 hour abduction like New Year's, I will definitely filing a report"" (Read the last post on that [incident here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5lfqi6/legal_rights_surrounding_a_primary_custody_parent/)  This is next level insane. I am terrified for the kids. This is like raising to the level that she needs to be committed.  Thoughts apart from just continuing with the psych eval I already have going?"	Yes
599	Okay so here's the deal. Around march of this year I quit a job that provided a company vehicle. I found a used Volkswagen on Craigslist for $3,000. The money for the vehicle came out of my exs bank account. I never had a ton in my savings but she did because of a large settlement she received from a car accident. The car is registered in both of our names and it is clearly stated on the title.   Anyways about 6 weeks after we get the car she broke up with me. Now she either wants $3,000 or the car back. I'd be okay with giving her the money but since we are in the process of moving out then should I not be asking for the things I bought her during the relationship? Obviously the car is expensive compared to the other things I'm thinking of but I just don't see the difference. When we got the car I needed it to get to work so I could make money for our bills.   So should I just pay her for the car to end this headache? I offered her half of the money, would that be a decent option? Or was the car a gift and I don't owe her anything?   Sorry if I sound selfish or rude. She's done and said a lot of things to me the last few weeks that have affected me a lot mentally.	Yes
600	Hi,  Thanks for reading.  So my girlfriend's mom (M) has a very tumultuous personal life that has resulted in 4 marriages. My girlfriend (A) who is now 26 years old, is the daughter of husband 1. During marriage number two, M had a daughter (T) in Virginia and shortly thereafter, left husband 2 (H2) for husband 3. According to A, H2 was an abusive prick. M is now on husband 4 and travels back and forth between Virginia, Russia, and California.   A cares a lot for T who is now 13 years old. M and H2 hate each other, and their hatred plays out in the courtroom with T as their favorite game piece. At various points, both parents have instructed her to lie on their behalf, both parents have said damning things about the other to her, and all in all, she is on the receiving end of their cornucopia of insanities and has been since she was 6 months old. Both parties have broken many aspects of the Bill Of Rights For Children Who's Parents Don't Live In The Same Household. Both parties have broken many parts of their custody agreements.  For the month of July, T has been in California staying with A. As it turns out, M may not have let H2 know that T was staying with her sister only, and H2 has insisted on T cutting her trip short as this violates their custody agreement. (This may or may not be true, A does not know. Both parties have lied a lot for many years in an attempt to deny visitation and custody of T)  As of today, my girlfriend received a threatening text from H2's lawyer stating that if T is not returned early, they will be filing a missing person's report on T. M and H4 (husband 4) are telling my girlfriend that H2 is bluffing and not to send her home until the month is up, as M is entitled to custody for the month and has chosen to let her stay at A's apartment. H2 has been tracking his daughter's movements via her phone and has known where she has been the whole month of July.  Essentially, I think this is a textbook example of an Idiot Plot, a literary device in which the plot only moves forward because all parties involved (M and H2) are idiots. They're spiteful and hateful, and their daughter, T, is suffering through a very unstable childhood. Typically, I would avoid these types of people and situations like the plague, but I care a lot about my girlfriend, and she cares a lot about her sister and so I'm hoping I can get some good advice from fellow redditors that could result in an improved life situation for T, and peace of mind for A.  So here are my questions: 1) Is there anything my girlfriend can do to help her sister's situation? 2) Is there anything T can do to improve her own situation? 3) If H2 knows where T is, communicates with her multiple times a day, and is GPS tracking her at all times, can he file a missing person's report, and is that a legitimate threat that could in some way harm A?  Apologies for the drama and thanks again for your time.	Yes
601	Hi,  I'm about to file for a divorce in NJ. I'm currently living with my parents but have yet to change my address, meanwhile my wife is in the house we both own. The other issue is that we are trying to sell the house so I'm hesitant about starting the process when the address may change during the course of it. Should I begin anyway? Or should I wait until after the house is sold and we have settled into new addresses?	Yes
602	My ex, and father of my youngest child, was arrested in May of raping a 15 year old girl that was in his care.  He also had drug paraphernalia in his home, and had been allowing the girl to get drunk with him on a regular basis among other things such as cold showers with our son and things that CPS wouldn't divulge.  Instead of sticking it out to stand in front of a jury, which from my understanding there was plenty of damning evidence that he would be found guilty, he decided to take a plea deal of Felony 2 (that is info I have gotten from him and he has been sugar coating, denying to me while telling others he woke up with his hands in her panties and remembers nothing as he was blackout drunk, I have yet to hear back from my lawyer but only 2 weeks have gone by and he isn't allowed to have contact with our child at the moment) My question is this, how worried do I have to be about him seeing our child again, he has only called once talking to me as he isn't allowed to even talk to him on the phone.  Even though he isn't allowed contact with his daughter, he has seen her though.  My worry is that someday he is going to be able to get visitation again to our son, putting our son in dangers, whether sexual or otherwise, and I wish to terminate his parental rights in order to protect him until he is old enough to make the decision to reach out on his own (child is 6 right now).  I would in no way terminate his rights if I didn't honestly believe it was in my son's best interest.  The guy has gotten to where he is mentally unstable to boot, he says he is being required by law to seek therapy as part of his sentence.  I am really just worried for my son and know that my lawyer is a busy guy, so looking for some opinions on what I might be able to expect if I pursue this matter in court.	Yes
603	I know for a fact that my child's birth parent smoke cannabis for a good amount of time and could possibly still be doing so.  Would it be bad to ask my attorney to ask their attorney for a drug test before paying child support?  I just don't want the money to feed their drug habit.  So far we are in an informal stage between attorney's and I was nervous during the meeting, so I didn't bring it up.  Also sorry for the vagueness, trying to stay semi-transparent.	Yes
604	I was in jail when my wife divorced me. She got granted ownership of everything we owned, custody, child support, and alimony. I live in Wyoming where alimony is rare. I don't make very much money, I am a chef with two jobs barely making it. They are going to take 50% of my income to supplement the child support and alimony, making it even harder to survive. I cannot afford an attorney and the courts have no paperwork to reopen our decree based on alimony. I don't know what to do! I will always pay my child support, but the alimony is killing me! Please, if you truly know any viable options for me, I need help!	Yes
605	Parents died, I assumed legal guardianship of my teenage brother over a year ago who starts high school this year. Husband and I are about to accept job offers for the Netherlands. Guardianship does not have specific restrictions on anything like this and I am talking with US lawyer this week as well but wanted to post here too.   But any lawyer from Europe or US know requirements for moving with a minor who has no living parents to a country in the EU?   Thanks!	Yes
606	I am the beneficiary of my deceased father's teacher's pension through the state of wisconsin (Which will run for 7 years we are approaching the end of year 4). My parents divorced in Iowa in 2000-2001 where it seems the divorce papers said the other was supposed to list each other as beneficiaries, but neither one ever did, instead putting them both in my name. They would even laugh about it when they talked about it since they remained friends post-divorce (I know, how weird, right?)   Winter 2014 I received paperwork about the pension and my Mother was okay with and excited for me to have a nest egg. A few months later she was fired from her job and threatened to sue me for the pension if I didn't do what she wanted with money (take a lump sum instead of monthly installments). She eventually backed off. At that time I had called the pension people who said they would have required special court-ordered paperwork in order to change the beneficiary in those conditions and they never received it. The lawyer whom I met with in Iowa (as I was living there at the time) had said the same thing. She said something would have had to been filed with the court while filing the divorce, which never was.   Spring of 2017 she threatened to sue me again. Sending semi harassing texts, letters to my home, and even showing up on my doorstep (She lives on a different coast than I)without invitation. She has been announcing on Facebook that I am dead or will be dead soon because I am a drug addict (never touched a drug in my life). I received a letter yesterday, 8\8\2017 from a lawyer saying unless I'm willing to settle this matter she will be suing me. I am not sure what to do at this point.	Yes
607	So my cousin has a child from a previous relationship when she was around ....20 I think. The parents kept it a secret and our family kind of turns a blind eye to it. I am not sure what happened to the child...I am assuming she is being taken care of by her father and is being given child support (or some form of support by my cousin's parents). My cousin met a good guy and has him totally whipped, I believe they are set on being wed in about a year from now or sooner. The guy rebounded hard after a breakup and believes my cousin is his soulmate (FYI she is a BITCH). I do not believe they told him about the child and because the guy is a pretty successful the parents want him to marry her. Also I am not too fond of him because he is like a sponge and just totally soaks up my cousin's evil personality and waits on her like a servant. Anyways...long story short...can he divorce her if he finds out? or is there some legal loophole he use to prevent this trickery? If I told him, I am pretty sure I would get shut down quick and he would not believe me. Hes an ass (most likely due to my cousin, otherwise he seems likes a nice, shy guy), but I do not want him to fall into this trap laid out by my evil cousin.	Yes
608	So I am divorcing first and foremost as a preface. Awhile back my soon to be ex wife setup her child support from her first child with another man to be deposited in my banking account. I have sole access and rights on this account still. There recently was a large deposit through the state enforcement office of back child support paid out to her that was deposited into my account. I won't go into detail why but am I in a legal state if I refuse to withdraw and give this money over to her? Yes it sounds scummy but I have my reasons. I just wanted to ask. Thank you in advance.	Yes
609	My wife and I were virgins when we got married in January 2016. She has been to pelvic floor therapy and several doctors, but still cannot have sex. She is not going to therapy anymore and we have not done anything physical for several months (no oral or manual stimulation). Do we qualify for an annulment, or is a no-fault divorce our best option?	Yes
610	"Short version: My mother is mentally sick (depression) and is being coerced to regularly give someone large sums of money. I don't have enough details to go to the police. I don't think she's capable of caring for herself either. How can I ensure the safety of her self and finances?   Long version: This is long and I don't know where else to turn but the internet. My mother has been ill for a long time with a history of depression and bipolar II. We have a sizable family. A few years ago my father passed away; due to timing in everyone's lives, my brothers and sisters moved out (including me), to school or work or whatever. This lead to textbook empty nest syndrome which she never really recovered.  She eventually moved to NYC into an apartment that cost an obscene amount of money per month. Additionally, she leads a very expensive lifestyle she can't afford to sustain. She apparently has/had a lot of assets but I never did find out specifics of how much or where they came from but I don't care about that. Today I found out she has been giving money to an unknown stranger (she refused to tell me who, or why). I pressed hard but all I managed to get from her was ""he might hurt me"" if she refused. She repeatedly tells me she feels threatened and in danger but will not elaborate.  I am 8 hours away by car, 4 by plane in Bumfuck, Nowhere. I am only just making ends meet. My siblings live closer but only one of them is on speaking terms with her (her illness makes her unpleasant to interact with). Her friends have left her (likely the other way around), so she is alone. She is in a vulnerable position and it seems like no one is willing to help. And I can't help personally because of how far away I am. She's old and vulnerable.  Nearly all of these details are vague and nebulous. She won't tell me anything about where her money came from, or who this mystery person is or why she's giving him money or why she feels unsafe.   * How can I protect my mother when I don't even know what's threatening her? * How can I ensure she gets the medication and prescriptions she needs? * Can I legally force her into someone's care? Are there programs to pay for this? * I've no interest in her finances but how can I protect her assets so she can live comfortably?  * To be honest I'm not even sure I can convince her to budget even if all of the above was taken care of. * I don't think a nursing home is an option. Elderly abuse is a huge problem, and I'm not certain she'd let herself live in a nursing home.  I don't know what to do. Sorry for the brain vomit but all of this came up suddenly. I greatly appreciate any advice of any sort."	Yes
611	My step sons father is in prison for shooting my wife. He will not be out until my son is legally an adult.  Is there any way that i could adopt my stepson so that I can make decisions regarding his medical care and school issues? As of now the school does not recognize me as anyone with a say. Thanks for the advice	Yes
612	"Location: Allegheny County, PA  I am the non-custodial mother of a 16 year old daughter. Due to a very complicated back story, I was alienated from my child for the past 11 years and she has always lived with her custodial father.   I have recently began a relationship with my daughter (i lived in a different state for most of her childhood) which is going very well. I don't bring up the past or bad mouth her father (my ex husband) but I also will not lie to her if she asks a question. We have formed a very nice mother-daughter relationship after many years of me being forced away from one.  Well, now my daughter wants to live with me, which I am 100% okay with. She said that she hates her school (she goes to a very rough school district) and has stated that her father hasn't been treating her well and has alleged abuse. I have no proof of that, but she has said that he hits her. When her father remarried there were also allegations of abuse by her step-mother that was investigated by child services but step-mom is long gone.  Long story short, she wants to live with me. I want her to have the best chance at life and will do whatever it takes to ensure she has every opportunity to achieve her goals. She asked her father (my ex husband and I do NOT communicate) and he flat out said ""no"", which was fully expected. 24 hours later she texts me saying her dad is kicking her out because she wants to have a relationship with me, her biological mother, and that I have to come pick her up. She shared text messages with me between her father and her and her ex step-mother (no idea why she's still involved) which were absolutely inappropriate and quite threatening towards my daughter.  She was allowed to pack up a few of her belongings and by the time i picked her up he had already changed all the locks on the doors and she was waiting with her minimal belongings at the end of her street.  She's 16, going on 17 in October...what do I do. I don't want the police banging down my door because they report her as a runaway. He absolutely kicked her out, I saw the conversations. I assume I have to file an emergency custody motion, I just want some advice on how to go about this. I don't know how any parent could just kick their child out of their house, especially their MINOR child. I don't want anything from him, I don't want child support, I don't want anything other than the rest of her personal belongings, and even then, everything can be replaced. But I have to get her enrolled in my school district pretty fast and I have absolutely NONE of her identification (social security card, birth certificate, etc). He doesn't have any type of health insurance for her, so it's not like I can even ask him to do that minimal bit by keeping her on his plan. Sorry, I'm rambling....  Basically, what do I need to do to cover myself and protect my daughter's best interests in all of this. She's more than old enough to have some say in all of this, i assume. I'm just working with a very limited time frame with school and everything and I guess just need some advice on where to start first. Thanks for reading if you still are, and thanks for any advice you can provide."	Yes
613	I will be 15 next month at this time and I was wondering if there are any loopholes of getting out of a bad family situation without being emancipated. I live in the US if that helps. I don't have any other family to live with, but I can't live with my father and brother as I do now. If there's anything you think can help me, please leave a comment. If more details are needed ask away.	Yes
614	We live in California.  My fiance has a 4 year old daughter who's mother has been controlling his visitation with her since we have been together. He hardly gets to see his daughter and they had agreed through messages that he'd see her sundays. Almost every Sunday she has other plans or excuses as to why he can't see her or as to why it will only be 1 hr or so. Last year she allowed him an overnight visit which lasted from bedtime to breakfast only,  and that was only because we had just found out her bf at the time had been arrested for murdering his parents. About a month after that visit she moved to Florida without notice before his daughters birthday and denied phonecalls and video chats the entire time she was there which was about 8 months. Now a few years ago when they were together and their daughter was a baby they got into a physical altercation where she broke his nose and he slapped her back. Neither pressed charges but the DA pressed charges against him and he completed community service, 52 anger management classes and as far as I'm aware this is all true. She uses the domestic violence charge against him every time he tries to push about seeing his daughter more or getting consistent visitation at all, as well as threatening to file restraining orders but allowing him to visit her home to see his daughter when she allows him to. He works, sometimes weekends and we are restricted on our vehicle since there are two of us. His ex and daughter now live about 45 min away and she absolutely refuses to drive anywhere to allow him to spend time with his daughter. He brought up court to her as an option to get reliable reasonable visitation and or custody and she now refuses to respond to him at all telling him to go to the courts then and to stop messaging her at all. Please help with advice for us to prepare for this. I have no idea what to expect, but I am sure she will try to defame him as much as possible :(	Yes
615	Hello, Thank you. Here is the question.   I am in Florida and I just received a letter from Texas regarding child support.  I am listed as the non-custodial parent. The mother is a woman I haven't seen/heard from in 14 years.  She left 14 years ago to return to Texas. I was not aware of this child, this is the first I am hearing about this. I never signed a Birth Certificate.  I don't know this childs name or birth date. Doesn't there have to be proof I am the father? What are my options? How does this cross-state child support work? Do I find a lawyer in Florida or Texas? If mine, can I contest for custody?  Or Joint?  Please, any words of advice.  Thank you in advance.	Yes
616	Hi!  Our wedding is being held out of state in TN in a few months. We would like our friend to officiate the ceremony. I have read that some online ordinations aren't being accepted (Universal Life Church). We plan to use AMM, but was hoping to get a legal opinion as to if this would be valid.   AMM lists the legal info for solomizing a marriage on their website:  https://theamm.org/minister-licensing/tennessee/  Any help is appreciated. Thanks!	Yes
617	My ex husband will be paying me child support starting next month. I am trying to do some long range planning to see if it is feasible to stay in my current residence.   This year my CCTB payments are $1800 a month. When it comes to file next year will I include the child support payments as part of my i come to calculate my payments?    Thanks for any advice or answer.	Yes
618	My friend moved to Canada to be with this girl, and has been married to her for 2 years and 2 months. Now, she's saying she wants a divorce. Starting next week, he's going to be visiting friends and family for 3 weeks. Is leaving on a trip a bad idea for him right now? If not, are there any precautions he should take before he leaves? And can she do anything to have him deported now that they've been married for over 2 years?  The only assets they have is their condo, which is paid off. It's their registered marital home and is in both their names.	Yes
619	Hey guys! This is gonna be a little lengthy, and I might be all over the place so I apologize ahead of time. So, last July my soontobeex-husband and I decided to seperate. We weren't going to immediately divorce; one of those things that we would see how it goes. Me  and our 3 year old daughter moved home to NC where I started working and getting my life back together. He was sending money every week and we had a pretty loose custody schedule due to our jobs and the costs of going back and forth. In October, I asked for the divorce. After a long time of thinking about it, I decided to go ahead and do it. We're still great friends, and pretty good at coparenting. We discuss everything about our daughter before we do it, and any issues we have are discussed when they occur. In fact, we're better now than we were when we were together! So we decided to file in Kansas. Problem we are running into is we can not find any information about filing and not including the paperwork about child support and custody. We're being pretty chill about it. With us having a 24 hour drive time between eastern NC and central Kansas, trying to budget and make a concrete custody plan doesn't seem feasible, especially since neither one of us are at each other's throat about our time with our daughter. And I don't want him destroyed in child support either. I guess I'm just trying to see of there is a way we can go ahead and get divorced without getting the courts involved in our parenting.  Any advice would be extremely appreciated!	Yes
620	"Ex wife agrees to pay mortgage and is awarded home. States in decree that she is responsible for all things cost related to home, and that she will indemnify me. I sign quit claim deed. We agree I must be refinanced off by Jan 2019. Long story short, she gets pregnant with some guy she just met, and they moved into his house a town over. She tells me throughout the year that she will be selling the home. Has a buyer, but she took a modification out on the home, and the deal falls through last minute. She can't sell the home without either raising that amount or getting someone else to pay difference. She then drops on me, hours after this falling through, that ""well I took an extra month of maternity leave"" and that she has ""no future plans to make any payments."" I have no document of her saying this, but I called the bank that day and let them know that I was told she will not be paying.   Not sure what to do about it, or what this means. I told her that I would be willing to extend the amount of time it takes to get me off of the loan, but it was agreed that she has to pay the mortgage. She stated that she will not do so. I explained that she will be in contempt of court, which she laughed at me and said ""what is that going to do for you?"" She has a car that I have to pay.   Can I petition the court to take the car back? She wants to stop payment on the house, why does she get to keep the car? What kind of punishments might occur as a result of this? Taking the car back would free up 300 dollars a month. We currently have a 50/50 custody agreement with the kids with no payments to each other. I'm getting sick of the irresponsibility that she keeps exhibiting. I know courts don't care - caught her cheating. She spent an 8k tax return I gave her at Disney World/Vacation instead of taking care of the kids/responsibilities. Not sure if I should even bother with any of this or just let it all go.   Please, I really need help in this matter. I'm tearing my hair out.   Thank you"	Yes
621	"Texas.  Spouse out earns me by double. Just found he has not paid the mortgage in 3 months. Trying to force a short sale (mortgage is not in my name , house has joint deed).   I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about ""taking someone out."" When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality. I am an educated professional and a bit disgusted with myself that I allowed this to happen.  Maybe some of that is not relevant, i'll admit I am not thinking clearly. Fundamentally, what can I do about the house???"	Yes
622	I could really use some advice. I'm in Texas and am attempting divorce my abusive husband. We have been married for 12 years and have a six year old daughter together. I moved out of our family home 8 or 9 months ago, and have been seeing someone else during that time. In the past he has been physically violent, but I never filed charges as he always showed remorse. I regret that now. He assaulted me when I told him I was leaving and the police were called, but they did not offer to press charges and I did not think to ask. He has assaulted me since then as well as assaulting my current boyfriend. I went and spoke to the D.A.'s office multiple times about getting a protective order (once with a bruise on my body he caused) but they stated that since he and I are still married and we have a kid together they thought it best to deny. I have had to get a criminal trespassing warning for my home, which local officers refused to give for a long time. I have been told by local authorities that I am getting what I deserve for cheating because were still married. My boyfriend pressed charges the second time he was assaulted, but the process seems to have stopped moving forward months ago. Nothing ever came of it and an officer just told him he should stop seeing me. I officially filed for divorce on February 21st of this year pro se as I could not afford a retainer fee. My husband counter petitioned and I ended up being bullied into signing over majority custody of our daughter to him, which I regret bc he is not a stable parent. At the time I was made to believe I had no choice, but time has proven that he makes poor choices for her emotional well being and she is in therapy. I am now paying approximately 45% of my monthly income, which is already small to him in child support, insurance for her, daycare for her, and other medical fees monthly. He makes good money and can easily sustain everything need for her without my extra payments. I am now on the verge of being homeless because even though I work full time and clean houses on the side I still don't make enough to cover rent, etc once my payments to him come out. Since November of last year he has stalked, threatened, cyber stalked (getting into all of my accounts constantly bc he works it security and changing info, etc) read all of my text messages, constantly hacked in and wiped/locked out my phone through google account manager, etc, and has begun to hack into my work's it network to post inappropriate pictures of me etc for all my coworkers to see. He refuses to give me a divorce now on top of it and constantly breaks the morality clause in our custody agreement. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. I feel like no authorities will listen to me and he never stops. I know that this post was very very long. I hope that someone can please help. This has been a total nightmare and I have no one to turn to. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading!	Yes
623	My mother is 64 years old. She's a retired church secretary. My father is still working, making good money, and has a large sum in retirement. He just revealed today that he has been having an affair for 14 years, and is leaving my mother. My main concern is that she is taken care of. What should I advise her to do?	Yes
624	Long story but here is the short version.  17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.   He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	Yes
625	My wife has 2 kids from her ex-husband who has custody since they divorced. We have 2 kids from me and my wife. My wife has been unemployed for the last 4 years and is a stay at home mom. I am military and our lifestyle is much more significant and beneficial for my step kids. Her ex-husband recently remarried and is trying to modify the order for more child support among other things that would impact our life for us and our 2 kids. I pay my wife's child support because she doesn't work and has a low education. Her income is imputed. I cannot afford the modifications he's asking for and any job my wife could get has the same effect since we would need child care.  What I want to know is there any chance we could pursue a change of custody especially if our lifestyle would be better for the kids, and they would grow up with their half siblings among many other beneficial opportunities he can't provide?	Yes
626	My girlfriend was first hit by her mother for disrespectful behavior keep in mind they are vietnamese immigrants to the United states. Her brother previously hit her for lying, he smashed her phone and hit her with a large stick on the butt until it was horribly bruised. He grabbed her arm leaving bruises and shoved her. The family encourages this type of discipline. Is there anything that can be done to help her like going to stay somewhere besides her home like a friend's house?	Yes
627	I (25F) will be giving birth to a baby boy who is the offspring of my fiancé (31M) in September. Because we are not legally married yet, I have a few questions/concerns over medical legalities.   Basically, I need to know the steps to take in case of something going wrong during birth. I'm assuming, as the father of my child, he would take over the decision making process for the baby if something were to happen to me. Would he have the same medical power of attorney over me if I were to have to be put in a coma or on a life support machine? Or would MPOA go automatically to my parents? I guess my questions are  -Do I need to file some sort of paperwork in case of an emergency with my life?   -Do I need to have a will or some type of notarized paperwork giving him MPOA over our son?   -Should I just inform my parents of my wishes in case of an emergency?   -Am I overthinking ALL of this?   Any and all advice will be considered. Thank you in advance!	Yes
628	Hey /r/legaladvice,  I'm a young trans woman, currently in the process of changing my name. While I already have the papers required, I still can't do it because of the local laws. You have to settle for a neutral name until you get SRS (sexual reconstructive surgery). The name I want and have used for quite some time now is considered exclusively feminine unfortunately. I consulted my situation with an expert witness, who told me there is a legal workaround. All I need to do apparently is to prove that there are men somewhere in the world with the name 'Daria'.   I tried searching through ancestry and found about 17 birth/death certificates and marriage licences there. On top of that, one of the people there have a son with an identical name. The son got in trouble with the law and I found and downloaded about 64 court documents from his trial (footprints, warrants, etc). The expert witness says it's not enough, apparently the documents need to be verified.   How am I supposed to get them verified if I'm not a US citizen? Is it even possible?	Yes
629	"My question is about child support and custody when married/vs not married. My guess was that the legal system would be significantly more involved with the child custody and support stuff if you were not married at the time of a kid's birth. I was picturing that with a divorce order, you'd pick what you both wanted, write that up and submit it to the judge, and they would accept it. (This is assuming both parents agreed on everything). I figured that if you weren't married then you'd have to ""follow the rules"" in terms of splitting custody and child support. I guess I was thinking because the presumption would be the parents don't have much of a relationship and might not be able to sort out stuff. But I am just guessing. Is there any truth to that?"	Yes
630	"A little over a year ago my sister had her daughter (rightfully) taken away. A year later she had her daughter back for a home trial, and then got busted drinking and got arrested. The little girl is back in foster care, the same family she was with for almost a year.  Social Services is filing for permanency.    Through this whole process me and our mother have been trying to get information about how to be considered for taking care of the little girl. She is now 3 years old.  A month and a half ago I had a conversation with my sisters social worker who told me ""I shouldn't be telling you this but there are questions as to your mothers mental health"", and then asked me if I wanted to be considered an option for the little girl to live with and I said yes. She said she would send me paper work.     That night she left me a voicemail telling me ""we have no indication your mother has been ruled out as an option, in fact I don't have any indication that she's ever made herself known as wanting to be considered for taking care of Little Girl.""    My mom had social workers interview her at her home, she's constantly been asking for the paperwork she needs to fill out (She filled it out once and the County office claims they lost it.)   A few weeks ago Social Worker found out that all my phone calls are recorded, and told me to speak with her supervisor from now on instead of her.  I've since tried calling Social Workers Supervisor to ask about how to get the paperwork I need, no response.   My sister was served today. She has a Permanency hearing on Monday.  I texted Social worker and said that I was checking in about the paperwork she said she would send me a month ago. She then texted back and said ""I had to wait until the permanency petition was completed. I will be sending out letters hopefully this week.""   My concern is that this process is being pushed along because she wants the foster parents to get custody of Little Girl. They are great couple, but MN State Law as far as I know places a stress on the requirement to give special consideration to FAMILY first. And that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm suspicious that it's because one of the foster parents is her Coworker.  (they are both social workers for the county.)   I have: - Audio recordings of her making (seemingly unfounded) statements that there are ""Questions to my mothers mental health.""  - Audio recording of her telling me that my sisters previous case worker ""wasn't very good"" about keeping records.  - She also said that she hasn't really looked at any records that may have been kept because 'Up until now I haven't had any reason to.""  - There apparently doesn't need to be any record/proof that they made any effort to contact any family members whatsoever - She left me a voicemail telling me that she has ""no indication"" that my mother ever wanted to be considered as a placement option - I have the text from her saying that she couldn't send me the appropriate paperwork until the petition was complete   I've been trying to read up on everything but I can't comprehend fully if these are actual violations of her job, or if I am just biased in interpreting things.   Any help is so greatly appreciated!"	Yes
631	I'm paying $805 a month for my daughter. I had resigned from my job as a corrections officer due to my mental health being severely affected. I developed PTSD, depression, and anxiety. My doctor had recommended another line of work due to the stress levels I was experiencing. I had left in April 2016.  My daughter is under custody of her grandmother. It was a mutual agreement at the time because my daughter's mom was a very neglectful parent doing drugs, didn't want to work, and I wasn't working so it was hard for me to financially provide while unemployed.  In August of 2016 (while I was unemployed) I was served to determine child support. The meeting was basically a child support agent asking me how much I make, did I have a pension, any savings, investments, etc. I had nothing. I was still waiting for a response to be eligible for a pension withdrawal at the time, but I didn't mention that. After that, I received no word from them.  January 2017, I receive paperwork stating that as of October 1, 2016, I was obligated to pay $805 in child support, and that I was in arrears. I'm dumbfounded by this information because I had no income. I didn't have anything from my pension because I used what little I had to pay bills. I got it in September and it was gone by mid December.  In June of 2017, I FINALLY got a job after months of looking. It doesn't pay as much as my job as a corrections officer did, but it paid something and I was happy. I felt like I could finally get back on my feet and begin providing myself and my children the lifestlye they used to have. I had to downside a lot of luxuries, but I made it work. That was all good until I was arrested for failure to pay child support. I had just started the job two weeks in, and then I'm thrown in jail. My bail amount was $750, my dad helped me out with it. Luckily I was still able to keep my job.   I've gone through so much and it's been stressing over this court ordered amount. I don't even make enough in a month to pay so much and have anything left over for living expenses. My tax return was intercepted to pay arrears. The grandmother listed she doesn't work, when I have her work number. I don't know what to do.   Can child support be determined from previous wages earned? Is that legal? I wasn't working. What do I do to make this right?	Yes
632	Person issuing my wife US Citizenship certificate a coupole of years ago changed the spelling of her first name and removed the middle name. She went to SS and was given a replacement with the new changes as they are on the US Citizenship. She didn't realize that the middle name was removed because it wasn't listed and that this would be the identity. My question is does she have to change her license too?	Yes
633	I'm honestly not sure if this belongs in /r/legaladvice, /r/divorce or /r/parenting.. I apologize if this is the wrong sub.  For the bot: Texas. Throw-away just because.  I got divorced in 2015 and am the father of 3 kids (two teen sons - I'll call S and J - and a pre-teen daughter - I'll call M) and I got custody of them late last year.  Both boys are in the Autism spectrum, with J also having anger issues. S has ADHD as well. M doesn't have an issues. All three kids are in counseling. The boys are also medicated.  My ex lives with her folks and we follow the standard visitation schedule for the state.  My ex messaged me recently saying J was being argumentative and disrespectful. They're staying with her right now for an extended visit. Ex's father has had it with J's behavior and doesn't want J to come back until J gets his act together. My ex expects me to keep J on the weekends when his siblings go to visit. The resulting melt-down J will have is not something I or my fiancee are wanting to deal with. Plus, we deal with J's and S's arguing on a near-constant basis and need the break.  Can my ex really decide to not have one of her children come for the visit?   I did have the same divorce lawyer deal with the paperwork for the recent custody issue, but to be quite frank he wasn't the greatest attorney and I really don't want to go back to him. I cannot personally afford a consultation right now.	Yes
634	"As the title states I'm 22. My mom got the no contact order when I was really young, no older than 4. I met with my dad, mostly out of curiosity but partially because I wanted to fill the void I felt during my childhood.   My whole life he was called my ""sperm donor"" and as I grew up and saw my mom for who she truly was I became more and more curious about my father and what really happened. (Feel free to stalk my comment history for more backround on my mom and our relationship)   The short version is I spent my entire life being the villain in my mom's story, even as a young child. I was blamed for everything wrong and the constant abuse I endured was ""my fault"" as well.  So when I heard that my dad wanted to meet me, I jumped at the chance. We spent 2 hours talking, about our cats, my mom, our childhoods, anything that came to mind.   I would love the opportunity to meet with him again and to possibly have him involved in my life but the no contact order worries me.   My questions are:   Would the no contact order still be valid even though I'm an adult?  If there are different types, how would I go about finding the information as to what exactly the order entails?  And finally, if it is still valid, how would I go about getting rid of or ending it?  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to being able to move forward with my life, out of my mom's shadow."	Yes
635	(Michigan)  Their marriage lasted from may 2015 to may 2017. He owns a pizzeria that I currently manage. He opened it with his own money in 2008. They were in a relationship at the time and she worked there with him and put all profit in their combined personal bank account. She's now suing for lost wages. Since their marriage he's allowed her to pursue her hobbies and be free from work. She had the affair in august 2016. He caught her. They gave it another shot. May 2017, she's at it again. He had to end it. She's also trying to sue for a piece of the business. Any advice would help.	Yes
636	Hello, broke up with my ex girlfriend in January after finding out she was addicted to opioids and cocaine. We have a daughter together who is now four years old. Found out of her addiction when money started going missing and finding valuables missing. After a confrontation she admitted to me and her problem. I found my own place to live and have had my daughter under my care since. She attended a short rehab in January. She went on to show no interest in being a mother and my daughter showed no interest in seeing or asking for her. She entered another rehab in April which last 60 days. She has since been out and is showing all signs that she is back on her drug. Money missing around her parents house (where she stays) she is up all night. Lies about her money and claims to never get paid. She demands to see our daughter and threatens to call the police and have her escorted to have her picked up. She told me over the phone she wanted to kill herself. I guess what I want to inquire about is what are my rights as a father as I am going to pursue legal action. She told me if I go that route she will keep our daughter from me the whole time until a judge decides. That is the only way I believe this will get settled but I am in deep fear for my daughters safety and well being while going through this process. Is there any way to ensure she is under my custody while this process unfolds given the circumstances of the past 8 months?	Yes
637	So, my boyfriend is currently going through an awful custody battle with his unsavory ex. I wish that we could record his ex with the kids but that isn't legal. His kids sometimes talk to me about things, so I was wondering would it be legal for me to record myself speaking with them about her given that they are minors, could their father give consent for them? Or is that still illegal? My boyfriend is very stressed about all of this and I can't really think of any other way to directly help with the hearings and his ex makes a lot of things up. Thank you for any help.	Yes
638	Newbie here looking for advice on my current legal situation. I'm a lesbian mom with a 4 year old child from a previous relationship. My wife has been in the picture since my daughter was 10 months. Majority of time is spent with us, bio father lives two hours away and sees her about once a month. All medical, school, etc.. is handled by my wife and I. When we enrolled her in pre-k last year, they required birth certificate and wouldn't let me put my wife as other parent. She is only listed as emergency contact. We have been legally married for almost 2 years. Question is, how do I go out about making my wife her legal parent/ guardian, without stripping any rights from bio dad? I know it bothers her that she doesn't have the same legal rights as him even tho she is a provider.. note that she is listed as other parent on all medical forms, never had issue until school. Daughter had surgery at 2 years old.. she was able to be there and sign all forms with no issues. Frustrated, just want her have the legal rights she deserves. Please help and sorry for the ramble.. thanks!	Yes
639	I have filled out a template that an attorney created in order to get my grandfather's birth certificate from New York state, I'm just not certain that in tailoring it to my specific case that I have maintained its accuracy. I need his birth cert. because I am applying for dual Italian citizenship and a court order is the only way to get it. I live in Oregon and will be doing everything remotely. Basically, I know nothing about court proceedings, filing, the process, etc. If I make a mistake in my documents, will I be given the chance to fix it, or will my filing fee be wasted and my filing ignored? Also, the template was created on the assumption that I would be going in person to file, and therefore includes blank spaces for dates and times of scheduled appearances. Do I remove those items entirely, or leave in (and leave blank) because my documents will eventually get before a judge at a certain time on a certain date? Thank you!	Yes
640	Hi I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question, I have just never had to deal with court or legal things and I figured I would give this a shot. I am trying to find out exactly what sort of paperwork may be needed or what can be done.  A little background, I have a 17 month old child with a man. He is not in the picture. My son is on Medicaid so now the state has said they want to go after him for money. When I was filling out the paperwork, there was an option for medical assistance only so I checked that. I don't want or need child support from this man but I understand the state wanting to go after him for the medicaid.  I have court later this week but I believe it is just a paternity establishment case since paternity has not been established and the father is not on the birth certificate. I am just wondering what to expect so any advice would be appreciated. Again, sorry if this is a stupid post. I am just stressing out over this whole situation even though I probably shouldn't be.	Yes
641	Was married a bit over 4.5 years, separated in Dec 2014. I filed in June 2016 for dissolution. We have no kids, she had a BA from UCLA before we married, didn't work during our marriage,  got her MA while we were separated, and got everything she asked the court for. I supported her for 13 months while we were separated. In that 13 months, she got $42,000.00 worth of support. I am active duty military, we don't get paid that much, so this amount of money is pretty big to me. Before we got married, she was arrested for assaulting me inn my barracks room. She took a plea for disturbing the peace. The judge still ordered I pay half of a college bill, which I never benefited from since she never worked, and pay her $1,800.00 a month for the next 14 months. I literally can not afford that. I provided my bank statements, for the last 3 years, as evidence, but I don't think the judge even looked at them. They had cover sheets with everything already calculated as to who got what, and highlighted. It would have been very easy to look through and see what I had paid her already. How can I be ordered to support someone so much when they were arrested, and convicted? How can I appeal, our file a motion for reconsideration, when I literally can't afford any of the options? How am I going to support my current wife and two step sons? Please, help me!	Yes
642	"So this has a ton of backstory, but I guess its all important.   My mother got me diagnosed with Autism syndrome at a very young age. She believes vaccines caused my Autism, and had to go through EIGHT DIFFERENT doctors to actually get me diagnosed. (I am convinced you can get anyone diagnosed with anything, especially when they are young and do what their parents instruct them to do during evaluations)  When I turned 18 I started having to do stuff like pay taxes and etc. I was working full time while going to highschool. I had a very strong social life with many friends, and was well liked throughout school. I am the opposite of what you would call ""Autistic"" and when I did eventually explain my situation to my school, they offered to help me get my diagnoses fixed. Even the special ed director quietly told me ""I'm not legally allowed to say this for sure, but you do not come off as autistic at all""  Anyways, I came across something that led me to believe I was receiving SSI for my disability. I confronted my mother about this on 3 separate occasions. The first two times she denied it. The third time she says that I used to receive a minuscule amount (less than 300 a year) I had called the SS office and they confirmed I was receiving disability, but could not specify how much.  The nearest SS office was a bit of a drive from me, and I did not have my license, so I couldn't get there any time soon, especially with working on graduating highschool and work on top of that. Everything I do/get I do on my own, buying food, clothes, my asthma medicine. The only thing I didn't pay for was rent. I never had any help with getting a permit or learning how to drive.  When I finally got an appointment set up and a ride to the SS office, my mother caught wind of it. 3 days later I am kicked out (2 hours after my graduation) and move to Texas with my father. Now that im here I am getting all sorts of shit done, and just recently went to the SS office. I received a statement of Disability benefits and realized I have been receiving $532 a month since early 2015. With my mother listed as my beneficiary.  This money has 100% NOT been being used for me or my wellbeing. And she has been collecting it for a full year after I turned 18. on top of that apparently she did something to disable the payments after she got last months payment (the month after I got kicked out) So I no longer receive the SSI ( something I shouldn't have even been receiving in the first place)  Do I have any legal recourse??? Is there any way I can prove she used these funds  fraudulently? I know that she will fight in court, she is insane and not the smartest person, but very stubborn. I didn't pay rent while I lived with her, and wonder if she will say thats what she used SSI for? (even though she is married to someone that makes over 100k a year, and she just started working full time for the first time since I was a kid, and only because my stepdad forced her to)  She blatantly lied to me that I recieved SSI, and this is mindblowing.  Sorry if this post is all mumbo jumbo, I just learned all of this withing the last 30 minutes and my mind is in a million places right now. If I didn't explain something well enough just ask and I will be happy to elaborate."	Yes
643	Greetings everyone.  I am having a hellish time trying to move on / away from my abusive ex fiance of 4 years. It's a complicated situation and it invovles a lot of manipulation, lies, defamation and abuse on her part that I would like to put a stop to, but need help doing so since my own efforts to disuade her have not worked out. I'm in colorado. If you know of any good lawyers that care about mens rights please help me find them because I am afraid being the male and her acting like a victim all the time when I never do anything but raise my voice and demand her to take responsibility for her actions!	Yes
644	"My friend's parents got divorced 2 years ago and she's now living with her dad and brother. She's told me that they smoke weed and she's allowed to drink underage. I'm worried about her safety because of obvious reasons. I know the police have been to their house multiple times (not for drug related reasons). I don't know if I should give an anonymous tip to the police or call Child Protective Services. Is there any way to tip CPS anonymously? I don't want to be known as ""That Asshole"" that reported the drug use."	Yes
645	Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6onosd/ga_can_my_stepdad_get_custody_of_me_in_a_divorce/  So, my mother was able to turn my stepdad against me and I'm being constanty threatened to be sent to Realdads house. He's a meth addict with no electricity so if they do I guess I'll run away to a LGBT homeless shelter. Not sure what options I have anymore so I'm kind of defeated. I appreciate all your kind words and advice on my previous post :)	Yes
646	"My wife and step son have been given injunctions from his ex-fiance in a malicious manner. He was served first and we just worked out how to get him out of the house he owns with her. He was the one seeking legal advice from officers because she was being violent and destructive. Officer told him there wasn't really anything that could be done since she also owned the house. In response to the officer contacting the ex, she filed an injunction and won, taking away some of his rights and putting it on his record. After the injunction the ex was attempting to contact my wife and not leaving her alone, so my wife filed for an injunction against her. In the interest of trying to never acknowledge the ex again, my wife did not go to the hearing. In response, the ex filed an injunction on my wife. What is worse is the ex works for my wife's pain management doctor. Between that and the ex knowing how much the two are into owning guns and going to the range, this is clearly malicious. She is constantly telling lies to persuade the judge to grant these injunctions. I feel like the judge(s) would pass any and every injunction presented to them at this point.   What I am asking is will legal action be worth pursuing?   I left out a lot of detail for simplicity but I think I have touched on the main points. What this woman is doing is one of those things where you say ""there ought to be a law against this."" I found Malicious prosecution at the top of my Google search but am not sure if that applies here. From my point of view she is definitely abusing the system to cause harm. Location is Florida. Any advice would be appreciated."	Yes
647	"I filed a preliminary protection order against a man for me and my son. I spoke with the judge explained what happened and she granted the protection order and marked the box with the most strict form of protection available which  states the respondent is to ""have no contact of anykind” with me or my son. In our city there are no other types of protection orders and there is no space for a note more specific instructions like a distance the respondent is supposed to be within.  My son's mother has taken our son to stay at the home of the respondent. After calling the police twice the police have shown up to the house and told me even though they are in the same house together the respondent has not violated the order. The first day they said they promised to stay on opposite parts of the house. The second day the same supervisor in charge contacted me and said he checked on my son and determined he was ""safe"" and that I was not to call anymore.  Not sure what to do but go request to see the judge in the morning and have her wrote a specific instructions for ""no contact of any kind"" on the protection order somewhere."	Yes
648	I have 3 children with my ex, that we had when I was living in NC.  During and after my two pregnancies (twins and another baby within one year) he was very emotionally abusive and unsupportive causing me to bounce back and forth with my babies to my mother,  who was equally difficult to deal with.  Within 6 months after my 2nd pregnancy, I sought help and planned my move back to my family in NJ, where I'm originally from. I met with a lawyer that advised me I would not be kidnapping my children if I left state, for I was the sole caregiver of the children. The final thing was when he caused a disturbance at our house and got arrested, the county issued a temporary order where he could not come to the house until court, his Dad helped me pack the car and I went to NJ.   This was 3 years ago.  The father came once to see them within the first few months and didn't last a few days without starting the mental abuse.  Over The years we have gotten to where he can talk to me without resentment and everything is ok until... The second time was this past December. He stayed at my Mother's and it turned out to be a disaster. She was drunk and starting her bs while he's allowing it, so I left with the kids and he left as well.    Now he always had helped me with extra money for the kids, and pays support.  I know he cares about the kids and even though he was shitty to me in the past,  I  never ever held anything against him when it involves the children. When he didn't see his children all the times he promised in between, that was on him, because every time he would revert back to feeling guilty and holding back from seeing them.  I always made sure to protect the kids from being disappointed by making sure to keep it a secret until I knew it was going to happen. The kids are now turning 5 and turning 4 so they don't really know the difference of having a father.   So this is where the question lies. I'm going to visit in North Carolina with my 3 kids to see his family and spend time with him for 5 days. He is going to rent me a car to drive from New Jersey to him and take care of the kids for school clothes and supplies while we are there in North Carolina.   My whole family is saying I shouldn't trust him that he could pull some shady stuff with the law or the kids and try to have them taken from me. I don't believe that he would go to that extent to hurt the children but I want to make sure that I know my legal rights. They were born in North Carolina, I legally left and they have had residency here in New Jersey for 3 years.  We were never married and have no custody agreement.  How should I protect my children if something were to happen?	Yes
649	Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.  Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.)   She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.  My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention.   The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.  After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)  The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family.   After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up.   This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation.   I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.  I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.	Yes
650	I got married in 2012, divorced in 2014, and was in a related legal battle through May of this year (2017). As such, I have a LOT of paperwork left over... Original marriage certificate, letters from my attorney to myself and copies of what they sent to my ex, letter stating that we are legally divorced, etc.    How long do I need to hang on to this? The final court date I had was, as mentioned, back in May- and at this point everything has been completely finalized. No further issues to resolve in court. Can I shred everything, including the original marriage certificates?    Possibly pertinent information: I do NOT have children, there is no alimony, and no shared assets that were divided up at all (house or otherwise).   Thanks!  **TL;DR**: Went through a divorce + related legal battle, everything is finally resolved- can I shred/burn the papers, or is there some reason I would need them?	Yes
651	Background : I'm 18 living in TX. My grandmother started a 529 fund for me in her name for college before she had a stroke and became hospitalized. She is still alive, however, my father, whom I no longer live and have a struggling relationship with, is her power of attorney. Previously this year I tried to get the 529 in my name so that my father couldn't take any money from the account to use for his own personal things, he has an untrustworthy past with money, and the bank that I have the 529 through basically told me to go away and they kept all information of the account secure from me. For this coming year, I am attending college online and need a place to live. I am renting an apartment this August and I am trying to save my money to have an emergency fund. I asked my father to pull out $2,000 from the account to help pay for my living expenses while I am a student and he said he would. Unfortunately, he said he would give me the money in cash which was weird because the money from the account comes in checks that are made out to me. This tipped off a few red flags and I looked further into it and found out that he has been taking $2,000 from the 529 account for the past 7 months (since January) in my grandmother's name. He is unaware that I know he's been doing this and I don't want to confront him directly because I need the $2,000 that he has for my rent.   Questions: What amount of money can I sue my father for on my grandmother's behalf?  Just the money that was taken from the account?   Is there any amount of money that I can personally sue him for? For things like emotional distress or anything like that?  He's been making my life very difficult these past few years and hasn't  paid a dime to help for things like my car, living expenses, or college.	Yes
652	Son is 23 years old and is still living at home. Unfortunally he hasn't got a job for a long time or makes too much effort to get one. I told him many times to better his life, but for years he continues to just make a mess and play video games the whole day. Nothing we tell him seems to let him want to change his behavior. At this point we are considering to force him to move out so he needs to learn to provide for himself. The problem is, he probably won't like the idea and would probably refuse to cooperate.   In that case I wonder, are there any legal grounds on which we could force him to move out, or could he just refuse and stay home? And if it's neceserry (when he refuses), are we permitted to move his stuff to a room we will sign for him and take his key of the house? Lastly, if he would refuse to pay, are we obliged to take him into the house again (because he proobably would) or is that not the case?	Yes
653	My ex girlfriend is around 8 weeks pregnant.  My mind is racing, so please excuse the brevity of this post.  Here is my question:  If the child is mine, I will fight to be a part of the childs life and perhaps even for sole custody.  My ex girlfriend has past legal issues and past drug use.  I am concerned for the well-being of the unborn child.  What can I do now to prepare, legally?  I want to protect myself but I also want to protect the child.  It is also possible that the child is in fact not mine, I am just trying to prepare for the scenario that I am indeed the biological father.  She will not talk to me at any capacity, so I am completely in the dark in regard to information coming from her.    What I know: -She is pregnant, I could be the biological father. -She has had two abortions and has stated she is keeping the child. -She has legal issues and recent drug/alcohol abuse.  In short, how can I use the legal system to protect myself, the child in the event that I am the biological father and can I use the legal system to gain any information on the child before birth?  Thank you for taking the time to read this.	Yes
654	Should mention before I start where I live. I live in Southern Arkansas, in the US.   I turn 22 in September, and I was recently talking to a friend who was able to get several years worth of missed child support from his father. As far as I know, my father hasn't paid Child Support at least since I was 6-7. I've been hurting for money for a while, and I was wondering if it were possible to actually do that without knowing where my father even is currently. Does anyone have any advice or any tips on where to get started?	Yes
655	I don't know if he ever changed his legal/ mailing address. I never evicted him or anything like that. He was free to come and go as he chose. I filed for divorce, he signed the papers and has since cut off contact with friends and family and stopped showing up for work. His current location is unknown.   He spent most of his time in the basement. I am trying to clean it. It was filled with empty beer cans, broken glass, tobacco, and piles of dirty clothes directly on the cement floor. I want to dispose of these clothes. Can I do that legally?  He has other items in my home (a home in my name, purchased before I was married. His name is not on the mortgage.) including a couch and many golf clubs.  I live in Connecticut, USA.	Yes
656	Hi,  I just had a text from a girl i slept with over a year ago saying she had a daugther thats potentially mine or her ex's - shes not sure and wants me to do a dna test. This was a one night stand, havent spoken or seen her since.  My question: am i obligated to take this test? If i dont am i liable to pay child support in any way? This would turn my life upside down, its not fair this bombshell has been dropped on me now after she is born than before when she was pregnant. I know i shouldve used protection and what the moral thing to do is, but i shouldve been told when she fell pregnant not after she was born! Didnt even know it existed till 30min ago!  Also im from the UK not US.  Any advice would be MUCH appreciated.	Yes
657	"My son's mother spent 2014 incarcerated, she only saw our son in January that year. In 2015, she filed her federal 2014 tax return claiming him and that she ""cared for him more than 6 months that year"". In addition to that, I have a Court Order from 2014 very specifically assigning me all physical custody, all legal decision making and rights to the EITC. Recently, her parental rights were terminated because she doesn't contact him. Now that Court is over (I handled custody, termination and adoption pro-se), I have the time to pursue the EITC issue. In speaking to a tax attorney, if I refile my 2014 claiming my son and showing proof she couldn't claim him, there's a significant chance they will prosecute because of the *clear* violation of federal tax rules (i.e. the fraud was intentional).   Would it be considered ""blackmail"" to send her an email telling her that if she doesn't agree to repay my son his EITC at $100 per month (for 10 months) that I will refile my taxes, causing her to be investigated for fraud?  I wanted to give her the opportunity to handle it without being indicted on federal tax fraud charges but am thinking twice because I'm afraid this might be considered blackmail. The law is pretty vague (to me)."	Yes
658	Baby born in Canada, shared between parents. Court looks inevitable at least eventually. What should she do to protect herself and save on legal expenses? How is it determined where court happens?   There are so many questions but really we just don't want her blindsided and having to fight for custody (even shared) in the US. Also what is to stop her partner from taking her to the US and not bringing her back? I believe without some agreement in place the police can't really intervene, correct?	Yes
659	Say a judge rules at the conclusion of a divorce proceeding that the husband is responsible for $10,000 of tax debt incurred during the short marriage and $5,000 of the party who filed for divorce's attorney fees. The judge orders the 10k to be paid by December 2017 (6 months from the ruling) and the attorney's fees paid within 90 days. Can the person the judge ruled against file bankruptcy to avoid paying the court ordered fees?	Yes
660	"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	Yes
661	I went to a drivers ed school and asked about the courses, which included classroom instruction along with behind the wheel instruction. At one point I ask the lady doing the paperwork if i needed a parent with a license, to which she said yes, saying i needed it for the permit and later on the provisional. When i told her my guardians dont have DLs she said it could be a relative. So i asked if it could be an aunt, she said yes, but she would need guardianship of me. So is she right, or what are my options?	Yes
662	We have 50/50 joint custody and the parenting plan states that we share all major decisions. I would prefer her boyfriend stay in the waiting room and not be allowed back in the room with him. At least while I am there. This will be my first time meeting him, on top of the first time any of my children have ever been administered anesthesia and undergone surgery. I don't need the added stress of him being there. What are my rights here? I was also wondering if maybe there are OSHA laws that give me the right to deny people visiting my child in the hospital. My child will have both parents present. I see no need in a boyfriend who has only known the child several months be present if I don't approve of it.	Yes
663	"Hi all... I'm helping my boyfriend get his marriage from Vegas annulled (he was drunk and drugged during it and doesn't remember, and both parties are consenting to the annulment).

664	"Posted from r/relationships  I've posted about this before but feel utterly stumped. Pretty short summary of everything going on, my abusive ex boyfriend has been harassing and blackmailing me. As he is currently in a different country (Australia), he's contacted me on several numbers telling me that if I don't speak to him he's going to release my personal information and a couple more intimate pictures. Ever since, I've woken up to messages from him, telling me that I've been ""exposed"" and has started to involve some mutual acquaintances. He'll claim that they've also seen my pictures because I'm whore who's passed them around. When I have enough proof that he hasn't even spoken to them, he gaslights me calling me a ""shady bitch"" or ""paranoid"", or will tell me that ""he just thought I had been exposed"".   Per r/legaladvice and many of the people on this particular subreddit, I took the advice to reach out to my local police station to file a police report. Upon discussing my issue with them however, I was told that I would not be able to do anything as police reports are for ""criminal matters"" only and I can't do anything about anything that might happen. Furthermore, I was told that ""my public information would be available online anyway"". An officer told me to try telling him that I was going to submit a report regarding his harassment which I have tried only to be told by him that, ""If something happens to him, there's going to be consequences for me"". I have also previously received other threats from him stating verbatim ""I know where you live, I'll see you soon"", ""If i want you dead, you will be. I know people in your state"", "" ""I want you dead"". I'm currently waiting for another call from the police regarding these threats, but I feel like I have no basis to take this any further. Please help"	Yes
665	Hi, thanks for taking the time to read this! Okay, let me explain the situation to you. When I was born my mother groggily signed my birth certificate and misspelt one letter of my last name. Apparently this went by unnoticed until now, but that's a different story. Anyways, I'm 19 now and I would like to correct my name. My misspelt name shows up in my social security card as well. I was wondering what steps I could take to correct this. I live in Kansas but I was born in Missouri, would I have to change it in the state I was born in?   Thank you and sorry for any mistakes. I'm new to Reddit :)	Yes
666	"My grandma had a stroke, she is fully paralyzed on the left side. Can not function mentally. She can not go to the bathroom without the help of someone else. My Step grandpa will not help her because he is physically unable. My step grandpa is also very emotionally abusive to her, yells and cusses at her when she needs her diaper changed or is hungry. I do hold recordings of my grandma complaining about how she is mistreated and never wants to ask for food because she doesn't want to be emotionally abused.   My mother has power of attorney, yet my step grandpa declines her the call list when tonight my grandma was admitted to the ER. My grandma says that she doesn't want to be around her husband (my step grandpa) because he is ""not nice to her"". My grandma has medicare in Arkansas and a supplemental plan.  My step grandpa will not go, by any chance, of selling his car or any bit of the house (half my grandma's) to help her with her medical treatment....   APS has been called and no progress has been made. My grandma needs better TX than she is provided. APS in Arkansas does not take an elder individual out of the home to be cared for.  What can I do for my grandmother to be rightfully taken care of?  I am a bit beyond my understanding of this situation and am looking for any words of guidance.  Thank you!"	Yes
667	I haven't posted on reddit before so forgive me if I am in the wrong sub or not adhering to protocol.  My young son and daughter are currently in Japan with their grandparents and myself and my wife are currently in the US. My wife has hinted before that she might take the kids to Japan and never come back, but so far hasn't acted on it. However, she made the threat again during an argument last night and has demonstrated behavior today that suggests she plans to go through with it since the children are already in Japan.  We have not filed for divorce or separation and she isn't currently scheduled to fly to Japan for another week, but it's possible she might be changing her flight now. My understanding is that I will have little to no recourse to get access to my children once she decides to follow through on her threats and I'm wondering what my options are to either prepare for the long legal battles ahead or to try and stop this from happening in the first place.  I have sought local legal counsel, but haven't heard back from them yet. She is not a reasonable individual at the moment, but I am hoping to appeal to her for a more rational solution than taking this kind of drastic action. That said however, how can I prepare for the worst case scenario? Thank you for your time.	Yes
668	I got divorced in 2003 and I was on permanent disability. Since I first started getting disability, my wife was in control of the money due to my brain injury/mental disability. To this day, she still has full control over it. I am asking for advice on how to get it out of her name and either back into my name or another family member.  I don't know the exact amount I should be receiving, but i know that she keeps about half of the total amount. The only other source of income I have is 600$ that I receive from the insurance settlement that caused by brain injury.  She says I would probably lose the disability entirely if the disability was taken out of her name or if the bank account it's deposited into changes.   Location: Florida, Hillsborough County	Yes
669	Here goes.. So I'm currently going through a divorce and my soon to be ex wife went online with USPS and changed my address to my business address without my consent. I have a screenshot of the receipt of change from the USPS and she was the one who changed it 100%. The problem I'm running into now is USPS online will not let me change my address because it says it's registered as a business. So is there anything I can do to: 1. Legally take action against her for changing it. 2. Get this issue straightened out with the post office so I can change my address?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
670	(I'm going to apologize for this wall of text, but I really need to get this out there. We need help ,and I can't find anywhere else on reddit to ask these questions.)  I'm in need of some serious help here. I'm 23 and out of the house, but I have sisters back at home. We were all adopted. To give you some back story: I have 2 other sisters, 17 and 18. They live in NJ while I'm in Ohio. Yesterday they visited and while we were alone, my 18 year old sister said she needed to speak with me. Long story short, she had confirmed my long-term suspicion: my father is a creep, and is sexually harassing her, to put it lightly. I've been *slightly* suspicious for a while now, after he made some off-handed remarks to me and a couple incidents of inappropriate touching. I gave him the benefit of the doubt with the touching; I always just assumed it was an accident when it happened. It turns out that he had been making the very same comments to her, only it and the touching has gotten more extreme to the point where she is petrified of being alone with him in the house.   That being said, my obvious first reaction is to get her out of the house. I have an apartment with my SO and we are both willing to have her here. Getting her here isn't too much of an issue. We do have a problem though: her bank account. I don't remember the details, but she said that the *only* way she is able to withdraw money is with our parents present until she's 21. We're afraid that, since dad has control over the account, he will withdraw all of her money. Yes, he would do that to her. Is there any way around that policy? Can we talk to the bank and explain the situation and can they make an exception based off that? Also, since she is 18, there obviously isn't a problem with where she goes. But like I said before, my other sister is 17. If I got her out of the house and dad got angry, could I be arrested for kidnapping? I just want all my bases covered.   And here's a second thing: what do we do about HIM? My sister has done what she can, I think. She has contacted the police on a few ocassions. They brought him in for questioning, but nothing came of it. The problem is that our father uses his clout of being an ex-police officer of 20 years to get him by in this situation. It doesn't help that my sister has had a habit of over reactions and exaggerations (this is obviously not one of them). It seems that local law enforcement will do nothing major for her now. There's also the fact that she's tried to bring this up to our mother. As I said in the title, no one, not even our mother, believes her. Dad is smart, and always makes sure that his creepiness can be masked to look like something completely innocent. Understandably, mom has always given him the benefit of the doubt (along with everyone else), despite warning signs that even she is aware of (ex: dad sometimes watches things like documentaries of crimes of women being raped (seriously dad, what the fuck). Mom tells him repeatedly to turn those things off. She doesn't seem to put 2 and 2 together). That being said...what the hell am I supposed to do about this? Is there nothing that can be done? Will he never be punished for this?  This is how it's starting to look to me, and I can't believe it.   If anyone has any answers, or even just advice, please tell me. I'm coming to my wit's end.	Yes
671	I'm a foster parent living in Oklahoma and I'm adopting my niece. Half way through the process I got a call asking if I would be willing to help take in my nephew and knowing no one else in our family would, I accepted. I later found out that he has a serious mental health issues that my wife and I don't feel we are equipped to handle and he's tearing my family apart.  The only reasons why we haven't had a caseworker change his placement is because we still feel for him (I was a foster child for a brief period of time when I was about his age), the fact that our adoption finalizes within the next two months and the financial bind that put my family in without the stipend my state provides. We had to purchase a new vehicle since we were a family of five which is where the financial bind comes in. Is there a way that the state can take my niece so close to adoption? Also is there a way to sell back my vehicle or trade it for something with a lower payment for people in my situation?   Noteworthy items: My wife is a stay at home mother We've had my niece in our care for over a year I hate looking like the bad guy but his bio-father has had mental health issues since he was about 10 I am sure my nephew needs in-patient treatment	Yes
672	"As the title says, I have no lawyer since I cannot afford it. I can't get any pro bono help since I do not live in Louisiana anymore(I live in Michigan), which seems to be a prerequisite for all the lawyers I've talked to down there. How can I go about fighting this?   Some details: My ex is claiming I haven't had contact with my son in 6 months, a lie which our phone records will show. The subpoena came in the mail 2 weeks before the court date. I scrambled getting together money, transportation and days off work and made it. The judge said I wasn't given enough time to prepare and pushed the trial date back 2 months. I tried asking him some questions about my options and he replied ""I'm not your lawyer.""   I believe I have a good case against the adoption, which would mean losing my all my parental rights, but feel totally overwhelmed by the court system. Can anyone give me some advice?"	Yes
673	"Hello guys,  Well, the mother of my child is moving away with my kid about 300+ miles away from me. We were never married but have had split custody without any official court order for that matter.  I have had a personal addiction problem which I have sought treatment in recently after getting into Rehab.  She gave me the heads up of her move well over a year ago and I did not put up with a fight due to my admittance of personal demons.  At the moment I am clean and have turned a new leaf although I am within 3 months of recovery I'd rather not elaborate.  Despite my problem I have always held down a job, often two when no overtime is available.  I live with both parents, one who is retired and taking care of my child most days of the week and another who is retiring within the year to dedicate bringing my child to school and taking care of her.  Now this was something the mother of my child and I were ok with as our plan for 5 years.  However, she is still adamant of moving away.  She virtually has the worst credit score, car repo'd, lives with either her spouse or family.  I am not on child support however I make sure to give her a couple hundred+ monthly which was originally for day care services however, she hasn't been in day care for over a year.  (Maybe longer, it's hard to believe her at this point.)  Now with my health and wellness getting in order I fear for my child.  Her mom still plans on moving to LA despite no vehicle, credit score, and no family in that area, let alone a true job option or place (she is waiting on section 8).   She's ""almost done"" with school  and does not have a good employment history.   I really want to fight for full custody and keep my child with me and my parents, we even had a school lined up a few blocks away from my house but the mother of my child immediately interjected at my suggestion with ""shes not going to school here"".  With her vehicle repo'd I told her that I wanted my child with me being that you don't have a car nor stable home to live in and she was adamant of her moving to LA.  Despite no vehicle her response was ""she'll just have to school late"", she will be attending 1st grade.  I am really trying to not let the stress get to me.  I do NOT anticipate a relapse nor am I considering it, but I really want full custody of my child.  I work 7 days, 56 hours a week as my parents depend on me to maintain my good credit score (they have filed for bankruptcy) and despite the economy, there retirement pay supports our household."	Yes
674	I'm a victim in a domestic violence case. Ex boyfriend punched me in 2013, so an order of protection was placed. He contacted me a few months later via phone. He did 90 days for the assault and criminal contempt 2nd in 2014. 2015 he violated again for calling me and being at my house. He got 1-3 Yrs upstate for aggravated family offense and criminal contempt 1st. He got out on parole last year and is currently still on it. He violated by calling me again in April. This time they charged him with a misdemeanor and RORed him. How is that possible ? He's already had 3 court dates and RORed each one. No d.a contacted me until today, the day before his next court date and told me its because he wasn't in my house this time ? I have a full stay away it doesn't make sense and isk what to do. He's never going to stop :-( help ...btw I have the entire call log as well as texts from that day but I didn't mention the texts in the initial police report.	Yes
675	My ex-wife recently filed an application for divorce.  There were some issues pertaining to the separation agreement that I wanted ironed out prior to accepting the divorce (specifically fixing FRO arrears to $0 since the amendments to the agreement were not on file as I had assumed she would have done which had adjusted the support amounts payable, as well as some other access issues and firming up some wording on the agreement).  We were able to settle all these issues in our first case conference, and a court order was filed to amend these changes.  I just received, from her, Form 12: Notice of Withdrawal, requesting that I fill it out so she can proceed with the divorce.  Now, I don't want to get boned here, so I was just wondering:  Does this notice of withdrawal rescind my answer that I had on file, nullifying the court order or is it just a formality since we are now in agreement to move forward?  I've also read in the Ontario Family Law that if a Notice of Withdrawal is submitted, that I will have to pay the court fees.  What kind of fees am I looking at?	Yes
676	I know somebody who lost parental rights to both of her children in 2009. Her boyfriend had beaten one of the children while high on methamphetamine. She also tested positive for methamphetamine and was arrested for paraphernalia during that incident.  She had a baby with somebody else in 2012. They separated in 2014. The father is now fighting for sole custody after receiving calls that the mother was using drugs again.  How much of an impact will the past terminations have on the mother's custody going forward?	Yes
677	She came home from Banff Pregnant, Had a Daughter named “M”  Soon after Fell in love with a man we will call “Bob” whom took to M as his own. Moved them both into his home. He had a problem drinking and about a year in got in an accident causing bodily harm. He had also impregnated my sister with “L” They tried to avoid jail by going into detox voluntarily but come the court date 6 months later, Bob got 6 months in jail. My Family was at their home keeping it up while he was away. No Help for his side of the family. Both sides of the family supported him with zero ridicule. He has been sober for 6 years and my sister was his rock.  L was born, my parents again were there to help, no sign of Bob's family. Two years ago they had twin boys. This is where I believe postpartum depression poked its ugly head. M is 8, L is 5. Again not to repeat myself but my family is now there everyday helping, while Bob’s family doing as little as possible.  This is where the story gets dark. My Sister tried to killer herself with pills. She’s taken to the hospital,they run tests ect. Immediately admitted to the Mental Wing. Now the Children's Aid Society is involved.  I’m not living in the same province, I fly home to visit her in the hospital where she will reside for 2 weeks. If you’ve ever been in a Mental Wing one thing stood out she did not belong here. While she was in hospital Bob family all of the sudden had to help with the kids. She was no tint here for a week and Bob’s Aunt had papers for my sister to sign basically giving up custody of her children, thank goodness my parents were there to read the documents first. And they were not signed. Next the Van Bob’s mom Co-signed for needs some repairs that are to be covered by insurance but tell my sister that the only way to get it fixed is to sign over the van to Bobs mom. (Bob can not drive until 2020). This is obviously wrong she ended up just signing a different piece of paper from the insurance company saying they can pay for repairs. Keep in mind this was while she was in the hospital.  My sister finally gets out of the hospital, can not live at home because of the Children Aid Society rules she must have an additional adult present for visiting her children. These restrictions are to be lifted soon and she can move back home with her children, she is currently living with my parents.  But wait there's more since she has been living away from the children, Bobs family has had to step up and help alot more than ever. Is going to get a whole lot more bizarre so here goes. Bobs mom has taken the keys to the van and will not give them back forcing my parents to take two vehicles to pick up the kids because Bob will not let them in the house. They have packed up all my sisters things and put them on the porch one night, i advised them they can not move out of the marital home and to leave the boxes there. They have recently changed the locks to the Marital home leaving my sister without a key. Bob has also asked for a separation. All of this sounds bizarre but it's real, Bob’s family has completely turned against my sister when she needs the help and support the most.It all feels like set up now. They are dictating when she can see her kids &amp; implementing their own rules that accommodate themselves and no one else.  Financially they are not in a good place, They do get the tax benefit from having kids which pays for the van &amp; the rest she sends to Bob to pay for the marital home.  My questions are, can she move back home when the Children's Aid Society has removed their restrictions? What happens if she does not? Is this entrapment?  Can they legally do any of this? What’s the fastest way to get legal aid? We don’t know what her rites are  I'm not a real good story teller, please take it easy.	Yes
678	I'm in NY and preparing for a divorce and have a quick question, since I haven't been to a lawyer yet and am trying to anticipate things in advance in order to make a rough plan.  We own a house but have only about $8000 in equity. We've decided the best option is for me to keep the house. I am assuming this means he will just owe me $8000 less (since I will be receiving half of his retirement funds, etc.) but he seems to think that the court will order half the cost of the entire house deducted from what he is supposed to pay me. (So, including all the money that we still owe the bank.) That doesn't seem right to me, I'm just curious if anybody could help me out with what to expect.	Yes
679	I am living abroad of US but in an American company. My question is, if a female security guard in an American company wants to have a child just for herself and she chooses a coworker male security guard as donor for giving birth to child, does it effect according to US HR regulation their employment in American company? If the donor has a wife and children.	Yes
680	In short, my girlfriend's father finally managed to get arrested after years of abuse and alcoholism. He's the main source of income for the household, and her mother is disabled and gets way too small of a disability check. She's been wanting to divorce him, but wouldn't know what to do to replace his income, so she never really looked too far into it. Now that we're forced into the situation, we don't know what to do about missing his income now. We don't make enough to support a whole family and house, and her mom's disability is nowhere near enough.	Yes
681	Does anyone have any examples for custody or visitation agreements for parents where one abuses substances?   Back story: other parent has been abusing OTC medication for a year, no test exists for this substance, but it alters mood. Also has mental health issues. Currently have an order for supervised visits, but that may not last long term, and I'd like to come up with something we're both sort of okay with instead of having a court decide.  I encourage a relationship, and the child's other parent wants one, but I'm not sure how much/what kind of visitation they should have other than supervised. Other parent uses sporadically, so I'm concerned the child could die if the other parent uses while watching the child alone.	Yes
682	The situation is kind of complex, but I'll try to break it down. I may not know all the details of the legal stuff that happened, but I'm trying my best from what I do know.  We are in Manitoba, Canada.   My parents separated legally. However, between themselves they agreed that Mom will not apply for child support benefits and in turn Dad will let her live with him rent free. They live like roommates, only sharing common spaces. They barely talk and in general do not have a relationship.  They do not share finances outside an RESP for my education.   My mom recieved government benefits for being a single mother for 3 (?) years. She works part time and does not recieve financial assistance from Dad at all, apart from their agreement about the rent.   Last month they both got letters stating that they need to explain what kind of custodial agreement they have over me. Their definition of shared custody included living at separate addresses, so they could not say they shared custody. So they wrote a custom explanation about the situation and their agreement.   Today a letter came in with an invoice of $10k CAD. I do not know the terms of this debt (interest, time frame). Is there anything that can be done? Is what they're doing actually illegal? Please help.   TL;DR: Parents separated, but live in one house to save the hassle of child support and rent. They do not share finances otherwise. Invoice came in saying Mom owes the government $10k CAD. What do?	Yes
683	Hello,  Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I was concerned about overexposition to the stock market, and asked my wife in late 2015 to make changes.  She ignored my request.   I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax.   I feel overburdened because while my exwife claims a sizeable share of these funds, she has completely ignored anything related to stewardship.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.  Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case for a while now, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending to be unavailable, or absent from the country, or that they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months..., just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.   Any advice appreciated.	Yes
684	Hi everyone   Basically my Mom finally had her mediation meeting with her ex-husband and their lawyers. They've been married for about 3 years prior.   In a battle for spousal support, his lawyer told my Mom that since he hasn't filed taxes for 2014-2017 and owes back taxes from before that, that she's legally accountable for half of it. So instead of having the IRS come after her, they'll opt to give her 0 spousal support.   My Mom's lawyer argued back, stating my Mom **NEEDS** some form of support, so they agreed upon $800 a month for 6 months.   Is this all we can really pull? Is this really how the law works? My Mom marries a new man and finds out he never filed his taxes during the divorce, so therefore she'll be screwed over because of his mistakes?	Yes
685	"I'm in Illinois in the US. My two brothers and I want to obtain Power of Attorney on my mother as she gets older. I have 3 questions:  1. I found [these (1)](https://powerofattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Illinois-Durable-Power-of-Attorney-Form.pdf) [two (2)](https://powerofattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illinois-medical-power-of-attorney-form.pdf) forms online. Are they sufficient or is there an ""official"" form that I should use instead?  2. The above-mentioned forms indicate that my mom can't name co-agents. Does this mean that only one of us can have PoA at a time, and the others would only get it through succession?  3. Do the forms need to be filed with any government agency to be official, or do we simply keep copies and present them as needed?  Thank you for your help. I know I'm just another stranger on the internet, but this will mean a lot to a group of real people that will benefit from it."	Yes
686	"A few days ago, my dad received a letter from some legal advice company (not an official court summons) that said that they could help with his case of domestic violence and a restraining order against him. We looked up the case number included in the letter, and it indeed did have his name on it, and that he's being sued for domestic violence by some woman that he claims he's never met. I do believe my father 100%, since he's never raised a hand against my mother or my siblings and I for as long as I can remember. (Though I am open to the possibility that he may be lying, but I really doubt that.)  We're not sure if this is a real fraudulent case against my father, or if this is a mistake that this legal advice company made. What we do know is that there's a court hearing a few weeks from now and that this was filed in the city that we live in. As of now, we don't have any official documents from the court letting him know that he's being sued. My hope is that this is all a huge misunderstanding.   Main thing that worries us is that my dad has just started the naturalization process to become a US citizen, and that this ""lawsuit"" could have a negative impact on that.   Regardless, we are going down to the courthouse later this week to make sure."	Yes
687	"I'm 16 and I'm going into my junior year of highschool. My conservative parents and I often argue. They believe that I am ""the only child that fights with his parents"". Because of those previous arguments, they wouldn't allow me to have access to the papers I need to enroll.  They made me miss the enrollment days.   I get okay grades. Mostly A's or high B's and those C's in Spanish. I am in speech and debate and orchestra. I clean my room, my dishes, fold my clothes and take out my trash.    Is there anything I can do? I go to school in California.    I posted this in r/advice and someone told me to go here"	Yes
688	My wife and I are filing for divorce, and we're keeping the debts that are in our name after the marriage. I'm currently filling out the forms and it's asking for us to list all our debts, before and during the marriage.   Can we just keep this blank or should we fill it out? Does this become public information? I know you can get things sealed, but I'm doing all of this online and I'm not sure the online application has the option of requesting this. I'd rather not pay any lawyer fees as otherwise this really is a peaceful separation. Thanks!	Yes
689	Obligatory this post is not about me but about my fiance (22 M). It is also necessary for me to say that him and I live in WA but his daughter lives in FL so this is a Florida state matter.  So my fiance got a girl pregnant when he was living in Florida. The child is now three years old (possibly 4 but I am pretty sure she's only 3). Anyway, his daughter was born while he was in basic training and he is now active duty military stationed here in WA which is where I met him and it is where he has been since. The mother of his child requested that he have a paternity test and he agreed. This was a little over a year ago. Since he has taken the test (it was positive), he has had to pay an ordered amount in child support since then which is automatically deducted from his pay and was slammed with owing around $12,000 in back child support which he now makes extra payments every month on that as well to keep him from going to jail. Additionally, the mother of his daughter refuses to let him see her or even have any contact with her. He always pays his support since he has had to and has no criminal history of any kind or any reason for him not to see her. I assume since he is required to pay child support, he has joint custody of the child even though he does not live there. He is also not named on her birth certificate.  So my question for anyone who has been in this situation before or anyone who has knowledge of FL laws regarding this, what rights does my fiance have to see his daughter and additionally, is it right that he now owes so much money in back child support from before he took the paternity test and how can we resolve this situation for him?  Also, there is talk from him about wanting to surrender his rights over. His logic is that if he isn't allowed to see her, why bother paying child support for her. So fine people of Reddit, can you give me any advice?	Yes
690	So, my wife just separated and we may get a divorce. She has a degree, an apprenticeship and will soon be a tattoo artist, lives with wealthy parents, but makes some part time money. I am a pure commission salesman who pays for us while she is an apprentice. We live in MN and have no kids. How can I avoid alimony after 3 years and 10 months of marriage? I have tried to work it out, and she has decided that she just wants to be an alcoholic and not work on it. What should I do?	Yes
691	We've been dating for 5 years and we have talked about getting married so that I can move in with her and get a job in the U.S.  I've looked up the process of me getting a green card and we're pretty certain we're going to get married in the future so we've decided to have a low profile union (only telling very close friends and family).   I'm just wondering if I'll be okay to go down to the states as if I were visiting and marrying her then. If so what do I say at the border? Do I need to notify either government beforehand?	Yes
692	A little backstory i think is necessary: Back in mid-2000's my wife and I divorced. Around 2013, I filed for custody and given the circumstances she was in, I was granted custody as it was clearly the better place for him to live.  My son (16 years old) visits his mom during the summers and had stated to me before leaving he wanted to live with her. I think this was due to him getting in some serious trouble soon before he left and wanting what he thinks will be a more lenient household. Also he had a serious falling out with his best friends shortly before he left as well. He told me again during a Skype call a couple weeks back that he still wanted to stay at his mom's. I was considering allowing him to move back there at the end of the next summer but wanted to talk to his mom and get a lawyer involved to protect all parties' interests.   Yesterday I was served with paperwork, filed by my ex-wife, that I abuse our son. It seems to reference a couple of incidents that I somehow harmed him. Im not sure, it doesnt go into specifics. As a single parent Ive tried really hard to provide the best life I can for him. I didnt even file for child support so his mom would have more money to do fun stuff with him when he visited as we were *fairly* secure at the time. Im really scared what could happen with these accusations.   I cant imagine any proof they might have since abuse never occurred.  Any advice or comments would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading.	Yes
693	My ex husband (38) and I (35) included a morality clause in our divorce agreement.  That he nor I should have someone of the opposite sex not related by blood or marriage spending the night when the children are present.  He recently told me that he plans on moving in with his girlfriend (23) of a year this fall.  In fact, they have already been spending the night together when the boys are there on visitation.  I have expressed to him and her how this upsets me and that it goes against our divorce agreement.  I don't have a problem with people in general living together while not married.  I just don't want it around MY children.  We are raising them in Catholic schools and they are taught this is wrong.  What are my legal options?  I can't afford an attorney because we are barely getting by as it is.  This isn't the first time he's broken the divorce agreement.  I feel like I'm being walked all over.  I'm willing to save and try to talk to an attorney but I don't want to waste my time if the clause is not likely to be enforced.	Yes
694	Allow me to explain the situation: I met and became friends with a trans woman online. She's caring, kind and is very motherly, a bit overweight and in her mid 30's. As I talked with her and got to know her, I began to learn more about her personal life and came to discover she's had quite a sad lot in life. She's married to trans man who is at best neglectful and unloving, at worst physically and mentally abusive, mentioning to me having to cover up bruises from pinches and slaps. Apparently about 5 years ago, they had an agreement to have an open relationship, but only with members of the same sex (this was pre transition for both of them). He(she at the time) broke this agreement and had an affair with someone of the opposite sex and when confronted about it, they blamed her(him at the time) for it. Apparently ever since he's made her the scapegoat for all their personal and relationship problems. This has had a considerable tole on her, becoming extremely depressed and attempting suicide by over overdose at least once. She's mentioned multiple times that she see herself making it through the next few years. She's also in a very bad place financially, unable to afford a divorce or even the $700 fee to change her name and gender on her driver's license. Despite my urges to seek help with a therapist or psychiatrist or even just staying with her parents for a bit while she sorts things out, she always brushes them aside, apparently viewing herself as a lost cause or saying the didn't help in the past. Here's where my end of the problems come in. I'm a 19 y/o male who is currently unemployed and I live on the east coast of America, while she lives somewhere in Northern California (she told me the exact name of her town once, but I forgot it now. Something like Sherryville or Cherryville if anyone is more familiar with the California area). I'm also not sure she'll even take any advice or contact anyone or anything that I ask her too. I want desperately to help her somehow and it breaks my heart to even have to write this and recall some of the things she's been through. Please, please, I just need some advice.	Yes
695	Hi, I'm new to legal advice and being in trouble in general, so please let me know if I'm missing anything.  First things first, I'm going to turn myself in obviously, I'm going to have my lawyer set up a time to do that.  About 5 years ago, my drug addict father showed up at my mom's house, after I hadn't seen him for over a year. In my opinion, he was messed up on prescription painkillers when he arrived. He was parked in the driveway, I yelled at him to leave, we yelled at each other. He tried to open the car door and I closed it back on him. I ran inside, called my mom, and he backed out of the driveway, called the cops and said I was threatening him. We were the only two people present. Honesty, I have no idea what I said to him. I was 20 at the time, and pretty upset that my abusive father showed up at my house without warning. The police arrived, assessed the situation, and told me something about how in domestic cases they usually arrest someone no matter what, but that my father wasn't going to sign a complaint and they told him to not come back to the property. The next day, apparently he called the police to sign a complaint. A warrant was issued for my arrest at the time, for misdemeanor domestic abuse  Here's where it gets fucked. I was never notified I had a warrant. Nobody ever showed up at my house. I never got a letter in the mail. I've had my ID ran by multiple police departments, including the one wanting to arrest me now (never in trouble or any other charges ever, just verbal warnings), applied for jobs, school, new passport, left the country and went through customs, etc ect. Nothing ever came up, so I had no idea.  About a year after that, my father passed away because his liver failed, due to the ridiculous amount of prescription pills and alcohol he was consuming.  Cut to just now. The police called me, saying they were going through old warrants and needed me to turn myself in. They explained that they tried to have the state's attorney quash the warrant, but the attorney refused. I'm not walking into the police station without a lawyer obviously.   What the hell happens next? The cops are saying that they'll transport me to court, I get booked, and then the bond court will PROBABLY throw it out. I don't believe them at all. I have bail/bond money, but I'm just afraid as fuck of jail.	Yes
696	"also posted in /r/Custody So, my ex and I broke it off March of last year. She moved in with some ""roomate"" guy, but didn't end up really being just that, of course. She didn't think I would go through with anything related to courts, but we couldn't agree on a school. I was moving back to a county with 10/10 schools (which I attended), and she wanted him to attend a charter school which was nothing I wanted him to experience, as it it was in a run down area, etc. I hired a lawyer, fought for school of choice, went to a referee hearing and somehow she had a lawyer (last minute, she was terrible), and I won with flying colors. She objected to the recommendation, went in front of a judge some months later, and she was definitely ill prepared again, and the judge sided with me. (He was very mad that she refused to take him to ANY school, hers or mine, for 2 months until he made his decision. I was taking him to my school since it started, and she was taking him nowhere on her days). We were supposed to go to mediation. She didn't show. My lawyer filed sanctions against her, for the attorney fees of $1800 for preparing for mediation and her missing it, and asked the judge for 5 days with me instead of 50%, and he almost granted it. Said ""Do you see what's going on here?"" She really kind of looked foolish in the judges eyes. The judge granted the sanctions, and it was ORDERED that she not be late at all dropping him off to school or picking him up. We were prepared to enter another mediation. I told her we could sign a parenting time agreement and we would not need to go. That night, she signed it, and all was well. Which brings me to now. Every. Single. Part. Of. The. Order. she hasn't complied with. Hasn't paid the mediator the $100 she owed him (in the order), hasn't paid me or set up a payment plan with my attorney for $1800 (in the order), and has been late to drop him off 20+ times (in the order that that cannot happen). I'm trying to be lenient because of her situation, living 20+ min away, moving into her best friends house instead of her ""roomates"" (that didn't turn out well, duh). And now, I find out she's an escort to old men. That's not OK, knowing her history into getting into risky situations, and I'm worried for things going down hill from there. I work too hard and spent too much for my son to be in an unsafe and unstable environment like that. So I let her know my knowledge of this, and she kind of avoids talking about it. Yesterday, I bring up that I'm taking actions based on her willingly violating every single aspect of that court order. I'm hoping that will change her actions, because I'm scared of what will happen if she continues, and worry about my son first and foremost. http://imgur.com/a/uXOrB http://imgur.com/a/xOGNj Pictures for reference. I'm wondering what in your opinion would be the best course of action for correcting her behavior. Contempt? Thank you!"	Yes
697	"Long story short: my uncle forced my grandmother into letting him claim me and my sister on his taxes, claiming if she didn't he'd call cps because my sister doesn't have a room. (he's ""renting"" it)and because of the arguments my grandmother and sister get into."	Yes
698	My wife and I are splitting, we're divorcing, we're done. Not going to get into who's fault or whatever, but there's a big issue.   She took my debit card, basically taking access away from money. Basically she decided to hold the money over my head. The account is joint, I have a card with my name on it and she has one with ours and it goes to the same account. She would basically give me cash when I got paid and tell me to get another bank account, which I eventually did but the latest paycheck still went into the account. She would drop the money off and yet I wouldn't get the full amount. Basically she's leaving me with nothing and also controlling how much I can have. She told me she is closing the account so I will no longer have access to it. Fine. We need to split.   Here's the twist... I found the card. Apparently she didn't think to chop the damn thing out before throwing away (and apparently she needs to work on her skills because she missed the garbage can) And the account isn't closed. I check the balance and found she has a lot more money than previously thought. I'm sitting here with my card wondering if I have any right to withdraw whatever money I want. And I'm confused... Do I? I mean... It's our account, she took my debit card, and the card has my name on it..... What do I do? I need to pay bills, I have a mouth to feed and she just left me with nothing. I could take the loss and wait until I get paid again but during this split she's done nothing reasonable. Everything done, especially the money situation, has been uncalled for. It may sound mean, and like I'm trying to get revenge but that's not what I want. I just don't want to starve the next two weeks. So... Do I have a right to withdraw the money?	Yes
699	I went no contact with my mother about 6 months ago after years of dealing with her violent alcoholism, her undermining my choices as a parent, her blatant favoritism and targeting of my children, and the straw that broke the camel's back, her running a background check on my SO in an attempt to persuade me to break up with him. I just received a certified letter from her asking me to contact her to set up visitation for her and my children. It didn't explicitly say anything about her taking further steps, but it seems like that's the direction she's trying to move. If she does take me to court for visitation what sort of information would be pertinent to document? Are her chances of winning high? (We live in Nevada) I can get several character witnesses on my side if I need to. I'm just not sure if I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thanks in advance for any advice. ETA- should I respond to her letter and reiterate my stance on her visiting the children?	Yes
700	Okay so this issue takes place in Austin, TX. Here is what is happening and I need advice on this subject...it's for my sister. She had a child when she was 19 with a guy she had only known for 2 months who was involved in some pretty sketchy things illegal things I believe but I am not sure enough to put the people around him at risk. Here's an example when my sisters child was around 3 he would still visit his dad and the dads girlfriend at that time had a twin sister who was threatened to be beaten if she didn't give them the whereabouts obviously they were going for the one who was dating the dad but they didn't know that she had a twin. Anyway, when my sister was with him for about 2 years, he hit her a lot the cops were called maybe 3 or 4 times but she never reported him officially. The child is now six but he stopped taking interest in him when he was 3. When the baby went to see him he would not play with him it was mostly his girlfriend at the time who would look after him. My sister then decided that she didn't feel he was safe seeing him or happy or well taken care of so she didn't let him see him. From what I understand he tried to see him a couple of times. The dad has never NEVER provided for my nephew my sister has always earned all the money and she has supported my nephew financially. The dad wants to see the child now after 3 years and he showed up. He is on the birth certificate my sister wants to get full custody of him. She's afraid for their lives is there anything that she can do to win and protect herself and my nephew from him??	Yes
701	"My wife and I are both residents of Indiana. I've been split with my wife for 9 months - not legally, just physically. We are still married. We moved into our own separate apartments and split all time and expenses with our child 50/50. She continually led me to believe that she didn't want child support or full custody - which I figured was a lie, but I really hoped for the best. In the last couple months I paid off the family car (2010, in my name) with the entirety of our tax refund and some of my own money, knowing and communicating that I planned on giving it to her. I've also sent unofficial 'child support' to her since I'm not there to split our son and his expenses 50/50. For many of those months I also paid her car insurance, and I've always paid half the babysitter bill.   When I'm at home I teach, and my margins are so small budget wise I can't afford to pay her a big child support payment after the divorce. I'm only able to afford it now because I'm making two incomes - my summer teaching check and my active duty money from the National Guard (my second job, I'm in MO at a branch schoolhouse).   She now tells me that she does want physical custody and child support, but our son will still be split 50/50 in whats called ""parenting time"". Her rich uncle has gotten her a lawyer and she filed right before I came here. It can't go through until I go home and take a mandatory children/divorce parenting class. I also am not home to be served officially/through certified mail (is my understanding)  My questions:    Does anyone know of an accurate child support calculator, or an idea of what I'd be paying if I lose custody but have 50/50 parenting time? I already have two jobs - she doesn't even work full time. Will the judge care? From what I've seen that doesn't matter - just the fact that she's making less than me is going to jack my bill up.   Are any of her text messages admissible in court?   What rights do I have to the vehicle? She is driving it and has the keys but I have the title in my name. Can I have it towed and scrapped? Would her lawyer sue me? Could the judge give her my car - the one I have in Missouri, even though that's in my name too (and that one's not paid off - would I have to give it to her AND pay it off?) Could I pay it off, put it in a friend's name and continue driving it? Could a judge touch that?  I know I sound vindictive - but I paid to put this woman through college, made endless efforts to get out marriage to work, was treated like absolute crap for a very very long time, have been lied to so many times, and now she wants to take my son too, and have me pay her, when I am a good dad, and she knows it.  I just got done taking her name off my insurance bill - what can I do about the vehicle, and what should I anticipate about child support?  Hopefully you guys are willing to help. Thanks for reading."	Yes
702	Long story short, me and my family are very happy. I have two stepsons that i love very much. They both have abandonment issues and I would love to adopt them, and they have brought the issue up themselves without provocation. One father is in jail for attempted murder and won't be out until my son is an adult. And the other's father abandoned him at birth and has not seen him or paid a penny in child support. I have spoken with both fathers, they both are very appreciative of my raising their sons but neither will go so far as to signing adoption papers.	Yes
703	"Long story short. California case. Husband had temporary restraining order placed on him, and I filed for divorce. He has a charge of domestic violence. Actual restraining order was not granted. (Judge HATED my attorney.) Judge ordered a ton of things, including a social services investigation on our child. Husband and I worked things out, don't live together but want to stay married. I filed a form for dismissal of the divorce, and was told all upcoming hearings would be dropped. Guess they weren't because I got a letter saying we are being ""sanctioned"" for not appearing  and are due in court to discuss dismissal.. What the hell does this mean? What will likely happen? I'm terrified of this judge, he is extremely powerful. I've never been so terrified of someone in my life. Can someone please give me an idea to what this all means? (Please no judgments on the fact that I'm with my husband still. It would take me days to write out our whole story.) Thank you."	Yes
704	"Hello everyone, i have a question for the best minds at r/legaladvice because I don't know what to do.  Let me give you some backstory.  I live in Kentucky.  My older brother lives in Athens, Georgia.  He's had psychotic breaks twice before, both timed he gets violent and talks about how people have a death wish and how they're going to die, one time he drove a golf cart with a .30/.30 rifle and pellet gun towards a house owned by someone he just had a loud argument with before veering off to an adjacent house and busting out windows and destroying it in his rage.  This was his first episode.  The second happened on Monday, he told me he had suicidal thoughts and needed help then went dark and wouldn't answer me, come to find out he got arrested for attempting to jump out in front of traffic and told the police officers to kill him and he had no reason to live.  He was also very careful to tell them he was on acid, so they wouldn't think he was nuts (he later proudly told this to my Aunt, unprompted).  Currently he's in a mental institution for monitoring, and is to be released on Monday.  I think that my brother needs serious help, and he is refusing to do any sort of inpatient care.  He doesn't have insurance.  I can't believe that the police are letting him go after he was attempting suicide and assaulting police officers.  From what I understand that's how the system works in Athens, they're overcrowded and just try to shuttle people through the system.  He is on probation from the first incident, but just has to do call check-ins and that's it.  He was diagnosed as mentally ill and was given medication but stopped taking it.  My brother is very manipulative, and when I spoke to him last he's still on the ""pink cloud"" where everything is going great and he had a support system and is on medication and everything is going to be great.. but I'm terrified that he's lying to me and he's just going to go back to the same old habits and next time someone could get very hurt when he has one of these psychotic breaks.  He won't listen to reason.  How can, or can I even, go about getting him involuntarily committed if he hadn't really done a great act of violence yet?  As I said he's manipulative, and likely that the mental health professionals swallowed everything he told them even though it's very unlikely that he is going to follow through with this and his psychosis builds on itself until it's too much to even bear.  The living arrangement that he'd be returning back to is with another violent psychotic person, who has said that he is going to shoot my brother if he sees him again, and he still has my brother's stuff even though he's officially filed an eviction notice with the state of Athens.  I fear that Athens is going to let him go because they buy that it's just an isolated incident, buy whatever he told them and would rather do nothing so they can get someone who is ""really sick"" in that bed but I'm not buying it.  Sorry if this is jumbled up, this is just a Readers Digest version and I'm just upset about this whole thing so...  TL;DR I think my brother is being affected by relationships and the environment of Athens, including the police and they want to just let him go but I think he has a serious mental health issue and he could turn violent.  How do I go about getting him out of Athens, with state help preferably, and into a care facility he needs?  He also has no insurance and my parents are unwilling to help pay.."	Yes
705	"Setting: I live with my parents, over 18years old. My sister and her husband drop their 2 kids off at my parents' house @ 6:30AM on certain days of the week for my parents to watch them while my sister and her husband go to work. It is known by many family members that her husband has anger problems, he has been on lithium because he is bipolar, and he takes Vyvanse for ADHD.   History: Last year he choked me out over a slice pizza in front of his kids with 2 witnesses (both my siblings) present prior to this event. No police report was filed.  I had a copy a my sister's house key because I was staying at their house a few times last year. Her husband decided to rudely wake me up and take the key off my key ring.   Her husband wanted their house key because I used it to get MY charger from their house that my sister had been reluctantly wanting to bring to me for weeks. So because I grabbed MY charger they start making threats that they will call the cops claiming I steal things from them (totally incorrect) I only took MY charger. So when her husband tells me to bring them their key I say, ""if you're going to treat me like a convict you can go and get new locks for all I care! I'm not going out of my way to bring you anything!"" Then on the phone, he threatens to beat me up the next time he sees me.  As her husband takes my keys and  leaves my room shouting you are not welcome at our house! I literally had been woken up by this and I was naked on my bed so I get up to shut the door so I can dress myself. He then throws his arm threw the door shouting which one of these keys are mine! I'm just trying to close my door and get dressed. Then he started hitting me because I shut the door on his arm, he starts beating my head and I fall to the ground. My mirror breaks right above me and shatters all over my legs. He hit me on the right side of my face because I fell on my left side. There were 10-15 punches to my head while I was on the ground. He put me in a choke hold and I almost pass out as I try to get him off me. Any attack I made was based out of self defense. His children were on the other side of him and eventually the door swings open and both children are watching him throw a barrage of punches at me.  After everything we call the police and I go to the hospital. I have 3 hematomas with huge amounts of swelling but no hemorrhages or broken bones.  I'm pressing charges for assault and battery and getting a restraining order. Please give me any advice to help me ensure that this does not happen to anyone in my family especially the kids. The kids are already starting to show signs of violence. They hit and kick people especially their mother 100s of times a day."	Yes
706	I apologize if this isn't the right forum. I'm seeking guidance on documenting the birth father for my 11 month old daughter. He's married and I agreed to protect his identity. While we haven't done the swab, there is no doubt of his paternity.   Can I add his name to her birth certificate now? I'm in Georgia if that makes a difference.	Yes
707	My son is currently in an inpatient psych unit. He may be discharged within the next couple of days because his insurance doesn't think he needs that level of care. His psychiatrist disagrees, but insurance has the final word. It has been mentioned to me that his father and I could say we aren't taking him home because we couldn't provide the care he needs and then the state would step in. This is called a 51A I'm told.   I have no desire to do this and will only do this if we feel he will hurt himself or others once he is home. This is one of the reasons he is inpatient at the moment. He is absolutely no better today then when he went in there 2 weeks ago.   Anyone have information on what happens if we do this? How do we get control back of our son? Who would make his medical decisions? Would we be able to see him?	Yes
708	I am getting divorced and have a 18month old son. I have moved out of the house because Wife has made false accusations against me in the past and I do not feel safe at home.  My Mediation for Temporary Hearings is coming up. My lawyer (a expensive one) told me straight that if we do not get agreement at mediation, the judge will just give me a Standard Possession Order at the Temporary Hearing.  I am sure my wife knows this so she will offer me nothing more than the Standard Possession Order at all.  My goal for this custody battle is to get 50% of my son's time. Question is - should I settle at the Mediation for time equivalent to the Standard Possession order or go to Court for the Temporary hearing and get teh Standard Possession order (SPO) there?  The reason I ask this is because - It seems that if I voluntarily ACCEPT an offer equivalent to the SPO, I will probably not get anything more later. If I do not accept, it will be on record that I did not accept and I can continue to fight for more.  Is my reasoning right here?	Yes
709	So.    My ex was arrested for child porn and i am divorcing him.  He is now filing motion after motion to delay not only his trial, but our divorce.    I can't get legal aid because of the circumstances, and don't have the money to get a lawyer.  I know Florida tends to have the spouse who has custody stay withibk 50 miles of the other parent, but I need to get out   Any ideas, info, advice....  Would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
710	"Hey!  My mom and dad seperated legally back in November of 2016 and my mom was awarded spousal support checks from my dad's income. My dad is salary and gets a constant amount every two weeks. My mom's spousal support checks from my dad's workplace have varied in amount by $100 to $200 each check, and that's when they show up. Currently it has been almost 2 weeks since my dad's last payday and no check has arrived. This isn't unusual and has been on going since the checks started coming. We tried to get direct deposit but his workplace refused and will only mail out a check when they remember to.   Now my parents agreed outside of court to some things, such as my dad continuing to pay the mortgage on the house, while my mom has taken it on to pay pretty much everything else. The checks coming late puts a massive amount of strain on her when trying to pay bills and maintain things around the house. Her divorce lawyer (original plan was full divorce) has been completely unhelpful and extremely expensive to do minor tasks. When the checks being late or coming in different amounts was brought up they sent a letter which cost way to much to do nothing. This was back in March. So my question is, what can be done here? My dad has gone in to HR at work to inquire about missing checks which they've claimed ""were sent out weeks ago"" only to show up next day via priority mail and they won't really tell him anything either way.   So is there anyway to get these checks in on set dates or maybe verify they are abiding by a court order? I know one other thing is my dad works for an Indian casino and there seems to be some odd understandings regarding their abiding by said court order, so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
711	I have court ordered supervised visitation with my daughter with mom being custodial parent.   My visitation is Saturdays, however, mom called visitation monitor Friday that we can't meet because she was home in South Carolina for a funeral. I received a call from the visitation monitor Saturday afternoon that mom and daughter had not yet left for South Carolina.   Can I request proof that she is going to a funeral or a validation of an airline ticket. Its just odd moms story has changed three times.	Yes
712	"Hi everyone, posting this to get some info about a situation in California.  Thank you in advance for your advice and help!      This is a question about custody over a kid.  I read some links (pasted at the end of my post) in an attempt to answer my question, but I'm hoping to get more info and perspectives here.      Will try and keep things simple in bullet form.  Here is some background:      * Anna and Bob have a daughter Sally (Sally is now 8 years old)      * Anna and Bob were never married, they simply lived together.  Bob is legally not the dad, but is the biological father (Sally has no legal father)       * When Sally was still an infant, Anna left Bob due to emotional abuse (not physical as far as I know) and general unhappiness, and has been raising Sally as a single mom for the last 6+ years (while living with Anna's parents)      * Anna and Bob are on civil, if not amicable, terms.  Bob usually takes Sally out for a day/afternoon once a week.  Sometimes Sally will stay with dad a few days at a time, when mom has to travel      * Anna is single, Bob is now dating and living with a woman Candy who has kids from an prior marriage and when he takes Sally, it is almost always with Candy or to her/their home    * Bob has never paid any kind of child support, whether documented or undocumented.  Bob (currently) has no legal rights or access to Sally, everything is worked out between Anna and Bob on a personal level.  Anna wants Sally to have a dad, so she wants to keep Bob in Sally's life, even though she does not care for Bob at all      Now for recent events:      * Bob's girlfriend Candy recently met Anna, and started interacting with (borderline harassing) Anna (over text and call), and long story short, as a result of those conversations, Anna fears that Candy may be a bad influence on Sally, or may even be trying to poison Sally against her.      * Anna asked Bob to see Sally alone, or at least not let Sally see / interact with Candy.  Need to emphasize that Anna is not doing this to spite or make life difficult for Bob (and certainly not to get child support).  It is out of genuine concern.      * Bob agreed to do so verbally and over text, but Anna has since discovered that Bob is still taking Sally to Candy's or going out with Candy together, just as before      Questions:      * Does Anna have a (legal) right to request Bob not have Sally see Candy?  Would this be a tenable and legal request?      * What are some ways this could play out from a legal perspective if a custody battle ensues?      To elaborate more on why Anna does not want Candy interacting with Sally--there is no apparent threat or evidence of physical harm / danger.  It's simply that Candy is a drama-filled, selfish, and manipulative person so Anna would rather not have her daughter influenced by Candy.  To be honest, there is probably little tangible evidence that ""proves"" Candy would be a bad influence (not even sure how that works legally), but that's just how Anna feels as a mom.  Bob is not necessarily a deceitful or bad person, but is extremely simple-minded, and likely being controlled by Candy, so Anna cannot rely on Bob to shield Sally from potentially bad influence, or even to keep his word about when and how he sees Sally.      I read the info in these two links in an attempt to answer my question      * https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-child-custody-and-visitation-2997637      * http://www.livestrong.com/article/140913-what-rights-do-fathers-have-if-they-are-not-birth-record/       Based on that, I think Bob will have to establish paternity, at which point he can enter a custody battle with Anna.  What are some ways a judge may rule in this case, with all of the factors above?  Any chance for supervised visitation only, or unsupervised, but specifically no contact with Candy?  I am aware that Anna may appear as a jealous mom in court with such a request, but that is not the case.  She was initially happy that Sally could have some semblance of a ""family life,"" but has since discovered that Candy would not be a good ""second mom,"" so I'm just trying to get a read on the situation from the experts here.    Thank you for reading!  Again, any additional help or advice would be greatly appreciated!  Please let me know if more info is needed."	Yes
713	Mom and i recently found out my father (divored) has been molesting my sisters but they hid it for years because they didnt want to lose their dad. We tried to report him but they sent cops and cps to our mom trying to charge her for it  because there's no proof against him. Also, my sisters said they found child porn on his phone but they didnt mention it to cops because they were telling them theyll go to a foster home.  How can we report him for that instead? My sisters dont see him no more	Yes
714	"So my Great-Aunt(We'll call her Mary) is in her 80's now. She has wrecked two cars within the past year, and recently purchased a third one. Fortunately, she recently fractured her pelvis(I know, it sounds weird to say ""fortunately"" in this context), so she's not currently able to drive. Her younger sister(20 year difference) has offered to bring my Great-Aunt Mary to live with her in another state, but she would have to sell her own house so my other Great-Aunt could build her a small guest wing. Great-Aunt Mary can hardly see anymore, and is constantly repeating everything as if she didn't literally tell us the same thing five minutes ago. Nobody really knows what to do at this point. Great-Aunt Mary has no husband or children. We've offered to drive her to places, so she doesn't have to drive anymore, but she doesn't want to give up her freedom. She does her own yard work, which is how she broke her pelvis. She clearly can't really do all the things that she thinks she can, and we're just not very sure about how to proceed. None of us have ever had to deal with this before. We almost got Great-Aunt Mary to live with her sister last year, but she backed out at the last moment. Her money is going to run out at some point, as she got a reverse mortgage a couple of years ago, so we do need to get her house sold if we want to move her to her sister's house. I know part of it is that she's stubborn, but she's never lived anywhere other than this area as well.   What should we be trying to do? Is there anything that we can do? My mom seems to think that we can't really do much, since we aren't her children or grandchildren."	Yes
715	"I'm looking for advice from people who maintain totally separate finances or are real estate experts. My partner and I got married mostly because we wanted the legal protections marriage gave us and we planned to buy a house. From my past experience with my ex, I knew that buying while married has significant advantages, especially when you both make a lower salary. However, over the course of my current relationship I have ended up out-earning him, and I now make in the low 6 figures while he is barely middle class. Which would be totally fine, except for when it comes to the house. We want to continue keeping our finances totally separate, and with the house we would ideally both be paying equally into it and into house maintenance, taxes, etc, but that can't happen now due to the fact that any house/condo in our area is going to be too much for him to pay half of either the downpayment or the mortgage. The ""solution"" seems to be I just pay more for everything, but we are both feeling very uncomfortable about this. It breaks up the plan of keeping finances separate and if we break up, he walks away with 50%. Neither of us think this is ok. The reality is he can pay about 35% of the house down payment and mortgage. Has anyone who had separate finances dealt with this situation before? In an ideal situation we would be single and my partner would be renting from me and I would write my will up so he got the house if anything happened to me, but we are married now. How would you write up a contract designating that he gets a percent of the house and how do you figure out what that percent is? Are there any emotional things we should think about? We're considering getting a divorce to be able to do this but I would like to know what my options are."	Yes
716	Married 14 years with two kids 10 and 12. Weve not gotten along for a few years now, i will save the details for another post.  She has also been withholding sex from me for almost two years now for grudges she holds against me. Shes a stay home mom and i just dont feel she is worth providing for anymore.	Yes
717	Basically, I'll make this pretty concise and simple. I had a child that CPS was involved with during and after the birth due to a terrible decision of mine and a positive drug test. My aunt now has temporary custody. I have passed every drug test, I've complied with all court orders, and I'm on the way to getting my son back. However, the CPS workers involved have, behind closed doors, openly ridiculed me, accused me of altering drug tests but refusing to send them to a lab, and generally been very openly judgmental and difficult to get along with. So, my question is, WHO can I turn to as an advocate for my rights and complaints? The GAL? The CPS case worker's supervisor? A human rights advocate? Can I request a court-appointed attorney? Perhaps a change of venue to another county? Can my case worker be remanded due to personal bias? I've tried to research this information on my own, but only found information regarding proceedings and my rights, but not who I can contact as my advocate in the matter. Thank you to any and all who can point me in the right direction. Again, I live in Virginia.	Yes
718	My SIL just got divorced in January. Both vehicles they drove were her ex husbands and only in her ex husbands name. In the divorce settlement it was stated that when their house sells she will give him an agreed upon amount to maintain ownership of the vehicle. 8 months later and still the house hasn't sold but now the registration is expiring along with insurance. She can't register or insure the vehicle because he won't sign it over. He is saying he will repossess the car if she doesn't hand over the money owed even though the house hasn't sold. Is there anything she can do?	Yes
719	"Here's the original post:  ""I just found out that my ex never filed the paperwork I gave him IN NOVEMBER because he ""couldn't afford"" the $200 fee. Other than the fact that I'm still legally married to this fucking loser, I can't get financial aid for spring and summer because they want proof of a divorce that never actually happened. I'm fucking irate. This is just a testiment to how immature and selfish he is. I was actually doing him a favor by making him pay the $200 because he originally owed me $450, but I said I'd forget about it if he paid for the divorce. Now, as a student, he expects ME to pay for it, even though he works full-time and is just irresponsible with his money. I hope his girlfriend sees all this and has second thoughts.""   I'm coming up on my deadline and have no idea what to do. I already missed out on an education when I married him and I don't want to have to work low-wage jobs forever just because my ex is a fucking idiot."	Yes
720	My father has alcohol induced dementia (at least we think). I am 23 he is 61. He was being watched and taken to doctors by his siblings but they want nothing to do with him anymore. He is currently living in the northeast, I live in Virginia, but I think his legal state of residence in California. I think he said a neurologist said he didn't have dementia and a psychologist said he did but he is unreliable. He is incoherent the majority of the time and absolutely should not be driving and probably should not be living alone. He likes to jet around the country to live in all these different places with girlfriends or family and doesn't listen to anyone.   How do I get power of attorney for his legal stuff (he's been divorced from my mom 15 years but they still clown a house and she wants him to sign it over but he doesn't even understand what she wants). I also want to be in charge of him medically in case I want to put him in assisted living or get his license revoked. I'm very confused by what I have read online. Does anyone have basic steps I will need to take? And is it ever possible to force someone into assisted living?	Yes
721	My father over the past couple years (parents divorced 4 years ago) has been alright, if not hard to deal with. But lately, whenever I forget to do something he will always yell at me and harass me, calling me another lazy millennial and saying that my mom is raising me to be a pussy. At the time of the divorce, my mom was living alone and had a low wage job. She is now in a slightly higher paying job and is married, making her much more capable of sustaining a family now. She has decided to take my dad to court and he has already been served the papers with the new custody plan, but I'm just not quite sure if the change in her financial situation on top of my not wanting to live with my dad is enough, and am mostly looking for confirmation.	Yes
722	"So hes 18 (6ft) and about to be 19, he already has a pending case for hit and run in process crashing his car misdemeanor. Owes me 115$ has parking tickets, no license, drug addict, dumb af, using gov college money on stupid shit, thinks hes the shit,doesnt pay rent, hasnt learned from his recent crime, says we deserved it.. He said especially ""Even the 14 yr old little sister of mine""  Im 17(5'7) barley..i first got a job(sad)...

We gave him the ride to his work he was bitching about shortly after to get him away(he crashed his car bc he ran..lazy for bus) doesnt pay.  Acts like he cant be charged for hitting a minor(afterwards)   We dont want him back....."	Yes
723	I'm a Canadian-American dual citizen. Born in Ontario, spent most of my life between Montreal and New Orleans. I've always considered my stepdad's last name to be my own, even if he never legally adopted me. I would like to finally change my name legally to his last name, and switch out my middle name, but I'm confused as to where I'd have to go. Back to Ontario? Montreal/New Orleans? or could I even do it here in San Diego (my current location)?	Yes
724	"Thank you in advance for your help and time it means the world to me.   I'd like to add that I currently have an attorney and I'm seeking for further assistance in enlightening me on what can be done and what I should ask from my attorney to do that may help us in the case.  I opened a case with the attorney general in regards to my ex girlfriend having no existence in co-parenting with me. I'd tried numerous times to make communication with her and to meet and discus about our child to no avail. In addition that request included extended visitation so that I can bond more with my son. I requested as well telecommunication to be enforced so that I can be in touch with my son as my ex had prohibited from me and my son.   I was granted the rights to communicate with my son electronically daily, and the judge set temporary orders which included the rights to use a third party app called ""TalkingParents"" which would help me with co-parenting with my ex. Extended visitation rights are pending until our next court which my attorney believes should be granted.   However and this is my problems. The day after our court and being awarded the following things mentioned I texted her if she could download the application and provide me with her code so that we can link our devices to converse if the need would arise. In which she neglected again and she states she never received any paper work saying she needed to do that. In which I'm thinking to myself well WTF the judge literally told you in front of your face that she needed to do that and they were part of the temporary orders. I just stayed silent and I'm fixing to go to my attorney to see what he says about that. However what can I do about this? It's costing me money to take her to court to co-partent with me and if she's not going to do it I'm just throwing my money away. Can I ask for attorney fees back? or what options can I do to put some heat on her.   Again community thank you and although I am aware that its best to communicate with my attorney I find he often asks me well what you want to do. And I'm here like well what can I do? Any help as to what to ask from my attorney is much appreciated guys. God Bless.  Location Texas"	Yes
725	"Im being asked to sign a custody agreement. Im being told that I can bring this matter back to the court in a year. However, in big bold letters and a lager font than the rest of the document it reads ""THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO REVOCATION"" under that it says As part of the consideration herein, tge parties acknowledge that this agreement is binding and not subject to revocation.   My ex whom im having a hard time trusting said that was put in for me, so visitation can never be withheld.  can someone please help me understand if i sign this agreement, would I be able to change it in 12 mos?"	Yes
726	This is for a name change, the hearing is at 9:20 AM so not really time to run all over the city (and to a county 2.5 hours away). I planned to mail all the info to MIL who still lives in the far county and she can do the searches there, while I'm doing my searches in my county, we meet up over the weekend to trade off papers and bam, done. It sounds so stupid but this process has been so stupid that I'm just being careful.	Yes
727	This question is for Virginia but could apply to every other state in general terms. Tomorrow's the day where parties go to court and the final divorce decree is issued. The ex-husband's attorney has e-mailed over a list of objections to the decree (no doubt in an effort to try and drag this out further than the 2-3 years its already gone on). Despite the fact that the judge issued a scathing ruling finding in favor of the ex-wife (rejecting spousal support outright, requiring attorneys fees for the wife and payment of back taxes). Generally speaking, without new evidence (they have none) what is the likelihood judges go back on their initial rulings? This has dragged on too long. And in addition, once the final divorce decree is issued it doesn't matter if one side refuses to sign it or not correct?	Yes
728	My ex-wife filed for divorce last year, and at the time I felt like the marriage could still work and she was just giving up way too easily on something in which we'd both invested 15 years of our lives. Because mentally I was still in salvage mode (and because we weren't well off financially despite my making a really good income), we went the mediation route. During mediation, we put together a spreadsheet listing every asset and debt, which included the house, the mortgage, all property therein, the credit cards, the cars... everything. When all was said and done and divvied out to each party, the only thing left to divide was my 401k. It just so happened that, to make the property division equal on both sides, we split the balance at the time 50/50.  Fast forward a month, and we're down to the wire. I've already paid a lawyer to review the documents, and my ex-wife and I had gone back and forth a couple times. At the last minute, she has the mediator slip in the following clauses in the PROPERTY AND DEBTS portion of the decree:  Petitioner (that's her) will received $X,XXX for equity in the marital home payable upon refinance or sale of home by Respondent (my dumb ass).  Further down in the LIABILITY OF OTHER PARTY/DEFAULT section, this verbiage appears:  The home mortgage note shall be Assumed by Respondent. Application for Assumption shall occur within thirty (30) days of this Decree being entered. Respondent shall obtain release from mortgage lender releasing Petitioner from mortgage note. If and when Respondent refinance or sells marital home, Respondent shall pay Petitioner $X,XXX for her respective share of equity in the marital home. The payment must be made within forty-eight (48) hours of closing of sale or refinance and must be paid by certified funds or EFT.  At the time I was sick of the back and forth, sick of paying out the wazoo for seemingly arbitrary changes, and still in the mindset of not wanting any of this to be happening, yet being dragged along anyway kicking and screaming. I didn't think anything of it, I didn't pay an attorney to review the documents again, and the mediator seemed to think everything was rainbows and unicorns, so I went along with it.  Fast forward to present day. I'm looking at everything that happened with the property division, and I'm realizing that, if my understanding is correct, she has already received her share of equity by virtue of how the property division was calculated. What I want to know is, am I interpreting this correctly? If so, I want to move forward with getting that portion of the decree nullified, written off, or whatever. Thanks in advance!	Yes
729	[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ltnlk/alms_child_endangerment_case_trying_to_obtain/)  We contacted a MS lawyer and CPS. The lawyer basically said that unless both parents agree to sign over custody, that it would be a long drawn-out battle, and we still probably wouldn't be able to get custody unless we could prove both parents were unfit. We contacted the father and offered to take over custody if he needs us to, but we will support him regardless. He was appreciative, but wants to do it on his own. The b/f who did all this has been arrested, and charges are pending against the mother. CPS knows about the issues with the father and is keeping a very close eye on his actions for the next 30 days. The CPS agent I talked to first is keeping close contact with us in case things go south with the father. We're just glad the child is doing much better and the people who abused him have been arrested.	Yes
730	A few years ago after my mother's divorce she found a boyfriend, things started out well enough but once he moved in it went over the edge. He physically abused myself, and emotionally and mentally everyone else in the household (Mother, Sister and I). They have since separated and gone their different ways. After the breakup however new details came to light as to his past. Apparently he had innapropiate contact with his children and with other children. This came to us as he had left an Ipod/IPhone when he moved out where he recorded conversations with a counselor at his children's school and a psychologist as he went through his divorce. He currently works as girls soccer coach at a middle school in Durham NC. Both my mother and I fear what he can do as he is a master manipulator. I want to bring this to light for his employer, but I want to get my ducks in a row, by finding the names of his children or ex-wife in Georgia. How would I go about finding this information? I know divorce records are publicly available but as I live across the country in Washington State I don't know if I'll be able to access them. Any advice is appreciated and I apologize for the text wall and any mistakes I may have made wether it be formatting or posting guidelines.	Yes
731	I am a Korean American and my wife is a Russian citizen. We have a lawyer who filed all the paper work for us. But we are assuming she bailed on us after putting our paperwork through because she is not replying to any of our messages and phone calls.   We received a date for an interview with UCIS at the end of this month; we also agreed to pay her 500 dollars to come with us to the interview. Could we pay another lawyer to come with us even though another lawyer filled out the paperwork? Do we even need one? If so, how can we determine if we found a good lawyer? How can we determine if the price they ask for is fair?  Just to add to the background information. She overstayed her student visa date by a few years and planned on moving back to Russia in the future. We fell in love/dated for one year and I proposed to her. We both have pretty bad social anxiety so we decided to married in the probate court instead of having a traditional ceromony. Our finances are intertwined and we also have a general outline of a plan for our future together. Due to my low income my mother cosigned on our UCIS paprwork and occasionally helps us financally.   Thank you for your help  - hun and irina	Yes
732	Hey all- any advice appreciated.  My ex and I are getting divorced and we have kids. We agree on everything, have already split a bunch of stuff. We are still friends despite the decision to divorce.   I am working through the paperwork myself, but some of it seems like ridiculous red tape given our situation like the mediation for example.   Does anyone know if there is a way around any of that?  Also, the stipulation of assets and liabilities form is a tad confusing because stuff is abbreviated and I don't understand the agreed value and amounts portion. I might just be brain fried at this point.	Yes
733	Today my wife and I had a hearing regarding my step daughter. The court commissioner said we needed to research the afcc family court review green book. She didn't provide much more detail beyond that. Would anyone know what she is referring to?	Yes
734	"please excuse the ""my ex"" and ""child"" references, i'm just not trying to give too much away.    where can i find (if at all) in the Florida state statutes a reference to the type of health insurance required to be maintained on a child and also the statute  that references the amount of back payment is required to pay back child support?  if my ex quits their job and goes to one making less than the one that the current child support order is based on do they have to pay less child support?  a little back story: my ex got awarded 60% time sharing, we both got 50/50 parental decision making with my ex getting final say. my ex is also required to to maintain health insurance on our child.   i am currently paying my share of child support which includes my share of daycare and health insurance. our child no longer go to daycare and i just recently found out my ex quit their job and lost health care coverage for our child. my ex did not notify me that our child did not have coverage anymore within 60 days so i am not able to get our child coverage through the market until the first of the year.   my employer has open enrollment right now and will have it again at the first of the year (they are changing the dates coverage goes through) but to insure our child it will be an addl. $125 a week. my ex doesn't want to pay this.   i need to go back to court to get the child support changed anyways since our child doesn't go to daycare anymore so i'm going to file a motion as well to ask the judge to order me to be the one responsible for our childs medical insurance. right now my ex does have our child insured with Christian Health Ministries but from what i am reading there is a lot of things that aren't covered and it seems like we are left open to huge financial responsibility.   i'm wondering what the chances are that i get awarded the responsibility for that. also would my ex be required to pay child support based on her ability to have a better job with  more income?      thank you in advance for any help."	Yes
735	"This is in Nevada, Clark county.   I am helping pay for a relative's divorce. It is not going smoothly, but I don't need to get into the relationship part of it here. What I'm concerned about is that I am not being told the truth about the legal proceedings, court dates, etc. I would like to verify a few things without relying on the word of this relative.  For instance, this relative has said he has appeared in court a number of times due to the soon-to-be-ex ""filing things against him"" and ""dragging him into court"". So there should be a record of that somewhere, right? Can I look up that kind of thing online?  There have definitely been custody hearings for their minor children. Are records of those publicly available?  Their court date for the divorce hearing has supposedly been postponed several times and is now allegedly scheduled for October. Again, is there a way I can verify this without going through my relative (or his lawyer)?  You may have discerned by now that I am not happy paying for this relative's divorce, and you would be correct. There are lots of relationship issues going on in the background and perhaps I will make another post to discuss those. This post is just to learn how I can get more information to verify if I am being told the truth or not about what is going on."	Yes
736	I'm  here because I'm not sure if I should pay for a lawyer as of yet.  My wife and I are separated and we have a 3 year child  together. She is Polish and My daughter and I are American born.  I will just get the point of my situation and not get into too much back story. So my wife told me that she was going to Poland to visit her family for two week which I never objected to and I knew the date of her departure and everything seemed fine, I even had a chance to say bye to my daughter at the airport over the phone.  My wife promised that she will call me when she reach there but something seemed unusual,  she kept insisting that she just going to see her family and I just said fine and she just hung up; I found this strange that she was trying convince me of her intentions. At work later that day , I was bother by her last comments when then I got a call from my best friend, I explain to him my situation  and he ask me if I sign a child travel consent form ? I ask him what consent form ? He ask me if my  wife told me that she can't board a plane or leave the US with my daughter without my written consent? I wasn't aware of this and told him that I didn't sign anything.   My friend works for a major Airlines and he told that he will call me back, when he called back he told that he talked to his coworkers and that I should report her for kidnapping of a minor. After seeing this form online and realizing that she forge my signature , I was so mad but  I didn't want to report her yet , if i did she will be arrested and my daughter will be taken away by whatever legal system for whatever length of time. Until now , my wife haven't called or message me since she left for Poland over a week ago . My friend and I think it is best that I wait but it driving my crazy. If there are Lawyers or legal experts  here can I  please get some legal advice on international laws on child abduction and what advantages are in my favor ? Please help! 😔	Yes
737	Earlier this year, my ex husband stole money from me ($600 to be exact). We were still going through the divorce when he took the money. We ended up going to mediation for the divorce, and the money he stole was put in the mediation papers. Those papers later went into the judgement of divorce. The divorce was finalized a month ago, so now he legally has to pay me back. The agreement in the papers was for him to pay me back within 90 days of the date of mediation, which was back in April. He is refusing to pay. What should I do? Should I go through small claims?	Yes
738	I live in Virginia. I pay child support, I dont make a lot given I am still in college. My ex is going to college too and needs day care for the kid. She said my child support will most likely go up. If I am already paying child support at a set amount relative to my income, is it really going to go up and how much. I am trying to talk with her about going together and finding a nice place we both agree on since i might be paying for it, I have a right in where he goes right? Speaking of rights, I havent been to court yet to establish my time with him, I work all the time and go to school and can see him only when I am free. It works, but should I go to court and get it all down for the record? I am 24 she is 25 and still lives at home with the kid her 28yo brother and her mom, I live on my own with roommates. What is best for the kid is for her to watch him, but once I graduate and get a job, I want to get 50/50 so I don't have to worry about being screwed in child support. What is my best option, I can provide further details if needed. Thanks &lt;3	Yes
739	I've filed for uncontested divorce/irreconcilable differences and I am scheduled for my first case management conference later in August. I have been wanting to leave the marital home but my lawyer says I can not leave unless my ex-spouse (who still lives with me because I can not leave) signs a consent order. I am trying to put the house for sale but my ex-spouse refuses (house is titled in:both of our names). I don't know what to follow anymore and feel my lawyer is trying to get money from me.	Yes
740	Today has not been a good day.   For the last two years I've been dating a mentally unstable girl, and for the past couple days she for reasons unknown to me ghosted me and refused to talk to me. So today I went over to talk to her and see what was up,  and she looked me in the eye while laughing and telling me that last night she had sex with someone and cheated on me.  I was obviously angry as all hell, I punched the bed and squeezed her arm in anger (she was sitting in my arms). I calmly asked who it was with, she rolled her eyes saying she wont say. I asked for my things back and left. I knew my best bet would be to just block her, not post anything and be the bigger person.  She's now posting things saying I'm abusive and beat her when I never would and may report me to the cops.   I'm really scared, I'm 18, about to go to college and I'm terrified my life could get fucked over for something I never did.	Yes
741	In 2012 my mother had went to the hospital due to her lymph nodes under her arms being swollen. Two years later she calls me to say she has Hodgkin's lymphoma. She lives 3 states away, is a drug addict, her exact location is unknown, and probably hasn't gotten proper treatment. The number she had is disconnected, my brother has sent her packages and pictures without any reply. My brother and I haven't heard from her since 2015. It wasn't unusual to go without hearing from her for a few months, but it's been two years. I'm wondering if there is any way to find out if she has passed.	Yes
742	I've been divorced for 10 years with two children and have been paying my ex-wife child support based on my 2007 salary of 60k. She never worked during our seven years of marriage so I pay her a reasonable amount, I believe it was 25% to 30% of my gross salary. In that time she has remarried and though that is specifically irrelevant to the circumstances, she has had two children with her current husband which have led me to take a greater role in the parenting of our two children. Over the past five years I've had the children residing in my town four days per week and going to school in my district. My ex-wife lives about 20 miles away and has them at her house about three days per week. She now is seeking an adjustment in child support due to cost of living increases. I think this would be fair if not for the fact that I have taken on greater responsibility as a parent. Though she may not agree with this assertion. I also do all the day to day driving of my teens relative to school functions and social engagement. Basically I always have to be around. Luckily I have tremendous flexibility at work.   If she seeks an adjustment, would the amount increase proportional to not only the cost of living, but also my current much higher salary of 150k? Based on my more significant role in my childrens' lives, would it be worth contesting the increase or would this be futile and not worth the legal fees?	Yes
743	My fiance already pays child support to his ex-wife for their 2 kids. If we get married, can she come after my income? (She lives in KY, we live in GA, and their current agreement was filed in FL).	Yes
744	My boyfriend and I are starting to plan our engagement (I know...really romantic but alas that's how it is) and we have both agreed to sign a prenuptial mainly for eliminating any alimony requirements for either of us.   We live in Sweden, will have the ceremony in the US and for the time being plan on living in Sweden long term. My question is do we need to draw up a prenup for each country? and then file it in my state (NC) and Sweden? Or will NC even accept it as I'm no longer a resident there.   What we're also curious about are the implications the US could place on him as a non-resident married to me, a US citizen in the case of divorce. Alimony isn't easy to get in Sweden whereas the US seems to be easier. So for both our sakes we've decided on this as a just in case.   Obviously I have a lot more research to do but any direction would be helpful.	Yes
745	It is stated in our custody order that my step mom is a suitable child care provider and costs are to be split based off our income and paid directly to her per month. Since May, my ex has stopped paying her his portion. I've already wasted a lot of money with a lawyer trying to get him to comply with other things, so I'm hoping to avoid more attorney fees if at all possible. Can anyone please help me with this matter?	Yes
746	"My son was born in July 2013, the mother and i split up after a year due to me putting my kid first and her putting herself first. We both lived in a small south eastern town so driving a few blocks to exchange him wasn't all that hard.   At first we had an ""every other day"" he stays with you, then me, then you ectect. That worked out fine for us, but was a hassle for him i would assume. Constant change of environment and what not. Then when the time came for preschool, it was ""he stays with you tuesday and thursday and me every other day of the week, then we flip flip days the next week (2 days/5 days alternating). We happily made that work.   now a short bio about her and myself. I'm a registered pharmacy tech working at the same pharmacy for the past 5 years, same community he's grown up in all his (and my) life. My mother owned a daycare so it was exceptionally nice for him to be around familiarity every day. I've never smoked and the only drink i have is once a year when the New Orleans Saints lose a playoff game. Went from the breakup to living with my mother for about a year with my son, to renting my own house for the past 3 years.   His mother on the other hand... She has been in and out of jobs for years now, due to failed drug tests or just plain getting let go, currently working a food chain. (rib crib for a month or 2 i believe) In and out of homes between her mothers, sisters, whatever current boyfriend of the month she has. Current home residence is with a sister who still lives in the same county as myself. About 60% of HER days to have my son, i end up having him because shes out partying, ""too busy"", forgets to pick him up from my house, ectect. The other times on her days she just pawns him off on some friend or family member so she can go out. (she likes to post on many social media platforms when she goes to bars and such)  Today out of the blue she hits me with, ""i'm seeking legal action, i want our son on weekdays and you can have him on weekends. He will be going to school 30 minutes away (insert town) [from his home, school, and friends] due to it being easier for me to see him. i want child support. get an attorney.""  phew..  i'm curious as to how all this will play out. what you guys' think. Should i have any concern? Besides getting an attorney, what other steps i should take? If the judge asked me what custody arrangements i would prefer, id tell him 7 days a week with me, every other weekend with her, that way i'd only have to worry a few days every 2 weeks if he was being taken care of or not. (trust me, he comes to my house not bathed, always hungry, sometimes not even clothed..just wrapped in a blanket, always has some form of new cut/bruise/gash somewhere on him)  All i want is what's best for my son, to be happy with his friends and family all here in his hometown. To follow in his fathers footsteps and make all-state striker in soccer one day. To live a happy and fulfilled life with the person who cares about him most and has been there for him every day of his life.  Not to mention kindergarten enrollment (same school he was at for preschool) is also next week, should i go ahead and enroll him?"	Yes
747	Since I was 4 and my sister was 3, we had lived with our mother after escaping our abusive father. When we were teenagers, my mom finally got our dad to start paying the child support he owed us (somewhere in the realm of $90,000). And we have received fairly regular payments since then. We even continued to receive payments after we both became adults, and my mom usually gave the money to us to help with our college expenses. My sister and I are 21 and 22 now.  In March of last year my mom died. It was devastating to my sister and I, as she was our only real family in the world. We have never even met our father. My mother left us a lot of paperwork, instructing us what to do after she died. One of the papers explains that we have the right to continue to collect child support after her death (sec. 154.013 in the Texas statutes is what she referenced).  I’ve tried to talk to our local child support office about it, but they were clueless and told me that the Waco Child support office would call us about it. They never did, so we called them but it was just never ending recorded voice prompts. I’ve had to move cities, and transfer schools all while dealing with my moms death, and it’s hard for me to find time to drive to Waco. And it’s hard for my sister to find time too, as she recently graduated from college and has started working long weeks.  I guess my question is, how should I go about collecting this child support? Should I be able to change it with the child support office or will I need an attorney? Also, since some of the child support has been used during this time, are we facing legal trouble for not changing this sooner? Would we be better off just closing the account and sacrificing that money?  I’m way out of my element with all of this.	Yes
748	My uncle (54) is a severe alcoholic, and he's had this problem for many years. A family therapist has told us not to enable his drinking, so when he checked himself out of rehab against doctor's orders, my grandfather (80's) would not go to pick him up. My uncle paid another patient who was getting discharged that day to take him to get his car, and he went straight to grandma and grandpa's house to confront them. They would not let him inside the house, so he spent the entire night drinking vodka in their front yard. In the morning my grandma had to go to a doctor's appointment. As soon as the garage door was opened, my uncle attacked grandpa, shoving him up against the wall and screaming in his face. Grandma and grandpa got in their car and fled. Uncle searched until he found the spare key and let himself into the house. He has been there ever since.  My grandparents were too scared to go home, so they went to their lake cabin in another city. Uncle refuses to leave their house and is just in there drinking and eating all their food. This has been going on for over a week now. I told my grandparents that I wanted to call an elder abuse hotline or the police to get my uncle out of their home. My grandma screamed at me that I had better not do that, and that she will just tell the cops that he is allowed to be there and that he didn't hit anyone. She says she will not ruin his life.  Obviously, this situation can not go on like this but I am at a loss what to do. Do we really have no legal recourse if grandma lies to the police?  Are there any resources for people in our position?	Yes
749	So this is about my fiancé and his two kids (7) (4). she left all three of them back in march 2015 and in the divorce decree he waived child support but she's required to pay half of everything for them. he has primary physical custody and they split custody though she very rarely comes around. back in Nov 16, they went to court to make her pay half of day care by court order, so that's all she's been paying since.  now, it's been well over two years, she never has them, never offers to pay anything and we are wondering how easy changing a divorce decree in regards to child support will be. This is VA.	Yes
750	I recently moved to Texas to be closer to my son. The agreements we had before this move (through the courts) was 50/50 legal custody and 100% physical to the mom with myself getting reasonable visitation. It was going mediocre, with the mom being flaky with available times or canceling on me last minute saying other things came up. I already have a court date in August to get formal visitation. On July 6 the mom told me she was going to Washington state to visit family and would be back July 28, today. Last night at 8 pm Washington time she texts me she might be back now August 10th. This has all been through texts and she won't return my calls. I have been unable to serve her court papers since she has been gone.  1) Is this some sort of violation of reasonable visitation or does it not matter since I do not have custody? Is it worth it to have my lawyer mention it to the judge?  2) will this get in the way of my court date since she has not been served yet? Who even knows if she will come back 8/10?  Also just me venting, she claims she works but after this I am posivite she does not have a job and is lying about that.  Thanks!	Yes
751	My mom, she's in her 60s, married a man about 6 months ago. My mom is not financially well but the man is very well off. She's super religious, they met at a church and have been in a relationship for about 5 years now. She didn't believe in being together for so long without getting married and they finally tied the knot. They're happy together though. He's treated her so well.  He has adult daughters that didn't agree with this at all. They thought my mom was after his money. She promised them several times that she wasn't but that didn't go over well. She's tried to connect with his side of the family but they never accepted her. That's been tough. She's worried that if anything happened to him, that she would just be thrown to the side and be forgotten about.  Even though they got married officially 6 months ago, they had a wedding ceremony a month ago, and he didn't seem well. He became forgetful and was physically unable to do things he was able to do before. A couple of weeks ago he was diagnosed with Alzheimers.   When the daughters found out, they wanted to send him to a home and told my mom that there was nothing she could do and she should move on. She couldn't accept that. They visited a couple of lawyers to see if she could be written into his will but it seemed like none of them wanted to be a part of this. Now it's gotten worse. For the past couple of days he has been stuck in bed, and hasn't been able to talk. She's been crying on the phone with me everyday and it's incredibly heartbreaking. She's been scared to contact his daughters because if she did, she feared that she'd be cast aside. I told her that she had to immediately, that's his family and they had to know. So she did. They're about to move him to another state (NC) where they live to be closer. They told her that if she had other things to take care of somewhere that she should go do it and leave him with them.   Does she have any protections or rights as a spouse at this moment? I read that they had to be together for at least a year before anything takes place unless he was able to change his will but things have progressed much quicker than we anticipated. Now since she's not in the will and it's been less than a year, I fear that there's nothing that can be done.   Thanks.	Yes
752	Hello, Long story short I am divorced and my ex signed papers giving me sole conservatorship of our child. He still see her regularly and we have been on good terms until recently. When we were married he was mentally and verbally abusive to me, and lately those behaviors have slowly started resurfacing. I have realized that for the past few years I have been battling terrible anxiety Bc I have still not gotten away from him.  My current husband and I have talked of moving to s new place, just two states away, where there are better schools and opportunities for my child and we can raise her in a smaller city than the one where we currently live. I believe I am within my right to do this but my ex is threatening to take me to court to get me to stay in our current city. Does he have any legal recourse to make us stay?  As I have explained to him, I am willing to tell the court he no longer has to pay child support so he cAn use the money instead to visit regularly. I would work something out where he saw her every month.  Am I legally allowed to just move away?	Yes
753	I broke up with my emotionally abusive, sometimes physically abusive ex. I found out he had been recording me with a motion activated hidden camera pointed right at the bed. (I've contacted a couple of the girls in the videos and none of them care. They were more interested in telling me how much better they were than me. Can the police not contact them because I feel like they'll undermine this case?) I wanted to go to the police when I first found them, but my ex and his family basically told me if I did, they'd go after my family(I don't know what that means, but my ex has threatened to shoot my family. I've asked his parents to take his gun away, but they haven't said anything.) This is where it gets weird. They told me how close they are to 2 former Presidents and how they'll be forced to get involved in this mess. I know they're not lying because I've seen pictures of them with a couple Presidents and politicians. Everyone in his family is a lawyer. Any advice on what I can do? How should I handle something like this?	Yes
754	My husband left for an overseas job when he found out that my daughter had AML. Because he has been overseas I couldn't serve him with divorce papers and taking care of my daughter took precedence over everything else. Sadly, things have taken a turn for the worst and now he's been blowing up my phone after four years of no contact, begging to come see her. I told him no and that I would do everything in my power to prevent him from seeing her if he tried to force a visit. Apparently he's planning to show up anyway but I don't know when.  I haven't decided whether or not I want him to see her. That's another thing I'm battling out with myself. What I want to know is if I have any right to legally stop him from seeing her if she doesn't want to see him. He hasn't contributed to her care much if at all, hasn't supported her emotionally, and if he hadn't been overseas, I would have divorced him by now. How can I best protect my daughter if she doesn't want to see him?	Yes
755	My wife recently filed charges on me and dropped them today after she realized they were felony charges. We are going through a divorce and she is now threatening to bring the charges back up if I don't agree to her terms of divorce. Can they be brought back up?	Yes
756	She also needs to get checked up at the hospital, but her mom isn't paying for any type of insurance for her even though she has the money, and shes not taking her to the hospital. My girlfriend has social security checks because of a family members death that she has been recieving since she was 12, but she can't use them because she's only 17 and they go directly to her mother's account which she spends on jewelry and food for herself instead of things like insurance etc... Theres also occasions where my girlfriend literally cannot eat because her mom won't buy her food, and her mom always tells her to get a job but won't take her anywhere to get the things required for a job. (Shes been accepted after an interview 3 times but things keep shitting up) CPS has been called multiple times but her mom fixes the issues before they get there since they apparently need a day in advance and they see that everything is okay. Is there anything we can do about this?  (We're both 17)	Yes
757	"Location: Colorado  I'm in my mid-20s. My mom was recently served with a ""Petition for Dissolution of Marriage"" document by my stepdad. I went over to talk to her about it, and she started handing me things to bring back to my place. These include legal documents for the ownership of several valuable horses that she owns ($20k+) as well as two guns that she uses for horse-mounted shooting (if it matters, they're crippled guns only capable of shooting blanks).  I have a suspicion that this was the wrong decision, but I just took the items from her and put them in my car because she was crying and I just didn't know what to do in the moment. She also tried to get me to take my half sister's passport (she's a minor), but I refused to take that.  What sort of legal risk am I at for being in possession of these items? I believe the Dissolution of Marriage document states that she's not allowed to hide assets."	Yes
758	My parents have decided to eat *Soylent* and only that, I'm of course expected to do the same. Soylent  for three meals a day, no snacks, no other food in the house. I won't even be allowed to eat school lunches, I have to take a bottle of Soylent to school and drink that instead.  Is this legal? Yeah they're technically feeding me but it's been three days and I'm miserable, I just want a sandwich or even a piece of fruit so badly. This isn't even some weird temporary diet they plan on doing indefinitely.	Yes
759	"My ex husband and I have 50/50 time sharing. In our divorce decree it states ""mother's address is to be used for school designation"". Due to my last move, she was to be zoned for one of the worst schools in the state. My ex husband was also zoned for a failing school. I talked to him in May about what we should do. I asked if his connection (a pb county sheriff) could get us a variance, he said no. I asked if she could attend his school (he's a teacher). He said it wasn't a good school. I attempted to sign up for school choice, but there were no good schools available. He resigned to send her to the bad school and basically let me know I was on my own in figuring anything further out. I wasn't okay with this and told him I was thinking about moving to a better school zone. I recently got a job offer 20 miles away making nearly twice what I was making before and four times what I made at the time of our divorce. That city is also where all the A-rated schools are (and where my daughter was born). After losing the offer on two homes to rent, I secured a home in the new area, zoned for one of the best schools in the state. In my decree it states I should notify him of the new address 30 days in advance, but that I don't need to do anything through the court if it's under 50 miles. Unfortunately, as much as I tried I was only just able to secure a place as of yesterday. I notified him immediately. My lease here ends in sept., with school starting next week. I actually paid extra to start the lease august 15th so she could start school, but I have my current place until September. Today he called me, saying I was in contempt of court for violating the decree because I made a major decision without him (what school she was attending). Since it says in my decree that my address is to be used for school designation, I thought if I moved it means it automatically is my school zone. I've offered to eat the cost of pre-care and even to pick her up on his mornings to take her to school in order to compromise and resolve this, so long as he picks her up after school, but he won't budge. I should mention that when we divorced he was living 30 miles from the marital home. He took her to a school 30 miles away without complaint. This school is much closer. He's only moved closer to me in the last two years. I want to know if he has legal standing and if I need a lawyer. Thanks in advance."	Yes
760	"Family lawyers of Reddit (or anyone that can help or advise.). I was in a relationship with a Spanish girl 5 years ago, I am in the UK, she became pregnant almost immediately or so I thought. When we went for a scan they said the she was 12 weeks pregnant but I had only known her for 9 weeks. Things soon started to fall apart between but obviously I wanted to find out if I had a child and obviously to be there for it and support it. Despite several attempts by myself and family members to get her to agree to a paternity test she flat out refused and ultimately asked me to leave her alone. A lawyer at the time said you would be surprised how often this happens and we all assumed that there was a high chance that the child isn't mine. 5 years later, this week she gets in touch with me. Saying we need to speak about our daughter. I of course reply and ask if she is now willing to consent to the paternity test, she agrees initially. I start to organize it with her between the two countries. Then she starts to flip out, saying that I will doctor the results so that it is negative (not something I would ever do I just want an answer and to be there for my child if they are mine). She then starts the familiar insults and randomness of old. ""Maybe it's better if we don't have proof."" ""She looks like you."" ""I will tell her you want nothing to do with her."" I repeatedly ask her if she will consent to the paternity test to which I get a no, a maybe, you haven't asked about her or for more photos (a route I'm trying not go down until I know and I think that she's trying to trap me emotionally) and then I ask one last time urging her to think about the child and not her pride and to drop the insults and negativity and I get no reply, it's been about 7 hours. Now yes it certainly looks like she's not sure if I'm the father, maybe knows that I'm not or has something else to hide. But ultimately I just want to know, what actions can I take, if any, as a potential father to get a paternity test agreed to or enforced. How would me being in the UK and mother and child in Spain make this more difficult? Thank you in advance for your comments and help."	Yes
761	"My soon to be ex has told me that the are the beneficiary of over 5 million dollars in a trust fund(s) that will be transferred to them one or both parents pass away. My ex told me this directly, and also told their friends about it, but in an interrogatory states ""N/A"" when asked about trusts/expected inheritances. I can't find any written record of it. We made financial decisions based on this nest egg, so of course now I am screwed.  It is possible that my ex's parents moved this money or otherwise revoked the trust during the divorce process, but assuming that they haven't, how do I figure out if this trust exists at all so I can learn more about it in discovery?  Note that I am not looking to gain access to this money, but it does come into play when it comes to equitable distribution / alimony (which my ex is requesting).  Them and their parents are of course hostile to this and will not cooperate, and also have a lot of money to fight any requests I make."	Yes
762	My grandfather is 86 years old and stubborn and pretty much what the title says. He lives in his own room in my parents house where he has his own bathroom, he doesn't drive so my dad drives him to the grocery store for groceries.   He will not go to the doctor even if there's something wrong like he has a cold or something like that. He doesn't shower and lies to my parents and says that he does. He doesn't wash his bed sheets or clothes and he doesn't throw anything away. A lot of his shirts are stained with holes.   He has a mini fridge and freezer in his room, but he stores items on a shelf when they should be refrigerated such as mayonnaise and eggs.   I know my dad doesn't want to physically make him do things, what else can they do?   Can my parents get in serious trouble for letting this continue? Is this considered elder neglect?   Thank you	Yes
763	"Apologies in advance, there's a lot going on and we've only just found out about this.  My grandmother (father's side) has slowly had her Alzheimer's get worse and worse.  Back in 2005, she was worried that she was starting to ""lose it"", and signed power of attorney over to my father in case it was actually Alzheimer's and not just her getting older.  I've checked the county clerk of courts website, and I see the document there granting power of attorney to my father.  About 3 years ago (2014-ish), my Uncle and my Aunt (and possibly other extended family) told my father that they convinced her to switch Power of Attorney over to them.    My father asked my Grandma if this was true, to which she replied yes.  Dad takes that as his cue to stay out of it from here on out.  At that point, my Aunt started living with my Grandmother.  My aunt has multiple felony drug convictions.  I would bet my house that she's been stealing from my grandmother since she moved in, but that isn't relevant to the question, sorry.    Fast forward to two weeks ago, and grandma is in really bad shape.  Almost non-responsive.  A different family member took her to see the family doctor who immediately admits her for dehydration and malnutrition.  She is now (as of late last week) in a senior care facility.  Monday of this week, another concerned family member got online and did some digging on the county clerk of courts site, and there are no records of Grandma signing Power of Attorney over to my Uncle or Aunt.  There are also no records of any Guardianship applications.  Dad realizes he's probably been lied to, purposefully by aunt and uncle (who have again almost assuredly been stealing her social security money) and almost assuredly unknowingly by my Grandmother.  My question is, had my Uncle actually filed for power of attorney, or for guardianship, would there be a record of that on the county clerk of courts website?  This was again supposedly a couple years back, not like last week where it wouldn't be updated.  Dad is now meeting with the current home, who was told not to allow him or my mother to make any decisions about Grandma by my Aunt / Uncle, to show them the 2005 documents.  They intend to move her to a better facility closer to them so that they can help.   I guess I'm just wondering if we're getting our hopes up?  Uncle and Aunt are obviously a mess, and we want to do what's best for Grandma, but we were under the impression (and that's on us for not checking) that Dad was no longer in control.  Also, if my dad still does have power of attorney, how can we get Grandma's financial information so that we can see how much they have been stealing from her, and make sure that her social security money gets used for her care?"	Yes
764	"My spouse requested a divorce nearly two years ago and has since spiraled into debilitating depression and unknown/untreated mental illness (spouse flatly refuses to get help)  The children and I currently live separately from my spouse (in the same city, within walking distance) who texts randomly asking when the children would like to come over or go to a park or for a walk. Sometimes my spouse just shows up unannounced asking if they're ""ready to go"". Usually when this happens I ask the kids if they'd like to go and usually get an enthusiastic ""no"" or a half-hearted ""meh, not really"". Sometimes if I push them just a little to spend time with their other parent, I get tears from the youngest. Their other parent doesn't do anything to harm them, spouse just doesn't engage with them at all and often simply takes them for treats then goes back home for a nap leaving them to entertain themselves.  What's my obligation to the spouse and the children as far as visitation if there's not any legal separation or divorce yet?"	Yes
765	Hello, posting from Ontario, Canada.  I am a step-parent of three years to a nine year old girl whom my wife had with her ex boyfriend. My wife and I also share a child together of two years. I have fully supported this family and the biological father has paid maybe $600 total over the entire course that I have been in a relationship with my now-wife. To give context, I make about $53k per year on average, and my wife makes about $16k. I suspect the bio father makes about $45ish.   My wife refuses to pursue legal action against the biological father to pay child support. My home expenses are roughly $3000 a month, and my family (my mother, myself, my father) have basically helped clothe, feed, and provide a home to my step child. The bio father provides no support.  Am I legally able to initiate a legal action against him for child support? All of the results I found online were post-divorce, but I am still married. Please advise, thank you!	Yes
766	I hope it won't be a battle, but I am scared. It's what has stopped me from pulling the trigger and actually breaking up. Long story short, been rough for a while, suspicious of bf, snooped and found evidence of his lying/messing around( at least on the computer) with another woman. I am ready to end it but want to make sure I am prepared.  We have a 15 mo old. He just started working a few months ago and til then I paid for most things or his mom helped him out. I handle bills, buy food, take care of baby appt. etc. he watches her during the day but whe. Something comes up, I have to figure out what to do. I have been trying to take some notes on happenings, because I heard that is a good things. I have my bank statements, and cc bills to show myself pYing and how much he contributes.  He is a good dad, so I want him in the kids life, I am just scared he will try to take her from me for more than half. Also our last fight, he told me I wou.d owe him half my tax return since it was partly due to his kid. Which I thought, bs man, I've paid for most everything I. Her life.  Anyway, any advise would be helpful of ways to prepare. I started looking up lawyers. I don't have lots of money, but if that's what I need, as he is a slick talker and has a mom with money and lawyers in the family, I'll have to find a way. Thanks for your help.	Yes
767	So, my wife (no marriage cert, but we lived &amp; function as man &amp; wife) has left, not really communicating at all.  While I adore her, and want things to work out, if she needs to leave to be happy, I can deal with that.  However, she has major medical issues (using the max FSA contribution in ~8 months each year), but if we are split, I can save ~150 a PAYCHECK by dropping her and changing to a high deduct plan, with HSA.  She has no job at current, and ~4 yrs ago when she took med leave from her last job, she didn't do the required appt's &amp;/or paperwork to continue to get paid from them. She also refused to apply for unemployment, or disability in all that time.  We also have a 5 yr old daughter, but I'm not concerned about custody today, although that will be it's own issues.  Open enrollment is typically in Oct. so I have time. But I want to be prepared.  So much more, I'm sure, but ask ?'s and I'll answer.	Yes
768	I am really out of options here.  We are not divorced so there is no type of child care plan. In order for me to see my child I had to live with either her mom or her dad.   Well one evening her dad freaks out on me and it no longer became safe for me to stay there. So I moved out. I haven't seen my son since. This goes back 8 weeks. His birthday is monday. Between my house payment and bills I virtually have no money left over to afford an attorney. I have shit credit and no way to make more. I have 450$ to my name outside of that and anyone that could help has. I called legal aid in my state and they denied my case for unspecified reasons. I am at a loss.  As a result my son is being kept from me. His grandparents will not let him talk to me because for fear that they would be denied the right to see him. This is the type of person she is. I need your help.	Yes
769	I'm wondering if anyone can point me to resources on family law with regard to mobility. My former spouse intends to move some distance away and make a mobility application, after we have been separated over a year with joint custody and equally shared time with the children (week on week off). I don't feel this move is in the best interests of the children. I've familiarized myself with Gordon v. Goertz, but I'm wondering if anyone can give me some other examples, or search terms one could use on CanLII.  Thanks.	Yes
770	I left my violent and abusive ex months ago. The system completely failed me and she ended up with physical custody because of the refrain order I got against her. Long story short the attorney for the child didn't like me. I get to see my son now, which is more than the original temp order so I've been content, in the interest of my son not being dragged through the family court system anymore.  Today I'm talking to him and he drops a toy and starts apologizing and saying please don't be mad. I told him it's okay we can fix it and I asked him if he had been getting yelled at. He said Mommy yelled at him for going down the stairs too slow and she kicked him down the stairs (6 carpeted stairs, not a huge staircase thank goodness). I told him he was good for talking to me about it and praised him for being brave. When I asked about it again he got frustrated and he WILL NOT talk about it now.   What do I do? He has to go back for 2 days tomorrow morning but I'm terrified something is going to happen again. I feel like if I went to the police then her lawyer spins that I'm drumming up bullshit. What if she snaps and something terrible happens? What can I do? I have a recording of him telling me a second time. He's only 5 he can't call 911 if she goes off on one of her rampages.	Yes
771	My dad recently inherited a piece of property when my grandfather passed away. He was married at the time and still is, but him and his wife of under a year are planning on divorcing soon. So far she is not too interested in the property but I was curious on if she would be able to grasp at it if she wanted? The property is currently in my name, and the current plan is to wait for the divorce to happen before developing the land.	Yes
772	"Not much info beyond the title. There is a history of violence in the home. He is an unrepentant alcoholic and he claims he does not remember anything that happened.   Question is: What are the next steps? I doubt he can afford a lawyer though he likely makes too much for a court appointed attorney. I know the ""right answer"" is lawyer up but I need to know what to do in the meantime. I stopped by the jail but apparently I am not allowed see him. I **will not** bail him out or put up any money for him. I'm just trying to get info to pass on to my mother. I'd let him rot if it were up to me but she's freaking out so thought I'd get some general info to calm her down.   Thanks in advance."	Yes
773	I'm 16, was adopted from fostercare about 3 years ago. It was one of the worst decisions I've ever made and I'm now looking for a way out. Anyway, absolutely any way that can sever ties between my adopted parent and make it so I can live else where. I have multiple places I could live if I wasn't legally obligated to live here. I've looked into emancipation and it doesn't look easy and/or possible. I've tried CPS (trust me it was justified) and they left I shit you not. And now I'm just looking for a way out, does anyone have advice?	Yes
774	Basically I have a friend who is determined to legally change her name every 5 - 10 years. Her reasons are not nefarious but bizarre. She has already changed her full legal name three times and intends to continue. I think, even though she's not doing it for criminal reasons, that she is opening herself up to problems down the road.  The following is a fictitious example of what kind of name change has occurred:  Lauren Miriam Brown to-&gt; Elizabeth Jadzia Tolson to-&gt; Ava Vivian Grimes	Yes
775	My boyfriend and I are planning on getting married since he has pcs orders for Hawaii. We currently live in New York. My son's father does pay child support but refuses to have anything to do with him. My daughter's father is currently in New Hampshire, doesn't pay child support, and hasn't made an effort to be in her life. I never bothered to get any kind of custody arrangement due to their lack of interest in their children. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what my best option is so neither father can come back and say I took their child away!	Yes
776	Oklahoma is the place.   So, friends of mine are dealing with their mothers death. She passed last week. They are pretty sure that their parents were not divorced but have been separated only for 20+ years.   The father(or widower) might be married to someone in another state for around the same time of the separation to now. He is also starting to try and call the shots on many things with the estate.   Anyone have any advice on what they should expect? This is confusing me to no end but I'm not a lawyer.	Yes
777	Step siblings are 16F and 15M. My brother is 11. I'll be 18 next month. Our dad married their mom 3 months ago.  Our bathroom has a changing room (which doesn't have a lock) and a bathroom (which has a lock). Since it's very small, we leave clothes in the changing room.  My brother was taking a shower today. The step-siblings decided to be funny and went into the changing room and took everything out. His clothes, towels, whatever else that was there. Told him that he should come and get them from them outside. They kept this going for two full hours until I got home and put an end to it.  My brother was shaking when I brought him his clothes. He was very cold too as you'd expect. He's been crying and begging them but they didn't stop. That night we told the parents and they laughed it off. Said that kids play pranks on each other and it's totally fine.  I later talked to my dad and he told me that my brother needs to grow a pair and learn to protect himself. Not helpful at all. Today, the 16F step-sibling told my brother that I won't always be around to protect him and this was just the beginning.  I'm thinking of what the best way is to protect my brother here. The step-siblings clearly think it's fun to make him miserable and parents are not being helpful at all. Should I contact CPS? Police? Anyone? Any other suggestions?	Yes
778	Trying to make this short and sweet. My husband has two sons from a previous relationship (not marriage). The older one lives with us and the younger one lives with their mom. This was her choice. Before my husband and I got together she decided she no longer wanted the older boy to live with her, she gave no reason why. My husband told her that he wanted both but she would only give him the older boy.  She makes no effort to visit with the older boy. She'll call him and tell him how much she loves and misses him and promise that he can come spend the night at her house soon, which never happens. She just gets his hopes up then crushes him. I really want to adopt him, but I don't know how to do that. If his mom has to sign some sort of document, it won't happen. She cares about her image too much. She's always posting pictures of him on facebook (pictures that my husband and I take, she takes them from our profile) and saying how much she loves him. She just does it so her facebook friends will praise her on what a good mom she is. I really don't think she cares about him at all.   My husband and I regularly pick up the younger boy and he stays at our house for a few days. Whenever we go to pick up the younger boy, the mom gives the older boy a quick hug and maybe a cheap toy that breaks in an hour, and sends us on our way. Also, the younger boy is absolutely filthy every single time we pick him up. He stinks of urine and feces, and his skin and hair is always sticky. His teeth are yellow so I don't think she ever brushes them. (Side note, the older boy only has 7 teeth because she neglected to brush them and they all rotted out, and she always had him sleep with a bottle of formula). He has horrible manners, he hits and bites everyone. Her home is full of cats and dogs and the entire house just smells like urine. She lives with her boyfriend, her mom, and her two brothers. One of her brothers has cerebral palsy and no one takes care of him. He always stinks because no one bothers to change his diaper. They lock him in his room where he soils himself all day and they all ignore him. Once she called my husband in a panic because her boyfriend hit the child brutally, then later said it was nothing and he's fine and its none of my husband's business. She is still dating that same guy. My husband desperately wants to get him out of there but he doesn't know where to start, because she won't willingly give him up like she did her other son.   TL;DR: I want to adopt my older step-son but I don't know how. My husband and I want custody of my younger step-son but we don't know how we can because their mom won't willingly give him up like she did her older son.	Yes
779	Hello all. I am in Indianapolis, Indiana. My sister was recently arrested for a domestic dispute with her boyfriend. She has twin babies that are eight months old. Long story short, she has a long criminal history and the babies were placed in foster care by DCS. I have obtained kinship guardianship of both children and they are currently living with me.   The issue I am having is with my sister's father (we have different dads) and his wife. Let's call him Scott. Scott is a convicted child molestor. He is also an alcoholic who gets drunk and beats his wife. I was around 5 when he was married to my mom and I witnessed him to do the same to her. He would get drunk, they would argue, and he would beat the hell out of her. Some of the more extreme examples that I remember include him hitting her in the head with a 2x4 and her having to get stitches, busting a beer bottle across her face and breaking her nose, pouring boiling hot soup water on her, and repeatedly slamming her face against the counter making her eye so black that she wore an eye patch for weeks. Mostly what I remember though is waking up in the middle of the night to my mom screaming and crying and running to find her just to see him mounted on top of her punching her in the face repeatedly and seeing her face covered in blood. These experiences have had lasting trauma on me and my sisters as you can probably imagine.   Anyways, Scott and is wife are requesting to see the babies. I am obviously not allowing them to. However, I am worried that they are going to contact DCS and force me to.   It seems pretty obvious that DCS should be on my side and allow me to keep the children from him. However, they gave approval to my sister to allow her to live at his house with them! As I mentioned previously, she has a long criminal history and has had issues with DCS in the past. While under investigation by DCS, she moved into her dads house and brought the babies with her. DCS completed their investigation, which included an inspection of his house, and deemed it a SAFE environment for her to raise her children, despite his criminal past!   That is part of the reason I am worried that they are going to force me to let him see the babies. I have read the documentation I was given about kinship guardianship in Indiana, but it seems to only specify policies for visitation with the children's biological parents. I am wondering if I have any rights to block him from having visitation? Does he even have any right to see the children under kinship guardianship? If DCS does tell me to let him see them, will I get arrested if I refuse? I am unsure of my rights in this situation.	Yes
780	"When the children were born, I tried my best to keep them on track with their developmental milestones given to us by the pediatrician.  When I weened my son off of bottles and breastfeeding at 8 months old and began baby food, the grandparents immediately put a stop to it, insisting he would choke or that the sippy cup would hurt his mouth. They continued giving him bottles against my wishes and those of the doctor to the extent that the doctor dismissed the children from her practice.  Both of my children ended up eating pureed foods and using bottles until they went to preschool.  My son wasn't talking when he was supposed to - around 2 years old - so I signed him up for the Early Learning Coalition Early Intervention Head Start program. Their father insisted I was forcing them to grow up too fast, and that he'd eventually just start talking on his own. After seeing the ""baby school"" as we called it, he relented, and my son was considered a preschooler at 2 years old, in the state school system with a structural and safe environment, and speech therapy. I was ecstatic to see their father agreeing to something finally. It turns out that my son is autistic, and this early intervention has helped him enough that it is barely noticeable.  My daughter was a thumb sucker since the womb. When she was born, be I bought her onesies with hand covers on them, and tried to get her to use a pacifier instead. His family undid it all, insisting that if it kept her calm and happy, let her do it until she grows out if it. (She was a colic baby)  She is now 8 years old, needs her mouth reconstructed so her front upper jaw won't be shaped like her thumb anymore, needs braces to straighten her teeth, and STILL sucks her thumb when she sleeps.  I left when my daughter was 7 months old. I tried to take the children with me, but he took them from me and locked them in the room with his parents. I was forced to leave without them. I tried multiple times to get the children back through the courts - even with evidence of domestic violence - but because he had more money, he kept getting primary custody. I was able to get them back for a year, before any court order was in place, and during that time (they were 3 and 4) I got them off the bottles, potty trained them both, and introduced them to solid foods. Getting them into school and social scenarios was a little harder. While my son had been in ""baby school"" since 2 years old, his grandparents wouldn't let him eat the school lunch, and only packed him a pack of crackers and an applesauce, quoting that he wouldn't eat anything else. (My kids, at the time, would eat anything I gave them)  So as my children grew older, they refused to eat anything they were not already introduced to. They would go as far as to act terrified, cry, and even vomit to justify their fear of new or different things. Even today, while I have had progress over the last few years, they will only eat things such as chicken and rice (their dad's family staple) pizza, macaroni and cheese, or fast food chicken nuggets. They don't like hot dogs, hamburgers, any kind of red meat, had never had any fruits or vegetables, or even candies and chocolate. They don't like chocolate milk or soda or tea. They are robbing themselves of their own childhood - and I don't mind some of these, but this is ridiculous. We have a rule that they have to try one new thing every visit. If they don't like it, they don't have to finish it, but they do have to try it. It's worked so far for so many things, but we're still far from even having begun.  My children have never known the need for physical exertion. They have never been exposed to sports at their dad's. They refuse to ride their bikes or scooters or skateboards. They get tired walking to the mailbox. They claim a box of food is too heavy to carry, they expect me to walk across the room to give them something off of the table in front of them. I don't do it - but someone else does. It took a long time to get my son to understand that he cannot bark at, or give orders to, my mother or myself. My daughter is still learning that she has to do things for herself. They don't know how to open packets of food, tie their shoes, brush their hair, fold their clothes...the list goes on. And they refuse to learn when I try to teach them. Because they're so used to everything coming so easily, or someone else doing it for them, if you try to teach them and they don't get it the first time, they get angry with the task and say they'll never do it again.  My daughter is actually exceptionally intelligent. She is making straight A's in school. I'm trying to skip her a grade and teach her things that are more mentally simulating and challenging, but the moment she is required to put effort into it, she refuses to do it, claiming it's too difficult for her. Turns out the county here doesn't skip grades, but they've agreed to change her educational material regardless. Hopefully, this will help her learn to accept hardships as a challenge and not a stopping point.  The children were never taught how to control their emotions, so when something happens, I have to drop everything, grab their face, tell them, ""don't panic, breathe, look at me and nothing else."" ""The worst thing you can do in a high-stress situation is panic. Now look at this situation, and tell me how you would deduce a solution"" I refuse to let them give up on anything they have the potential to enjoy.  It takes time to get through to them, but I take all the time I'm given to prepare them. I find myself often reminding them, ""as your mother, I am not here to do everything for you. I am here to keep you from harm as I guide you to learn to do these things for yourself. That is my job."" And they begin to understand.  They also learned the concept of money from me. It started with bribes as rewards, then fines as punishments - which I don't personally condone, but it taught them the basics of law and finances. If they messed up, I'd ""ticket"" them, and they'd pay. Suddenly they realised they didn't have enough money to buy another of whatever they broke. They learned that we can't ""just go out and buy another one"" anytime something breaks. So they better care of things. They know now when I do or do not have the money, but they trust me when I tell them I'll get what they ask for when I can afford it - so long as they earned it.  The children often say they do not want to return to my house, because it is too hard for them to be with me, because I teach them sports, budgeting, household chores, cooking, logical deduction, stress management... They say they're only given things to play with at their dad's, and the only real interaction they get is when they are given help with homework and food. They're otherwise left to their own devices and their grandparents will just do whatever keeps them quiet and happy so the kids don't have to do for themselves at all.  But my shining moment was when the children tried to do something they know very well how to do - such as warming up food in the microwave - and their grandparents panicked and took away the chance. When the children realized that they were treated like independent and intelligent people with me, and babies at their father's, they started getting more excited about our visits.   But the issue is, their father considers their attempts to care for themselves as ""rebellion"", and they're punished for it, then the children are told to me angry with me. The children are told I do not love them or want them, that I neglect them so they're forced to learn for themselves. Everything I teach them becomes undone. Their lost money is returned, their broken items replaced, their independence stolen from them. Then they go back to their Xbox, their tablets...they get locked away from the world I'm trying to show them.  Since 2013, my visits have been every other weekend, and 2 weeks out of the summer. During 2014-2015, they were withheld from me for 18 months in violation of that order until September of 2015, and now I'm starting all over again. Every attempt I've made to regain custody has been turned on me, and the courts see nothing wrong with how the children are parented by their father's family. I've been denied custody now 3 times.  So...what can I do?  Sorry this is too long."	Yes
781	I've been trying to research this for a while, and while it's easy to find how to remove a father from a birth certificate, I cannot locate anything on how to remove a mother.  I've never had a pleasant relationship with my mother. She didn't raise me, and I feel no attachment for her, and on the contrary, she has no attachment to me. We haven't spoken in ages. I'm a 30F, and would like to know if it's possible to remove her name from my birth certificate without having to replace it with an adopted mother's name?  Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.	Yes
782	My girlfriend lived in the US for most of her life and had two kids while she was living in California. Her ex (the father) and her moved to Mexico with the kids and then they separated and she took care of the kids but let him see them. She finally decided to move back to the US but she wanted to let him see them so they agreed that they would stay in Mexico until the school year started and then they would move to the US. Her visa was still good when she crossed the border but it has now expired and her ex is saying he won't return them. He is only doing this to upset her but she's not sure how she will get them back. Is there anything we can do to get them back? We're worried about her going to a court because her visa expired a few weeks ago.	Yes
783	Tx- my husband is telling me that in the next 45 mins he is going to kick me out while pregnant and take off with our son and he does not care that I have nowhere to live and no food which I need to maintain nutrition for our child while in the womb...he says he is going to literally drive me somewhere and kick me out of the car and lock the door. I'm so scared, can I call the cops for this or is this legal for him to do?	Yes

786	Hello, I am a father who loves his daughter in the state of Florida. However, my ex-wife is trying to take my daughter away from me on the grounds that there is marijuana in my home. In the past 6 months, I had to move back in with my family as I had been facing, like many fellow Americans, the harsh reality of unemployment. I do not smoke personally, but my family members do smoke marijuana. My daughter is unaware of the smoking and lives a comfortable life with her own bedroom, a lot of toys, and a lot of healthy, organic food.   My ex-wife is trying to obtain full-custody as she is uncomfortable with our daughter living in a home where marijuana use occurs. I am now employed and trying to move out, however, I am afraid that in the mean time my pride and joy could be taken away from me. I have tried to do my own slipshod research and have read that I may need to get a house study done to help my case.   Lawyers of Reddit, could you please give me legal advice on the situation so that I may legally keep my daughter? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!   (TL;DR: I live with my family who smokes marijuana and my ex-wife wants full custody of our child because she disapproves of the drug use. How do I keep partial custody of my daughter IN FLORIDA?)	Yes
787	Hello,   I have recently been looking into getting my last name changed back to my mother's maiden name. However at the same time I am needing to file a small estate affidavit in order to access some of my deceased father's assets.   I was wondering if I should go through the name change first and then file for the small estate or the other way around? If I file the estate first would I have to refile it again under my new name?  Would I have to refile my other paperwork stating my assets under my new name as well? I am scared that changing my name will somehow allow me to lose my heir assets that are underneath my old name.. and I am not sure of the process of getting them transferred over to my new name.  Asking my courthouse questions like these leads to no answers, and I've never hired a lawyer before so I am not sure the costs of filing a small estate or even if there are costs to just asking questions. Any advice is appreciated!	Yes
788	"My 92 year old grandmother is currently decaying away in her home losing her mind. She has been injured various times but plays it off with insane excuses. She is clearly not mentally fit to be all on her own.  Currently she is in the ""care"" of my aunt, in which her daughter forced her so that she controls all my grandmother's finances. Right now the aunt does nothing at all, and worsens my grandmother's physical state.  In general the aunt is a big obstacle.  What can I do to help this situation? Ideally I'd want my grandmother to move in with me so I can actually take care of her but im unsure if my aunt would let that happen. It's come to the point where the aunt drains her pension each month not even leaving her enough for groceries.  Legally what are my options, alternatively i'd want her in an old folks home."	Yes
789	I'm a 17 year old who is home schooled by my mom in Missouri for most of the time. I get to see my dad every 6 weeks, sometimes here in Missouri and sometimes at his home in Florida. We both want to spend a lot more time together. Do I have the right to spend more time with my dad than my mom wants me to?	Yes
790	I'm 20 years old. I have one little brother, he's 8. He's with me right now. All of my relatives live in South Africa. My aunt and uncle are flying out to help me but they won't be here until Friday morning. I just need to know where to go to get the ball rolling.   My parents spoke of a will but I haven't been able to find it. My mom was an attorney so they didn't use one that I can contact. I know my parents had money, but it was all tied up in real estate. There are tenants living on 3 of their properties. Two sets I'm sure will be respectful but my parents were trying to evict the other set and I'm afraid they'll use this to take advantage of me and try and get some kind of claim to the house. Please don't think I'm selfish for thinking about money, but I need to take care of my brother.   I have both my parents credit cards and bank cards so money isn't an issue for the time being. But can the bank/credit card companies freeze the cards if they find out that my parents passed?   Most importantly I'm worried about my brother. I think my aunt will try and take custody of him. She spoke about bringing him back to SA with her. Can she do that? I have no job. I guess now I have money but I have no figures right now.  One of the reasons I'm worried about custody is that I regularly smoked weed before all of this. Now that I have to take care of my brother I obviously won't be doing that anymore. But I'm afraid that they'll drug test me and say I'm unfit for custody. With the amount I smoked it'll probably take 3+ months to get out of my system, maybe up to six. I've also been in two at fault car accidents this year, but I wasn't under the influence or anything. Can my aunt use this against me?  I don't even know what else I should be asking. Just a point in the right direction. This is the first time I've been able to sit down and think. I'm about to start doing some googling but I figured I'd post here first.   Thanks.	Yes
791	"Some background information: So my mother and father are currently going through a divorce. I'm legally an adult (18+) while my younger brother is a minor (Under 18). My father recently moved out of the house because of this divorce and is currently living in Chicago. My mother, who had been previously diagnosed with a personality disorder, left the house for 3 days without a word to me or my brother on when or whether she would be coming back or not. During day 2, we broke down the door to the house's office room in order to get more information or maybe a hint on her whereabouts. The actual act of kicking down the door was committed by my younger brother but I witnessed it and did not try to stop him. She is now trying to take me to court for ""convincing"" my brother to kick down the door. I don't think she has any legal standing as the house is under my dad's name and he pays for all the bills because my mother has been unemployed for years now. My dad understands my side of the story and doesn't care for the damage done. Can she really do anything or is she just trying to scare me and play mind games? I am now living with my dad in the city during summer break from college to get out of the house but my brother is stuck with her because he's still got a year left of high school back home.  Some other stuff she has done to me I think I can use against her to file a ""counterclaim"" (don't know if I'm using that word right) or just in general is: 1) Logged into my newly opened bank account (which was only suppose to be under my name) and taken $5,000 from my savings and tried transferring it into her personal bank account. I, foolishly, used an old username and password from a previous joint account with her when I was a minor to open the new one. She used that previous information to log into my new account and tried to steal my money. I called the bank and reversed it but I would still consider that some form of identity theft, right? 2) She has been constantly berating and belittling me over text message (calling me names, using every swear in the book, threatening me, etc.) for a little under a month now. I don't want to block her as I think I can use this as evidence as some form of abuse, correct? Yes, I find it very disturbing and am deeply saddened that my own mother thinks I'm worthless simply because I refuse to take sides in the divorce.   More info on her mental issues: She has obviously had this Personality Disorder for a while now and during my childhood would constantly go through bouts of yelling at me and my brother and acting like a normal mother. She use to see a therapist but I'm not sure how often she attends appointments now. I think the stress of the divorce accelerated/intensified this disorder as the abusive text messages have gotten more frequent. I've even come home one night (in the old house) to see dozens of holes in the wall across different rooms of the house which was very creepy to say the least.  Thank you in advance for all the help."	Yes
792	Quebec, Canada. I am the victim along with my younger sister, my father is the abuser. I frankly have no idea where to start legally - I have a few questions I hope someone can help me with. Frankly, I am terrified, this has been kept hushed in my extended family for over 20 years.   The abuse lasted from when I was in diapers to the age of 18. I remember recurring specific instances of abuse clearly, without the memory of specific dates because I was so young. Abuse included numerous and repetitive molestation and forcing me to manually stimulate him.   At the age of 5 years old, my mother was suspicious of abuse but never witnessed anything herself. My mother filed for divorce. An Aunt on my father's side called her one day saying she had witnessed him molesting me while giving me a bath during a family visit at my grandparent's house. However, this aunt was not willing to testify. At the age of 5, I was considered too young to testify in court. Without a witness, all my mother had to go on legally was suspicions. Though she fought tooth and nail, the legal system was not on her side since she had no witnesses willing to testify and no evidence except the memories of a child. The legal system failed me and my mother horrendously. She had no job, no family support and no money, and the appointed lawyer could do little for us. She was advised to try for supervised visitation, and not to try to prosecute as the case would most likely fall through, and the courts might take pity on him if he was not convicted and grant equal custody. My father ended up with supervised visits one Saturday a week. Despite this, the abuse continued. Any time someone's back was turned for one second, he would molest me - this continued at least until the age of 8 where I became more self confident to protect myself and avoided his advances, but subtle abuse and psychological abuse still remained. He remained in contact with me until the age of 18, when I became an adult and felt I had the courage to cut off all contact with him and move away without fear of him tracking me down to hurt me.  Now, 20 years later, I feel I am ready to finally face the ghosts of my past. No-one in my family would talk to me about the abuse as a child or a teenager. Which, in a way, is a good thing as it solidifies the fact that all of the memories I have are from my own experience, not from people telling me that I was abused.   I plan on getting in contact with the Aunt who witnessed the abuse, although I highly doubt she will be willing to testify if she was unwilling to do so when I was a defenseless toddler. I have several recurring, specific memories, that correlate with memories of my younger sister, who suffered the same type of abuse as myself. My older half sister, who was a teenager at the time but lived in the same house, has memories of abuse including him trying to climb into her bed and molest her at night, and showing her hardcore pornography while she was a minor. However, she lives in Malaysia currently and I am not sure she would be willing to testify.  I know it is a very long shot, as the abuse was many years ago and the memories of a young child from that long ago do not hold up well in court. But I know that if I do not do this now, I will regret it for the rest of my life. I want to get in contact with child abuse help, but I have no idea who to contact, and I know nothing about the legal system or how the case would be handled since it was such a very long time ago.   I am considering buying a hidden audio recording device, and interviewing the aunt, as well as my father, for evidence. It is legal in canada to record a conversation between two people without one party's consent, as long as the recording party is aware of it. Is there anything else I can do for evidence or to prepare for this? I want to be as prepared as I possibly can before I present the case.   This monster has molested me and my sisters, probably more family members or neighbors children that I don't even know of, and is walking free hurting more children no doubt. He is unbelievably bold and manipulative, charming, and continued the abuse under the direct supervision of my mother and case workers without anyone knowing. This will be a long, hard fight. Any advice would be welcome.	Yes
793	Who is guilty? Two brothers, one 36, one 26, live in their father's home with their mother who is ill with cancer. The two are not amicable. Great deal of bad blood. 26 claims history of violence at hands of 36.  They take turns occupying shared spaces in the home. 36 goes to work to make private income. Family income provided by the father. 26 stays at home caring for ill mother. 36 returns to house in the middle of the day. This is not typical. 26 doesn't want 36 in the house. Feels it's his time to occupy spaces. 36 just want to prepare for business trip. 26 grabs a skillet, stands at the entrance, and blocks 36 from entering house. He warns 36 not to enter. 36 comes in anyway toward 26 punching. 26 weakly swings skillet no injuries. 36 knocks skillet away. 26 jumps on 36 and bites chest and arm. 26 clings to 36s back. Fight pauses, they talk about issues. 36 gets fed up and strangles 26 with hands until he passes out. 26 calls cops.

794	I'm a mom to 4 boys, 11, 10, 8 and 7. I am also in college finishing my bachelor degree. This semester I have a mandatory internship which makes my getting home an hour after the boys get off the bus. In the state of Arkansas, is it legal for the boys to be home without an adult for an hour after school each day? Money is really tight and we cannot afford child care.	Yes
795	My daughter (age 7) lives in Minnesota with her father. I live in Washington state. We originally lived in Washington together, moved to Minnesota together into his father's house, and then I came home after I had difficulty finding a job, in order to get a job here and save money so we could afford to get our own place in Minnesota because his father did not like having me and all of my other children there (I have 5 other children).   The agreement between my ex and I was that our daughter would stay there with him because his father is ill and he wanted her to have a chance to form a relationship with him. That was 3 years ago. I ended the relationship with him after I came back. We never married and never established a parenting plan or any official custody or anything. He claims I wouldn't win anything in court because he lives on a reservation and tribal court always favors the Native child staying with the Native family.   I say the tribal court doesn't have jurisdiction because he doesn't live on the reservation affiliated with the tribe he's actually registered with and that any custody proceedings would be in standard Minnesota courts. Regardless, I haven't seen my daughter in 3 years and when I schedule time to call and talk to her, he often doesn't answer the phone or isn't home. I haven't spoken to her since January.   I've offered to fly out there to see her but he usually makes some excuse about why it's not a good time. I'm fed up and frustrated and I have no protection because we have nothing established in court about my rights to have access to her. What do I do?	Yes
796	TL:DR-In my “infinite wisdom” I believed it a good idea to get married at the age of 21 as a US citizen to my long-distance boyfriend who is a Canadian Citizen. It was my first serious relationship as an “adult” and while at the time I made excuses why, it was a very rocky relationship. After almost two years of being married it all fell apart and I moved back home with my parents. He jerked me around with dancing on the “Maybe I still want you” line for a bit before I finally said it was over. While back in the states it took him years but I finally got request for divorce papers in the mail. I believed that was the end of it, but after contacting him he swore up and down he still has a bunch of paperwork to work through before we can be properly divorced. I no longer believe him when he said he would handle it. I just got engaged 8 years later but I have no idea if the divorce went through or how to handle it moving forward as I plan my first proper wedding.  We were married IN Alberta and when he filed he was still there and I was (and still am ) in Rhode Island.  I’m going to preface this all by saying I’m very ashamed of the whole situation. I was a very stupid lonely kid who didn’t realize just how greatly I was screwing my life over. I’m sorry this got long, I still get pretty emotional thinking about the whole situation. If this is not the right place to post this I would really appreciate being directed to the right place.  2006 - I come from a pretty tense and dysfunctional family, so when it came time for me to go to college I chose something far away. While attending my first semester at college I did not know anyone there and spent the majority of my time by myself in the library or computer labs. It wasn’t long before I got officially involved with a long-distance boyfriend from Canada. Huge phone bills were racked up due to international calls and he even ventured out to see me on a very long bus ride.   2007 – I ended up transferring back to my home state and after a short time spent back at my parent’s home I decided I needed to get out of there. If I went straight back to school the next semester my parents agreed to help me get an apartment if I could prove I could pay for it. I worked full time and went to school full-time that semester but ended up failing most of my classes because I was just not able to handle that load on top of depression. The Canadian long-distance boyfriend came to stay with me for roughly a month where I supported him as he had no job back home and had been living with his parents. Had I been smart I would have seen that the relationship was clearly toxic at this point, but I’ve always had a quiet sappy romantic side that had me wanting to believe that this “first love” was special enough to be the one.    In the fall I moved out of the apartment and transferred yet again, this time to a college where I could live on campus, but still close enough to home where I went back to my parents nearly every weekend. My mother was convinced I would do better in this setting, and to her credit my grades were all passing even though my heart wasn’t really in it. Many Many phone conversations later he (Canadian Boyfriend) convinced me to move out there with him so that we could be together. At that point he had gotten an overnight job and a small studio apartment that I had flown out for a week to visit so I honestly believed it was a logical next step.  Spring 2008- I packed up a single bag and two carry-ons and moved to Canada. Whether I believed it might not work out, or that I would be stopped by suspicious customs folk I can no longer remember, but I went there with a return ticket that went unused. While the relationship was okay in the beginning it quickly deteriorated. As I wasn’t a citizen I could not get a job, car or really anything else that required money so I was at his mercy when it came to pretty much anything. He insisted I have the same sleep schedule he did as an overnight worker and that pretty much killed any hope of a social life outside of him that didn’t involve the internet. Sex frustrated him as we were both virgins and he came to place that blame on me. While I was willing to work through everything, he was impatient and eventually decided it was all because I was not attractive enough for him. Yes, he would explain this to my face. Believing that I was indeed the problem I did my best to try to fit into that mold he kept claiming he wanted. But I came to learn that if I improved one thing he would quickly find another fault that MUST be why he wasn’t interested in me. He would pepper in romantic conversations saying I was beautiful and he didn’t know what was wrong with him and that he loved me in between all of this so I moronically stayed.    The six-month mark rapidly approached and I was told the only way I could stay any longer is if we got married. Believing myself in love I was for it, “If I really love you and want to be with you, why now?” I’d thought. We decided that was what we would do. He did not pop the question he just called me over to the computer one day to help him pick out wedding rings from a cheap site online. I convinced myself that that was what I wanted so it didn’t matter that it wasn’t romantic. We filed for a marriage license and a short time later I was informed by him that we’d be getting married a couple days later in a park because he had already booked the officiant. I bought a dress I hated from some outlet store (It was brown and black with some green but it was the only dress I could find in that store at a low price that looked ok on me.) So on a muddy day when the trees didn’t even have enough green on them to look nice I got married. The whole affair was almost as miserable as that evening when he wouldn’t have anything to do with me because he was too tired. My family and friends were confused and more than a little upset that they were not invited or even told when this was happening and some of them stopped talking to me completely because of it.   The rest of the time (Less than a year of marriage) I spent there is a dismal blur of fights about filing paperwork for citizenship (He procrastinated for EVERYTHING. The only thing he stayed on top of was getting married to I could extend my stay) or where he said hurtful things and me falling into a depression so deep I started sleeping away the time I didn’t waste playing video games and started to rationalize jumping off a local bridge to just get out. Multiple times I caught him having long-distance relationships, the final one I knew about was some 17-year-old from Texas who he told we were already divorced. After weeks of sleeping on the couch after learning about that one (Clearly it was my fault for not being able to hold his interest on a physical level and being a moody depressed boring person. Oh yes, he said these things to my face.) I broke down and called my mother and told her it was over and I needed to go home. This was almost a year exactly after we had gotten married. I remember being on the road and laughing like a crazy person when I realized it was out anniversary.   2009- My mother has her issues and we don’t always see eye to eye, but on this occasion, she came through so hard for me. She quickly got time off work and drove with my sister from South Dakota to Alberta in two days. When it was clear that she was showing up and not leaving without me my “husband” did a lot of back-pedaling trying to explain that I had been irrational in being so quick to find a way back home. She showed up and he left while I packed my things into my mother’s car. When we were finished he came back and kissed me goodbye saying he had no idea if he wanted me to come back again.  When my family and I got to the hotel I had received an e-mail from him saying not to contact him, he needed space, he would tell me when it was ok for us to talk again. I was very broken. After getting home I spent a month so shattered I lost 20 pounds from not being able to eat much. My mother helped me get my license back (it had expired in Canada) sort my school debts out (He had refused to pay any of my school bills because it didn’t affect us in Canada). I moved in with friends for a few months before moving back home. It was at this time that my Canadian “husband” had decided he wanted me back and that some of our troubles were actually his fault. I was angry, but usually heard him out. After falling into an old fight I just stopped taking his calls after I told him I wanted a divorce. He popped up on my doorstep not long after trying to win me back. He convinced me to give it another try but it came down to me being unable to trust him. So we were over. He said he would handle the divorce, it would be cheaper if he did it himself without a lawyer. At that point I was so scarred from the whole experience I didn’t believe I wanted to ever get married again anyway so I wasn’t overly concerned and agreed he could do it.    In October, when I had been living with them, my parents started going through a messy divorce. During that time, I kept my head down, worked a lot of hours and started planning to move out. My mother and siblings had moved out due to the divorce and I guess because I was an “adult” she just left me staying at the house with my dad. I’ve never had a good relationship with my father, he’s a very angry man, with a touchy temper prone to violent outbursts. (My mother had been so convinced he would react violently she told him via text message which my father made me read aloud to him when he got home) It was pretty fucked up. Time went by, life happened and a long-distance friendship blossomed into a romance and relationship by December.   February I flew out and spent a week with my new beau trying to just move on with my life. Nothing physical happened outside of making-out because I had been completely upfront and honest about my situation and he wanted to take things slow. After coming back to South Dakota I became much more interested in the progress of the divorce, but when I contacted my Canadian Ex I would get a lot of excuses and run arounds. He would make brief progress after I threatened to get a lawyer involved from my side but it never seem to stay on track.   Unhappy with my living situation it didn’t take long for the idea of moving out to the east coast to sound really appealing. Initially I had wanted to get my own place and build into the new relationship slowly, but making minimum wage and paying for some of my parents bills I didn’t have the means to amass the money for a down payment or rent for the first few month while I got settled. In 2010 I moved to Rhode Island from South Dakota and into my new boyfriend’s apartment.   Years later my Canadian Ex got my address and sent me papers declaring intention to divorce. He had told me I did not have to do anything and the divorce would go forward soon. I was so happy that I had thought it was finally over. That stupid raincloud was going to be off of my head and out of my life.  After this in 2013 my New Boyfriend attempted a proposal at Disney World. I say attempt because I was still so skittish to the idea of marriage that in a panic I yanked him off of his knee and walked forward like nothing happened. This naturally caused tension, but he was very patient and understanding about the whole situation.  After a lot of serious discussions and talks about our future he finally got the nerve to ask me to marry him again on May 25th of this year 2017. I said yes. After a few months of excitedly planning and dreaming what our big day will look like I’ve come to realize that the raincloud of my first marriage might not be fully gone. The last time I spoke to my Ex a couple years ago (AFTER he had send me the papers) he said he had messed something up and it was going to take awhile because it cost a lot of money. (Another excuse, he gave me this song and dance after telling me he was in an upcoming magic the gathering tournament, and that man never skimped on buying cards for his perfect deck)  My Future husband believes that I shouldn’t do anything. That there is no technical record of me ever being in the United states so I should just pretend like it never happened. I have always filed my taxes as single since moving back to the states and getting back into work so as far as the system knows and cares I’m single and I have always been.   While in Canada I didn’t file any taxes, I never paid any bills, had nothing in my name save for a single credit card where the Ex used my “married name” (I never filed for a name change but apparently the marriage certificate was enough to open a joint account in that name)  I don’t want my stupid decisions of the past to have any effect on my upcoming marriage or future life with the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.   Is there a way to figure out just where my Canadian Ex is in the process? Is there somewhere where I could get this information to see if it went through or just is stuck in limbo? Or do I need to find an attorney to get to the root of this?  Or would it be better just to follow my Fiancé’s advice and pretend it never happened? What possible legal backlash could this cause if any?  I feel a little slimy at the idea of filling out a marriage certificate saying I've never been married before, but if my last marriage is stuck in a hellish legal limbo trying to get that wrapped up with proof that it's legally over sounds like an expensive nightmare.   After over 6 years separated I just want this to be over.    Frankly I have no idea how to handle this situation moving forward. Contacting my Ex would likely only lead to another set of run arounds and excuses that give me no information whatsoever.  If you’ve made it this far I am extremely grateful, I did not anticipate this would end up being so long or so…all over the place.   If I have made anything unclear or you have any questions please ask. Thank you for your patience.	Yes
797	Okay so this situation is fuuuucked up. Like you wouldn't believe.  I was told I might be able to open a case.  [This is what I just wrote up about the situation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj2qeIFjqzF1rDmku_AO9TjFifz_9i4A4Gx8tyKbQe8/edit?usp=sharing)  ^^basically ^^lots ^^of ^^abuse ^^and ^^children ^^are ^^getting ^^^psychologically ^^^^fucked ^^^^^up.   obviously i know nothing about writing a legal document. names have all been changed.   if anyone could check this out and help advise me, I have no idea what steps to take next. I've never made a legal case.  If it helps I'm in Washington County, Oregon.	Yes
798	I will contact lawyers, but wondering if anyone here has a general idea of how to proceed? She left me without any warning or explanation, and I want to file for divorce. We have a shared checking acct with only a small amount of money, but I have mutual funds/retirement savings in my own name (that I had before we got married, but they've accumulated a lot of wealth in the years we've been together). Will she be entitled to money from my retirement account in settling this?  Any idea of how to serve her papers in another country? I have no idea how the divorce process works. Does she need to be there in person?  Thanks.	Yes
799	Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	Yes
800	"Louisiana.  I ask here because i have little idea about what marriage entails when it comes to money.  I dare not ask my sister since i've had argument with her about how much I dislike and wish they've broken up before they had kids. She was lucky to land a rich boy like him. She went from poverty to having their own house and got her nursing training, all from her husbands parents support. Her husbands parents are manipulative and evil, so, yeah. I worry they may have done something to secure their sons wealth from her in some way.  And as excited as i am to see her split up from him, it brings a very bitter sweet feeling and i am not fit to confront my sister about these details ""Currently"" as my emotions are a strong mix of relief and sadness because her children are going to go through exactly what we all went through, concerning low life, deadbeat and cheating fathers"	Yes
801	Hi all, so I'd appreciate it if I could get some advice on this situation. Some context, my grandmother has had three husbands. The first one died when my mother was 3 months old. The second was found to be cheating, was kicked out, and divorced. Her third husband, however, took serious advantage of her being a single mother so he could sexually assault my mother. Unfortunately, this wasn't a one-time thing. He was charged in the early '80s for it. There was a condition for him not to go near anyone under the age of 16 unless they were accompanied by an adult, and a restraining order put on him to not go near my mother. In '85 he built a brand new house, and he wanted my grandmother, uncle and mother to move into this new house that he built, but they all refused because the house they were living in (which is the same house my grandma still resides in), was built by her first husband - their father. So he (her 3rd husband, not her 1st) got drunk one day and sold the house he had built, for pretty much nothing, in an attempt to gain permission to move in to my grandmas house (he still had the restraining order on him at this point), which was successful.  After he moved in, he sexually assualted my mom continuously right up until '96, then he proposed that same year to my grandma, which gave my mother a 6 month respite. What was really odd though, was that he married my grandmother on the same day that is my mother and fathers wedding anniversary. He started sexually assaulting my mother again in '97, right up until 2 years ago. It's a real long, unpleasant story. Nevertheless, he's in jail as I'm typing this, and my grandmother is actively seeking a lawyer to remove him off her house title.   My question is; could she get this marriage anulled in order to make the separation easier? She is willing to let him have all of his belongings, including his boat and the only vehicle they have, as long as she gets to keep her house. She see's how twisted this man is now, and wants nothing more to do with him. She wants him and his children off her will, and she wants her relationship restored with us. This man, only last year had another 'peace bond' applied to him, stating that he must remain at least 100m away from my mother and sister at all times. Oh yea, did I forget mention he had done this to my sister ever since she was 4? But that's another long, uncomfortable story. Any help would be appreciated. Please help.	Yes
802	I'm currently trying to get a divorce in Hawaii. My ex moved back to the mainland back in 2015, so this has been a wild ride. I've pushed for her to sign all the papers since early 2016, and she finally has sent all the documents *except* the appearance and waiver. Now she's gone no contact despite saying she would send the last document. She hasn't replied to any of my emails since June 1st. I'm kind of in a hurry now because I'm gone until September and then leaving to go overseas with the military in October for over 6 months. I'm not able to use the military legal services because she can't, which is a whole other story.  My question is, can a judge grant the divorce without this *one* paper? Do I have to get a lawyer involved? If I do have to get a lawyer and we can't get this figured out before I leave, will I not be able to finish it until I get back?	Yes
803	This will probably get long. Sorry. All names are fake.   &amp;nbsp;  When I was younger and stupid (19 in fact), I married Chris. Chris and I had a long history reaching back to when I was 13. Chris is mentally ill in several ways, on and off drugs, has no respect for women, about 30 different charges in his arrest record over half of which are assault on a female, kidnapped his child with another woman at one point two days after the child had serious surgery (it took a week for our local police to get off their asses and do something about that one, and in the end I only think they did it because the child was on a prescription diet and Chris could not purchase it).... I personally was cheated on, hit, trapped in my home, emotionally abused, infected (deliberately) with an STD, financially destroyed... I have horrific stories of things that he has done to me, which I've never told anyone.    &amp;nbsp;  The reason I've never told most of these stories - not even to my therapist or my current partner - is because Chris seems incredibly normal to most people. He is very, very good at manipulating, lying to, and confusing those around him. Without getting into too much identifying detail, our marriage fell apart over the course of a couple months, and I left. Then he came to where I was staying, convinced me to talk to him, and ended up putting me in a situation where I could not physically stop him from having sex with me even though I told him no, nor call for help. Yes, I know what forcible sex without consent is called, and I don't like to call what happened that. Mostly because that was the night my daughter was conceived.    &amp;nbsp;  It took me a long time to completely sever ties with him - I am not proud of that - especially when he was able to use my daughter as an 'in'. He has now not seen her in over two years, almost three. It became very clear that he was not interested in seeing her, he was interested in using seeing her as a way to manipulate and torture me, bum money or a place to stay or rides, control who I saw and what I did, etc. I stopped the visits after one where he picked her up at 1 pm; we had clearly agreed she would be back before 4 pm, and he texted me after he left and said he'd decided he wasn't going to bring her back until 7 pm, and threatened to not bring her back at all. He had lashed out in that way because I'd told him he could not take my then-2 1/2-year-old to a comic con out of state for 3 days, where she would have been staying in a hotel room with him and 5 of his mostly-male adult friends, all of whom made clear their intent to drink heavily (not that it would have mattered if they were Mormon virgins, because there was no way it would have been appropriate for her to accompany him to that), none of whom had a legal license and insurance. Thankfully, he is not on her birth certificate, and as far as I am concerned, never will be - there has been no DNA testing and no legal establishment of paternity. So I was able to tell him to bring her back or I'd call the police.    &amp;nbsp;  Another thing that helped me be able to finally stand up and set firm limits was my budding/new relationship with James. James and I had a brief fling when I was 16, hadn't spoken for quite a while, and things just kinda sparked just under 3 years ago. Our relationship is wonderful in so many ways. I am with someone who respects and loves me, who doesn't hurt me or scare me, who tells me the truth... He is everything I could ever want in a partner. In addition, although I neither intended or expected things to end up this way, he is a wonderful stepfather.    &amp;nbsp;  We have had no contact with Chris for a very long time (other than one recent attempt to get some medical information for a geneticist visit for my daughter - he said he'd look over the forms and email them back 'tomorrow', a week later I gave up and filled out what I could myself). However, we do hear quite a bit secondhand from a mutual friend who Chris doesn't know keeps tabs on him, and a couple of my &amp; James' friends who he thinks are somehow his buddies. This is a small town, so it's less wierd than it sounds. About six months ago, one of my friends ran into Chris at a bar. He hung around for a few and overheard Chris spreading the rumor that James, my boyfriend, was a pedophile.    &amp;nbsp;  My friend specified that it seemed to be a sort of shitty joke, playing off James' chubby-guy-with-beard-in-glasses look. However, I was pretty ticked off, and I'm very aware of Chris' 'jokes' and how he likes to pretend he's just joking when he's really either being cruel or trying to manipulate people. I spoke to Chris' sister, who I do have a fairly good relationship with, and she gave him a pretty big dressing-down. The issue seemed dealt with and done.    &amp;nbsp;  And then a couple days ago, Chris called our mutual friend and was chatting with him. At some point in the conversation, he started trying to claim James was a pedophile, and his 'proof' was that I was 15 and James was 20 when I first met &amp; had sex with him. This is not true, I was 16 and James was 19, Chris knows that I was 16, it was 100% legal in our state (NC), and regardless it was a consensual teenaged fling that lasted all of two weeks! James and I are 2 years and 5 months apart, for the record. I am currently 25, about to turn 26; he turned 28 a couple months ago.    &amp;nbsp;  Our mutual friend is not patient with Chris' continual lying, and happens to quite like James, so he brushed it off and made a joke about 15 year olds being mature enough to make their own decisions. Chris became angry that he wouldn't play along and hung up on him. The mutual friend then told me about the conversation, and added that in a group chat he was in on Facebook with Chris's friends, Chris has brought this topic up 'jokingly' repeatedly.    &amp;nbsp;  If this was just harmless gossip, I'd continue to ignore it. However, again, I am a single mother of a five year old, living with my boyfriend - stereotypes are definitely against me. If the wrong person hears these 'jokes', I could lose my child while it was being investigated - Chris knows this, because when I was pregnant, he deliberately incited someone else to call CPS with similar spurious accusations, in the hopes that I would be under investigation when my daughter was born and lose custody, which led to my younger siblings not being allowed at my mother's house (where I lived) for a month while they investigated whether or not my pregnancy was the product of incestuous rape of an 11 year old male sibling. Again, not exaggerating this in the slightest. Chris is well aware of the intricacies of the CPS system and the ways to abuse it due to the fact that he spent most of his childhood and teen years in and out of it.    &amp;nbsp;  Knowing that the jokes/accusations have continued and that he is deliberately twisting dates/ages/events, it's clear that he is actively trying to make people think James is a pedophile, thereby implying I am putting my daughter at risk (there is probably also an element of jealousy that my daughter has another father figure). There is 100% no truth to this. However, we have no clue how to handle the deliberate slander, nor if we even should do anything. I doubt I could involve the police; they are notoriously lax in our town for anything that doesn't involve physical violence, and there's no proof he's saying it (or that it's meant maliciously, not a 'joke'). I can't prove anything he said over the phone to someone else, nor can I obtain Facebook chats in any form that would be legally admissable. I feel that any contact with him, whether direct or through an intermediary like his sister, would merely fuel the flames, so I don't necessarily want to try that again.    &amp;nbsp;  But, I also feel that something should be done. James is leaving the decision up to me, although he did say if he runs into Chris in public he's probably going to break his nose. Considering even if this went no further than gossip, James could have his reputation ruined - which in a small town, could also lead to him losing his job - I can't really fault him. In addition, whether deliberately incited or otherwise, it is 100% within the scope of possiblity that Chris' less savory drug-addict friends would attempt to corner and attack James. They have, at his behest, stalked and assaulted people in the past, including myself. Chris again has also kidnapped a child in the past, although I don't believe he has the financial/family resources to do that again and as he is not on the birth certificate it would not end well for him.   &amp;nbsp;   R/relationships felt this fell under a legal question, and suggested I post it here.    &amp;nbsp;  **tl;dr: My abusive ex-husband Chris has been systemically and deliberately trying to spread a rumor that my boyfriend James is a pedophile (he is not). Seeing as I have a 5 year old daughter, this goes beyond possible damage to James' reputation and puts our day to day lives at risk. I am not sure how to proceed or if I even have any recourse to handle this.**	Yes
804	I'll get right to it - wife is asking for a divorce, we have 2 children, 2 and 4; we rent a home in TX, she drives a car that's in my name.   What are my rights? Her rights?  She has expressed wanting to move to California with the boys. I'm pretty sure if we get divorced she can't do that.   I know that as the father in this situation it leans way in her favor of custody and child support. Is there any legal possibility that I can maintain custody?  We are both good parents, both good people, no cheating, no abuse physical or verbal.   Her reason for divorce is that she doesn't love me like a wife should and isn't happy - but that I'm still her best friend. I asked to try to fix our marriage and she doesn't want to try. I think her mom has more to do with the reason, also recently divorced (I.e. Last weekend for the 7th time) but that doesn't seem relevant.   I just don't want to lose contact with my two children.   She's asked me to move out, before divorce has been filed, I feel like that would put me in a bad position to then ask for custody of the children.   Not sure what to do; I don't want an ugly divorce, I also don't want to lose my children.   I know this is Reddit - so, Facebook is deleted and Gym membership is in hand - now on to the legal advise.   Thank you,	Yes
805	My family recently moved my Grandfather into assisted living after his Dementia got worse. My sister is his POA, and I want to buy his car. How do I do this legally so that family members do not make a stink about it down the road?

806	"Long story short, my mother is a not so great person and stole my identity ages ago. She's done this to my father and my sister but neither of those escalated to this level. Right now the issue writing bad checks. She's spent time in jail for this herself.   I live in Florida right now, and I completely removed her from my life. These charges are coming from Nevada and are from 2011.   Basically I was getting a background check done for a job and they told me they couldn't hire me because I have two arrest warrants out in Nevada. I wasn't too shocked, because like I said, my mother has a history of this, but I was pretty damn floored.   Running off of 100% assumptions here, but I'm guessing these physical checks stemmed from a bank account that my mother helped me open after I turned 18 and she just kept the checkbooks.   I completely and 100% did not do this. I've known of her using my identity before because I have bad marks on my credit report from her (from around this time) but I had no knowledge of these checks being written nor did I do it.   Since moving away from Nevada, I went from having nothing more than a GED to my name and now going to an amazing University, living on my own, etc., my life has really changed. This happening has been the lowest blow I've felt in a while.   Now I'm stuck on what to do. These are two separate charges, both misdemeanors, issued within 6 months of each other. I briefly spoke to an attorney in Vegas over the phone and he said something along the lines of ""these are not bench warrants, they're actual arrest warrants which are more serious"".   I was quoted $7800 to get both of these taken care of. It's twice as much because there are two separate charges.   I have no idea what these checks are for, how much they're for, who they were written out to, anything. I'm kind of afraid to call the courts to find out anything because I don't want to trigger a manhunt or something. Paranoid, I know. I'm really lost in what to do.   Any advice on my next steps? Is $7800 too crazy high for an attorney?   I've gone 6 years without knowing these issues existed... I'm terrified to even drive my car now in the event that I get pulled over, arrested and extradited over this.   Any peace of mind and advice would be greatly appreciated.    For what it's worth, I've spoken to my mother once in the past 6 years and I have no connection with her. I ignored the negative remarks on my credit report because.. it's family. But this, this is too much. I don't have contact with her, don't know where she is, but I have no qualms over saying it was her. I know some people have relationships with their parents that they'd never turn on them, but this is far too much for me to forgive. Like I said, she's been in so much legal trouble for writing checks before. This is her pattern."	Yes
807	"[Throwaway for legal reasons]  Hello everyone,  As the title says. I'm looking to divorce my wife. I've been out of the military since June 2016 and am now on Inactive Ready Reserves. We got married in October 2014. In April of 2015, she gave me 6000 dollars to put down on my vehicle. While in the military and once I got out I have been financially supporting her while she attended college full time. I am working full time and going to school full time. In March of 2016 we co-signed a vehicle which I am the primary holder. We have two dogs. I have been paying all the bills  Move Forward to now. I have moved out of the house. The house is her aunt's. I met a woman who I kissed(which will be talked later). That's it. Now she found out, and is threatening to take me to court if I don't pay her back the 6000 dollars and pay for the damages the dogs did to the house. She is also threatening to call my commander and tell them I committed ""adultery"". I am receiving VA benefits, and a disability check which she wants to take away. She wants me to pay for her bills until they add up to the 6000 dollars plus the damages. I am just looking for the best way to handle this because I'm honestly unsure of what to do. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much."	Yes
808	My friend has expressed her concern however the new girlfriend says that it was approved by my friend's ex partner (father of the children). Is there any precedent over what kind of control my friend has over the posting of images like this when the father says it is okay? I want to again say that the images are completely public on Facebook, not friends of friends, and not only friends.	Yes
809	"I've had custody of my niece for 3 years. My sister was involved in a horrific car accident and sustained a brain injury to her right frontal lobe (regressed in mental age to a teenager). She developed a crippling heroin addiction and I eventually took custody of my niece.  My sister got pregnant 3 times within a 4 year timeframe and lost 2 children due to her addiction. My sister had recently ""got clean"" although she's still taking suboxone regularly with an infant at home. We had to block her number because she kept calling and cussing at my niece/her daughter when she didn't hear what she wanted. We've blocked her number, but now she's sending letters without return addresses.   I want to adopt my niece, but I don't think my sister well simply relinquish her rights. How hard of a fight am I up against? Any insight or advice is appreciated."	Yes
810	My wife and I are filing for divorce in Ohio.  It's very amicable.  We had agreed on all of the terms, however the lawyer just told me that what we had decided isn't properly equitable.  Neither of us really want to go back to negotiating and we are both very much in agreement about what how we want things divided.  Is there a way around this, or will the court effectively force us to distribute our assets differently than we desire?	Yes
811	Title. I pay court ordered child support that's automatically taken out of my check to my son's mother. I'm not behind, there are no issues there. Today she told me she had to take me back to court because she moved out of the court district that originally ordered the support, but that seems a little strange because it should all be automated within the system at this point (I've been paying for over a year).  Any idea if I have to worry about this being a trick to try and get more or something?  As a side note, when the original order was put in place we were both single and had similar incomes, though I think she had been making a bit more than I was. Now she and I have both gotten married (to different people), and she has quit her job to stay at home. Her husband has a child I believe he pays support for, and my income situation has only changed slightly, but not much more. Also, she is pregnant. My wife and I have not had any children. Because of these changes in life situations I'm concerned that her having to change because she's moved districts is just a cover from her for her to try and get more money out of me. She's a money hungry and incredibly self-centered person and it would not be unprecedented.   Should I be concerned?	Yes
812	Since she was born, I have raised her myself. She is almost 3. Her mother is currently in Texas in a rehab center (she got into meth after she left me with my daughter) I've talked to lawyers but can't afford one upfront. I live in Indiana.	Yes
813	In the U.K. If a minor runs away from home (due to bad parenting) can they face any kind of charges (so long as no laws are broken) and also, if they stop at a friends house and the friend doesn't tell the authorities can they face charges too?	Yes
814	Long story but here is the short version. Just turned 17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings (13 year old twins)  and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.  He reached out to teachers for help so she made him drop extra curricular activities.    He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	Yes
815	Alright, so every summer when I get my son I'm served papers to do with something she's in a tizzy about. This is year 7. This time it's to change the drop off/pick up location regarding summer visitation. She lives in central Arkansas and I have recently moved to Tampa, Florida from South Georgia, associated with the military. For the past 7 years, drop off and pick up have been a huge ordeal for her every time but it has remained that I am responsible for pick up at the beginning and she is responsible at the end of visitation.   She is now wanting it changed so that we meet at the beginning and end at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport in Georgia and that we pay half of each other's cost. While meeting there isn't the issue with me as it's only a 7 hour drive for me, compared to almost 17 driving to her location.   I like the way it is now, getting it all done in one trip and not having to plan and or loose any extra time with him. She constantly complains about having to take off work and now she wants this?   I have to go to court in roughly two weeks as I was just served court papers after responding to the initial complaint that I was unwilling to change the current order.   Can anyone offer any advice on how to convince the judge to keep the order as is, or at the very least, not make us pay for half the others expenses?  My worry with that is she books whatever flight, hotel room, car rental she wants and tries to stick me with half the bill when I can get to ATL on a tank of gas that costs me $20 to fill.   Any help appreciated.	Yes
816	My ex-wife and I are on decent terms during and after the divorce. I claimed my jeep and she claimed her car in the divorce, the car happens to be the only joint loan we ever had together and she has told me numerous times that she'll refinance but it's been 6 months with no luck.   Question: can I take her to court over this matter? She assumed all responsibilities of this vehicle but hasn't fulfilled her obligation. I have written messages saying she would do this but has failed to uphold her word.   I'm currently deployed to Iraq and won't be home until September so I'm a little helpless right now. Any advice would be great, thank you!	Yes
817	"I'm looking to get advice on regarding what to do. I know the best way to get legal advice is through a bar approved lawyer, but I would like to have some second-hand advice on what I should do regarding this situation I'm currently experiencing.  My Grandmother has been ""ill"" for a while (see can't be by herself and someone has to always watch her) and currently has her house for sale. My Oldest brother has been taking care of her primarily (Being at home with her to watch her while he tries to live out his own life) and also my mother. (She can't be alone with my grandmother due to her inability to take care of herself.)(Tdlr she is a severe alcoholic and has really bad short term memory due to it.)  During most of the time, it has been my older brother taking care of her. He even transferred household utility bills in his name (Gas, Water, Electric, Comcast, ext) and additionally paying for other expenses. (Groceries, living expenses for my mother and grandmother to survive).  A Few months ago, her oldest daughter (my aunt) started giving her vitamins/pills/ect in other words ""alternate medicine"" (Whatever Steve Jobs did before he sought out real help) and in my past couple months watching over them I've notice she gets a tad better, but a bit worst each time.  In regards to what I want to ask, just recently my Aunt made herself Power of Attorney (Even though she is not the oldest sibling) even when my grandmother is in current state of mind. Her current state of mind consist of ""flashbacks"", random hysteria episodes and the inability to do the basics of living (Getting up from her bed, using the bathroom, washing herself, ect).  When she became POA she recently informed me that when the house sells that she (my aunt) will get all the money and then presumes to tell me I have to find a place for my mother since ""I'm her son"" when I can't even take care of myself in the 1st place.   So tldr - Aunt has POA, sells my grandmother house keeps the money for herself and then my mother, brother, and myself don't have anywhere to go. Honestly I'm pretty scared about this and I don't really know what to do so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
818	So the girl I'm with takes birth control and the likelihood of pregnancy is very low. However, I do not want to risk a substantial part of my life if she gets pregnant and decides she wants to keep the baby and demands child support from me. I am only 19, in college, and have ambitions to make something of my life. These goals would be seriously hindered if she got pregnant and tried to fuck me over.  She has told me that if she ever got pregnant and wanted to keep the baby then she would not want to receive child support from me but these are just words and I do not know what would actually happen if the situation arose.  This is why I'm coming here. I would like to know what it would take to ensure that if she got pregnant that I would A) not have to pay child support since she has told me multiple times she would not want me to or B) ensure that the baby would be put up for adoption so that it can be taken care of by a family with better means to do so.  I appreciate any responses ahead of time.  Thanks.	Yes
819	My mother wants to divorce my father. And we need advice based on the information below.   My father has been cheating on my mother for years, he even passed HPV to my mother from sleeping with other woman.  She forgave him for it years ago but is now tired of it and wants to leave. Me and my younger brother are both over the age of 18. And she has the following questions.   1. Could she get alimony from my father even though both me and my brother are over the age of 18 ? She is 49 years old with bad knees to work.   2. They are currently in bankruptcy over the house. Could that affect her in anyway ?   3. She is no longer a legal resident. Could that get her deported ? ( I plan to help her get residency because I am a legal citizen)	Yes
820	"Hey all,   We are getting married at a small town protestant church and asked one of the elders of the congregation to officiate.  He says it's his first wedding, and mine too. My question is are we good to go with him just being an elder, or does he need to get some kind of license?   Texas law says ""(3) a person who is an officer of a religious organization and who is authorized by the organization to conduct a marriage ceremony"" which is somewhat vague but sounds good enough to me.  Just covering my bases"	Yes
821	Hello, I'm in the USAf and I'm going home this month to get married to my fiance. He is from Canada, however and wanting to know if there is anything I need to do outside the standard marriage practices for Oregon.	Yes
822	Last month my ex-husband purchased a new car and came to pick up our two and five year old children for his visitation without car seats. He expected to be able to borrow my car seats which I declined to share with him. He has come twice to pick them up without appropriate car seats.   The first time he left angrily after I refused him my car seats and didn’t contact me about making other arrangements to see the children. He did not see them all for that visitation which was supposed to be for four days.   The second time he arrived we were outside playing and, my ex-husband  managed to scoop up the older child and get him in the car. I made it very clear to my ex that I would be calling the police to report his car the second he left if he didn’t have my kids properly restrained. Again my ex left without the children and has since left me several voicemails about how he’s taking me to court for violating our custody court order and denying him his visitation. He also thinks that the car seats belong to the children and should come with them like their clothing.   The lawyer I used for our custody agreement is currently on vacation and I haven’t been able to consult with her yet. Do you think it would be likely that I could be forced to share the car seats?  We have it in the custody agreement that he has to pick up the children because I have a degenerative eye condition that may make me unable to drive in the next few years and we don’t live in an area with public transportation.  The main reason I don’t want to share the car seats is my ex seems to be making it his personal mission to destroy or lose any clothing, toy, or other item my kids take when they spend time with him. I had to buy the oldest three pairs of winter boots this past winter.	Yes
823	Im Located in Florida, USA. Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old.   My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.   I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.    My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.   This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.   I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!     tl/dr: ex wife keeps winning custody battle even though she knowingly is filling false accusations	Yes
824	I'll get straight to the point. I got a phone call today from my aunt saying that my estranged father has lung cancer, is in hospice, and has estimated a week to live. I'm currently in Connecticut (Litchfield County), so I'm not able to fulfill his request of going back to New York (Erie County) to see him before he passes.   My mother, being the money hungry narcissist that she is, is talking about how she's going to look into the possibility of his Social Security being used to pay his rather outstanding child support balance for my sister (20 years old) and I (25 years old). I'm not certain that would even be a possibility, but if by some miracle that is a thing that happens, I would like to be prepared with any facts or advice on how to make sure my mother doesn't get the complete sun so my sister and I can split it between ourselves evenly.   My father has no estates or assets. He's a homeless man who lives off of my Aunt's couch and a drug addict/alcoholic. Again, no clue if Social Security paying off outstanding child support is even a thing (highly doubtful), but if it is, I greatly appreciate the advice.	Yes
825	So, long story short, my family is and always has been dysfunctional. My sister has serious mental illnesses that she refuses to take medication for. She has been in trouble with CPS multiple times. One of my nieces had been living with her biological father, whom had apparently been abusing her. CPS came to get her on 7/20 and now no one knows where she is (I was only told about this a couple of days ago!) I don't know if my sister has any custody or if CPS would have placed her there at all. I haven't spoken in over two years, and either way she hasn't answered me at all if my niece is there or not.   So my question is, how do I go about trying for custody? Am I even eligible? Who do I call to even inquire about this? CPS? A lawyer? My niece wasn't treated well at my sister's house either and I'm finally in a place where I can take her in. I just want her to be safe.	Yes
826	My aunt and uncle, who live in PA, are in their 80s. My uncle has had dementia now for a few years and it has changed his personality and decision making a bit. Recently he has been thinking about paving his driveway, which would cost them quite a bit of money.  This has gotten my aunt worried about my uncle's financial decision making, and she is concerned someone might take advantage of their situation. She was asking me what she should do, but I am really not very knowledgeable about legal stuff. I was hoping maybe someone could provide some advice about what her best options are before she discusses things with a lawyer. Thanks in advance.	Yes
827	"2014 I went to court filed for custody. My oldest I was able to keep. She was living with me anyway since cys got involved due to drugs in the house and some abuse. At the time my youngest who was 15 at the time also had a live in 19 year old BF. The constable found him in the closet in her bedroom. This all went to court including the constable. Why they let her stay with her mom I don't know.  At the time they said she was old enough to decide. She liked to party with her mom and now she's in rehab. Butler county juvenile has her in for the second time. The first time she went in she was 18 and she was still in high school. I was paying support to her mom. I stopped paying support to her mom since she was not living there. Soon as I did that butler came at me for support. She got out and I was paying the arrears for that while again paying her mom. The arrears were paid off and then my support juSt stopped because washington county domestic relations emancipated her as she was 18 and graduated. The week they stopped the support she ran to butler saying she was hot for drugs. THE WEEK MY SUPPORT ENDED! I figured this would happen. Anyway I enjoyed about a month of not paying support and just got the letter from butler setting up suppprt for ""the minor"". I am in the process of getting an attourney and would like some advice. She is now 19 and butler says they can make me pay support while she is there until she is 21. I'm trying to stay calm."	Yes
828	After some financial and relationship issues, I have been given a few opportunities from family to start over.  One is living in a basement apartment with my Aunt, the other is taking over my grandmother's house as she is only there 3 months (camps in summer and goes to AZ in winter).  Both are not in Iowa where I have resided for 10 years and where my son was born.  I have a 5 year old son.  His father has never held a job and currently lives with family members.  Also has a history of meth use and I believe he is not clean as he states due to his behaviour.  We were never married.  He is listed on the birth certificate.  I have solely provided for my son his whole life.  I did file for child support but the best they could do was have my son added to Medicaid under him as he has no recorded income.  I am not in a position where I can afford a lawyer and not sure if I qualify for assistance as I make just above the maximum for various assistance programs.  I did have a no contact order when I first left him that granted me custody and he had supervised visitations for a month then had to provide a clean drug test to be granted unsupervised visits. He failed to provide drug testing and all visits were revoked.  He also went to jail for violating the no contact.  Some advice from people claiming they have done this is as follows...  Because we were never married and do not have a current custody agreement, I as the mother, automatically has full custody and can move anywhere I want with my child(ren). The father would have to bring the mother to court for custody.    This seems a little vague and too easy.  Advice?	Yes
829	im not sure how to format this present this with as much information organized. I wont lie everything could always be a lie but i knew this person for 2 and a half years who i will call CRA.   --- **Background info:**  CRA is currently 18 who lives in reading pennsylvania which looks like a shit hole. she lives with 2 older brothers,19 and 21, and a younger one 15. her dad apparently dealt drugs in the past and was forced to move out of state before getting to pennsylvania because of a hitman. her mom goes to school for what degree im not sure but she always use her and her 19 year old brother to do her homework for her. if they dont they get threatened in multiple ways. Her mom gets a lot of financial aid as long as no one works in her household as she is seen as a single mother with 4 kids even though their dad does actually lives with them and uses his income on luxuries like owning 4 cars. one of them being getting $500 a month for classes as long none of the kids work (how this is supposed to work or if anything really works like that idk). so as long as they live in their roof they cant work or they get kicked out. problem is she lives in reading pennsylvania which appears to be just a shitty city overall. CRA says a lot of times she doesnt feel safe walking around as an 18 year old girl. even if CRA and her brothers moved out and 3 of them were to look for jobs she doesnt feel confident they can find some there fast enough and have a reliable income for all of them. There way more problems like her dad locking her in a dark room for the whole time her mom was at work because she snitched on her dad that he would go out at night with other women when she was little and believed in ghost but the list can go on [some little bio she wrote about herself for school that can give an idea on what shes willing to share about herself with people](http://imgur.com/a/QPeyL)  ---  **Family Meetings**: apparently CRA and her family has meetings where they supposedly are to speak their mind about any issues oor problems. problem is they are almost always afraid to say anything and things will turn personal and get scolded for thinking anything negative about her parents. Couple months ago when CRA was talking to her 19 year old brother about making sure she will not let her parents get to her financial aid. her mom overheard it outside her room and got mad about not only the money but some sly remark was made (what is was i dont remember). a day after their mom forced a family meeting about it and [this is what happened](http://imgur.com/a/vWKxu)   She recently believes her brother has OCD as her always tries to hit his elbows against something til they bruise and cries uncontrollably. when she brought this up with her parents they again made it about them worried about being accused of neglect and she sent me an [audio clip](http://vocaroo.com/i/s0br429ykSLd) she apparently had 4 recording but only wanted to share one. ive asked for the others but i cant say why as she doesnt know im making this post and this was [CRA complaining about it today](http://imgur.com/a/qvluc)  ---- again its the internet but i have reasons to believe and worry about a friend. I just want to know what can CRA do? what can i say? i cant relate but obviously i have empathy and wish to help. Its easier said than done to say just leave and work or crash with a friend(s) till you can get on your own feet but she said she doesnt trust anyone she knows irl and is close enough to ask for something like that. she is smart enough to know suicide isnt the answer but even after all that she doesnt really wish to report her parents to the police or anything. im open to anything	Yes
830	This was first posted under r/relationship_advice but it was suggested that I might want to post it here too.  My mother been a total Bitch to both me and her husband for over a year. This has got me worried that my stepfather who is the nicest person I know might say enough and leave.   My mom has mental issues and she doesn't always take her medication and that can make her paranoid and really grumpy. She has been really bad this month and when I asked her if she was taking her medication she told me she doesn't need me to tell her when to take her medication.  She has been very hostile towards her husband ( at supper last night he asked her to pass the salt she threw the salt container at him. She said she was sorry later but worried he is going to say enough and I will be stuck with her being even worse because I he helps keep her acting out sometimes.  I don't know what I can do. My stepfather is the best thing ever to come my way. He helps me with so much and treats me like his real daughter. He loves me. He doesn't just say it ( he says it lots ) he also shows me by his actions like never lying to me helping me with school and when I have a problem I know I can tell him and he won't freak out on me. He has family time once a week most of the time my mom doesn't even participate.  My mom never tells me she loves me and most of the time I am sure she would be happier if I wasn't there. This is not new for me. I have been dealing with my mom's shitty parenting all my life but I don't want her to chase away the best thing in my life. I know she should be that and I want her to be but she doesn't care about me half as much as my stepfather. He has been my daddy for 4 years now and I don't want to loose him.  TL;DR My mom is not talking her medication and she is making both me and my stepfather unhappy . I am afraid my stepfather will leave me with her.	Yes
831	This is in Michigan. My sister's boyfriend left her in December for a women 10 years older than him that has 4 kids. My sister has two kids and works as a waitress. He is a marijuana grower and makes all his money under the table.  My sister hasn't done anything through the courts yet.   Since he doesn't have any reported income I'm not sure how much they would make him pay her in child support. I believe he makes around 80k a year and doesn't pay taxes. Not sure the specifics but he drives an expensive new truck and bought a house. They had agreed to an amount but he hasn't kept up with it, has paid less, or not at all some months. Once his excuse was that he was going on vacation to vegas and needed gambling money.  They had agreed to him seeing them every other weekend but sometimes he takes them other times too and he's inconsistent in bringing them home. Last weekend he said Saturday morning and my sister had a babysitter waiting all day. He didn't bring them home till the next day. Another time he dropped them off a day early at the bar she works at, while she was working.  My sister just wants there to be rules to when he can take them and bring them back. And she wants child support because she doesn't make much money compared to him. Now he is insisting on half custody and says he's talking to a lawyer. What are my sisters options? She doesn't really have money for a lawyer. Are there free options out there? Or will I need to pay for a lawyer for her? If the later how do I go about doing this. I'm only 24 and haven't used a lawyer or been to court before. How much would it probably cost or what are likely outcomes. I feel very lost and very bad for my sister. I'm the only person in my family that has finished college and makes good money, so I feel like I need to help if I can in any way.	Yes
832	Basically this situation is really fucked up and my GF is losing her sanity from her psychotic neurotic mother.   &amp;nbsp;  I was told that I should open a case for the mother to request that she should be put in a home under the states care.    We are in Washington County, Oregon.   &amp;nbsp;   The mods asked me to remove the link to the google doc I have written up, so I will be posting it at the bottom of this post.   A user to the original post wrote  &gt;  *If you are drafting and filing something on behalf of another you are engaging in the unauthorized practice of law*  But I was told that in a circumstance like this, when the person is unfit to make the decision to be put in care, you open up a court case and let the state take over and make the decision to put the person under the states care. This person is unaware of her own mental state and the situation, is unable to comprehend what is happening.   Furthermore, I don't have any idea how to write a legal document, so there is no way this post in its current form is a legal document. It's just a document.   Since I didn't make it explicitly clear, there is no personal information here. at all. all names are fake.   &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, I guess my specific question is what steps to take to open up this case, and what kind of actual legal document I should send over to the court to get this going.  Civil court I think.   Really I'd just like advice. Okay here's the post:   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;   REQUEST FOR CASE TO BE OPENED FOR Bonnie Smith  CONTEXT:   &amp;nbsp;  Jenny Smith (Female, 32) lives with her 4 children, mother Bonnie Smith(Female, 64) and Joe Lee(Male, 23, author of document).   &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie is the current caregiver of Jenny’s son James Smith(5), who has a rare debilitating disability [redacted too specific]. Jenny took care of James when Bonnie was not working.   &amp;nbsp;  The situation a few years ago was that Bonnie had her own apartment, Jenny had her own, and she came to the home only for her shifts, though she continually refused to leave the house.    When Jenny moved to another house last year, Bonnie stayed at the new house longer and longer until she became considered a resident. Bonnie now takes care of James at all times. Bonnie also pays around half of the household bills.   &amp;nbsp;  A DHS case was opened last year, where Jenny expressed that for several reasons she could no longer take care of James, among the main reasons being her mental health and that she could not live with Bonnie anymore.   Different options were discussed, the main consensus was that Bonnie would move out of the house and continue taking care of James.   &amp;nbsp;  We no longer believe that Bonnie is mentally sound enough, nor physically healthy enough to take care of herself and James.  We also do not believe she is capable of holding a job.  We believe she may benefit best under the care of the state.   I (Joe) am soon going to attempt to take over the expenses of the house and Jenny is considering options for James including putting him in a home.   &amp;nbsp;  We were already planning to open this case, the timing of when has sped up to now as  Bonnie is currently threatening me (Joe) with a restraining order which would trap Jenny with her longer and affect my career, Bonnie is acting increasingly mentally unsound,  and Jenny is having a mental health crisis from prolonged exposure to this situation.   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  REASONING:   Jenny says she feels she has no control over the house.    Jenny says she feels that she cannot take care of the house while Bonnie is living here.    Jenny says she feels trapped in the house and unable to leave.    Jenny often feels she has to lock herself in her bedroom to avoid Bonnie.    Jenny says her mental health is suffering from Bonnie and adds (paraphrased);    ‘Bonnie has driven her past the limits of her sanity.’   she ‘cannot handle this anymore.’   she ‘is unable to begin healing until Bonnie is gone.’    Jenny says she feels she cannot parent her children.    We both worry the children have been damaged psychologically by Bonnie.   &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie does not respect Jenny’s authority in any way.    Bonnie refuses to leave the house. She makes it difficult for Jenny to leave the house.   Bonnie follows Jenny around the house and will not leave her alone when asked.  &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie acts “neurotic”(as an adjective) and believes that what she has to say must be said to Jenny, believing that there is an urgent matter to the point that she will stand outside of a locked door if Jenny is on the other side for long periods of time,   growing increasingly worried and paranoid as time passes,  more convinced of the urgency of her messages, raising her voice, beginning to whine cries, and changing the inflections of it ( it can sound like 3 people are talking).    If Bonnie is left feeling like this, she will begin pacing around the house mumbling to herself and repeating phrases in a scared tone, then grow angry and yell at anyone nearby including the children, in between randomly chuckling and shaking her head.    Bonnie will not sleep or rest during these times, and gets worse the longer she doesn’t sleep.    Eventually she will begin threaten Jenny (normally that she will turn off Comcast) if she does not do what she wants.   Bonnie is not aware she is acts like this, and grows increasingly defensive if accused, shaking her head and laughing while saying “no, no, no” followed by threats.    Bonnie will refuse to leave the house when she decides she needs to leave for the same reasons.   &amp;nbsp;  The only way Bonnie will leave Jenny alone is if Jenny screams at and name calls her at the top of her lungs, and Bonnie will then calm down afterwards possibly for the rest of the day.   &amp;nbsp;   If Bonnie cannot talk to Jenny, she will tell her paranoid thoughts and worries to the children.  During any fight with anyone, Bonnie will yell in front of the children.  One of Jenny’s children now screams and cries during these fights.   &amp;nbsp;  If Jenny attempts to punish her children,  Bonnie says the children have done nothing wrong, begs “Please stop Jenny, please stop”, then tells the children that everything is okay and that something is wrong with their mother, then rewards them.   &amp;nbsp;   The children have learned that they can manipulate Bonnie, screaming at her and name calling her until they get what they want because she will whine and beg them to stop until she does what they say.     If for example, Jenny tells Bonnie her daughter cannot play video games because she’s grounded, Bonnie will allow her to play when Jenny leaves the room.    Bonnie believes that she should not listen to what Jenny says because Jenny is being manipulated by me(Joe).   &amp;nbsp;   The children have come to know Bonnie’s behaviors as normalcy.    Any attempt at bringing outside family help into the family results in Bonnie yelling at them,    leaving them often traumatized within five minutes as they are not used to this kind of person.   According to Jenny, Bonnie’s physical health is failing and she is barely able to take care of herself.    Bonnie’s mental state has been the direct cause of her to get laid off at every job she has worked in the last decade before she began staying here.   (for example, she was laid off at the most recent company because she repeatedly insisted that not having the American flag raised high enough was illegal.)  &amp;nbsp;   ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS FROM Jenny:  The only time Bonnie acts decent is when she is attempting to manipulate someone.    Bonnie manipulates the children with gifts, and has taught them that if they are not being treated they are not loved.   Bonnie poops and pees herself everyday and rarely bathes.    Bonnie acts abusive and entitled after cleaning the house.   Bonnie spends frivolously spends her income then claims that Jenny has taken her money.    Bonnie attempts to make Jenny and the kids form sentimental attachments to trash so they will never throw anything away.(Note, she is a packrat)   Bonnie makes every situation miserable, is horrible to everyone even in public, no one ever feels peace.    Bonnie denies and immediately forgets anything and everything she does.   Bonnie does not believe nor is aware that she is not wanted in the house.	Yes
833	She spoke to the local sheriff, and he claims that since she left she has no legal right to any of the possessions left in the house or the joint property. The sheriff and my ex-wife don't really care much for one another, and it sounds like he's filling her full of bullshit out of spite. She and the husband are still married, and I don't see how she forfeited her claim to her belongings when she moved out. I think the sheriff is full of shit and just being petty.	Yes
834	Separated from ex for about four years now. We decided to attempt filing for a non contested divorce without the assistance of an attorney. We agree on everything with the exception of who will drive for pick up and drop off during visitation. We really can't get past this and I think it's probably going to result in a contested divorce in front of a judge.   A little background; I'm a mother of five children ages 2-10, three are half siblings and step siblings from my current relationship. We alternate holidays and he gets every other weekend with the option to see them whenever he's in the area. Neither of us is too firm on the visutation schedule, we just do whatever works.   In the four years that we've been sharing custody the kids have never been picked up or dropped off on time. He's picked them up as late as 3am and brought them home as late as 4am on a school night. It's become a huge problem and source of tension. He blames it on my location, says I live too far away but in the four years that we've been separated I've lived in one home while he's lived in several. Whether he's staying with family, friends, in temporary rentals or hotels, I can't be blamed for not consistently living within an appropriate distance from him.   Currently he lives about an hour and 45 minutes away. He wants to meet halfway for pick up and drop off. Under normal circumstances I would agree that that is fair but I've been there and done that with him. In the beginning I would meet him and we would sit in the car for *hours*, sometimes very late into the night waiting for him to show up. I tried bringing them to his house and still, I would sit for hours, waiting. Eventually I stopped meeting him and now it's becoming an issue of him bringing them back at all because he doesn't want to drive. They'll be due back on Sunday and he'll repeatedly say he's coming but not actually show up until several days later.  It's driving me crazy not having a consistent routine and I realize that something needs to be put down on paper so that everyone is equally liable.   In a contested divorce will a judge consider the circumstances before ruling on who should do the driving? Honestly the reason I've put this divorce off for so long is that I'm worried a judge will order me to share driving duty and I can't- I just can't- spend every other weekend sitting in a car with my 5 kids waiting on him for hours.	Yes
835	Long story short.  My wife and I separated for a short time and filed for divorce, divorce was dissmissed.  We have a minor child and there was a child support order issued.  We worked things out after about 6 months and have been back together for several years.    I have been paying the child support all of this time up until 6 months ago when I took a new job.  Our question is how do we request the child support end?  The only forms I was able to find were if the child turned 18 or was emancipated.  I know to dismiss the divorce all we had to do was write a letter to the judge requesting it, is that all tjjat we would need for this?	Yes
836	I live in Alberta Canada.   There is a lot of back story here but I will try to keep it as short as possible.   I'm 31, my sister is 12. My mother is 49.   My mother and I have been no contact for over 2 years (previous periods of no contact on and off since I was 13 and living in foster care).   When my sister was born I was a very active part of her live from the beginning. When she was 2 years old I had my own daughter and actually provided full time care while my mother worked since I was a stay at home mother. My sister and my daughter (almost 10) are very close.   During this last period of no co tact one as not allowed to see my sister for a little over a year, but my sister's father bridged the gap and began to allow me to see her (without my mother knowing). My mother eventually found out and flipped, but inevitably continued to allow us to see her, mostly because my sister freaked out and begged her.   So about a month ago sister's dad called to ask if we would take my sister for an indefinite period of time. Mother was evicted and is unemployed, was planning to move my sister into a tent on the property my sister's dad owned. Sister's dad is also unemployed and living in a broken rv on said property. He receives disability monthly.   There are no current plans for the winter. I don't know how long they expect me to keep her unofficially, and I don't mind having her here, but I personally believe they are both unfit. I would like to try to gain guardianship or custody, but I'm not sure if I have a leg to stand on legslly. We can provide for her financially, but I worry about the back and forth and I worry that any day now my mother will decide she doesn't want her here (this has happened before). I know that if she knew I was planning to try anything she would cut off contact completely.   Some issues: I feel that her parents are not adequately managing her health. She's just over 250 pounds, for one. I know that her pediatrician said she was lrediabetic years ago and they have done nothing to change her diet or exercise habits. They routinely provide her with all manners of junk food in copious amounts.  Her father showed up tonight at 11 pm and took her the 711 and bought her a giant sluroee and chicken fingers after she'd already eaten dinner and snacks here. This is common.   She suffers from anxiety and depression (diagnosed) and takes medication for it. She also has sleeping pills prescribed for occasional use. My mother routinely forgets to send medication home and I don't think she is ensuring she takes it regularly.   They do not take care of her hygiene appropriately, even prior to the eviction. Her hair is always dirty and unwashed. Her clothes are absolutely filthy and smell of cigarette smoke. Her shoes were a size too small and tattered, She was wearing them like slippers. She's gotten her period and they haven't taught her how to use pads properly and don't provide her with deodorant or ensure she showers regularly. In short, she smells pretty bad every time she comes back. They currently do not have access to running water or heat, though her dad has a generator for limited power. I have no idea what they plan to do come winter.  My mother has been exceeding irresponsible financially for pretty much her entire life, but especially lately. She was evicted and is on welfare, but recently purchased a car (got some shmuck to cosign) and an expensive dog (within two months of eviction). She smokes a pack a day. These are just a few examples.   The situation between my mother and my sister's father is extremely unstable. If my mother needs something she will allow him access to her but will randomly decide that he's abusive and can't see my sister anymore, and will tell my sister that she's not allowed to speak to him. This lasts until the next time she needs something, like right now. They both verbally abuse the other in her presence. There has been a few physical alterations but I'm not sure if anything was documented.   Right now she has no idea where she's going to be living, where she'll be going to school (the property they're camping on is over an hour from the city they were living in) or even whether she'll still be here tomorrow. She wants to be here, but is extremely dependant emotionally on my mother and if pressed, would absolutely tell any official that she wants to be with her mom. She's just a kid, I get it, I used to feel the same way.   I considered originally contacting social services , but have been onoffvially advised that because it's summer, and she technically has somewhere to live, god and clothing, they would likely only monitor the situation. If that happens, they will know I called (no-one else knows what's going on, my mother is very secretive) and would cut off contact with me immediately.   For now she's with me, and safe and happy, so I'm sort of just waiting. They are obviously not providing for her financially, I'm paying for everything for her (which again, isn't an issue).  If I wanted to sue them for custody, I know I would probably need lawyer, but do you think I'd have any chance of winning based on the situation currently? I'm not really sure what my best option is here but I am very concerned for her going forward.	Yes
837	I guess I'll start with the situation that led up to me discovering this. Please pardon any spelling errors. I've done the best I can to piece everything together from memory.  Up until yesterday afternoon, I had been staying at my parents' house for a few days with my cats because I was in between apartments and my new unit wasn't ready yet. Then the landlord of my new unit ghosted me after I'd paid my deposit/application fees, and I was stuck trying to figure out where I was going to go when my mom came into the living room and started asking me about it. She accused me of lying about it, so that I could somehow use her/manipulate the family. (I've realized she's a narcissist and all the abuse I endured as a kid all made sense after that but I digress. That's a post for /r/relationships.)  Anyway, one thing led to another and I decided to pack my bag and leave, rather than endure her verbal assault. My dad and sister weren't home to witness this fight (I think she waited for that to be the case before instigating) and in the moment I needed to vent to someone who would believe me, so I texted my half brother in Massachusetts and told him what was going on, that I had a horrid sneaking suspicion that SHE was the evil manipulative monster, and not my biological father.   Now, my mom has always told us that he left her in California with us when my sister was 2 and I had just been born, and moved to Massachusetts where the trucking company that he owned was stationed. He asked her to bring my sister and I up to the east coast so they could all be a family, then slapped her with divorce papers the day she got there. He'd been cheating with another woman and was planning on starting a family with her. The divorce was messy and my mom claims she fled back to California after he was a no-show for the termination of his parental rights. I was maybe 4 or 5 years old at this point. When she got back to California, she happened to reconnect with the man who would eventually adopt us (that happened when I was 8) and married him.   After speaking with my half-brother, who still lives with my biological father and my half-sister in Massachusetts, I decided to reach out to him and hear his side of the story. And it's not what my mom had led me to believe for the past 20 years.  He had been planning to divorce her because she'd grown cold and unloving towards him whenever he came back from trucking. (He didn't know that she'd met my step-dad/legal father before she met him, he thought they met after the divorce when in reality that's probably why she was so distant towards him- she already had someone else.) And he did cheat on her, which is what led to him filing for divorce. But he never asked her to move us to Massachusetts- she chased him up there when she suspected he wanted to leave her and then moved us and herself in with his mother and step-father against his wishes to try and keep him from going through with the divorce. It didn't work of course, and he went through with it anyway. The courts granted him custodial rights to me and my sister at first, and he would have us on the weekends while the divorce proceedings were being finalized. When it was finished, at my mother's request, she was also allowed to move us back to California under the stipulation that 1.) he would have us for vacation time and 2.) she would have to provide him with contact info, i.e. a physical address and a phone number- which she didn't do. In fact, the only reason the courts let her take us back to California was because she said she had a support system there and family to help her (another lie). She took us back to California and never told him where we were. He received one letter from us through CPS but there was no address on it so he couldn't send anything back. She also quietly filed for the termination of his parental rights with her attorney by forging his signature on the paperwork. After paying for the divorce, he couldn't afford to hire another attorney to fight the termination of his parental rights and he'd also would've had to come to California to do so. It wasn't within his power to stop her. When he found out we'd been adopted, he stopped paying child support and the courts threatened to take him to jail but he contested it- because we were legally not his anymore. He sort of gave up trying to speak to us after a few years, until he found her info when we moved to Georgia (presumably because we left the protection of the state of California) and called us wanting to connect when I was 16. It was the first contact he'd had with us since we were taken from Massachusetts. My mom had brainwashed us and painted him as a manipulative monster who would turn us against her if we gave him a chance, so when we spoke to him we basically told him to fuck off and we didn't hear from him anymore. That's how things were left until I called him yesterday.  I really want to sit down with my sister and tell her everything, because this is not the truth either of us grew up with. Through the mess of the divorce and custody battle, we cultivated a closer bond than anyone else in our family but that also means she's very loyal to my mother (she was a bit older than me and remembers a lot more than I do) and has already told me she's not choosing sides in the situation about my mother kicking me out of the house. My mother has texted me since that incident to berate me the way only a narcissist can, and I've refrained from responding. At this point, all that I care about is telling my sister in hopes that the web of lies my mother spun and protected for 20 years will finally fall apart. I'm really not sure at all what advice can be given about this because I have no paperwork to support his claims, but I want to see if there's a way to possibly request it somehow from the courts. My current boyfriend is completely up to date on this situation and has a lawyer I may be able to speak to, but I'd like to gain some clarity here so I can be more organized when we get to that step.     TL;DR I have to find irrefutable proof of my mother's alleged illegal actions to show my sister to support or I'm afraid lose her with the rest of my mother's family.	Yes
838	My brother and his wife are raising 7 kids in poverty (we're not from a good area).  My fiance and I recently graduated from college and both found high paying jobs in a different state.  If possible, we would like to have one of the girls live with us through high school (currently about to start 8th grade) and help make sure she gets into a good college.    What is the process to make this happen?  I have been researching obtaining guardianship, but it looks like it would involve a full investigation and I don't want to risk him losing all of his kids.    Ideally, I'd want them to agree with this and sign over rights so that she can legally live with me, be under my insurance, etc.	Yes
839	I'm considering leaving my husband. I go back and forth on that issue, but one of the biggest points of consideration is that I am a stay at home mom and we live in Hawaii. There is zero chance I would be able to leave him and find a job that pays enough here for me to afford a place for my son and I. Even with child support, it simply isn't attainable or would be a quality of life I would want for us. I would really like to move back to the mainland. I'm not sure where yet; it will depend on where I find work.   Will I get into legal trouble if I move to another state with our son without my husband?	Yes
840	I'm not sure if I have flat out proof of her premeditated planning to fabricate an altercation in order to get a restraining order, but it seems that way.   This is a no fault state, I understand that, so I'm not asking for sympathy about this sad situation, just advice.   I'm a Navy veteran, we were married for nearly all of my Navy career. I got out in 2009 because I couldn't stand her infidelity when I was out to sea. (pathetic, I know.) We now have a 9 year old son with his own story this has effected.  We purchased a boat inside a boathouse in the Seattle area a few years ago. I was in school on the GI Bill at the time but have never made as much money as my wife since the Navy.   We were renters before the boat and boathouse. Here's the kicker. I've always had the VA loan program available, but her grandmother died and left her plenty of money.   It was then that she quit her job, we bought this boat home with plans to renovate it, sell it down the road. It wasn't much, but COULD BE CONSIDERED PART IF HER INHERITANCE, even though we're both equal legal owners.    Since then, I've spent the last year working tirelessly to build equity in the investment we went on. She got another job and likes it. The place is worth much more now than when we bought it, because of my labor.   During this time, I've worked on the home or been a stay at home parent, doing side jobs here and there to support our dream.  She got a boyfriend though. She has insisted on a separation to retroactively excuse her cheating, but that's emotional crap.   Her and my son now spend three nights a week at this boyfriend's house and I'm here on the boat paying moorage.   Questions:  1) How will custody look if we don't already have a parenting plan in place?   2) Can she just uproot me from our family home at a whim because it was purchased in part with an inheritance from her side of the family?  3) Is it unethical to find her new secret address where my son has gone for months, or in my best interest?   Realistically, there is no way she can maintain a boat and boathouse alone. It's not in her wheelhouse. Clearly she plans to move him here to help.   Am I about to be homeless?	Yes
841	Ill try to keep this short. My friend was recently given custody of his child in Texas. Yet he has to pay back child support in Oklahoma. In the mean time she does NOT have to pay child support until she gets paid back in full.   WTF?  Thats the gist of it. I was there when the court awarded him custody of his son so I know its legit on that part. But my friend claims that because he was behind by 6k, he can not receive child support until he pays off the remaining balance.   How does this work? What can be done to fix it? This guy is seriously living in poverty until he can start to receive some money here. He worked 40 hours a week and has more than 60 percent of his check taken by child support. She recently started working again after finishing rehab and still does not have to pay child support.   How does this work and what can be done to fix it?	Yes
842	I never took my husband's last name and now we're divorcing. We have a child together and I'd really like to have the same last name (his). Would he be able to protest my taking the same name as my daughter?	Yes
843	Long story short... Court awarded home to ex wife in 2012 and she signed a decree agreeing to refinance in 60 days and hold me harmless of the debt. She never did this and I couldn't find an attorney who wanted to handle the problem so I basically did nothing.   Now, home is going on 120 days past due (Foreclosure on the horizon) and she notifies me that she's filing for bankruptcy. Spoke with her attorney and he says she's going to let the home go back to the bank and file bankruptcy.  My credit is already slaughtered (570-600?), but I plan on visiting the home tomorrow to see what shape it's in and if she's not living there, entering the home and taking pictures, etc for when I take her to court for this. I have not signed a quit claim, I have the deed in my hand, and I'm still on the mortgage. Even though the divorce decree awards it to her, with all of the rest, do I have grounds to enter the home if she is no longer living there without any legal reprocussions? My concern is if I have to break in and the police get called.  Thanks!	Yes
844	I made a post in r/relationships yesterday and someone brought up a point I hadn't thought of.   I'm 16. I live with my mom and her boyfriend. When I was 4, CPS took me out of her home and gave me to my Dad and step mom. I lived with them for 7 years, but my Dad abused my stepmom and she eventually left. He took me to live with my mom not long after that and I've been here ever since.   Part of the reason they took me away was because my mom's boyfriend is a sex offender and had for sure sexually abused my older brother (they didn't know about me and I wasn't speaking then. I don't remember either way). There were also drugs and neglect, deplorable house conditions and other things.   Things were ok when we moved back in with her for a little while. She and the boyfriend weren't together anymore, but they got back together a few years ago. My mom is sober as far as I know, but she doesn't really do anything other than lay in her room. Her boyfriend is abusive to me and on drugs. He also has a few warrants but I don't know much about it.   When CPS took me away, my mom willingly signed over full custody to my Dad with no visitation. There also was a restraining order in place against her boyfriend for my brother and I but I've never seen it and don't know how long they last.  I don't want to live here anymore. What can I do to get out of here?  Ideally, I want to live with my ex stepmom but I don't know if that's possible. I haven't seen my dad in years. No idea where he is. I don't think my other family members could afford to support me.   Someone suggested calling the child help hotline and I will, but I want to know if legally I'm even SUPPOSED to be here. If not, can I just walk out?  Can my mom do anything if I just call up my ex stepmom and ask her to come get me?	Yes
845	My girlfriend and I are getting married in the next month. We moved the wedding up almost a year because of her grand fathers health.  My question is, could I find quick prenups online that would hold up or do I need to go though a lawyer? Any other advice appreciated.   Before anyone asks, she knows a prenup is a stipulation to our marriage. She knows I have considerable assets and q business I want to protect in the event of divorce. I witnessed my father go though a brutal multi million dollar divorce after 20 years of marriage and don't want to go though that.	Yes
846	"My Gf asked me to go to the beach with her dad and his wife, who is not her mother. We were all drinking one night and me and my gf were playing around wrestling which was a bad idea cause she started to get mad when she thought I was getting too aggressive. We stopped, I thought we were just playing around cause she started laughing and lunged at me which caused me to fall back and she hit her head in the ground hard. I immediately asked if she was ok and tried to check on her but she freaked out and said leave me alone, don't talk to me etc. and ran to her room with our 8 month old son who was sleeping. I kind of just layed there and was like what the hell just happened before going inside. Well her dad was in the doorway asking what was wrong and she tells him that I body slammed her to the ground which was not true. She claims she wanted my attention and her emotions always get the best of her when she is drinking. So anyway, her dad starts yelling at me saying all these things like next time I touch her he is gonna beat my ass and all this stuff making me out to be some abusive boyfriend. At this point I am looking him straight in the eyes saying ""I hear you"" ""I understand"" and we are both raising our voices. He then threatens me by saying ""I will go to your house and slap your mother"" this obviously pisses me off and I go on to say ""no the fuck you won't"" etc. next thing I know I'm hit the eye and we are wrestling around in the kitchen. He has me by the hair and is beating me in the side of the head while my gf is trying to break it up and he won't stop. He was also drinking. I can't even say if I hit him or not but I was just trying to defend myself. I eventually get up and say ""you got me, you win"" he calls me a piece of shit and I start packing all our things to leave. Later I find out he told my gf ( his daughter) fuck you and he pushed her out the door and when he did he ended up clipping her on the chin with his first. At this point I have no idea what I should do, I have a huge black eye, bruises over my head and my nose was bleeding. I have pictures of everything after it happened."	Yes
847	"Hi Everyone,  I'm in the middle of one of the most messed up situations I have ever heard. As a  start I am BP1 and dependent on my wife . About 10 months into our marriage my wife started constantly skipping work to meet up with a friend's brother and fool around in our car. She got bold enough to rent a hotel room to have sex with him and I caught her. This is the time she exposed herself as a narcissist as she really couldn't show any remorse.  The day I found out her parents just showed up and her mom was very angry. They went on a short walk and Upon returning her mother completely changed and said that my wife has been living in fear of me and that we should be separated. My wife talked privately with me and cried and pleaded to stay and I said whatever you told your mom obviously was taken very seriously. Her mom went into Super protection mode and did not hold my wife accountable whatsoever, while my wife blocked me out of everything.  I start living at the house alone with my dog and two cats and start losing weight and making positive changes. I talk daily with my wife with a lot of communication that was always attempting to be positive. Fast forward a few weeks her brother has a wedding near our one year anniversary. After the wedding she went to her friend's house to meet up with her Affair partner and ""see how each other feels."" I snapped the picture of her car and his car and texted her that I was done and to feel free to stop by the house and talk. I was then completely mind f***** for about 5 hours until I finally realized she didn't want to come back she just wanted that as an option. I asked her to leave and she claimed to go home to her mom's but lied and admitted later she went to the""domestic abuse shelter."" She continued by saying that she was going to commit suicide and the counselors at the shelter wanted her to go to the hospital. My best friend died November last year from suicide, looking back I see now she was playing on that to keep me roped in.  A week later I stop by Petco after a therapy appointment and see the affair Partners vehicle. So I stop and wait about 5 minutes because I wanted to ask him if he was still seeing my wife / aware of suicide threats. She had been playing this oh my phone randomly shuts off game like I'm retarded for days before this so I had very little contact and was desperate for a smidgen of Truth. I was shocked when out of the corner of my eye I see my wife driving in our car with him in the passenger seat. She saw me and turned around in the parking lot so I jumped in my car and caught up. I videotaped so that way she was unable to narc her way out of it. I foolishly thought she would pull over and say okay The Jig Is Up.  Of course her Affair partner called the cops  and they pulled over into a parking lot and so did . They asked if I was following that car and I said hell yeah that's my wife and her Affair partner and she is supposed to be in a domestic abuse shelter and suicidal. Her response to them was oh I am terrified of him he carries a gun. The police asked I said no and it moved on very quickly. They said it sounds like it's time to move on and I said no crap dude. They were super cool mostly because I was obviously taking a video and not trying to physically do anything at all and it was apparent. She felt she was completely untouchable, but had finally been caught red-handed publicly. Several days later I get served with an order to appear in court for one of those blasphemous ex parte orders of protection which is early next week.   She is claiming I was stalking her because I ""knew of her whereabouts"" and that I was carrying a gun around the house and that she was in fear of her life. She has explained over and over to her mom dad myself and anyone that I have and never will harm her in any way. But for it to fit the statue it has to be fear of her life. The third thing she referenced was from a year-and-a-half ago and she claimed when she bailed me out after a bar fight I was in a rage and try to Veer her car off the road. This was about a three-minute drive on the way to my pdoc / therapist. It even reads like complete b*******. I believe completely that I am about to walk in there and get crucified. Her narc is so strong in so many ways. She is the queen of isolating me and telling one side of stories. It's clear to me that she wants the house to herself without me around so she can move her boyfriend in and also get revenge for being caught red-handed because that's basically criticism and that's not something she deals with. Sorry for the wall of text there are more details but I try to keep it short. I will probably come back through Andrea edit. Any help advice anything would help at this point."	Yes
848	"Hi - I (28f) have a 6.5 year old son from a previous (never married) relationship where the biological father is not involved. He is court-ordered to pay a little child support but that's it. Nothing as far as custody goes - but he won't sign off his paternal rights.  I am getting married next year to a man who my son knows as dad, as he's the only father figure he's ever known and has been there since he had just turned 1.  What changes once we get married? More specifically, what rights will my fiance have over my/our son once we are legally married? Does he become a ""legal guardian""? Would he be able to keep him if I ever die? I really know nothing on this topic so any light shed on it would be helpful."	Yes
849	"Long story short, when I was born, my father left my mother (both early 20s) because he didn't want me and wasn't ready to be a Dad. He wanted to keep partying, going to bars and living that lifestyle.  They were married when I was born, but shortly after, got a divorce.  My father was ordered to pay child support until I was 18, but he never did. My Mom was so busy working 2-3 shitty jobs to keep us stable and so upset with my Dad that she never had the time, willpower or resources to do anything about it. She just gave me the whole, ""He'll get his in the end."" speech about karma.  I haven't spoken to my father in over 15 years. Since my early teens.  Well, I'm older now and my adult mind can process what actually happened and I'm not okay with it. I'm 29 now and I was wondering if there is any way I can sue him and collect the money he never paid so I can try to force my Mom to take it. I know she's prideful, but I want to make things right because she still works those same shitty jobs as she did when I was younger and she deserves better than that.  Is there anything I can do legally about the back child support he never paid? I know he has it, because he **still** lives with his mother  (my grandmother), doesn't pay any bills, and my uncle (his brother) tells me that my Dad is into bad drugs and constantly bets thousands of dollars on stupid football games.  It's infuriating what he put my Mom through and I want justice. I'm just hoping that legal action doesn't have to come from my Mom, because I know she will just tell me to let it go like she did.  Any legal advice you guys can offer would be great. Thanks."	Yes
850	Hi,  How can I get a marriage license for a wedding that's held overseas? The ceremony would be next summer, which I think excludes some states. We want to get married under US law, by a person who fills the US requirements (e.g. pastor), not a foreign government official. Is there a way to manage this? Thank you!	Yes
851	"So my brother and I have been living together.  We are both adults (I'm 27 he's 34).  Last week we got into a fist fight.  He managed to get on top of me and attempted to gouge out my eyes before I forced him off by getting my pocket knife out and slashing at him.  That night after I got home from work I tried to talk to him and he said ""the next time you hit me I will assume you intend to kill me and I will take my knife, and I will gut your fat sorry ass.  I will carve your fucking face off before I gouge your eyes out.""  Now normally that would be enough for an arrest but I hit him about 20 times and gave him a mild concussion.  I want to make sure I can press full charges and have his 2 kids put into foster care with out legal repercussions my self"	Yes
852	Hi. My husband and I, married 11 years. I am thinking of leaving my husband. He originally purchased the house before we married, but I have significantly improved it, ie repainting, tuck pointing, re-grouting, and basically building 2 new rooms out of a sleep out. I don't want it to get messy, I guess I just want to know where I stand if leave.  As he owned the house before we married, do I have any claim on it? I am worried as we have 3 children. I am happy to  move somewhere else, but I don't quite know how to move forward.	Yes
853	Im going to try and make this as short as possible. Boy meets girl. Boy gets married. They have a kid after a few months. Boy losses job and place to provide for family. Family moves into girls parents. Parents kick boy out for arguing with wife about finances. Boy leaves to 'make it easier'. Now, how do I go about ruining there lives? Im already going to never allow them to see the grandchild they love so dearly. There is alot of information, If you read this far please ask anything you need to better understand the situation and give me proper assistance.	Yes
854	Colorado. I was assaulted by my (ex)partner last night, him being taken to jail and I to the hospital. He was seen by a judge today and I have a Mandatory Protection Order that specifically mentions the apartment we are both on the lease for.   About an hour ago I received a three day notice to quit for substantial violation. Am I out of luck or is there protection for me since I was the victim?  I will be calling around when offices open tomorrow, but right now I am scared I will have to move on my own in three days. If I left anything out I am very sorry.  TL;DR He broke the lease by assaulting me. Do I have to move or can I fight a notice to quit?	Yes
855	I purchased a duplex from the estate of the homeowner, who about 2 years before he died had rented the other half of the duplex to a young-ish couple. The lease is month-to-month. One major remodel of the half the homeowner had lived in later, I'm preparing to tackle the side with in situ tenants. So on  April 30 I served them with a 90 day notice that the lease would be terminating as of Aug 1. Immediately they stopped paying rent, &amp; early July I filed s 72-hour pay rent or quit for the three months unpaid rent. Of course they didn't pay, &amp; so next is the forcible entry &amp; I had the first appearance last week. They agreed to move out by August 1, so if that happens it is fine. Here is the problem: part of the stipulated order was I got to do an inspection of the unit, &amp; what was over there was just appalling: rotten food, stench of dog feces, unbelievable amounts of trash &amp; garbage everywhere. And they have a little 15-16 month old kid in the middle of this. There was also make evidence of domestic violence -- every hollow core door had 1 or 2 fist size hikes. Also, there's a pit bull that already has attacked one of the tenants, causing the dad to break an ankle (and  a window). Also lots of screaming could be heard at times. Also also I do a free legal search &amp; it turns out mom has been charged with oxycodone possession (dropped) &amp; theft (pled guilty), dad is a registered sex offender for a pretty gruesome sex crime on a young girl (served time), &amp; both have multiple evictions. Also, during the course of the eviction, both got extremely upset that I might be photographing pill bottles, which they said they were in the process of throwing away.  So, what I am worried about is this cute little kid. If I bring this up to an attorney, will he/she gave a duty to report to CPS if I show the pictures of the dangerous squalor this kid has been living in? Or is this hopeless?  This is Oregon.	Yes
856	Simply put my husband wants to name our daughter something gross. I don't know if he is serious or not. But I am not ok with the name. Can I name her without his consent? OR will she just have to be named Baby A until we can agree on something? I dont want her to grow up thinking we hate her.  The name for the curious: Marc-Geraldine. Yuck.	Yes
857	My grandfather is trying to adopt me I'm 19 if that matters to make a long story short I've lived with my grandparents since I was 2. Parents are divorced dad has no rights and my mother's okay with the adoption while he was looking for a lawyer idk if we even need one but. He found this http://www.411legal.net they said it was a $1.99 for a 7-Day trial and $20 a month after that so is this bs?	Yes
858	My boyfriend's ex is taking him to court for additional child support. Without getting too much into the details, because I don't believe they are relevant...  He has been asked to fill out one of those income/expense worksheets. Obviously he has filled it out with the amount of the bills he pays (his portion of rent, etc) but it also asks for household size. We live together but are not married. Am I correct in assuming that the household size is 1 and not 2?   We live in New York, if it matters.	Yes
859	I am a recovering alcoholic. my son was taken into CPS custody because of an ongoing case where  my ex calling cps on me and me on him.. we were a couple of selfish, short sited, idiots.   Its been a year im recovering. Ive done class after class, PARENTING, IOP&amp; SOP, MRT, AA, CHOOSING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS, PERSONAL THERAPY. I see my son once a week for one hour. Ive never had a failed drug test or missed a visit with my son. I am a happily sober person. I never thought I would be here. I have a great apartment a support system and a Job that i love.   Before my son was taken I want to be clear he was not abused nor neglected . He has never missed a doctors appointment or a dental appointment. He was actually spoiled with love and attention. I love my son and I would never hurt him. I needed to learn coping skills regarding stress and anxiety and i believe i have after a year of intensive therapy.  I am even  grateful to have had this. experience. I didnt realize that my life was unmanageable in every way. I feel like im on solid ground for the first time in my life. I was homeless as a youth due to my abusive addict bipolar mother.   The problem.   My appointed Attorney is bullying me to give PMC (permanent managing conservative) to his paternal grandparents. She herself said no one is going to take all of my rights.. then she does mental gymnastics and tells me that If i bring this case and the judge hears all the bad testimony ill lose him and if I have other kids they will be taken immediately at birth. Im of the opinion that yes... of course I fucked up to get my self in this situation. The judge is not going in there expecting to present me with mother of the year award. She is going to examine the evidence and decide of im capable? (I think) My lawyer wont talk about it. She is only interested in having me sign tge agreement. Its my opinion they wouldnt make things up if there case was good enough without the lies! right?    Im having a hard time with their lies. The DA&amp;CPS.   1. They have 50 ppl lined up to bad mouth me to tge judge.   2. A person at the Doctor's office that I go to for antidepressants has made a claim that i was walking up and asking other ppl what they take  3. they said 2 of my sons drivers are going to testify that i followed them...   1.Day one of the trial they only had 5 ppl show up.. My lawer said they dont need 50 ppl to win.  2. I went to my dr appointment one of the nurses was shocked to hear what they claimed. he scoward my records and said no one has made any such claim.  3. I hope they do put the drivers on the stand my google maps tracks my every move. To be clear I NEVER entertained the idea of following them..   I feel like they are all corrupt. Especially my Attorney.  On the day of meditation, I spent 8 hours refusing to sign most of my rights away with intense pressure from my attorney and the mediator. I stood my ground and refuse to sign over my rights.  This is when the DA said they were ready to call 50 people to testify against me.   That one really scared me. I almost signed the custody orders, until I asked to see the list... it was a joke! 75% were people I've never met, for example the arresting officer who was called to a domestic dispute between my ex and his girlfriend another example was a group leader of a class my ex took  At the end of mediation My lawyer was furious that I wouldnt sign. She said that was the best offer i could hope for and she asked me 20x if im good with having all of my rights taken away because if we go to trial that is what will happen...   I agreed to continued negotiations via email. I was asked to sign again after a step up to 8 hours of supervised a month after 6 mos. I told attorney that I could not sign. She said she was speechless.. and she immediately sent an email to a friend of mine to gain an allie in putting pressure on me.   I want to fire my attorney but how.? Least trial date began and ended with me saying my name on the record.. We go back in 10 days ig i ask for a new lawyer they will likely deny my request and and claim i am only trying to prolong the inevitable.   Honestly..  I feel like they all got together and agreed to just bully and lie until I gave up.  Can anyone give me dome insight as to why this is happening and how do i protect myself and my son from being torn apart?   TLDR Appointed Attorney is bullying me into signing most of my rights away. The DA, CPS and my own Attorny are threatening me with fabricated stories that I have been able to conclusively prove otherwise.	Yes
860	My grandfather has dementia and my mom and him set up my mom to be his financial and medical POA. Located in Illinois.  It's been 4 years and my mom has slacked completely. She hasn't done his taxes, some bills have gone unpaid, and last but not least his debit card bounced because she didn't transfer money to it (really confused him and was a bad day).  I'm not sure my mom wants to give up this title but it's at a really bad point. It won't be an easy conversation but something needs to be done.  What are my best / worst case scenarios?  Thanks.	Yes
861	Hi,  I have 2 things that I need to do, but I'm not sure which forms I need to fill out.  1) I would like to file a motion for reconsideration because the court order is missing some important items that were supposed to be included (and were mentioned in the court transcript).  I don't see a form on the Superior Court website that allows me to file for reconsideration. How should I go about doing this? It's already been 6 months since the original judgment was made.  2) I'm being taken to court for contempt of court regarding child support by my ex-husband. I would like to respond to my ex's motion but I'm not sure which forms to fill out.  Can anyone give me some guidance?	Yes
862	I'm a guy and will be getting married later this year. As I understand it, here in California, it's $435 to file a change of name petition. My fiancée will also be changing her name, to take me (new) surname. I *believe* the $435 covers a family, assuming the changes are done at the same time. If so, makes sense for us to change them together. Can anyone verify?	Yes
863	Hello Reddit , and thank you for taking the time to read my story.  Throwaway my obvious reasons. I have two kids. A daughter who is 8 and a son that is 5.  When I gave birth to the both of them, I was staying with him, because I didn't have a place to stay myself. As time went on, things went South and we ended up not being able to be in a relationship with each other.  Ever since then, I have been trying to get partial custody because I have a place and would like to see my kids. However, they keep on delaying indefinitely,  because the grandfather has a terminal illness and they're in the grieving process currently. Recently, the father officially has passed, may he rest in peace, and now they're requesting even more time. What can I do? Before they were requesting time because he was very ill, and now they're requesting more time because he died.   The FOMK isn't even letting me see the kids in any shape or form. They're doing whatever they can to keep me out of the kids life and that's completely unfair. I don't even know what school my youngest son goes to because he hides everything regarding them from me.  I have tried to get partial custody. Filed for child support. What can I do Reddit? Is there anything I can do to stop them from delaying indefinitely like they have been?  Also, his aunt is an attorney and is helping them through the process. What can I do Reddit?   Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for reading.	Yes
864	"My ex wife and I divorced about a year ago.  We have an 8 year old daughter and live in a suburb of Pittsburgh.  We have no custody arrangement for our daughter, as we both work full time jobs and rely on each other for childcare.  Personally, this has benefited me because I get the majority of time with my daughter.  However, lately, I feel like my ex has been really reckless with taking care of my daughter.  Examples:  - During the school year, it was my ex's job to pick our girl up from school at 2:50, at the latest.  She neglected to pick her up often and I would have to leave my 9-to-5 job downtown and drive against traffic for 30-40 minutes to go pick up my daughter, if her aunt or grandmother could not go pick her up.  This happened so many times over the two years she attended school that the school sent us both letters saying if it happened again, they would be forced to report it to child protective services and present this to the magistrate.  My ex's defense is ""I work nights and my alarm doesn't wake me up.""  - She recently moved to a new house in a different neighborhood.  Evidently, based on my child's explanations to me, once I drop her off with her mom in the morning, she basically spends all day taking care of herself while mom sleeps.  This includes running around the neighborhood with a neighbor child or playing at their house.  Often when I come to pick up my daughter in the evenings, I have to then turn around and walk over to this other person's house just to get my kid.  My ex's excuse:  ""I tell her she has to check in every two hours.""  When asked what happens if she doesn't check in, would she even wake up to notice? ""I set an alarm on my phone to wake me up"" (nevermind the above point of an alarm not waking her to pick up her own child from school...)  - I have reason to believe that she occasionally abuses prescription medication.  She worked at a hospital in the ER in the past and now currently works for a nursing home.  In the past, when we were still living together and were on the skids, I was doing laundry one night and a loose valium fell out of her scrub pocket.  This is coupled with the fact that she has admitted to having some drinking problems in the past, while we were separated but not divorced.  This is in addition to a really weird interaction we had this last Saturday where she arrived at my house, unannounced at 2pm, claiming she was there to pick up our daughter. (1. she rarely if EVER picks up my daughter from my house. 2. I always have my daughter on the weekend)  She mumbled a bit about being there to pick up our daughter, forgot and thought it was Tuesday (1. It's Saturday 2. She's literally never picked up our kid from my house on a weekday, I come home from work on weekdays and pick her up from HER house) and then she mumbled an apology and drove off...  I'm not terribly familiar with substance abuse, but that seemed extremely weird.  My Ex's excuse: ""I had been working all day and was really tired and just totally exhausted and out of my mind.""  When I told her it would be easily confused with being stoned, she simply said ""I'm not on drugs""  - She recently decided, against my wishes, to take in her 17 year old cousin who is currently being tried along with her boyfriend for selling pills, stealing her sister's gun, shoplifting from a department store and then getting pulled over by the police.  She is currently on house arrest (I guess?  I'm hardly an expert.  She's to stay there under 24/7 supervision until her court appearance and not to be left alone or see her boyfriend until after the trial.)  Anyway, I expressed my opinion that I did not want my daughter to be there with her and that I thought it was a dumb decision to allow her cousin to stay there and that it was her immediate family's responsibility.  She then told me that I could pay for childcare while I was at work, since I was the one that had a problem with the arrangement.  (I make 38k a year.  I just can't afford to do that for a month, a majority of my income would go to just paying for daycare.  I will be starting a job in a few days where I'll start making about 20% more, but it won't be in time to help with this.)  I was sort of coerced into moving here against my will when we were still married, and I can't lean on family for support, as my closest family is 6 hours away.  She currently is spending her days at my ex's house and I pick her up every night to spend the night with me.  - Today, the reason that drove me to make this post -- I went to pick up my daughter from her house at 6:20 like I always do, and my ex's housebound criminal cousin answers the door, tells me my ex isn't there and that my daughter is across the street with the neighbors.  I check with the neighbors and she's not there, hasn't been all afternoon.  I go back to the house and her cousin says she doesn't know where my ex or my daughter went off to.  I haven't heard from my ex all day.  She's not answering anyone's phone calls or text messages.  I call her family, no one knows where they are, but all basically have something to say along the line of ""I don't know what the hell her problem is, I never hear from her and I don't approve of what's going on with your daughter.""  About an hour later my ex finally responds to my calls and calls me back.  She took my daughter an hour and a half away to go out on a boat on the lake with her new boyfriend.  After about 10 minutes of me (embarrassingly) losing my shit, she finally admits ""I dropped the ball"".  Like it wasn't a big deal.  So, this is basically what's been going on.  And to be honest, I don't want to do it at all, but I'm thinking it may be time to look into filing for custody.  I didn't do it when we were filing for a no contest divorce because 1. It seemed unfair to my daughter and I didn't want to make things more stressful. 2. Her family is well to do and there's a lot of rumors about her dad being mobbed up.  In some of our more fiery arguments in the past, if I brought up custody, she threatened that her dad's lawyers would bury me and I'd never see my daughter.  3. If I got sole custody, I don't know if I have the support in this city to be a single dad and I'm pretty sure I'd have to move back home to the midwest, about 6 hours away until I could figure out what to do.  I'm really upset right now and I don't know what else to do.  Hell, I don't even really know what questions to ask.  This really isn't something that's in my wheelhouse and I have no experience with this sort of thing.  Do I have a case if I was to file for custody?  I know courts tend to favor the mothers in these scenarios, and I don't want to run the risk of losing my daughter.  How much would this cost?  At my new position with the raise, I think I could put away about $400-$500/month, currently, I don't have any savings, really.  I've been wiped out with some bad car stuff and it's zeroed my savings.  Is there any sort of evidence I could be compiling or a case I could be making at this time?  I have a lot of people and friends who know what's been going on and they have all said that they would be happy to help in any way possible, but my friends and family are all low class working schlubs and I couldn't ask them for money.  I don't know /r/legalhelp...  I just need help, or at least a direction to be pointed in."	Yes
865	Hi Reddit,  My wife and I have decided to separate due to unforeseen circumstances. (She left me for another fellow).  Anyways, I need help.   So I've spoken with a family lawyer and she gave me a bunch of papers for both of us to fill out regarding our financial situations. Including the last 3 years of tax returns.   We are going to both sign an unofficial separation agreement that I've drawn up. Once done I'll hand that to my lawyer to draw up an official agreement.   We are being surprisingly rational to each other and I want to know if this financial paper BS can be waived and we can just simply sign an official separation agreement and be on our ways.   We both think it's a waste of time and I was told once the official agreement was drawn up, she will still have to retain a lawyer of a different firm to explain it to her.   We just have the desire to end this as quickly and painlessly as possible.  Lawyers ain't cheap.   If you need more information let me know.   All responses are appreciated.	Yes
866	"I'm still not 100% sure on how this happened which is why I'm coming to you guys.  So a few years ago I started college as a freshman and got some student loans to help. My (abusive) father made me take out this ""parental loan"" or something like that for $15,000 to pay for school. I was 18 at the time and didn't really know the details, he basically took the loan out himself. Long story short, I ended my abusive relationship with him a year later and dropped out of school to deal with my mental health issues and lived with my mom for a while.  Fast forward to now: I'm trying to apply to another school and my old school is telling me that my transcripts are being withheld. Apparently my father cashed out the loan, took the money for himself, and didn't make any payments or inform me of what he did. (So technically I owed all of that money to the school now?) The school was sending him bills and and notices to pay and he was just ignoring them and not telling me about them. There was so many missed payments on the loan that it eventually went to a collection agency. Now they're telling me the only way to get my transcripts back is to pay back all of that money.  Is there any legal recourse I can take? I really don't know what to do right now.  Thanks for taking the time to read this."	Yes
867	As the title states, my evil MIL let it be known today that she secretly obtained a DNA test on my 8 month old daughter without mine or my husband's consent or knowledge while she was babysitting our child for an hour. I don't know what she thought the outcome would be, I suppose that part doesn't matter.   Apparently, she obtained a cheap drug store paternity test and swabbed my daughter and her husband's (my daughter's grandfather's) cheek. She must have forged mine or my husband's signature because neither of us knew they did this. My husband has explicitly stated he did not consent to the test and I obviously did not either.   I am angry and I feel completely violated on behalf of my child.  From what I've read, a lab needs one parent's consent before performing these tests. Again, my husband did not consent and I did not consent. Either they forged our signatures or the lab they used is up to some super shady stuff.   I live in Missouri. I plan on filing a restraining order against them first thing in the morning as well as speaking with an attorney about any charges that can be filed. Am I just reaching here or is what they did truly illegal and reprehensible by law?   Can the lab be sued for not obtaining proper consent?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
868	"Before I get barraged with ""You'll ruin your relationship."" posts, let me start with the fact that we have spoken about this and are BOTH on board with this decision.  We live in a state that does not have common law marriage and have been together a little over 6 years. During those 6 years, we've always divided up assets regardless of who made how much etc. We did this by having a single joint account that we would put money into each month (no direct deposit). My question is, how much would a prenup protect the two of us, and our finances, if we got married and things fell apart? Quick run down: I make roughly $110,000 to $140,000 (depending on overtime). She makes around $25,000-$35,000 (overtime again). I purchased a house while we've been dating, it's in my name only, and I paid for it 100% on my own. She's obviously helped out with groceries, bills, and handled her own expenses. Would a prenup keep the house in my name?   Also, not that I like talking about it, but I will be inheriting about $600,000 worth of real estate and property in the future. Would a prenup be able to keep all of that inheritance in my name, even if we are married while it happens?   I love this girl to death and want to be with her forever, but I've had friends and friends parents who've been screwed over because of marriage. Losing houses, paying alimony, forfeiting a huge percentage of pensions... it's so scary to think that you could be with someone for 20+ years, and they have the power to simply leave and take half of it with them.   Any advice?"	Yes
869	"My ex-husband was ordered 3 years ago during our divorce to pay child support. Before I get a bunch of hate PMs -- I work, I didn't ask to keep the kid more. He didn't want more time. I don't enjoy never having any time to myself and always having to do everything on my own. It sucks, ok. I would gladly pay him the $350 he is required to pay me a month to get any sort of break on healthcare, child care, or even not having to use every single vacation day of work for a sick day or because school is out. Do you know how great it would be to just have to pay $350 a month for all child related expenses. It would all be worth $350 because that is nothing compared to the cost of a kid. I spent $100 on shoes the other day. Shoes. He needed shoes for school and water shoes for water activities and nice required shoes    for graduation. I swear to god I just bought him shoes 3 months ago that don't fit now. So before you come at me with the collecting child support shame just think for a second about how much it costs you to live and double that. Double all your costs. It isn't easy on one income. It isn't easy on two incomes.   My problem is my super pissed ex-husband who sees him kids the last weekend of every month likes to make it uncomfortable or hard to get my child support. In the last year, he has stuck the check in an actually bucket of slop, he has stuck it in a zip lock baggie of dog shit, he has taped it to my roof, he has tried to get me to play an elaborate scavenger hunt, he has driven to my son's elementary school on a day that isn't his custody day and stuck in my son's backpack and not told anyone and when I asked him where it was he has said "" guess where?"" which lead to an elaborate search of the house and two days of a guessing game (it was well hidden in a tiny pocket in the backpack and my son had no idea his dad even put anything in there, he has buried it in my back yard with my son's help, he has hand delivered to my HR department at work with ""for the bitch"" on the envelope, paid me cash in all $1, he has threatened to pay me in change (which he has not done yet), and he has written me 350 different checks for $1 each.   It is always something and it is getting old. I have not accept checks before (the ones covered in things) and he has eventually written me new ones after giving him a hard time.   I am exhausted. This is annoying. He doesn't work a consistent job so often times a garnishment would be hard. He always pays on time without hesitation but this is insane.   How much of this do I have to put up with? Is this just something I have to deal with for the next 11 years?"	Yes
870	Background: partner and her ex split up five years ago with a one year old daughter. My partner's been the sole caregiver ever since. We've been together three years, and I think of her kid as a daughter to me, too. Her ex has a new partner, and a new kid with her. He's hit his new partner at least once, and  I think been charged for it, though I'm not 100% on that.  The ex is meant to pay child support (which is like, $70 a month or something, practically nothing, and he hasn't paid it in like six months anyway). I guess he doesn't want to do it any more, because recently he's been pushing my partner real hard for me to adopt their daughter. We've been interested in getting guardianship, but adoption will mean (correct me if I'm wrong) that he ceases to have any obligations towards his kid, and as shitty as he might be, my partner and I both kinda feel like that's not really our call to make? We've talked about it and always figured we'd give her daughter a choice when she was old enough to actually comprehend the consequences.   When we told her ex this he didn't agree with this decision, and is now saying that he intends to sue for full custody of his daughter. She doesn't know him, has no relationship with him and hasn't seen him in years. He clearly wants no relationship with her and is just doing this to fuck with my partner, and I think it'll be really tough on her daughter to go through this. She knows she has a biological dad out there somewhere, but doesn't need to know its this fuckwit, at least at this age.  Is what he's doing legal? Isn't it kinda unethical for a lawyer to take on his case, given that he has no shot of winning and clearly doesn't even want the kid and is just doing it to be a dickhead? How should we respond to this?	Yes
871	Throwaway Account  I [19] recently found out from my sister [25] was molested by our father when she was a child, leading up to high school. I won’t go into detail about it, but it was bad, and hearing her tell me about it, listening to her voice and looking in her eyes, was one of hardest things I’ve ever had to listen to.  Me, my sister, as well as older brother grew up in an abusive house. I was beat as a child for almost anything, as were my siblings. I always knew my father to be a bad man. I always just carried on so I could do my own thing; so I could do good in high school, so I could go off to college and get my degree and not get involved with police and such. Never told any authorities about the abuse we endured, and even lied when CPS got involved when I was in 6th grade and asked me about being abused. There was no follow up.  This is entirely different though. My sister asked me to tell no one, and I haven’t (except this post of course). Its not something that I can just let go of, and know that he can get away with doing that to her. She’s 25 now, married and extremely successful, and this happened when she was younger, up to around 14/15.  She doesn’t talk with my parents at all, and has been seeing a therapist for a while now as I understand.  I don’t know what I can do even if I can convince her to act against my father. I’m not familiar with how the stature of limitations works, or how police would proceed with a 10-year-old case of child molestation, as well as not having any evidence other than my sisters word. And for those raising questions if it even happened in the first place, I assure you my sister would never lie about this	Yes
872	"So I have this friend who is currently trying to undergo a divorce. He wanted to start now, but he has to have 1k up front. So it will be about two ish weeks. Well, assuming child support doesn't stack up against him.   Anyway, his soon to be ex is a sucky person. She is overdramatic and always tries to start problems. Throughout their thirteen year marriage, she would walk out or kick him out and always do something dramatic to try and get him to chase after her like they do in all the romcoms.   This last time was it for him. She slapped him in the face and he shoved her back and held her against the wall, telling her to never touch him again. He didn't slap her or hurt her in any way. He restrained her. So what does she do? Goes out and gets a restraining order against him and feigns ""domestic violence"" and deems him unsafe. She realized that was pushing it over the limit because not even hours after filing it, she tried dropping it.   Whether it was through text or messenger, she would spam message him appologies and threats intermittently, which I know is grounds for her not being able to get a restraining order later on. Well, ""protective order"" I think.  He is done with that nonsense. And this woman finally realized how good she had it before. She has a job, but it doesn't pay well. And pretty much the moment after she did this and they began the ""separation"" phase, she was demanding money. She wanted like, 1500 bucks per month in child support. (We used a chart and consulted a lawyer for the actual cost he should pay.) She dropped the order the following week as soon as she could and has been repeatedly begging and threatening him throughout the last three weeks now.   She is also wanting him to pay rent even though he doesn't live there, or she will take the kids away.   He doesn't have a problem helping his kids, but we know if he keeps helping her she is just going to make it worse for him. And she said that if they do a divorce, she will make it harder on him than necessary because she is vindictive. She wants to do a legal separation so that she can still have power over him.  We have logs of all the messenger conversations and texts between them as written record and he avoids speaking in person as long as possible. He is paying child support and is picking up his kids a couple times a week.   But he tries to keep minimal contact with her, even when she continues threatening him and saying questionable or incriminating things.  Should he continue speaking sparingly? Does he need to go ahead and pay all their bills? And what should be his course of action throughout this ordeal? Sorry if I'm missing details, I'm typing this on my phone while waiting on a game of Black Ops to queue up. I will add more later."	Yes
873	"A friend of mine was born in Mexico and became a US Citizen at age twenty-something. He still has nationality in his country of birth (Mexico). He does not Mexican IDs...whatsoever. His name now (after naturalization) is different than the one on his birth certificate (Certificate: First Name Paternal Last Name Maternal Last Name | Current: First Name Last Name Suffix).  For some reason or another, he had to get a Mexican ID as the government entity in Mexico which requested an ID does not accept his American passport.  When he went to get a Mexican ID (voter card) at the Mexican consulate in the US the clerk registered the name as First Paternal Maternal as it is on the birth certificate. When asked to verify all the information was accurate my friend noted the issue and requested it be resolved to which the response from the clerk was ""in Mexico, you will forever be First Paternal Maternal.""  Did the clerk just change someone's name? Does anyone know how that works?"	Yes
874	"My boyfriend and I met at work, and both had their health insurance. I quit after getting a different job, but I don't have health insurance. ""I'll just add you to mine"" he says, because we knew that company doesn't require marriage. Neither of us are interested in getting officially married, and if we were, it wouldn't be right this second.   Well, after looking into adding me to his insurance, it does say it requires a domestic partnership affidavit.  As far as I can tell, you can get one of those in a bunch of counties in NY (not my county) but most have residency requirements. The exceptions are the cities of Albany, Ithaca, and Rochester. Albany is 1.5 hours away, Ithaca 3.5 hours, and Rochester 4 hours. I was not opposed to driving down to Albany, but then I saw the rules. (see links below)  We have lived together over 6 months, but his driver's license address is his mom's because he cosigned her mortgage for her, and there was a whole thing about residency. That house is right up the road from us. I own my house and the utilities are all in my name, and he doesn't have a lease with me. He's just here. We do have a joint bank account so I can provide a document for that. His car insurance and pay stubs list our address. He got the motorcycle license endorsement in May, so his driver's license issue date is not over 6 months ago, which Albany seems to require, right?  Ithaca doesn't seem to have all these rules. It looks like you just show up, sign the paper, and you're domestic partners. However, they are only open on week days and the 3.5 hour drive each way would result in an entire day spent. I'm fine with doing that, I just want to be sure it's really necessary instead of going to Albany.   I can't seem to find any google or reddit examples of domestic partnerships in NY state...everything that comes up is for NYC, or for state employees, or counties we don't live in.   Does anyone know anything about domestic partnership in New York state? Is Ithaca really the place we'll need to go?  [Albany DP rules](http://www.albanyny.org/_files/DomesticPartnershipsInformation.pdf) / [law code](http://ecode360.com/7683425)  [Ithaca](http://www.cityofithaca.org/177/Domestic-Partnership) /  [law code](http://ecode360.com/8390659) / [Form](http://www.cityofithaca.org/DocumentCenter/View/193)"	Yes
875	My soon to be ex-wife and I are trying mediation, but she has already been very difficult and I don't have high hopes.  We have two kids and I expect her to fight me hard for an equal share of custody.  I left the mediator a message on Friday, but he never responded.  For mediators or those who have gone through mediation before, what can I expect in the first meeting?  How should I prepare?	Yes
876	The reason I'm asking is because my girlfriend (17) lives with her mother who is incredibly abusive. She had a huge fight with her today and she told me that she can't take it anymore. I offered her to come and live with me and my parents, but to do that, she'd have to become emancipated which is something her mother would never allow. She IS financially independent of her mother. She works full time and makes enough to support herself and pay rent to stay with my parents.    What would it take to get her emancipated?	Yes
877	Throwaway account here, if only because the obvious sensitive nature of the topic and I don't wish to air someone's dirty laundry in a way that could link to them.   My wife and I have a happy marriage and a 6 year old son, and her parents live with us in our home in Texas. Due to some medical issues that should have kept ANY kids from being possible, my wife had to have a hysterectomy at a relatively early age. We always wanted to adopt a second child and recently have been doing the research on what the requirements are in our state. One of the requirements,  of course,  is a background check for everyone in the family (I'm not sure if they mean just in the house or everyone genetically linked to you), which makes sense. But it raises my worry about something.   My father in law is a convicted sex offender. Now, I mean that legally speaking in that he has to go and register his location and all that,  but my wife told me this early on in our relationship. According to my wife's family he was caught up in this witch hunt back in the early 90's with these two kids who lied about a whole bunch of shit and he decided to take a plea deal instead of dragging his family through the hell of a trial. Not the choice I would have made but it is what it is and I don't know what I'd have done under those circumstances.   I believed my wife and her family when this was told to me years ago,  and after being around the man for almost 7 years I haven't had a single moment to the contrary to shake that. He may have his flaws,  but if I thought he had ever touched kids like that I wouldn't let him live in the same roof as my son. The issue is this: would his status on the registry prevent my wife and I from being able to adopt as long as they live with us, if at all?  Thanks.	Yes
878	This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. My location is Mississippi. First let me give you the facts. I graduated high school in 2014. My junior and senior year of high school I had a teacher that I hit it off with. Throughout high school I was a very good student, had a 31 on my ACT, numerous scholarship offers, and 3 nominations from my congressmen for the United States Naval Academy. About Christmas time of my senior year, this 32 year old female teacher and I exchanged phone numbers and began texting occasionally. By two weeks before graduation, there were sexually explicit texts being sent. I visited her house at her request twice before graduation. I graduated on a Friday, and on saturday night as a 17 year old I was at her house, she provided me alcohol and we first had sex. We did this same thing a couple more times before I turned 18 in June. By this point I was so smitten by her that I had given up every scholarship and college opportunity I had.  We continued our relationship and she convinced me out of going to school and into the workforce as soon as possible, as well as convinced me to marry her and have a child as soon as possible. In July of 2015 we married. In September of 2016 after many months of trying, she became pregnant, and abruptly moved out without telling me where she was going. I held on for almost a year hoping that she would come back and that we could be a family.   The child was born in May. I was allowed to see her a couple of times until my then wife decided that I couldnt see her again until I agreed to her custody terms. I refused and consulted with a lawyer to figure out my options and within 2 weeks I was served at fault papers which falsely accused me of being an abusive alcoholic (I was under 21 the entire marriage, so any alcohol I had was provided by her) and she was suing for full custody as well as the meager possesions ive managed to put together since she left in October of last year.  after being served those papers is when it finally clicked for me that my family was right. She manipulated me into marrying her and having a child with her. She has even openly admitted to only marrying her first husband because she wanted a child.  At this point, I have a 3 month old daughter that I love dearly and she is keeping away from me, as well as my former teacher pursuing an at fault divorce for full custody. I think she is expecting me to just give in as I have over the past three years.   I want full custody of my child to at least be able to regulate her being around her insane and manipulative mother. I also am considering pressing seperate civil as well as legal charges against the mother for the manipulation and pain that has been a result of this, in order to get custody as well as secure the future of my daughter. My-ex wife has already ruined my life, I cant let this ruin my daughters as well.  My lawyer seems to think I could have a case against her, but he said he cant think of a cause of action for it. By some of the other things he said, it kinda seemed to me like this case might end up being more work than he bargained for. I dont know. Am I out of luck due to a dumb decision while I was in high school, or do I need to find another lawyer that could push ahead with my case, or at least suggest a cause of action for him?  I dont want to ever see my ex-wife again, but I also dont want her to do the same thing to anyone else, and most importantly, I want to be able to see my daughter and provide her a life away from the crazy that is her mother.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. This has been a tough time and I dont know which way is up and which way is down.	Yes
879	I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit or if there's a better one to post under. Background is, I live in UT, divorced, 50/50 custody. 3 children, 2 teens and an 8 year old. My child just came to me with pictures of text conversations and pictures of the edible gummy marijuana that her Dad is using. Marijuana is illegal in UT and its really upset my kids. I am so far out of my element here. I don't know a soul who does drugs, let alone what to do since their Dad is now using them.   I have several concerns. First off, apparently the kids even know who is selling him them. My feelings on marijuana aside (I do beleive it should be legalized), I don't want someone who is obtaining a currently illegal drug and selling them around my kids. Second issue, aparently the 5 times he's admitted to being stoned the kids were with him. Add to the fact he just lost his job, and these seem like red flags to me.    Do I call the police for this? He seems in a downward spiral and no, a conversation won't work. He has no family here and the latest job he lost was working for a friend so I imagine he's low on a support network right now. Would the police even care about drug use with marijuana? He won't see a therapist of any kind, doesn't believe in them. But he needs some type of wake up call.	Yes
880	My ex husband recently allowed our 17 year old daughter to get a pit bull. The animal was free because the owner didn't want it. My daughter has paid for the things it needs (food, crate, collar, etc.) Ex husband has not paid for anything.   The dog is living at his house. He got mad at my daughter and told her she needed to take the dog to my house. I said NO. That's his dog, his responsibility. Ex husband believes the dog is the property of our daughter and therefore the animal is her responsibility. I said he's wrong.  I made it clear to my daughter that the dog cannot come here. I already have 2 dogs, which is the most my rental contract allows me to have.  Also, I am not interested in replacing either of these animals if/when they die. Pet ownership is expensive and time consuming. I have already obligated myself to these two dogs as long as they live and that's that.  I told my ex husband before he got her the pet that it would not be coming to my home. I also told him I didn't think it was a good idea to get our daughter a dog at this point in her life. At age 17, she has a lot going on with schooling and work. Also, if she wants to get her own place to live, many landlords will not allow aggressive breeds.  But since she is a minor, can she legally own the dog? Or is the dog the property of her father?  For example, if the dog were to cause damage to another person's property who would be liable? I insist ex husband is liable because it is a pet he harbors on his property.  So what happens when my daughter turns 18 and her dad gets mad at her again and tells her to leave and take the dog with her? Whose dog is it then?  We have shared custody and live in Ohio.	Yes
881	Hello, everyone. Long story short, I was about to break up with my then girlfriend, she thought trapping me would make me marry her, it didn't, now I'm in a shitty situation. We broke up, she moved back home, and refuses to communicate with me. I've tried to contact her and her family about the due date of the child (I know it's sometime in February, but that's all I know) but they ignore me. I only got a picture of the ultrasound because she posted it to my facebook wall in an attempt to embarrass me. She's also stated that she's not going to put my name on the birth certificate, which I'm not sure if that matters. I'm afraid she's going to try and keep the baby away from me. I may not be on good terms with her, but I want to take care of my child. I'm in Texas. What are my options?	Yes
882	"Hi, thank you for reading this.  At a young age I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Had some help but mainly the help came to our house. When I turned 18, I locked myself up in my room and didn't go to school or outside my room other than to eat, drink and take care of my hygiene.   I voluntary choose to go to an institution, although abroad. The program was hard, but learned a lot. Until one day I got a letter from my mother explaining that she is now my financial guardian and has my custody (not sure how to explain it in English). Meaning I'm not capable of making my own decisions, transactions or whatever anymore without asking my mother.   The court did not ask if I thought I should be put under this because I was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome and the institute claimed I'm irresponsible for my own actions/life.   Here comes the tricky part. I have been the fastest who completed the program, the owner speaks with big words about me to outsiders (that he expects a lot from me, etc). I know that I'm capable of living alone.   I also can not pick up all my stuff and leave as they have possession of my ID papers, bank papers and insurance cards.   I'm now two years further, 20 years now. I'm moving back to The Netherlands to another program. Also not in agreement with me. Now because I'm moving to a different municipality I have to move ""on paper"". This organization is asking me to lie to ask for funding from the government. As all of the organization has been paid by the government.   What should I do, what can I do?   I'm thinking of saying the truth to the municipality, that I'm capable of living alone etc. But how do I get my own voice back from my mom?   Thank you so much."	Yes
883	Florida. My father collects disability and hardly gets by as it is. He rents a small trailer that's 3 bedroom 2 bath. It's not much, but it's his. He doesn't get food stamps or other assistance other than disability. I have a sister in the area that has 2 girls and 1 stepson. They bought a fix it up house in the area. For the last couple years they let everything go. No ac, no refrigerator, no heat, and the water was undrinkable. The stepson is in the care of the biological grandmother. My sister lets call her, lazy and her boyfriend (father of her 2nd daughter) let's call him doofus. Well they would randomly come over to my dads house unannounced to stay the night because their power would constantly get shut off. Of course my dad would them and the girls stay. It would usually just happen for a couple of days here and there. Over time they stopped having people over. Later it was discovered how bad the house got. Fleas biting you constantly, and the mess was apparently terrible. My other sister made a surprise visit and just broke down into tears. She immediately just started cleaning. We thought that the situation was getting better but soon after thy showed up at my dads house because the power got shut off again. This was back in February. They are still there. My dad was currently caring for my 17 year old sister who just turned 18, graduated and moved in with me to start college in Nevada. The oldest daughter is currently with me. I don't have custody, but my sister let me have her for the summer. I just got permission to let her stay with me until she can get on her feet. Lazy and doofus eat all the food, pay $0 in bills causing my dad to borrow money constantly from family just so that the kids could eat food. Doofus works full time as a welder and apparently they can afford to move back home. My dad is being stepped all over just because they are living for free. The only bills they have is $300 for rent, electric and car insurance. They pay my dad nothing and even have their hand out for gas money. Lazy goes to a methadone clinic 1 1/2 hours away every other day costing them a lot in gas and of course money for the drug. All of their money seems to go toward this. I know that doofus smokes pot as well. They could go to a clinic closet to home but it's run by the government so they would actually have to go to meetings and whatnot. My dad offered to buy them a refrigerator, and reccently offered to pay their electric bill so they can move back into their old place. Doofus replied with, no reason to it will just get shut off again. The kids were going hungry and there was 6 people living in a small place. It was crazy. I now have the oldest daughter, and my 18 year old sister. I have no idea what I'm doing. Lazy said I can let her start school out her and whatever paperwork I need let me know and she'll sign it or whatever. I'll save that for another post. My poor sad is at his wits end. They are clearly taking advantage of him and he can't see the kids suffer so he does everything he can but it's not enough. He wants them out but who really wins? The second daughter will still be suffering and I can't take care of everyone. The issue here is that the landlord doesn't know doofus, lazy, and their daughter are staying there. It's supposed to be a single family home so he could get evicted. Can my dad still start an eviction notice? We could have to get CPS involved for second child but we are all scared because we are all stretched thin as it is and don't know who can actually care for her effectively. I just had a baby myself. I went from no one to 3 kids to take care of. I should also note that the fixer up house was bought by doofus's mom outright and they just pay her $300/month. That's why they haven't lost it. I'm sure she's upset she hasn't been getting paid, however, I'm not aware of any written contract or that she wants to sell or get rid of the house. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just trying to scoop everyone up and take care of everyone, but I can't. They need a wake up call. They're older than me and sleeping in my dads couch. It's shameful to take advantage of my dad, and even more shameful to not even care for the kids. When the oldest came out here she didn't even have a pair of shoes to wear on the plane. This is bad. But they need to step up and take care of their family.	Yes
884	Pretty much summed it up in the headline but one more detail I need to add.  The mail from the food stamp office comes to my house.  I called her and asked about it and she told me that they knew she didn't live there but she didn't have her PO Box set up.    I'm concerned that she told them that she does live here, but not me.  Is this something that could come back on me?  What exactly are the requirements for counting a child as a member of the household, when they don't live with you the majority of the time?	Yes
885	I'll try to keep this to the point.  My brother and sister-in-law are getting divorced.  SIL just got served with divorce papers where my brother is requesting majority custody and decision making.   - Brother went on a 2-week military commitment - SIL blindsided him with a text message two days into this saying she was leaving, moving in with a boyfriend - SIL proceeded to turn into a nympho, opened a dating profile, showed and sent my brother explicit text messages of her meeting up with multiple guys, which we have copies of - Her boyfriend has openly posted about drug use on facebook for the past 4+ years, which we have screenshots of - Her and her boyfriend posted nude snapchats showing both of them, which we have screenshots of - Both her and my brother make ~$10/hr, but her grandparents are millionaires and allegedly going to finance her legal fight  She's seriously a terrible, neglectful person, doesn't change their son, doesn't bathe him, doesn't clothe him or even put blankets over him before bed. The thought of her drug using hookups being around my nephew makes me sick to my stomach.   My questions 1.  Are the screenshots we have worth anything? 2.  General advice for going up against people with an unlimited legal budget?   3.  We have no intent of cutting her immediately family out of his life, is there a way to make that intent clear? 4.  My parents have supported and financed basically all of my brother and SIL's expenses over the past 3 years (groceries, appliances, rent, bills, baby food), where her family had cut her off. They are just now stepping in to help her fight in the divorce.  Does this have any weight?  Thanks.	Yes
886	Trying to help my friend who is getting a divorce. He  is active duty military. He and wife separated but were trading weeks with child. Wife decided to get out of the military, husband reenlisted. Child was supposed to go with husband to new duty station per military orders. 2 weeks before the move, wife takes child out of state without husbands permission and keeps child out of state until husband had to move to next duty station.  It has now been a few months and wife refuses to let husband see child at all except for a 3 min phone call each day. They have some sort of court date in November to decide some things.  My question is: how is her keeping the kid like this not illegal? If the divorce is not finalized and there is no official custody arrangement, don't both parents have equal rights to the child?  I'm aware that this hurts her in the long run, but my friend is desperate to see his kid. He has hired a lawyer but they aren't helping him on this front and not giving a clear answer as to how she gets away with this.	Yes
887	Hello,  As the title says, I am on my ex (husband's) insurance plan as a dependent. I am not able to get onto a different health insurance plan without cancelling this one. They say that only the primary account holder can have me removed from the plan, but my ex and I are not on speaking terms. Is this legal? Do I really have no say in this? I live in Canada, btw.  Thanks in advance...	Yes
888	Little backstory is important.  We obtained our green card (mom and her son (me)) through marriage with him. He has started drinking last months more and more and he is just gettibg more aggressive. We don't know what to do. This morning he threatened my mother and she was able to record it. He said he is going to her work place and drag her out and that today we will see who he really is. I'm currently in my car couple blocks to where I live and I'm scared I don't know what to do. This isn't the first time he blows up but I just can't keep it. He keeps threatening my mom since we got our greencard from him and we want to stay here ( they've been married for almost 5 years). I'm afraid to escalate but how am I supposed to sleep knowing he is living in the same place as us?    How can I protect my mom's and I's status? He keeps saying he will say the marriage was a sham (it wasn't). How hard is it to win if he does this (we do have photo evidence and many people that can probably testify).   I'm sorry This is probably not the right place to have a meltdown but I can't keep pretending this isn't happening. I know this will make it way harder for us financially(if he leaves) but at least we can sleep fine	Yes
889	I'll try to keep this as short as possible... Divorce in 2012 - Ex Wife was awarded the home and signed a decree agreeing to refinance the home within 60 days and hold me harmless. She has never done this and is constantly late. She is up to 120 days past due now and I finally was able to contact her through a friend's cell phone and she says she's filing bankruptcy and to contact her attorney.  Is there anything I can do or should I just go ahead and file bankruptcy.	Yes
890	So, I'm probably about to take a position as a server and wanted to know how paying child and tips works. I know I can expect normal garnishment from my check, but I want to be able to get ahead and put a good dent in my back owed.	Yes
891	This is kind of a long one, so stick with me. I don't feel like I'm getting a straight answer from an attorney. I'm in New York.  My wife and I are getting a divorce. We've been living separately for about 14 months now and are very amicable. We've decided to go with an unconstested, no fault divorce. We have no kids, more debt than assets, and we simply want the divorce to be over as quickly as possible.  We agree as to how all of the assets and debt will be split up. I'm dispassionate about any of the 'things' (furniture, electronics, etc.) that we acquired together, so I'm letting her have whatever she wants of that. I'm keeping all of the cash assets, house, cars and the significant debt other than student loans. I'm taking on the debt because she has almost no means of servicing high levels of debt and it's less of a burden to me than it would be for her to do so. Additionally, she has no interest in our cash, house, cars or my very modest retirement assets. She sees them as mine because she did not work during our marriage, and she is aware that she has a right to all assets acquired during the marriage. I'm not looking for an analysis on this, we 100% agree on this piece.  So, I've researched all over the internet and can't find the answer to this: given that we are in complete agreement about how everything will be split up, do we NEED a document that outlines how the assets will be split? If so, how detailed does it need to be?  I went through New York State's DIY online divorce tool and it simply asked me if we were in agreement about the division of assets. I said yes, and it let me continue and print out the paperwork--there was nothing in there beyond that question on the walk-through about the division of assets. I spoke with an attorney and he is telling me that I need to have a separation agreement, but I don't think that's right if we 100% agree on who is taking what. I understand that it's best to have one, and that it would be appropriate in 99% of divorce cases where the spouses are adversarial, but that's just not how things are in this instance. I don't feel a need to have an attorney involved if it isn't necessary.  Does anyone have any insight on this? Essentially, what's the bare minimum paperwork that I need to get an uncontested, no-fault divorce in New York?  Thank you for your time.	Yes
892	I have severe anxiety issues and my father said that there should be a witness on the hearing which he read on a letter that was given to him. I don't know what I should be doing as a witness since I've never been in one and it just makes me scared thinking about it.   My step-mom is the plaintiff and she said she would not be bringing anyone.   EDIT: My father is perfectly okay of me not being there. He is just making sure if there is a need to have a witness on court.	Yes
893	My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	Yes
894	My lawyer has only given very general advice. I want to know specific advice and examples from individuals who have gone through these.	Yes
895	My wife filed for assistance when my son was born. I didn't know I had I son, two years later I received a letter to be DNA swabbed at DFS, which I obliged . Even before the results were in I knew he was mine so I contacted my wife and we got married 12 years later, present day, I get called into HR and was told there was a order for back child support to garnish my wages. Look at the paperwork and my son's name is on it. WTF! I've raised this kid and I owe child support. Apparently the case was never properly closed. My question is what is fastest way to resolve this and if any is there any recourse for the state fucking up?	Yes
896	"Is there a way to remove my mothers name from a property mortgage my dad acquired before they were married? My mothers lawyer had my mom signed a quit claim BEFORE ""applying"" to get it refinanced.   She wants her name to be removed to get approved for a low income house loan she applied for. The low income agency advised her to clear her name off the mortgage to be approved.  Her lawyer is incompetent. She told my mother to just wait 3 years. And my father is the biggest dung, for not cooperating.   Thanks in advance."	Yes
897	Michigan - I moved out of the marital home approximately 7 months ago. My wife still lives there. My legal address on my driver's license still has the marital home address, although I filed a change of address with the post office so I could get my mail. I am still paying part of the mortgage each month. We're in the process of divorcing, but it's taking a long time. Is there any reason I can't just move back into the marital home? We have no children.	Yes
898	Whenever my sister and brother-in-law drink they argue aggressively and, unfortunately, they drink quite often. Occasionally, he has been known to strike her. This month it happened twice. Once on July 5th (her birthday) and again on July 18th. On the 18th I was floating down the river when I got a phone call from my niece who was hysterically crying, so I called the cops and came home as soon as I could. I later found out that he poured Bacardi on my sister’s head and when she rolled off the bed to escape he kicked her in the back of the head. The police took him to prison and placed a “No contact” order on them where they can only text/e-mail and are not allowed to be wherever the other person is, which includes our home. He’s been charged with domestic violence (but only for throwing liquid), a second DUI since he drove away from the house, and having an open alcohol container in the car.  He’s been living out of his truck since then and has been posting/answering hook-up ads on craigslist all while saying he wants to get back together with my sister. In all honesty I think my sister will eventually end up getting back together with him and the only reason she isn’t now is due to peer pressure from our family and our small community.  Today we received a phone call from his lawyer who stated that he was trying to speak to the judge about being allowed into our stand-alone garage so that he can work (him and I work together in the garage). My sister, niece, and I do not want him back. Even if he was permitted to live in the garage we have no bathroom or air conditioner in there so I believe this is just his way of trying to get back into the house. My sister’s case manager has suggested they move to a woman’s shelter but my sister refuses to because she feels it would do more harm than good to my niece due to her autism.  My question is: Will a judge allow  a domestic abuser back onto the property so that he can run his business? He is the sole bread winner so it seems plausible. If so, can we add a ‘no alcohol’ stipulation?	Yes
899	"My (heterosexual) partner and I do not currently have plans to become legally married, but consider ourselves to be and meet all the NJ legal requirements (listed here http://www.nj.gov/health/forms/reg-d7.pdf) of Domestic Partners -- that is, we have a joint bank account, joint insurance, are one another's life insurance beneficiaries, etc. But everything we find regarding DP in NJ refers to those 62 and older, there doesn't seem to be anything on the books for younger couples.  Is there anything available to us at our age (early-mid 30's), or are we just SoL? Do we even NEED anything official, or do we just declare ourselves ""domestic partners"" to whoever listens and that's that? We just want to make sure we're protected in case of accident, emergency, legal issues, etc etc."	Yes
900	So there's a non-zero chance that I might have to try and get custody of my daughter from my ex-wife to me in the next couple of years.   This will be due to abusive behavior by my ex to her, documentation from the school counselors , and my daughter's wishes.  (And she's old enough to have input with the court.)  I'm more than willing to have this fight for my daughter and acknowledge it won't be an easy one.   However,  there's a clause in our decree that states the kids have to go to a specific school district that I no longer live in.  (Cannot afford it with child support / daycare)  Would that be overridden as a part of the custody change or would the court want me to move back?	Yes
901	"I'm in MD, currently kids are visiting their dad in FL.     To make a long story short (and less identifying) there is an INSANE amount of inappropriate stuff going on at the fathers house where my 2 young children are staying, where they are currently on their court ordered visitation for the next few weeks.  I understand different houses have different rules, and I can't ""make"" their father do anything.  But in light of gathering some actual evidence of how out of control this is, am I legally allowed to record a conversation with my kid if they know they are recorded?  My guess is as minors the answer is I would need permission from their legal guardian, but since that's me I don't see it being an issue?  Or would their father have to consent?      Custody order is in MD, I have legal tie breaking authority.  Basically I have the final say over the kids well being education, health, etc wise."	Yes
902	"During the school-year, my mother (Who had moved to Colorado with my sister the year prior, under the false pretense of wanting to be ""around family"" [she actually just wanted to smoke weed legally]) wanted me to spend the summer with her in Colorado. I was very much against this, since both my mother and my sister are massive control freaks and have anger issues. My mother is a touch narcissistic aswell. Even though I had stated multiple times I did *not* want to go down there, my father (and mother) forced me to go there. Are they legally allowed to do this? I know that my mother still has custody, but my father and mother are divorced. Am I allowed to choose where I want to live? My father lives in Minnesota, if that changes anything."	Yes
903	(Arizona, Phx/Tucson) Hi, r/legaladvice, I’m posting on behalf of my mom.  She’s been separated from my dad for nearly a year now, for various reasons including infidelity with a minor, and hoarding.  He’s paying child support on the child which was the result of the infidelity, and has accrued other various debts.  Anyway, he hasn’t paid rent on his house in long enough that he’s now getting evicted, and has found out today that his landlord (who gave him more than thirty days’ notice) put the house on the market and has an offer pending on it already.  My question is this: Mom can’t afford a lawyer, and is worried that she would be saddled with half of his debt and half of his hoard of junk if she were to divorce him. She is also concerned that he would try to force her to accept him into her new apartment, even though he is not on the lease. To complicate matters, I still have a minor sister living with her.  We’ve already taken everything she wants out of his house, apart from a jewelry box she inherited from my grandmother that she can’t find. What sort of advice should I give her on how to proceed next?	Yes
904	First post, but I'm at my wits end. My ex (divorce final 3 1/2 years ago) is now on trial for lewd and lascivious acts against a minor. The child is a relative, but not one of our children. I have repeatedly refused to get in the middle of the case, in order to keep my kids out of it, and to maintain my sanity for their sake. Our kids have been solely with me for almost 2 years, and blissfully unaware of what their father has been accused of (I don't speak negatively about him to/in front of them, but I believe he's guilty).  The alleged acts are from 2009, when we were together and my oldest was less than 2 years old. He and his attorney just served me with a subpoena to be in court, along with my now 9 year old child.  My kids have been with me 100% because of an order from superior court (California) that their father cannot be with any child without supervision by another adult, and his girlfriend doesn't qualify. Our divorce got settled with 50/50 custody, and that still stands, as I lack the funds to hire a lawyer to go for full custody at this point.  All I want is to keep my kids out of this whole drama - they (and I) have no involvement. Wtf can I do???	Yes
905	"Hi, so this may not be the right place for this post but there's recently been a ""friend"" of my grandmother show up and is taking advantage of her.   Little backstory: She is 87, was diagnosed with dementia and early stage Alzheimer's, and is in the process of moving from Massachusetts several states away to be closer to her daughters (my mom and aunt). The ""friend"" used to be a TV service guy for her, maybe ~5 years in the past. In the last 6 months he showed back up in her life, mysteriously and out of the blue. She claims he ""helps her with everything"" but we are pretty sure that is not true, he has done a handful of favors for her (including admittedly two quite large ones, driving her ~1 hour 30 minutes and the other driving her and a truckload of her furniture ~5 hours.).   About 2 months ago, she gave him $10,000 with which to buy a car (which he supposedly would use to drive for Lyft and pay her back $100/wk, which isn't happening). The kicker of the situation is, she opened a joint account with him and he has a debit card with which he is draining her money. She transfers money from her checking account to his ""sub""/joint account and then from there he spends it (gas, groceries, shopping at malls, etc), or withdraws it (including recently a $4,000 cash withdrawal). When we spoke with the bank about it their attitude was ""she is our client and we have to respect her wishes, if she wants to open this account with this man she can do that"" blah blah. Doctors say they can't do anything because she is still compos mentis.  I'm at a loss for what to do. Can my family and I go after this guy to recover some of the money he has stolen from her? is this even illegal? It's clearly elder financial abuse in my mind, but I don't know what grounds we have for any legal or financial recourse. Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated. I can also provide more info but will be at work most of the day so will only be on and off.  Thanks!"	Yes
906	Insert the standard throwaway disclaimer here.   Back in the late 90s-early 2000s, I dated a guy. We moved in together for about a month in 2001 - long story short he punched me in the face, I dumped him and that was that. No kids, no pets, no community property. It was a clean break.  Fast forward 16 years to about a month ago, my fiance and I were at the grocery store and he noticed someone acting really weird, ducking in and out of aisles, following us around. It was my ex. We ignored him, finished shopping, and went home.   Today - I got served with divorce papers from the ex. I was (and am) totally baffled. Apparently he hired a lawyer, filed with the county, etc - everything you'd do for a regular divorce except that we were never married. I know the rule of thumb is to ignore the crazy until you get served, but here I am with papers in hand. What do I do now?	Yes
907	Abusive husband knows i wont report him to the police because due to reasons CPS gave us two strikes. (first time was during the time after i gave birth, he lied to the doctor and told her tht i didnt feed him- had to be investigated by the CPS; the second time one of my kids told her teacher that she was hit - she was talking about when you slap a kids hit for trying to touch a hot stove- but she didnt understand that scolding =/= abuse) and so we have 2 strikes on our house.   I finally decided to go through with the divorce but my husband wants to keep up with his abuse (he left the house for 2 weeks taking his stuff, now he is threatening to call the police if he isnt let in) He knows fully well that if his domestic abuse is reported or if the police get involved the kids will be investigated and there is a highchance of them being taken away.... i have 6 kids under the age of 16.  Any advice on what to do when he calls the police? how to handle CPS? the divorce process hasnt fully began cause im still waiting on legal aid.... plz any suggestions are appreciated.	Yes
908	After many years I finally decided to cut off contact with my mother a few months ago.  I'm well into adulthood, but the abuse has had some pretty lasting effects.  She came to my house tonight, unannounced, at supper time to give my children birthday gifts.  While she was here she mentioned that she was thinking seeking a lawyer with the intention of suing for visitation rights.  What legal rights does she have to my children?	Yes
909	She hasn't seen the kids in days and her husband isn't picking up the calls. She's high and wants to do nothing. People are cussing at her on facebook. Cousin says we can't even call the cops because we're not as close and don't count, cps was already called they don't know where they are. Anything I can do?	Yes
910	My ex and I were married for 10 years and we got divorced 3.5 years ago. He is an attorney and black mailed me into waiving the spousal support or else he would ruin my life. I have been through therapy and am ready to go back to court to modify the child support because I have had a change in income. Can I also ask my lawyer to look into the spousal support? I am no longer afraid of him and even though I waived the support I was under duress. He took advantage of his knowledge as an attorney and held me under duresss. Is this all possible?	Yes
911	"Apparently my ""father"" paid $800 for child support within the last month, after being almost 4 years behind, and I just now found out after telling my mom I was going to ask him where my money was, that she spent the $800 on my grad party without even telling me he paid it. My dad keeps giving my mom money now and now that I'm 18 it should be going to me.   I'm pissed because that's my money now that I'm 18, she didn't tell me about it, and I'm trying to get things paid for college, and trying to buy a car. Do I have a right to be pissed? Is there anything I can do legally?"	Yes
912	Been married for a little over two years. She's unemployed, but collects Social Security benefits as a representative payee for her kids (the kids dad died last year). I realize that alimony laws are different from state to state. Therefore, does anyone have any specific knowledge about alimony laws for Alabama?	Yes
913	So I don't know if there's anything I can do about this. My children are in Louisiana visiting their father. I am supposed to pick them up at the halfway point (I live in PA). He told me this morning that he will only drive four hours and I need to drive the other 16 1/2  hours. Is there any way I can compel him to meet in the middle like we agreed? I even offered to drive 12 instead of 10 hours. Its a round trip 20 hours if we meet in the middle.	Yes
914	This is currently a hypothetical situation for the sake of discussion so thank you for sticking with me:  I was wondering what happens to the allocation of assets between two partners (A and B)  I suppose this extends to multiple situations, an answer for any would be appreciated:  1) partner A brings in the sole income for the household, partner B works around the house (no children)  2) as in situation 1, but partner B also looks after children almost exclusively   3) partner A brings in significantly more income than partner B (around 8x) who also works around the house  4) as in situation 3, but both partners share housework equally.  For all situations assume no substantial personal assets prior to marriage.   I suppose these situations would also be influenced by prenuptial agreements, would these influence the outcome?   Thanks for your time!	Yes
915	My best friend's father works for the MTA making $35/hr. All of his primary children are at least 18 years or older and are capable if not employed in a job. The issue involves financial and parental burdens on his children.  The father currently has two sets of families: the children and a passed wife he's lived with for at least 20 years, and another family birthed from infidelity dating back to about 15 years ago. He has rarely visited his second family until after the loss of his legal wife due to breast cancer 5 years ago.  The issue persists primarily on the financial impact that is affecting both his youngest son, age 23 (my best friend) and his oldest daughter, age 19. His 23 year old son has moved out since graduating college to Long Island. The father was assisting in paying student loans and is also responsible for the rent at the apartment he and his daughter live in. For the last two months at least, the father has rarely been home, when he does go home does not bring any food for the daughter, has stopped paying student loans, and is at least a month behind on rent. They fear he may be splurging his money on the other family or other things, but he is not around enough to confirm/deny that, nor does he often respond to their calls/messages. The daughter works a part time job until the fall semester starts and so she has been the one to maintain herself for the time being.  It's still unsure what will happen if another month's rent goes unpaid and if the daughter will be displaced and have to live somewhere else. Currently, grandparents are the most immediate resource even if their apartment is smaller and already crowded.   What options does my friend and his sister have for her living situation in particular? There's only so much I can do living in another state (TX) to try and help them out.   Any suggestions or advice are greatly appreciated.	Yes
916	My boyfriend has to pay child support to his child's mom. He paid through Western Union the first month (last month) as per the agreement, and the money was supposed to start being taken out of his check this month. They never told his employer to take the money out, did not send his child's mom a card to receive the money on, and now today is the day she's supposed to receive the money. She's badgering him and we're not sure what to do.   Should he send the money through Western Union today and have a copy of her signature saying she got it? What do we do if he sends the money today, but next week she receives a card and they take the money out of his check?  The Child Services number for the county she lives in has not been answering their phones, and she apparently didn't have gas to go up there to talk to them in person.   Redditors, please help!!	Yes
917	I'll start off by saying the friend is 18 and this takes place in Virginia. For the purpose of this story we will call her Friend.   The story begins in October when friend was working part time to build savings and taking classes online which her mom paid for monthly. She did not pay rent or have any legal lease to live in the home although she has lived with her mom her entire life.   Short backstory- friend lived with her mom, brother and stepfather basically all her life (stepfather and friend never got along.) mom and stepfather became separated and mom, brother (7) and friend all moved about 1.5 hours away from stepfather. Months later mom decides she wants stepfather to come visit and he agrees but says Friend can't be present. So mom asks Friend if she can stay the weekend at another friend's house. For the purpose of the story we will call her Roommate.   Long story short, mom and Friend got into a huge fight but in the end Friend agreed to stay at Roommate's for the weekend. While Friend was leaving mom took her debit cards, all the money from her savings, and her most recent paycheck. Mom told friend she would give the money back when she returns home after the weekend.   The weekend comes and goes and mom still will not allow friend to return home. After about a week she informs friend that she used the money she took from her to pay off friend's car (the car is in mom's name but friend is the primary driver.) friend does not give her permission to do this but she assumes that would mean the car now belongs to friend. Friend chooses not to take action against her mom as she wants to maintain a good relationship because she assumed she would eventually return home.   Another week goes by and mom tells friend she's going to come by Roommate's house to pick up her car and get the oil and tires changed. Mom picks up the car and informs friend the next day that she sold it and will not be getting her another one. Friend has to call out of work for the next week while she figures out how to buy a car with no credit, no money and no consigner. Friend buys a car with $0 down and a huge interest rate. Mom feels bad and says she will help her pay it off when she returns home.   Mom promises friend can return in November. November comes and goes. Mom promises friend she can return by thanksgiving. Thanksgiving comes and goes. Mom promises friend she can return by Christmas. Christmas comes and goes. Between Christmas and New Years mom promises friend she can come back soon she just wants friend to learn how to live on her own first.  The next week mom removes friend from all insurance plans, cuts off her phone service, stops paying for her online classes, and begins selling her personal belongings she left at the house when she thought she was only leaving for the weekend.   At this point it's clear to friend that stepfather has moved in permanently and she's out of the house for good. Keep in mind she's still living rent free with Roommate and Roommate's parents who were also under the impression that she would be only staying there temporarily. So now our question is can she do anything to get her money or belongings back from her mom? Can her mom legally evict her without notice? Does this count has illegal eviction even though 3+ months have passed? Basically at this point she no longer cares about staying on good terms with mom and she just wants her money back so she can move out from Roommate's house on her own.  Based on other posts in this sub it seems like mom can legally evict friend by giving her a notice with enough time to move out. Mom gave friend a few hours notice to leave for the weekend promising she can return. Therefore she didnt give her enough notice to legally evict her but it's now been over 3 months before it was clear that she cannot return home so is it too late to do anything?	Yes
918	I have full custody (legal and physical) in this situation, and my ex has monitored visitation. I won child support through the court as the CSSD was never able to verify my ex's income. Recently my ex filed to open a new case with the CSSD, and I'm unsure if that's even possible nor do I understand the intention of that. So I guess my question is, if there is already a support order through the court, will the CSSD even bother with this?   Thanks in advance!	Yes
919	For several years I had a relationship with an abusive man. He never hit me but he threw things at me and was verbally abusive. I always wondered if he would graduate to hitting me. I found out he was recently arrested for domestic violence. I have no proof of his behavior because I deleted everything, however, I want to let the prosecutor know that this was not an isolated incident as he is probably saying.   Is there any benefit to me contacting the prosecution when I have nothing to prove what I am saying is true?	Yes
920	He has an attorney. There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her. Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	Yes
921	We live in Virginia for starters. A little background I'm 24, my husband is 32. We've been together for 4 years and married for 3. We have one child together and have purchased a home while married.   He has been verbally and emotionally abusive to me for a long time now, and has cheated on me in the past. In recent events he's brought it to my attention that he's miserable and that this isn't the life he wanted for himself.   I've made it clear to him that the only thing I want out of this marriage is our daughter, I don't want spousal support, child support, none of the property. Just her.   The problem I've run into however is I currently don't have any means of acquiring any money, he's our sole bread winner.   So my question is, what the hell do I do.   I can't keep doing this with him, I'm at the end of my emotional threshold.	Yes
922	"I'm 46, born and raised in the Bay Area of Northern California and now living in Omaha, Nebraska. My mother had me at 18 as an unwed mother. My biological father has denied parentage (left the state when he found out he knocked up my mom). Then I was adopted by the man my mom married when I was 1 year old. He and my mom separated when I was 15. My adoptive father and I became estranged almost 30 years ago and haven't spoken.   I did have one dinner with my bio-father when I was 21 and no contact since then. I was able to find my half siblings that he had after me on Facebook and my one brother verifies that some family members have verified that I ""exist"". My youngest half sister has listened to family members that say that I was only contacting the kids because I am a gold digger ... She won't speak to me. I am not a gold digger, but, rumor has it that both my biological father and my adoptive father have made out very well over the years in California real estate. From time to time I wonder if I will ever see a dime of inheritance from either one, and if I have any legal grounds if I'm not named in any wills... I have had abandonment and attachment disorder issues throughout my life relating to male abandonment stemming from these ""fathers"" leaving me at formative places in my life... Money doesn't solve those problems, but, it wouldn't be a horrible thing to have, maybe buy a house, have some financial security in my lifetime..."	Yes
923	My father left my mother last week, and has officially filed the paperwork for divorce.  I'm trying to help my mother wade through this process as best I can.  The two of them are on pretty amicable terms, and he's presented a pretty fair division of assets offer that she seems ok with.  I just have a few questions on the process, and what else I can do/read to make sure we're doing what's in her best interest.  This is in Texas.  I set her up with a few consultations with various family lawyers when I found out he had gotten one, just so she would be represented.  One thing they brought up was spousal support which is it something that we had considered.  She works in a commission based field with minimal job history, is this something even worth pursuing?  If she doesn't have a lawyer, is she able to petition for spousal support herself if it's not in the initial divorce paperwork?  What else should I be reading, looking into to understand how to help best in this situation.	Yes
924	My stepfather left me money in his will. My mom wants me to sign off the money to her as terms of her agreement with closing the estate and getting essentially paid off.   I'm not sure that I want to sign it over to her. He wanted me to have it... Looking for some legal advice on what my options may be?	Yes
925	"This is for a friend who's currently being investigated by CPS for what they suspect is child abuse.  I'll be keeping this as vague as possible to protect the identities of those involved, but I have a few basic questions that I was hoping someone would be able to help out with.  It sounds like this could get bad pretty quick for my friend if things aren't handled properly, and I don't want to see that happen.  **Quick Background**  One of my friend's kids got hurt from an accident in the home, and ended up having to go to the hospital.  Everything seemed normal, CPS didn't show up, and they were never mentioned during the trip to the hospital.  It wasn't until the next day when CPS showed up at my friend's house for questioning, and even then, no additional issues were brought up.  They showed back up the following day and said my friend was going to be investigated for possible child abuse, and everything since then has been an extremely hectic, mental and emotional mess.  **Questions**  * If my friend is unable to afford a lawyer from a private practice, how long does it usually take to get a court appointed lawer?  Is this something a court appointed lawyer would be a able to quickly act on?  * If my friend is required to have a ""supervisor"" in order to be around their kids, but they don't have any friends or family who are able/available, what will happen?  Will a lawyer be able to help with this?  (I read that some courts will counter CPS in some cases, at least with the ""supervised"" stuff, but I wasn't sure how often that happens.)  This investigation has only been going on for a couple days now, but CPS is already saying my friend is at risk of losing their kids.  It sounds like this could happen sooner than later if my friend isn't able to find a friend or family member that what would essentially be a live-in Nanny that could serve as a full time supervisor.  I understand the reasoning behind this stuff, but I honestly don't know how some families are expected to make it through these situations in one piece.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
926	My ex and I are divorced and have joint legal custody, and I have some physical custody of our daughter. Can I move out of state with her at anytime, or do I need to get permission from her father? Thanks in advance.	Yes
927	My ex-wife and I have 50/50 custody of our 14 year old son both legal and physical. Circumstances have changed in her household and we have both agreed to a new living arrangement for him. We want to just submit a notarized modification to the court, so its on record and we are both held accountable for it. What is the easiest form to file (there are sooo many), we both agree on this for our son and have no intention on letting the court decide what is best. We just want it on file. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
928	I'm 20 years old and I've never seen my social security card and passport. My parents keep them in a safe deposit box at the bank. I have reason to believe that my parents will not permit me to retrieve them. What options are available to me if they decline to give me my identification?	Yes
929	Hey i'm looking for advice in regards to paying unnecessary child care in Alberta, Canada. I'm divorced and my ex wife refuses to apply for a child care subsidy. Over the last year iv'e been paying the bill out of pocket. I recently just got off the phone with the Government and they have said that she can qualify for subsidy yet she refuses to apply. Is there a way or a chance that i can get some of my money back whether it be through small claims court or through some other legal process?	Yes
930	Long story short I am leaving for a couple of days to clesr my head and possibly commit suicide( no one knows this. I just bought a 20 gauge and am hoping this will work) but my question is. If I am not around and my ex girlfriend who is staying with her ex attempted to let me have our son for a night ? Or if everyone just thought that I was gone for awhile would I be okay if I came back? What would happen if I didn't come back and I had a CPS case open against her?	Yes
931	Throwaway because my sister is an avid user of reddit, the whole deal.   I live in Ontario, Canada. I'm currently fifteen, but will be sixteen this month, which is the age I can legally move out of the care of my parents, who are basically useless. One is an alcoholic and tax evader and the other is truly his soulmate, I assure you that.   The thing is, I have braces and no cash saved up. If I do move out, what are my parents obligations to me? I don't see CPS or foster care as an option at this point. Can the province provide me with financial aid?	Yes
932	First time poster looking to get an answer to a question that I've been having issues figuring out.   I'm trying to file a Paternity case to get a court order for visitation. I reside in Los Angeles county and my daughter resides in San Bernardino county. Which county do I use to file for my paternity case? My daughter has lived outside of Los Angeles since 11/2016. If I file in San Bernardino county, do I have to travel to that courthouse each time I need to go to court or will the Los Angeles courts be able to assist me?	Yes
933	I'm a 17 year old, extremely smart (not bragging) O-levels student studying in Pakistan and currently in Bahrain for summer holidays.   At the age of 11, my parents took me out of school and put me into a Quran teaching institute for 5 years, during that time I got extremely depressed with having the same routine 7am to 12pm and 3pm to 7pm everyday for 5 years.   Every year I tried to convince my parents to let me go back to school but they never agreed and just beat me, until the 5th year when they realised I wasn't interested in finishing the Quran and it was getting too late.  After that I spent the next 3 months finishing the 5 years worth of syllabus of 5 subjects so that I could get into school. After 3 months I moved to Pakistan to live with my brother (who turned out to be a sadistic asshole)and left my family behind in Bahrain.   My brother wanted me to get into the 8th grade of the Pakistani education system but since I was 3 years behind my former classmates, I went behind his back and barely got myself into the first year of O-levels.  At the end of the first year, I topped all of my subjects getting all A's and A+'s except I math and ended the school year with certificates in Business, Economics, Accounting and English for the best student of each subject over the year. I did all of that in my first year of school after since the 5th grade.  After that I was still behind my former classmates who were in the 12th grade and I asked my brother to let me skip one year of school and get myself into the 3rd year of O-levels straight after finishing the 1st, my brother didn't allow me and gave me no reason as to why he didn't and said I should take my time, so once again I went behind his back and got myself into the 3rd year of O-levels all by myself. I had to finish the whole 2nd year syllabus in 2 month and, after I was done with 2 subjects out of 5, my brother caught wind of my plans to skip a grade and took away my laptop, phone and everything else knowing I needed the internet to study as I had no teachers.  so now I'm stuck. I opened up to my mother about how my brother treats me and how he's an asshole, and she replied by beating me and telling me how I disrespected my brother. Now my only option is to go with whatever my brother has planned for me which is gonna ruin my future. I know I have great potential. The students who got the same grades as me in 12th grade as I did in 10th are getting into top universities like Stanford, Harvard and Pennsylvania on full scholarships and stipends. It's been my dream to move to the US to study an to pitch an amazing app idea I have that has impressed many of people but my parents would never allow me to move there because of religious reasons and other reasons.   Other than my education, I had breathing problems for 10 years from the time I was 7 to the time I was 17 and my parents never took me to a hospital,this year, I convinced one of my brothers to take me to a hospital where I was diagnosed with either Bronchitis or asthma (full diagnosis would be done if I visited a specialist which I probably never will).  I just want to know my options, what can I do to leave my abusive and careless family behind and move to another country? If I have the option of getting into some education programs abroad I would have no trouble getting into them because I have exceptional grades in all my subjects. I have a lot of potential but I'll never be able to achieve it if I stay with my family.	Yes
934	My girlfriend has 3 kids from her previous marriage with her abusive ex-husband. After they divorced they continued to share the house week on week off, so the kids would stay in one place. After more and more mental and physical abuse against her (never the kids) she left, no money, car job, etc and because of her circumstances and her ex's access to money and a good lawyer he became primary gardian, and she has been seeing the kids every weekend.  Well last month her ex husband up and moved to NY, 13 hours away, without filing a request to move with the courts, to live with his new girlfriend. The kids are 8, 14 and 15. They have no friends or family there. There are miserable.   My wife has been applying for legal aid to try and get custody (money is tight, we're trying to save up but it's taking a while)...   So last night the 14 year old boy got into an argument with his dad and his dad threw him against a wall. Huge well across his back this morning. So when the kids called their mom crying last night, we had the cops go to where they are in NY. The cops did nothing. Said he acted out and basically got what he diserved.  My wife isn't a perfect person. She hasn't handled everything right, but these kids are miserable, and being mentally and now physically abused.   If anyone has advice, or a template for what we have to do to petition for emergency custody, we need it. The kids want to be here with us and are being held away just to spite their mother. I know the best thing to do is get a lawyer and we want to and are trying but just need some help now. Thank you everyone.	Yes
935	"I divorced my spouse July of last year and part of the settlement involved being awarded a portion of their 401k. The 401k was operated by the local chapter of their union.   In December of last year the provider of the 401k merged with the international chapter's 401k provider and since then noone seems willing or able to help me.  I've been told to basically stop calling/emailing the international chapter's investment department as ""we've not received the final calculations from the previous provider and cannot give you an update""  What, if anything, can I do to compel them to follow the court order?"	Yes
936	My son’s father filed for a child custody modification last year. We are going to trial at the end of the month. The original judgment handed down by the court gave me primaryp physical custody with visitation for our son’s dad on Wednesday nights and every other weekend.   I cannot afford an attorney so I will be representing myself at the trial at the end of this month.   I have a few questions: 1. His lawyer emailed me a “take it or leave it offer” regarding visitation (for me) which I declined to sign. Since then, my son’s father has not let me see our son. His lawyer indicated in the email that I could not show the judge the “offer.” Is the lawyer allowed to say this? My son’s father has now said he will ask the judge for me to see our son a few hours each week.   2. DCF (Mass) was involved during a domestic violence incident in 2015 in which I was arrested and my son’s father had a 51A filed against him for abusing me. A 51A was filed against me as well because I was arrested in front of our son. At the time, our son was 4 months old (I had full legal and physical custody) and I was used to the abuse and thought it would make more sense for me to decline to press charges against my son’s father so that my son wouldn’t be taken into custody by DCF. How can I most effectively tell the judge the circumstances of that night?  Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
937	*Location: England*  My parents are about to go through a divorce through no fault of my Father. My mothers alcoholism has gotten worse over the years and my dad can no longer take the emotional turmoil no more. She is stuck in a cycle and will not seek help or change her ways so my dad has to go. The turning point for me was my mother was diagnosed with esophagus cancer at 47 (very rare) due to her obsessive smoking and alcohol abuse. She was given a second chance after operating and was all clear but slowly slipped back to her old ways before getting much worse.  Divorce in the UK is a very financially toilsome outcome for the male party and I want to know how my dad can keep what he has worked hard for without my mam prying everything away? He is essentially the victim of years of emotional abuse and it is completely my mothers failings that have forced him into divorce so why should he have to pay for her failings.  Information that may be of use when giving advice:  - Three kids together. One 16, one 22 (me) and another 23. Only myself and my younger brother live at the family home. - My dad worked away a lot for the first 18 years or so of my life whereas my mam was a housewife.  -My mother got a job a few years ago as my dad needed help with the bills but then was diagnosed with cancer one year ago and has been on the sick since - She is able bodied and in my eyes should be in work - The house is up for sale and my father is in contact with the solicitors to go through divorce proceedings. I'm pretty sure both names are on the mortgage.  I would love my father to be able to part ways with this woman and get on with his life instead of paying my mother a 'lifestyle allowance'.  He has worked incredibly hard his entire life and shouldn't be forced into giving some alcoholic more money to spend on alcohol. I am not naive to the fact that my mother is obviously entitled to something but she certainly shouldn't be entitled to everything with this being her fault.  Please give me a solution to put a smile back on my Dad's face!	Yes
938	My stbxMIL is suing me, she already sued me for something else and won (mostly because it was considered a martial contract that was violated) but has since agreed to drop it in exchange for me relinquishing my half of ownership on the cars. This suit is for a bunch of stuff, most of it is money she gave to him for various things before we got married and the money never went through my hands. There was one thing that we were married for but there was no agreement attached to it like her first suit and a couple of other things that I probably won't be able to get out of. She is also pursuing almost $1,000 for emotional trauma. Earlier this year she kicked me out, pushed me to my limits and ended up calling the police and filing a protective order. I want to countersue for emotional damages but I'm not sure for how much and all of that. It is small claims. Any advice is much appreciated	Yes
939	In Virginia (VA)  My coworker has a younger brother (we will call him Bob) that has gotten involved with a woman (we will call her Laura) who is separated but the divorce is not yet final.  She has another child with her ex that lives with them as well.  Laura still sees the ex twice a week.  Apparently Bob can't be put on the birth certificate (I think this is a good thing)  because she is still married to someone else.  Laura and Bob are living with Bob's parents,with the toddler, and she is now pregnant.  We don't 100% know that the child is his.  What should he be doing (and not do) between now and the birth, and after to ensure he is not on the hook for child support for another man's child, if it is not in fact his, until he can verify paternity?	Yes
940	"After many years of no contact I reached out to my father in prison. He quickly sent me paperwork to become his POA, which my aunt (his sister) has had up to this point. My dad has legal trouble in both NY and PA and is constantly appealing and transferring between both states.   My father was in his 60s when he went to prison and actually retired from his job, so he gets checks each month. He wants the money put into an account for legal fees and other expenses, and some taken out for commissary. He thinks his sister is taking his money (I highly doubt it) and that he wants me to take over.   I have a general understanding of POA but my dad has a sketchy past financially. I'm in nursing school full time, and financial aid pays for my schooling, and I'm not sure if having this financial POA counts as my income or his own. Do I have to file taxes on it? If it counts as income this might cut my financial aid back which would be devastating. My dad claims he owes nothing, but I know my dad had debt (I watched many cars get towed for non payment growing up) and have gotten phone calls for outstanding bills. Will they/can they come after me if I have POA? Can that effect my credit?  I can't afford to talk to a lawyer about this situation, and I'm not sure of my fathers current credit or debt. His past was always a secret and he lies a lot.   My mom is advising me not to, saying my aunt had problems with other inmates sending her threatening letters wanting his money. My dad talks to ""jail house lawyers"" aka inmates a lot and they wanted compensation from his retirement, so they threatened my aunt apparently via letters.   I'm unsure what to do really. I want to help him but I don't know much about POA, and googling only tells me so much. I'm trying to keep good credit and my debts to a minimum, and I feel like this can come back to bite me. Please help!"	Yes
941	Alright so I live in the US in Virginia and I'm a minor (15). My parents got a divorce and my dad is very abusive physically and emotionally so I ended up moving to my moms house. My dad gave me my clothes from his house but he's keeping my PC and other things from me (it was given to me as a gift for my birthday). Is there anything me and my mom can do (legally) to get any of my stuff back?	Yes
942	Hello, I need some advice and hopefully you guys can steer me in the right direction.  I live in Washington state, U.S. When I was 3-4 years old, my mother and father split up and she retained custody of me. They were not married. He has not paid a cent of child support and disappeared off the face of the earth after my mom took me and left. I recently reached out to him to see if he's someone I want to be a part of my life, and...he is one of the biggest pieces of human trash I have ever encountered in my entire life. Just a horrid human being. He lives in New York in a quarter million dollar home. My question is, can I (I'm 26 now) sue him for back child support, and if so, what steps should I take? My mom and stepdad raised me, I wasn't adopted, and they paid for me growing up. Just want to see some justice here. Thank you in advance.	Yes
943	State: Alaska Situation: unwed father and mother seperate and voluntarily relinquesh their rights and guardianship to the maternal Grandmother, so the unwed Mother may join the military.   Long term Guardianship was appointed to the maternal grandmother in the courts, where the judge ruled no child support would be taken once Fathers rights were terminated. The court order stated that Grandmother maintaineld physical custody but the mother was still accountable for providing financial support.   5 years later, Mother exits the military, terminates the Guardianship order and regains physical custody of the child, and files for child support, and 6 years worth of backpay, while the Father took NO steps towards re establishing his rights or responsibilities.  Soooo, can the FATHER still be taken for child support when the mother exits the military and reestablishes HER parental rights? Even after a judge ordered no child support? And could she collect back pay for the time in which his rights were terminated?   If NOT, how does one contest?	Yes
944	"This is a very long story but I will try to make it as simple as possible.   My husband is being asked to speak to a detective in a case against his brother ""Joe"".  We don't live near Joe, but another sibling does and is on Joe side saying that everything his ex-wife is saying is untrue.  Basically Joe is accused of molesting his five year old daughter. Supposedly, according to his ex-wife he has already lost custody of his daughter, but the court hasn't decided what will happen to their son.   When my husband was a little boy Joe molested him, and even though that's all in the past now, Joe's ex-wife is asking my husband to speak to a detective about it because she thinks it could help her case.  The problem is we don't know who's telling the truth. Joe says the court didn't take his daughter away, that it's a pending investigation, and his daughter was coached to say the things she did. According to his ex-wife she's worried that he'll molest their son too, but because he isn't  a named victim at this time the court might not take away parental visits.  My husband's having a hard time deciding what to do, because if Joe's ex-wife is telling the truth he wants to help protect his nephew. But if Joe is telling the truth he doesn't want to ruin his life. Also, if my husband makes a statement this will definitely divided the family as obviously everyone seems to believe Joe.  My question is if there's anyway that we can know, since we don't live near them, what actual evidence there are in the case. If my husband speaks to detective is he legally allowed to lie to my husband about the case?  Joe is a known liar... but his ex-wife can be cunning.  Is it possible that my husband's statement would really hold so much value?  Please help."	Yes
945	My sister has been bouncing around from place to place for the last eight years. She had my nephew five years ago when she was living in a very rural part of North Carolina, and spent some time in various communes or squats elsewhere in the US.  For a good amount of that time, she was with this guy “David.” David is not my nephew’s biological father but he’s as good as. My sister and David also have a 4-month-old daughter together. She was born in Washington and also doesn’t have a birth certificate.  For medical reasons, my sister decided to return to civilization. She, David, and the two kids have been living with me while they sort things out.  But I/we honestly have no idea how to legalize the kids’ existence. I’ve been talking to David and my sister about it, but it’s overwhelming and there’s no money for a lawyer or anything.  There's basically no record of either kid. No schools, hospital visits, etc. The only thing is a recent emergency room visit for the 5-year-old (which is what prompted the return to civilization in the first place).  My sister was born here in Massachusetts, but there’s no record of her residency at the approximant time of either kid’s birth. David is legally allowed to be in the US but he’s not actually a citizen. Again, there’s no record of his residency at the time of either kid's birth.  David and my sister aren’t married though they’re open to a city hall wedding if it makes the paperwork/immigration easier. David has also said he wants to put his name on the 5-year-old’s birth certificate as well, and I’m not sure if that makes things easier.  The goal is to get both kids birth certificates, get the 5-year-old in school for this fall, get medical insurance/care for both kids, and eventually get them passports so they can meet David's family.  We’re anticipating a lot of legwork on this but we don’t even know where to start.	Yes
946	My friend (not birth mother) asked me today if it is legal to adopt a child by signing the certificate at birth. Her co-worker (birth mother) is pregnant and wanting to put the baby for adoption. My friend and her husband have been thinking about adopting. The co-worker and my friend have the idea that when the baby is born my friend simply signs the certificate at the hospital with her husband and just like that the baby is adopted to them.  She is asking me what I think and I think it sounds illegal but I have no idea. Maybe the community here can give some in sight.   Note: If it is illegal they will NOT do it that way obviously. I suggested they see some one for a consultation to tell them their rights and explain CA's laws.	Yes
947	Is there ever an actual legal distinction between these options when filling out forms, and if so, when? What, if any, consequences are there to marking single instead of divorced?  Three examples:  * I imagine that my massage therapist doesn't really need to know I'm divorced, and even if she'd like to know that, I don't think there are any legal consequences for lying on a medical intake form. * On census forms, it maybe makes sense to mark divorced, since the whole point of a census is to gather demographic information, but while by law I am required to fill out the census, I don't see any avenue by which the census would a) know if I lied or b) be able to do anything about it. * On a credit application, I could see it being fraud if I didn't report legal obligations that reduced my available income (alimony, child support), but some states award 'palimony' and you don't have to have ever been married to owe child support, so as long as I disclosed those obligations, it doesn't seem like lying to check single instead of divorced.  I put [WA] for LocationBot, but this is really a general question and I'd be interested in hearing answers to locations other than the US if it differs. And there is no particular situation I'm in prompting me to ask, it's just a combination of:  * plain curiosity. * I'm really sick of something that happened years ago being considered the fourth-most defining characteristic about me (it's often after full name, birthdate, gender). * pedantic irritation about how it's always a radio button instead of a check list even though I am technically both single because I'm not married and divorced because I used to be married, and if I were to re-marry, I would be both married and divorced and it would still be a radio button, unless by dint of getting re-married I am somehow magically 'un-divorced' in the eyes of the form gods.	Yes
948	Hey there Reddits,   I live in Maryland with my boyfriend in a rental. We're unmarried, committed, and not really in any hurry to marry. We have a joint checking account, but also keep our own separate accounts. He has some (moderate) cash assets in his accounts. I have a student debt worth about half his assets.   We live in a pretty progressive area, but the local ERs/hospitals are all religious affiliated institutions, and we're gay.  In case something happens, I don't want either of us to have to fight for access/decision rights, etc.   We plan on seeing a local lawyer to get healthcare paperwork taken care of. Other than wills, medical POAs, and advanced decision directives, what else should we be working with them to do? Is there anything to worry about with his assets/my debts?  Anything else I haven't thought of?  TL/DR: Gay unmarried couple planning on seeing an attorney for health care paperwork. Anything else we should ask for to protect each other from debts/issues/etc.?  Thanks!	Yes
949	Too much backstory for tonight but we've been married 15 years, owned the home for 11. He's an alcoholic and a gambling addict, currently has no access to any cash, our finances are separate and all household expenses are paid by his grandmother who controls the bank account that his paychecks go into. I have my own money.   Will filing for legal separation be enough to keep him out of our home? I have his family's support in this. He's currently locked outside sleeping on a beanbag in the middle of our yard because of his drunk behavior tonight.   I need a hard line in the sand. I do not want to be married anymore. I do not want him here. When he sobers up tomorrow he will act like nothing is wrong and want to come home. I can't live like this anymore. What do I need to do/know?  We live in Washington State.  Thank you in advance for the advice you give here, I don't have anyone else, not like this anyway.	Yes
950	My daughter turns 18 in 5 months and has one year of high school left. She is severely mentally ill after being sexually abused by her bio dad for six years, and she has lived with me since January of 2016. Her bio dad is in jail awaiting sentencing.   She threw a coffee mug at me tonight as hard as she could because I asked her to pick up her belongings in the living room, she went to bed without doing it, and I immediately asked her to please get up and do it. When she did she was yelling at me the whole time, throwing things, etc. Long story short, we were arguing and she threw the mug at me. I covered my face, and it hit me in the ribs. She picked it up to throw it at me again, and I held her wrist and asked her to please put it down. She dug her nails into my arm before slamming it onto the table. She also broke a knitting needle in half and threatened to stab me in the neck with it.   After she went to her room I had my husband change the wifi password, and told her we would talk about it tomorrow. She decided to try to punish us by playing music really loudly, and when we told her we weren't going to let her use the wifi regardless she left. It was around 11:30pm at this time.   This is not the first time she has gotten violent with me. She also rescinded her consent to allow her therapist and doctors to speak with me, and she has not been to see her therapist in over a month. She won't allow me to have access to her meds, nor will she tell me what she is taking. She has broken our property, punched holes in the walls, broken the bathroom sink. I have had her hospitalized before. I should have called again tonight, but I'm just so exhausted with her. And I'm legit scared of her.   I suspect she went to her boyfriend's house. I was unable to call his father because she had her boyfriend block my phone number on his dad's phone. I was able to send him an email through the form on his business website just to give him a heads up.   I don't want her coming home without being able to communicate with her doctors and therapist at the bare mininum. Really at this point I would rather she not return home at all because she is completely uninterested in cooperating with me of following the house rules to even the barest degree. What are my options? I would like to still keep her safe as much as I can, but I don't feel safe with her living here anymore.	Yes
951	My soon to be ex husband came over and took my tv. (Were separated) I said no and was blocking the tv. He kicked me in the stomach and punched me in the arm to shove me away and grabbed the tv. I grabbed his shirt as he was leaving and it tore. He said great now when you call the cops it will look like you attacked me and you'll be arrested. He did this all in front of our 3 yr old son. What can I do? If anything. I didn't touch him (besides grabbing his shirt).	Yes
952	"Hi I'm 30 and my parents are divorced as my mom left our family for a man. My sister is 20 and in undergraduate school.My dad pays 2000 a month in child support to my mom which covers more than enough for her tuition. Last night my sister informed me my mom has been taking out student loans in my sisters name but won't tell her how much she's taking out and that my sister pays for everything herself and my mom is making her move home from college unless my sister pays ""because she can't afford it"".  The amount of money she's getting in child support is more than enough to cover her tuition room and board and she's seen not a dime of it and my mom is taking out loans for amounts she won't disclose with my sister in my sisters name.  What can be done About this matter ?"	Yes
953	This is going to be long so thanks for reading in advance  My wife (Canadian) and I got married in Toronto in May 2016. She insisted that we go live with her wealthy family in the middle east in Jordan after we got married. She was already working for her dad and he wanted to keep her from leaving the office so he promised me work and business opportunity. His promises turned to be flat out lies, I realised after 6 months of working for him that he is not going to pay a cent. Furthermore, my wife demanded an expensive wedding, a whole heap of jewellery and a honeymoon that I paid for (approximately 200K total cost). He had discussed wedding expenses with me when we got engaged and he said that he would help, he also said that he would organise the honeymoon and that it would be a surprise for us. He did nothing and it all turned out to be empty talk.   After almost 10 months of living with in laws in the middle east in a country where I had no visa, no work permit, and no driver’s license. I had enough so I decided to go back to my home country in New Zealand so that I can go back to work, get out of the middle east and start earning a living again. My wife reluctantly joined me and we have been in NZ for almost 3 months. I started a new job and we are living at my family’s house till we can look at purchasing our own place. I came back from work on Tuesday only to find that all the jewellery is gone, her stuff is gone and she is uncontactable. There were Auckland airport charges on my bank statement on the day that she left. I couldn’t get hold of her but I managed to speak to her dad who told me that she was depressed in NZ and she is on a plane back to Canada. I tried contacting her but she didn’t pick up or return my text messages. I knew she was unhappy here but never expected that she would do something like this. We never had an argument, she didn’t have to do a thing at home as I did the shopping, cooking and laundry. We had a cleaner come in once a week and she just stayed in bed on her laptop watching soaps and going once a week to get her nails done. I never touched or abused her physically or anything like that.   Our total time together as a married couple was 14 months. We don’t have any kids and its very unlikely that she is pregnant. We mostly lived at her parent’s place and at my parents for a couple of months. I do own a rental property that is rented as an investment and have some money saved in the bank both of these I bought pre marriage. I earned a total of $2000 dollars from working 2 weeks in NZ while I was with her. She never earned a cent as she just used her dad’s credit card to shop while we lived in the middle east. She has an apartment in the middle east that her dad bought for us and put it in her name but we only lived in it for 6 weeks before we left to go to NZ.   This is where I need your help reddit, I don’t know anything about Canadian law or how it works. However I would appreciate it if you can help please. Do you think she can come after my property here, take away my money or make any other demands? She left me last week and she is not willing to communicate. Even if she was depressed after what she did I don’t think I can ever trust her or get back with her. She is very materialistic, she took all the jewellery even a gold cross that my mum gifted to me when I was 16 for my first communion. For some reason she feels entitled to everything I have yet she never earned a cent as she always worked for her dad. Any suggestions please if there is something I need to do to protect my assets in NZ, I don’t own anything in Canada and I am not a resident or have any immigration status there.   TL:DR Canadian wife walked out on my after 14 months and may try to fleece me for money (no kids involved). We didn’t have a family home as we stayed at in laws place mostly and I didn’t work during this time. Is she entitled to anything? What can I do to protect my assets in New Zealand?	Yes
954	"My ex-girlfriend and I recently split up, we dated from March - June. We found out she was pregnant in May. She wouldn't tell me how far along she was and didn't seem too worried about going to the ultra sound or doctor's appointments and had a different story every time I asked her anything about it. She indicated that her and her ex had slept together a week before her and I got together, no condom. Her and I have never had sex without a condom. She even tells me that she ""knows"" that it couldn't be mine (I never came in her.) and is sure it's her ex-boyfriends, but is threatening to take me to court to pay for the test, out of spite. Is this legal?"	Yes
955	Okay, so I really don't know where to start with this. I am 17 years old and living in Texas. I recently moved out of my mother's house to live with my sister in my father's home. My father used to live here with us, but after getting a job in another state, he moved and I went to live with my mother. I lived with my mother from ages 15-17. As I lived there with my mother I started to realize how unstable the living situation was. There were times when she would yell at me so much that I had to leave to go stay at a friend's house. This happened multiple times. The incident that occurred that made me feel that I needed to move was when I came home one morning from spending the night at a friend's house to find all of my belongings thrown on the floor in my room. The entire house was in disarray.  She said that her friend was the one who was responsible for this, but now claims that she did it. I don't know which to believe. This all happened in the midst of her coming off of Xanax, so her words were slurred and she just wasn't making sense in general. This is not the first time she has had trouble with addiction. I was fed up, and decided to take my important belongings with me and move into the house I grew up in with my sister. I also feel that it's important to add that I go to school in the same city that my mother lives in, but I have plans to commute there while still living here. I really do not want to move in back with my mother. It is an unstable living environment. So I'm asking if, legally, I'm allowed to stay here. What rights do I have? Does she have any power over me? I'm very anxious that she might try to make me live with her. Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
956	wife's ex and us were working on a new visitation schedule for her daughter who is (now) 17. daughter suddenly decides she doesn't want to follow the CURRENT plan on file, and starts staying at dad's full time.    So now with the new plan almost signed, we really don't have any motivation to sign it, since what is on file is not being followed anyway and it doesn't give us a whole lot of faith the new one will be either.  Do we have any ground to stand on?  Should we just say fuck it and let it go?	Yes
957	"My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend (BM for baby mama) had him served last week, or the week before, to take him to court and change some things on their custody agreement.  On Sunday (07/25/17) she came to him and offered to remove a morality clause (""when enjoying access to the minor child, no parent is to have another of the opposite sex staying overnight"") and lower his child support payment significantly in exchange for abandoning the 50/50 custody they have previously agreed to, and changing it to the father getting the child every other weekend and one night a week.   Today, after thinking it over, he told her to tell her lawyer to start the paperwork. She immediately then began saying how she changed her mind about the morality clause since ""she's not comfortable with it.""  We do have a DNA test process started to determine if she's actually the father. I'd go into some details about why we have doubts, but I don't want to post anything too personal.   I'm sorry if this is all scatter brained, but I don't know anything about family law. All I know is that, I want to be with him, and I currently live eight hours away. No, we don't want to get married right now. It just feels like someone he dated for 4-6 months (I can't recall exactly) is controlling his life now, and I don't understand how she can do that. I'm aware of the need for a lawyer here, but like some other dad's paying child support, he can't afford a lawyer AND child support.   Do we just wait for the DNA test and go from there? Or do we take actions based on the assumption that the child will be his and focus our attention on getting this clause removed?   Thank you so much in advance, and I'm sorry if I sound super ignorant. I just can't read through the legalese anymore."	Yes
958	My ex has court-ordered child support payments that should be deducted from his pay. He moved back to Canada several years ago and was paying, but has stopped and currently is $28K in arrears. There is an order in place in Alberta, but they don't seem to be doing anything to collect, in spite of me giving them his work information and address/phone number. I believe he owns his own business but he may have lost it due to shady practices and not paying his bills. Is there any way, short of hiring a PI, to find out where he is and if he's working somewhere else? I've tried calling the Alberta child support enforcement but they refuse to talk to me, which is extremely frustrating.	Yes
959	My dad abused me to the point where I had so much adrenaline pumped I could barely even feel the physical pain with household items used as weapons against me. I don't think I need to go into the details, but this was in a country with basically non existent child protection laws and I decided not to go to the embassy on the basis that it would be better to request aid in Canada.(and I was too scared to)  The abuse hasn't happened after a bit more than a week of being in Canada, but is there anything I can/should legally do? I don't want to mess up anyone's life, but since he's betrayed my trust so many times and significantly affected me, I don't want him to go unpunished.  Yes, I am under his(and my mother's) custody and I am living with them.	Yes
960	Is there a way to see my full divorce decree online in Missouri? I have lost the paper copy and I’m hoping I can get a copy online without having to go to the courthouse.  Thanks in advance.	Yes
961	Backstory,  we've been married 14 years.  We/He just bought our first house in another state.  We are moving with the intention of getting divorced in the next year. He agreed to move to my home town but said if he decides to purchase and not rent, he wants  me to not fight him for the house in the divorce.  I haven't worked significantly in the last several years to care for our daughter.   Will this document he wants me to sign hold up in court? I have no access to any money to hire legal help I'm not sure if I should sign.	Yes
962	Wife and I are splitting up and filing for a dissolution. However, the process seems kind of complicated. We have already worked out all division of property and assets (we are 25 and 23, so there isn't a whole lot). How do we file from here? Is it worth using an online service to fill out the paperwork?  Also, residency might complicate things. I'm keeping my permanent address in Ohio, but I'm going out to college in Utah for the next year. Should I get residency in Utah or keep my Ohio license and permanent address? We've been living with her parents and that's the address on my license.   Sorry if this isn't super coherently written, but any follow-up questions are welcome.	Yes
963	"Today I was told by one of my other siblings that my sibling (let's call him Joe *alternate name used for privacy purposes*) who is less than 7 years old tried to kill himself. Twice. My mother withheld this information from me and the rest of my siblings who are not living in the house because ""it is none of our business"".  My mother has a documented history of physical child abuse, and has mentally and emotionally abused my siblings and me for most of our lives. She has BPD, but any time she meets with a therapist she fires them because she refuses to accept that she is the problem. I don't think she or my stepfather are physically abusing him, but I definitely know they are mentally/emotionally abusing him. I'm trying to get more information about what happened, but I think my mother is freezing me out.  There are three other siblings in the house with him, two of which are 6 months old babies. I know the babies are okay because they're little and cute and that's how my mother prefers kids. I don't know how the other sibling is doing, and I suspect he's getting the same treatment as ""Joe"".  I am a junior in college at the moment, living with my boyfriend of 3 years. We share a car, but my income is primarily based off of a financial aid refund (but I'm more than willing to get a job). He earns about $40k a year. We live about 2.5 hours away from my siblings. I don't know what to do, but I know they aren't safe. They may not be in any immediate danger, but I know that something is wrong in that house.  I don't want them to go into foster care. If they're going to be anywhere, I want them with me. I know this is going to keep happening. Where do I start? What do I do?"	Yes
964	"Background info that you need to know: My dad has physically abused me for basically my entire life, and my mom their entire marriage (has become a lot less frequent in the later years of their marriage, but he still threatens her with a raised hand. Also, she has kind of learned not to speak out against him because she understands the physical threat that he poses to her). Up until recently I just took the abuse and did nothing about it, but over the past year and a half or so I've been standing up for myself and threatening to dial 9-1-1 if he stepped closer (first time I did this was when he was threatening to beat me with a bat because i accidentally lost one of his papers -- locked the door and put the phone up to the window so he could see) and even using my own strength to stop him from hitting me - not hitting back, just using my arms to hold his down.  Also, my dad has been financially abusive his entire life. My mother works 5 days a week and makes almost as much money as he does on top of the countless hours of housework that she does and the abuse that she has to go through from him, and still she is barely ever allowed to spend money on anything for herself. Every penny she spends is policed by my dad and he goes so far as to make her return things that he does not approve of. He barely gives me any money to spend (probably has given me on average like 5 bucks every 2 months -- he hasn't even given me a birthday present or a graduation present or anything), which isn't such a big deal on its own and honestly it may seem like I'm complaining about a first-world problem and sound like a little brat but what makes it awful is that he did not allow my sisters and me to get jobs while each of us were in high school (although with some convincing I managed to get permission to get one near the end of my senior year of high school, but I couldn't find a job all throughout the summer), so basically we all wanted money to spend but he would not let us work nor would he give us money. He's even been known to take money from us that we received from other family members on special occasions, which is why we've learned to hide our money even around our own house.  Also, he makes every decision in the household for both himself and my mother and she plays a very small role in any of those decisions if any at all, even though she is a breadwinner just like he is. He threatens her with physical abuse or raises his voice at her if she doesn't comply with what he chooses to do, and eventually she just gives in like always.  I planned to move into my college dorm (university is in NJ) on the 31st of September to start my freshman year of college. The payment for my first semester costs, including tuition and housing and everything, is due on the 17th of August, and it's not small amount of money that I can pull out of nowhere in 7 days. --------------------------------------  So, over the past few months, things have been getting pretty heated between me and my dad. I don't see him much during the day, but on the occasion that I'd still be awake when he came back from work, we'd usually fight about something, and the fights have been getting more and more frequent.  Tonight, my whole family was in the car on the way back from an event, and he asks me about my roommate, and somehow, like always, one thing leads to another and we're arguing with each other again. He says to me ""Ok, well if this is how it's going to be, then we're not going to be paying for your college. You're on your own."" I told him to stop using the word ""we"" as if my mom had any choice to make in the first place -- I told him to say what he truly meant and use the word ""I"", because everyone knows it's only him that makes any big decision like that ever and speaks on behalf of both my parents. Even though my mom makes her own money, if she wanted to pay for my college fees, she wouldn't be able to because my dad would not allow her -- or at least she feels too threatened to try anything like that. We usually have this argument and it blows over in a few days, except this time I went even further and told him that he basically ruined my life and called him out for physically, mentally, and emotionally abusing me throughout my entire life and doing the same to my mother throughout their entire marriage. This got him especially upset, and as we were coming out of the car, he rushed to the back, clearly very angry, and I knew straight away what he was about to try and do, so I locked the door and punched in 9-1-1 on my phone and showed him. Eventually, I got out of the car safely, but he would not let me back in.   So yeah, after much threatening over the years, my dad had finally kicked me out of the house for the first time ever. I called up one of my friends but by the time he got to my house (about 2 hours ago) my mom told me she wanted me to come in and just say sorry to my dad, but there was no way I was going back inside there, so I just left for a little and my friend and I hungout and I planned to stay over his house for the night like he had offered, but my mom wanted me back home and had convinced my dad to let me stay, so I just went back. And now here I am, typing all of this that literally just happened and my dad's upstairs and things are extremely heated between us and this is the first time that I'm actually legitimately concerned about what's going to happen in my future after a threat from my dad, because our argument tonight actually went way beyond the level that it usually does.  I still have to get a new phone and laptop for college which my dad had promised me, so that's also a problem, because I doubt he's going to be paying for those things any time soon. I'm going to ask my mom to help me out on her own without my dad but I know it's possible she might not agree because she would not even think of going against my dad's word. As I mentioned before, the payment is due on the 17th of August and I do not think between now and then that my dad will change his mind about paying for it, and even if he does, I do not want to remain under his fiscal control like my sisters have all throughout their college years, because they go through hell whenever they want to make a decision about their lives and I don't want to put myself in that situation. I'm completely lost, I have no clue what to do. Please help.  P.S. sorry if there's a lot of useless information in here, I just wanted to put the stuff about my dad because it seemed to me like a lot of it was illegal and it might help. Also, I'm just a complete mess of emotions and my thoughts are running crazy right now."	Yes
965	"I have my court date set for this Monday against my ex (the defendant/respondent) to set ""parental responsibilities"" (I.e. Custody) over our two year old daughter. I'm asking the court for full decision making powers, as well as for her to live with me, and have her mother see her every other weekend, as well as a weekly, non-overnight visit.  She currently resides with her mother. I work full time, she works part time. It has been my family that has taken care of my daughter when we are both at work, where she also spends time with her cousins that are around her age. There has been some neglect on the mother's side for her care, such as not packing supplies in the diaper bag, not bathing her for days or even up to a week, not changing her diaper and bringing her with a bad diaper rash.. etc.   I'm looking for advice as to how I should prepare myself for this hearing. I've never dealt with anything like this, so I'm a bit unfamiliar with the process. I've talked to an attorney and they believe I have a strong case, but I'm just looking for further advice as to how I should structure my arguments and what I should focus on during my testimony, as well as resources that will aid me such as evidence, affidavits, witnesses, and such.   Thank you for your help."	Yes
966	This in regards to technically my nephew-in-law, my husband's sister's son. Our nephew is about two years old and we were informed by her and a family friend that he was taken into foster care on Friday. We aren't sure exactly what happened to cause it, since we can't get any straight answers out of my sister-in-law, but clearly it was pretty serious. She has been under the scrutiny of CPS since the child was born, and even lived with us for a few months after he was born under an agreement with CPS.   We don't understand why we weren't contacted to have our nephew stay with us instead of being put into foster care. We've been an advocate for him since he was born. We've tried contacting CPS, but we know they can't tell us anything--we're just a little desperate. I tried contacting a few lawyers Friday and today (Monday), but I haven't yet been able to find anyone able to help on short notice (not at least for three more weeks). I've contacted my work hotline that helps connect employees with a lawyer or legal advice, they gave me a couple names, but agreed it would be incredibly difficult to find someone to talk to immediately. I haven't been able to get a response from anyone today. None of that is too relevant except that to tell you all, I'm desperate and I just don't know what to do.  We're supposed to be going out of town tomorrow for the rest of the week. Our sister-in-law is telling us she has a hearing this week and wants to declare her intent to have us to adopt her son. But no one has contacted us and no one will talk to us about it, besides her, and we have reason to not trust her. We don't know if one of us should try to stay to see what happens and if we'll need to take action during the week. The trip is for work, and so it's hard for us to make this decision not to leave just on a whim, when no one's telling us we need to be here.  I don't want to be too specific just because this could all involve some legal allegations that, again no one will talk to us about, but I thought maybe I could ask some specific questions someone could give us some advice:  1. I've been told that typically children are placed with family before being placed into foster care. However, no one gave us the option to take him, even though we believe our sister-in-law and social services knew that we would willingly care for him. We're incredibly worried that our sister-in-law has said something about my husband to make them think we were a threat, which would be completely untrue. Is that possible, or does it seem normal that a child would be placed in foster care just while they were figuring out what to do? And if something was said about us do we have any right to know about it?  2. What can I say, who can I contact to let them know how urgent our situation is? I feel like I keep getting brushed off from law offices because my matter is 'too urgent', they tell me to talk again to my referral service, but then I'm just stuck again with someone who can't take our case.   3. Is it actually possible that my sister-in-law is preparing to hand her son off for adoption to us but yet no one has tried to talk to us about it besides her?!   4. I realize that two weeks in foster care probably won't harm this kid forever, but at the same time, I am worried that things are going to move down a path so quickly that we may never see our nephew again, without even getting the opportunity to speak up about it. I know that we don't technically have any legal rights over him since we aren't his parents, but we care about him and we want what's best for him, and think that that is with us (if it can't be with her). But we don't know where to start and we don't know who to talk to to make sure our voice is heard.  It's been a long day and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this! There are a lot of details I left out, and my mind is racing and stressed at the moment. I could write a novel about the journey we have been through with this kid, and I want to help him so much, but I don't know how to say it to the courts.	Yes
967	I have a friend, and due to the fact that she is gay, was kicked out of her home. She right now with family in Virginia, but thinks that she might get kicked out of there too, and might have to live alone in NYC or DC. Her location is in Tinton Falls, NJ, but now I don't know where in Virginia. Is she able to legally get back home? Or press charges on her mother if at all needed? I just want to know what her options are. Thank you	Yes
968	"My parents were married for over 10 years, but have been divorced now for almost 15. Recently my father was hospitalized and somehow my mother found out about it, came to the hospital and present herself as his ""wife"". She still uses his last name.   This caused some confusion as I was already there making decisions. I am his oldest child and his next immediate next of kin. Once I found out what she was doing I asked her to leave and requested the hospital not allow her back in but this has gotten me to thinking- how can I prevent this from happening in the future? Do I need to carry a copy of their divorce decree with me at all times? Is there something similar to a will my dad needs to have done clarifying that I'm his next of kin? He doesn't have a will now, and doesn't really have any assets to speak of, which is why I think he's never taken care of getting one."	Yes
969	Location: KY  Going off this post: Wife on drugs and cheating on me with coworker. What can I do? https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6nd1vy/wife_on_drugs_and_cheating_on_me_with_coworker/  I caught my wife up in some more lies and she is livid right now. She said she's coming to get my daughter away from me and telling me there isn't anything I can do because we are married, she has possessions in the house and the cops won't escort her off the premises.   I'm worried about the safety of my daughter. She says she hasn't used drugs in about a month now so Idk what leg I will have to stand on there and it's the weekend so I don't know how to go about getting an emergency custody order. My lawyer is on vacation and Idk what to do? Do I have to let my daughter go with her? IS there anything legally I could do?  She's currently working out of state in another store and wouldn't be here until around 11 tonight.	Yes
970	I haven't seen my soon to be ex and my daughter in over a year. I have no clue where she is. What can I do to be legally separated from her while unable to communicate with her?	Yes
971	The way i worded it in the title makes this seems a lot more civil than it is. My uncle cousin and aunt lived with my grandmother (uncles mother). Friday my grandmother and aunt got into a fight and my aunt left calling it the straw that broke her back. My uncle is completely fine separating from her, but he needs to see his daughter. My aunt told my uncle not to come to her parents house or her dad will shoot him. My uncle's response was to call his cousins and nephews (including me) to do a home invasion style re-kidnapping of his daughter. I told him how shitty that will look in court, not to mention the danger we'd be in (the old man with a gun would get at least 2 of us).  After calming him down and convincing him to see a lawyer Thursday (earliest appointment) he is now irate at the thought of not being able to see his child for at least a week. It seems like he's starting to move the pieces for his raid again but this time leaving me out.  What can I do to help my uncle see his child today (sun/mon are his days off)? My grandmother went to the hospital and is working on getting a birth paper copy to give to the police, thinking this will allow him to legally kidnap the his child while the aunt is at work; will this work or at least allow him a visit?  Florida.	Yes
972	Someone I know had their daughter falsely accuse them of sexual abuse. She said to her mom that she was just trying to relate with her friend because her friend was talking about being abused. Her friend told the counselor at school, the girl freaked out and stuck to the story of molestation because she was scared. she was not expecting the situation to blow out of proportion. My friend's daughter is 12, she wants to fix this, what can she do?	Yes
973	"Me and my partner are planning on getting married.  We are both men, and we both work at the same company. We are closed at work and very ""straight acting"". While we do not work at a ""Christian company"", we work in an environment were one family makes up the executive branch of the business and they are very, very, religious and very, very, conservative.          To the best of my knowledge, being LGBT is still not a protected class in the state of Michigan. Michigan is also an at will state.           If we were to marry, would we need to disclose partner information to the company?  I know that we would change our tax with holdings but I'm not entirely sure what that entails. We both have health care through the company individually so I don't need to add him to my plan.              It's kind of shitty that I can't just be happy about getting married without worrying about losing my job but it is what it is."	Yes
974	"Quick backstory: I caught the ex wife cheating and asked for a divorce as a result. She gave a lot of lip service and crocodile tears before she just threw her arms up and went with it. In the agreement towards the marital home, she said that she would keep it. Our divorce decree states the following: ""8. Property Settlement: a. Real Property: Wife shall retain the marital home, located at REDACTED in REDACTED, and shall be responsible for all costs associated with the property, including the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities. Wife shall hold Husband harmless and indemnify him in regard to such liabilities. Husband shall quit-claim the property to the Wife within 14 days of judgment in this matter.""  Handed it over, she said that she would live in the house without issue. States also that my name must come off the house as of Jan 2019. So the mortgage was behind when I left, but I forked over my tax return (about 8k) to cover it, and was told about a week ago that she has no plans to make any future payments. This year she went to Disney World with her new husband, and just spent it there... however she has made every payment up to now, and I want to save my credit, as I just got into the Excellent range and was looking to buy a home once this one sells. For about 6 months, I was told that the house was going to sell. Unbeknownst to me, ex-wife took out a lean, with my name, on the house to bring the payments down. So when she went to sell, the bottom dropped out of the deal when they found the lean. I don't know where the 28k extra came from, but the decision to do this occurred once I signed the quit-claim. Last week, she tells me matter of fact-ly that ""I have no plans to make any more payments,"" since she got knocked up the week she met her current husband, and decided to take extra time off this summer when she could have worked. She DECIDED not to work. Yes. she had another baby, but she told me that ""she only got paid for 4 weeks off."" She also just moved into a 350k house with this guy and put a giant divide between me and the kids. A year ago today she didn't even know this guy.   Any case, I'm tired of the surprises. Surprise! I've been having an affair for 15 months. Surprise! I met some guy last Tuesday and me and the kids are moving in! Surprise! I'm also pregnant! The house I told you I was refinancing to get your name off, didn't get your name off! Surprise! NOW YOUR CREDIT IS GOING TO HIT THE TOILET!  No more surprises. I rented an apartment down the street so I could be with my children anytime, at the drop of a hat, and this woman decided that her tingles were once again, way more important than the relationship her children have to their father. I'm lucky that I have a 50/50 custody agreement, but I don't know what to do.   I spoke with my lawyer, who said that she could not represent me, but that my ex would be in contempt of court. I'm sick of this woman having jurisdiction to screw with my life over and over again. What does contempt of court mean? I asked but it was an inopportune time. This person can physically work, just refuses to because ""she just had a brand new baby"" with her husband and spent all of her money irresponsibly. She is still driving around in a car with my name on it that I help pay for... why can she just tank whatever deal she wants but she can tank her obligations to the martial home? I thought I was being really generous with her to keep her name on it. I had no idea that she was going to get knocked up and walk away from it. Her response to my saying that I will petition the court was ""what is that even going to do for you?"" I also found out that she stole money out of my son's college fund. It was only 1k, but this stuff is getting really old.   Any help that you can muster would be appreciated  Some guy in Connecticut"	Yes
975	I am a friend of the wife in question.  I know a little about evictions and stuff from lurking here but this is getting out of control and beyond my scope. Today the wife went to work. Apparently they have been considering divorce and yesyerday husband thought she was cheating cause she said hi to some guy? I don't know. Either way, while she was at work, he served her with custody papers for their child, threw her stuff on the lawn, and kicked her out of the house. He has also gotten violent but not today. I told her to call the cops and that she can't just be kicked out, but this is a hostile environment foe the kids. She is just getting out of work.  Firstly I need to know what to tell her to do about her being kicked out and her stuff thrown out.  Secondly, how does she go about fighting this custody? She is a great mother and in fact works as a teacher at the school her daughter attends. He is doing this simply to try and hurt her. He hasn't even cheated, which is the worst part, she said hi to a work friend.	Yes
976	Long story short, he has had the same job 2-ish years, has had it set up to be withdrawn from his paycheck automatically, and for some reason it's not deducted in full, and we have had to constantly pay the $6 or some odd low denomination manually as we get notices... This alone is infuriating.  We also receive constant notices from the DMV about his license being revoked due to lack of payment despite not being late and paying in full, monthly.   There seems to be an endless loop of no one to call and miscommunication but it reoccurs monthly or every three months, rinse and repeat. he is at the pint of just paying whatever comes in, and that I can't really get behind. I understand he is just tired of fighting, but really, what should I have him do to sort this out and get these letters, the run around and the miss communication to stop?	Yes
977	Greetings,  Long story short. I was in an abusive relationship for over 15 years - myself and my children escaped from it - my soon to be ex husband lives in the US. Despite some foolishness by him and his lawyer, the divorce was granted just over a week ago, on the grounds that I contact Relationships Australia, so they can mediate more contact between him and our five children. I had to do so with 14 days of the court ruling. I did so the following Monday and I have an appointment on August 15th.  Two days ago, after I let him know that our children were ready to talk to him, he told me via text that if I didn't directly negotiate with him and send him something in writing before August 4th, 2017, he will be appealing the divorce. This is despite the fact that I have fulfilled the court's requirements.  As far as I know, as I am self representing due to financial constraints, I do not legally have to negotiate outside of the agency nominated by the courts. Nor am I legally required to agree to anything or put anything into writing before August 4th - this is just day 14 from the last court date.  I want to know if there is anything else I can do to stop this? Even talking to this man is a huge trigger for me - anxiety, nightmares, fear. I am going to start seeing a DV counsellor here soon because of the issues he is causing.  FYI: There were never any FVO charges filed because I was in socially and financially isolated in the US. He told me, and I believed at the time, that if I charged him, he would be fired by his employer and it would be my fault that our children would be homeless and destitute. Wrong in hindsight, but very real in that instance.  I also have several family members and friends writing affidavits and statutory declarations concerning what they witnessed etc.  I just want to know if there is anything legally I can do - NOW. To be proactive.  Thank you so much.	Yes
978	"Hi, I'm in the UK currently, and I'm 18 years old. My mum and dad had a really bad breakup.Me and my Dad are moving to Canada in a few weeks, and while my dad is in Canada looking for a house, I've been staying with my Mum. Long story short she let me borrow a laptop, and she left her Facebook logged in when I went to use it. I saw a message that mentioned my name so I used the search bar in the messages to find other messages mentioning me.   She mentioned to two separate people that she wants to 'Go buy some illegal drugs and stuff them in (dad's) suitcase.' Obviously intending to cause issues at the airport and stop us from flying, possibly even worse.   She also mentioned ""Someone left their keys here by accident... Must have had the wrong ones cut when I went to get a copy of our own house keys made"", implying that she purposely had a copy of my dads house key cut. She also says that she used this to find documents in my dads house that told her what part of the new city we will be living in, and where my dad will be working.  She explained to a friend how she was planning on putting a satellite tracker in my camera bag, talking about how its battery is good for 5 days, and how it is accurate to 5-15 meters.   IN this conversation she also mentions wanting to find where to get drugs to plant in my dads suitcase.   Other more minor things she talked about were an IP grabber to find our new IP and using this to find our new location, and giving me essential oils without me knowing to help me sleep. Obviously the oils are not as concerning as the other problems but still makes me uncomfortable.  Screenshots to see what I'm talking about:  http://i.imgur.com/IgGHwpe.png?2 Illegal key cutting, finding documents in my dads house leading to our new adress and his new workplace  http://i.imgur.com/ozSoLnx.png?3  Wanting to plant drugs in my Dads suitcase, the satellite tracker  http://i.imgur.com/ZtT4P6e.jpg?1  Another conversation where she mentions putting drugs in my dads bags  http://i.imgur.com/TClYiXv.png?1  Family friend telling her how to use grabify to get our new ip/find our location  Any help would be appreciated on what to do, is it possible to get a restraining order based on this? There are screenshots for proof in case she deletes the chat logs, she's also taken away the laptop and told me that I will have to find a place to stay until my dad is back and we move to Canada."	Yes
979	I am only asking for informational purpose as I was curious whether it rests with the father or the mother (paternity established, and they share custody). I also want to know if different states have different laws regarding naming the child.	Yes
980	My wife and her ex husband have joint custody, after a fight broke out between her ex and his father while the children were in his company, and witnessed the event she filed a restraining order (for the children) and was granted emergency full custody.   We then filed for a custody modification. However all legal council on both sides have been dragging their feet endlessly causing the restraining order to expire before we even get to go to court. Now the children are being forced to resume the previous custody arrangements the existed before the incident.  My question however is a little confusing. Since her ex (the children's father) had a restraining order his lawyers had him sign control over the case to his parents. (Who are narcissistic) This whole time we haven't been going up against the grandparent, not the father.   Now that the restraining order has expired, is their a motion we can place to have them remover from the case?	Yes
981	My ex recently talked to a friend who mentioned that some night shifts pay up to 10% shift differential.  Based on this, she wants the child support recalculated to reflect any incentives that I am being paid.  Is this a standard procedure or is support calculated on base pay only?  I mean, what if I start working tons of over-time?  Will support payments be calculated on that?  Where does this end? PA resident.	Yes
982	"Canada.  My niece and nephew are twins, age 14.  A year and a half ago my brother was roughhousing with my nephew, things got out of hand, and nephew got scared.  My brother explained to him he was never in any danger, apologized for scaring him, and hasn't played like that since.  Fast forward to three weeks ago.  Somehow (don't know how) child services got wind of the incident and ordered my brother to immediately go no contact with his kids.  They call this a ""safety plan"".  He has been staying with me since then.  Even though the incident only involved my nephew, he's also not allowed to see my niece.  He is however allowed to see my kids.  Between then and now, they've interviewed my niece and nephew once, my brother once, and they talked to my sister-in-law briefly.  Everyone including my nephew basically said, yes it happened, it was a year and a half ago, it was an accident, it hasn't happened since.  Child services reported this to the RCMP which closed the file without even speaking to my brother because they do not believe a crime was committed.  Child services tells my sister-in-law that breaking the safety plan could result in the kids being removed from her as well and being placed in foster care.  The social worker says it's unlikely he'll ever see his kids again without supervision.  This is, to say the least, overkill.  With the exception of this one incident, my brother is a model parent.  He coaches his kids' sports teams, he volunteers at their school, he's well-liked by everyone, children and their parents alike.  My brother has contacted a lawyer who advised him to work with child services as best he can and to call him back when child services asks him to agree to or sign something.  What can be done to hurry the process along so my brother can live at home again?"	Yes
983	i am 20 years old and decided to take my 2 and five yearold siblings with me to stay in my appartment thats an HR away. I have the mom's permission but not my dad. He is abusive to his wife and are both going through a separation right now. I wanted to take the children out of the tense environment. He wants the kids back and will call the police, what are my rights and options?	Yes
984	"My SO's mom is abusive and controlling. She is 17 now and turns 18 in several months, I am 18. I live with my parents and am in college but my parents, after seeing how my SO is treated, are willing to let her move in unconditionally. I have some questions about how to (if it's possible) take things legally which have been paid for in full or in part by her mother. We live in TX.  ---  Here's the situation:  * SO is the daughter of a single, never-married mom who owns a small business. We've been together for 3 years.  * SO has no license because her mom is ""too busy"" to take her to TXDPS (DMV). She paid 50% for a car and chauffeurs her mom around illegally because if she doesn't her mom will have a meltdown. She needs a parent/guardian there to get a license so she will have to wait until 18 to drive legally. Her mom's name is on the title. The car is insured and SO pays for the insurance.   * SO has a joint savings account with her mom with around $6000 in it from working for her mom after school and during summer.   * SO likely has an undiagnosed chronic condition (which my best guess for is strain+anemia or fibromyalgia) which has gone untreated because her mom lacks insurance or is ""too busy"" to take her to the Dr. (both excuses have been used along with others).  * SO has access to her birth certificate and social security card but no form of photo ID.   * SO has many items of clothing and other misc. things paid for by her mom which she would like to keep.   ---  Here's the questions:  * Can a joint savings account be cut off by either party at any time? How would one go about doing that? Could it be done in advance without the her mother being aware?  * We know that she has to wait until she is 18 to get her license and it will hopefully be much easier, but what about the car she paid 50% of? We're not hopeful about being able to bring it because the title is in her mother's name, but just in case, is there some way to legally keep the car without having a title transfer because she paid for half of it? Like I said we are not hopeful and she is willing to eat that $2600 if it means moving away, but it would be nice to keep it.   * They currently don't quite have medical insurance, what they have is a ""Health care sharing ministry."" I'm not exactly sure what it is but based on what I've read online it seems like something John Oliver would make a segment on. That's besides the point because the assumption is that her insurance will be canceled when she does leave. I am guessing that because she won't be on her mom's ""insurance"" and because she is not one of my parents' children, she cannot be on our health insurance. What is there to be done about insurance? Will she have to buy her own policy if she wants insurance?  * Are SO's birth certificate and social security card her property? The birth certificate is not the original, a new one had to be requested because her mom lost the old one and her mom paid for the new one. Since those are the only documents she has to prove her identity, are they her property? The birth certificate is kept at the place of business and social security card kept in her mom's wallet (stupid, I know).   * Her mom has paid for probably about 80% of her clothing and other items. Is it stealing to take them? Can they be assumed her's because she wears them? How can she take her clothes and other belongings without it being thievery?   Thanks for bearing with me through the long post and thanks for your advice.   TL;DR: SO is daughter to single mom, SO turns 18 soon. How do we arrange to get her belongings and identity (which were mostly paid for by her mom) legally?"	Yes
985	So a friend of mine was divorced a couple years ago: she cheated on him with his best friend (split up 2 families) now they are living together. In the past couple years she's accused him of a crazy amount of shit (all of which was investigated and turned out to be false)  -he beat her - false - he beat the kids - false - he doesn't pay spousal/child support - false -he's doing drugs and drinking around the kids - false So she's used the police and court system to make his life a living hell and everything has turned up false.  He recently had a court date to go over the custody agreement (he only gets to see his kids when she lets him which is extremely rare). And wouldn't you know it just a couple of weeks before the date she comes at him again. He came home to find his house raided and all his personal electronics gone. She called the police on him again. My question is this: this is the 5th time (that I'm aware of) she's made false accusations against him. Is there anyway to turn it back on her? She's basically getting the justice system to do her dirty work and make the guys life a living hell.  He's paying for his lawyer, her lawyer, spousal support and child care.	Yes
986	Hello.  I want to preface with this is not for me, but a friend, and just need some advice.   It is almost a nightly occurrence that they want to kill themselves because of their family. They have been through psychologists and everything, but their family isn't changing anything and keeps blaming them.   They are about to be 17, is there anything they can do to get out of the house before they are 18? It seems like if the family is the main reason they are struggling, there should be something to help.   Am I just being naive?  I appreciate any advice, please let me know if I need to clear anything up, I don't really know how else to say this.   Thank you all.	Yes
987	Texas  My husband and I are splitting up. We have a 3 year old son together. My husband has offered to pay me $600 a month in child support. $500 would go to child care and the extra $100 would be for anything else he needs. My husband brings home around $4,500 a month. He also has our son insured through his work.  Here is the issue - I want to go through the attorney general for child support. He doesn't want me to because he says I'll get more money from him and I 'don't need more money than that'. He says that he put me through school so that I could have a career and can take care of myself and that I really don't need any more money from him in child support. I make about half of what he makes monthly.  I didn't think this was fair, so I told him that I was going to get a lawyer for all of this. His response to that was that if I went out and got a lawyer to get more child support, he would ask that I take our son to an actual daycare. My dad has been taking care of my son since he was born. He watched him every day when I was in nursing school, and he watches him while I work. He's been to every single doctors appointment, he takes him to his T-ball practice and he does 2 learning programs with him at home - ABCmouse and a program with actual books and flash cards. He's doing really well with these programs. My son is very close to him and I feel safe knowing that he's with him.  So my question is - would I likely get more money in child support if I go through lawyers? And can my husband make me send our son to a daycare facility?	Yes
988	multiple times she has been incommunicado, for weeks.  7 at one point until we had a family blow up and she finally responded to our attorney.  This filing in family court being delayed is putting a major strain on the relationship between my wife and her daughter.  Do I have any options for grievance/complaint to BAR assoc or anything..or because I'm not HER client I am out of luck?  All this could have been settled 2 months ago had she been responsive.  We've been dealing with delays since APRIL 1!	Yes
989	"Father has son on vacation in Florida while school is out. He is trying to claim his vacation address as sons current address for full custody. The father wants to take away custody from the mother on the grounds that I, the boyfriend walk the house naked in front of the child, as well as drink excessively and do drugs while in the presence of the child.  I have &lt;b&gt; NEVER&lt;/b&gt; exposed myself to that child, and I don't even drink.. or do drugs.. it also says she has moved the child several times during his VPK, and kindergarden years..  She moved to try and work things out with the father, who then abandoned her and forced her to move again.   If it helps, I have no history of drugs or alcohol.  The father who wants custody has served 5-8 years.. not sure.. for possession of cocaine over 150grams..  The paperwork we received says we have 20 days to write a written response to the court.  Mother is in North Carolina, Father is in florida. Mother has a job that can be home with her child every day.

Yes
990	"A girl i know and i were talking and she casually mentioned her almost 1 year old daughter doesnt have a birth certificate or a social security card. She had an unassisted home birth in California and almost immideatly moved to Illinois and never signed her daughter up for one. Her daughter hasnt been to a doctor and she tells public aid that her social security card was ""stolen"". She also doesnt plan to ever sign her up for school. She wants to raise her completely off the grid.  I know this will cause problems in the future but can anything be done about it now? Is this illegal?"	Yes
991	I am currently in the process of leaving an abusive partner. One of my hesitations is that they have threatened to turn in a family member of mine for being a pedophile if I don't stay with them. For my own reasons and really the time elapsing, I have no intention of pressing charges. He is not around children and does seem to have reformed.   I am asking because if my dad is to get contacted about abuse, he will lose his shit and I want to be prepared.	Yes
992	Legality - Ontario, Canada  Recently found out my estranged father has very likely been lying and severely downplaying his income during mine and my siblings childhood and made measly payments under duress to my mother for years.   He's owned a business and also registered it in at least 2 states in the U.S over the last 10 years as I've learned through research online. I've also found details on the market value of his (more than comfortable) home, as well as some help of friends viewing it who live in the area, and it does NOT align with the income story he was making up for years when I was younger.   Lots of variables and missing pieces but wanted some general advice on if this is worth my time pursuing for back pay as my mother had struggled for years to make ends meet for us. It may be impossible to forge a case as he was doing his own business during my childhood and that info isn't accessible. Where would a lawyer begin into something like this if there's evidence that there was some blatant lying going on?  Anything is greatly appreciated.	Yes
993	This might get long.  I have previously posted about this. I granted my ex primary physical custody of our daughter, since she wouldn't sign divorce without it, I did so with the condition that we maintain joint legal custody and that I would still get 3 days with her each week. So, technically the primary physical custody is only in name. I found out after filing, from her boyfriend, that she would move to a house further away. Google says the commute without traffic is 50 minutes and 39 miles, not counting actually dropping off my daughter at the school. God knows how long it will be with traffic, current commute is 20 minutes, and 14 miles. I drive a lease, so this will definitely kill my lease. She has decide all on her own to enroll our daughter in a school closet to her. How this affects me, is that I have our daughter Sunday, I drop her off at school Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and I pick her up on Monday and Tuesday.  The ex has already stated that because she has primary physical custody, her boyfriends house is the address of residence, and that the joint legal custody does not matter. I will be forced to take her to court in order  o get things more agreeable and fair to both parties.  Now to the actual question, where can I find guidance in regards to what the court takes into consideration when deciding commute times and distances? I cannot afford an attorney and need to represent myself.	Yes
994	I have full parental consent from both my parents and her's. I want to go to school where she lives which is out of state from where I currently live. What process, if any, do I have to go through?	Yes
995	I have sole physical custody. We have joint legal custody. He was ordered to provide health insurance and relatively low weekly payment.   First he was fired from a job he has had for quite a while. The reason, failed drug test.  Next, he gets a new job but doesn't keep it long because he doesn't like it. He quits.  Now, I'm a defendant. He is requesting a reduction to support due to his income change.  He did not tell me he was fired. I figured it out when the payments stopped for several weeks and all of a sudden my kid didn't have insurance.   The IRS and the court have the basic info on his employment but it doesn't tell them the reason he lost the job. Doesn't even say if he quit or was fired.   Any advice on how to fight this? I don't see why he should be allowed to choose to do drugs/not work and get rewarded with a reduction.	Yes
996	I have gone 6 days without sleeping. Having trouble even writing this. Help plzzz	Yes
997	I'm a mother of a super awesome three year old girl. I married my husband one year ago.   My daughter's biological father was abusive and an alcoholic throughout our entire relationship.  I have been her sole caregiver since birth, but for nearly a year I did allow supervised visitation 2 days a week.  During that time, he lived with his mother, and by her own admission, she provided care(meals, baths, etc) during his visitation.    He has never held a job longer than 6 months.  Recently, he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and other various drug related charges.  He is currently in drug court, is unemployed, and seems to be completely spiraling out.  Prior to his meth spiral, all visitation was facilitated through his sister, who is a social worker. I went no contact with him because his verbal abuse persists regardless of our relationship status.  Three months ago, his sister refused to facilitate any type of visitation with our daughter because he insisted we allow him to take her to his girlfriend's house overnight.  His girlfriend is a meth addict, covered in fresh track marks who lost her own children because of drug addiction and neglect.  Even if her bio dad DID beat his addiction issues (he won't, but hypothetically) he will still be inconsistent, verbally abusive and dangerous to my bubbly baby girl if he ever has access to her alone.   I was lucky to marry a man nothing like her bio father. He is absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to us. He's involved in every aspect of her upbringing, responsible, and brings peace and consistency to both our lives.  He and my daughter are the best of friends. She's nuts over him. She's a mommy's girl, but if she cant have me, she chooses my husband (even over her grandparents that spoil her to pieces). She deserves this father. She does not deserve a lifetime of inconsistent, likely very psychologically damaging and physically dangerous situations her bio father will put her in if given the chance.  How do we begin the process of terminating bio dad's rights/step-parent adoption?  What proof is needed in the event bio dad contests termination of rights?	Yes
998	So my mother just called me to let me know that her tenant informed her that a man had moved in boxes to the garage and was sleeping there. Turns out its my dad! They have been separated over 20 years. He just left one day and that was that. They never divorced and the mortgage is still under both their names. I didn't see my dad after that or talked to him until maybe 2 years ago when he randomly contacted me to get money. My mom had tried contacting him before about refinancing house to remove his name from loan with no luck. We would hear about him from time to time as he remained in the area. She wants to ask him to leave but she thinks he will still stay because it is still his house. What can be done in a situation like this? Obviously she needs to divorce him.	Yes
999	My SD(11) would like to live with us full time. Her mom has a long history of being physically and verbally abusive, but we've never been able to prove it. SD is very unhappy and has mentioned suicide. DH and I have been fighting this for years, but BM is very good at convincing judged and CAS that she is a good mom. She also makes the kids lie to make herself look good.   We are trying to see if there is a way to change custody so SD can live with us without making her go in front of a judge. We aren't even sure if a judge would take her seriously at 11 years old. Does anyone have any advice or resources we can use? We are very concerned for SDs safety and wellbeing.	Yes
1000	"I have a [previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/6kcqte/can_he_actually_get_that_or_a_lesson_in_why/) that outlines the whole background, if anyone would like to peek at it.  But I have a specific legal question:  My ex believes he's entitled to half of our home's passive value increase due to the market demand.  We bought the house in 2012, but didn't marry until December of 2015.  When we bought the house, it was worth $148k.  When we married, it was worth $155k.  A month ago when I told him we were through, it was worth $160k.  And now, it's worth $168k.  (These are Zestimates - yes, I know they aren't accurate, I'll be getting an appraisal to get the right numbers).    So - for what time frame is he entitled to the increase in value (marital property)?  During our marriage?  Or the whole time we've owned the house?    Also, the value keeps rapidly climbing - what's the ""stopping date"" for the equity owed?  (Hope that makes sense).  Thank you for any help."	Yes
1001	My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes
1002	My mother lives about 3 hours away from me in the hometown that she grew up in the South Ga area. She has paranoid schizophrenia from years of drug use as a teenager.   She has been in several crisis centers for the past months. The issue is that she is able to check herself in and out of them but none of the family can do anything about it.  She recently was arrested at her apartment and is getting evicted in a few days. She has been in jail for the past few days and she does not have anywhere to go. I don't think anyone in my family can take care of her because she won't listen to any of us. Not even the cops.   I just need some suggestions on the next steps for her. She does have disability so that area is covered. It has been suggested that I find a way to take over her healthcare decisions but I don't know how to go about that. Any advice would be appreciated.	Yes
1003	I am in the military, and my wife has a 7 y.o. daughter from a previous relationship.   The birth father has a rough history, and essentially lost joint custody for a) harassment of my wife, b) repeatedly asking to pay less child support, and c) not showing up for court. By Oct '13 my wife had a protection order against him and his only rights were bi-weekly visitation.   I married wife that same year, and the military re-located us out of state. NY law required that we receive consent from the father to relocate step-daughter, and he was not willing to give consent, so we had to go to court. To sweeten the deal for him, we offered to reduce child support. The judge determined it was in the child's best interest to move with us for several reasons. Birth father is now allowed to see step-daughter every summer for 6 weeks and Christmas for 1 week, which roughly equals the cumulative amount of visitation he had with her before - arguably, more quality time together as opposed to 48 hours every 2 weeks. And he was released from obligation to pay child support, with the implied intent being that he could save the child support money to visit his daughter. He has never visited. We paid out of pocket to fly my step daughter home to NY twice per year, at about $500-800 round trip each time.   We have since moved 2 more times, and birth father has never paid child support. He has offered 2-3 times to pay for something like soccer registration fee, so about $100 worth of donations. Birth father got married last year and his own child this year.   Do we have any leg to stand on if we ever want to resume his child support payments? What would we have to prove? We don't need the money right now, and I don't want to be greedy, but it would be nice to put a little more into her college fund and savings account. We are not living in NY currently, which would affect our ability to attend any legal proceedings.	Yes
1004	"Short  backstory: My husband has a 9 year old son from a previous marriage.  He and his ex-wife have joint custody, but due to the distance between our houses, we see his son every other weekend during the school year and every weekend in the summer. He and his ex-wife are amicable and co-parent without problems. His family hates the ex-wife and have been at odds with her since they were engaged. We all live in different suburbs of a city that straddles two different states; the ex-wife and his family live in one state and we live in the other. We're all about a half hour drive from one another.   A few months ago, I received a panicked call from my husband's aunt stating that she had filed a suit in family court for full custody of his son, alleging that his son had been abused over the past nine years and was in urgent danger for suicidal ideations. She also said she had attempted to get emergency sole custody and was denied. The only reason she was telling me this was because a guardian ad litem had been appointed and he was asking where his son was. She was worried he was going to remove our son from his mother's home and place him in DFS care, and she wanted us to know.   My first question was 1) what made her think our son was suicidal, 2) if she felt this way, why wouldn't she either tell us this so we could take action, and 3) why didn't she file to have my husband and I take custody, as a third-party suit seemed unnecessary when there was a perfectly good set of parents available to take over.   Her answers were: 1) she said that while showing her and another aunt Minecraft, our son got upset that he had made a mistake and then said, ""It's no big deal, because if I mess up again I can just kill my character and start over.""  2) She felt like if she told us we wouldn't take it seriously, and 3) She claims she had asked if we could be given sole custody and the courts said no, because we had moved across state lines (with his ex's permission).   Since then the situation has gone from baffling to very hostile.  The aunt forwarded us her suit, expecting us to give our blessing to this. Her filing was filled with a large number of exaggerated events, things completely unrelated to our son (he has step-siblings who live with his mom as well, and about half of the allegations were about them), several of the allegations had already been written off as unsubstantiated or no evidence by DFS (she has sent them to the ex's home 4-5 times over the last nine years; the first three times the social worker said there was absolutely nothing to investigate, and the last couple of times they refused to even go to the house), and the rest were based in misunderstandings that would be been easily cleared up if they had talked to one of us before freaking out.   My husband has talked to the guardian ad litem, they've all been in front of the judge twice, and we have been encouraged to get our own lawyer even though no one has really involved my husband in the suit beyond asking him what he thought about the situation.  His ex-wife's lawyer feels there is a case for a harassment suit and is recommending an order of protection when this is all done.  The judge was very harsh with his aunt (used to be a lawyer and is acting pro se in the suit) and told her to stop being melodramatic and working outside of the scope our son and his current situation.   The GAL said at the last court hearing there wasn't much else to do except ask some follow-up questions at our son's school once teachers are back. We felt like everything was pretty much wrapped up.   Throughout all this, both of the aunts have been texting us and emailing the GAL asking for access to my stepson as well my daughter from a previous relationship. We have stated several times that we'd like to wrap up the court case and get guidelines from the judge as to how to proceed with visitation.  Our son has been having panic attacks since being interviewed by the GAL because he's worried he'll never see him mom again, he's aware the suit was brought by his aunts, and that his aunts have mentioned his mom was a bad parent.  My husband and I feel like them seeing him now would really mess him up.  We've tried to explain this, but they say we're just being vindictive by withholding the children from them.   In our last exchange, his aunt who filed the suit said the GAL had told her things were working in her favor and that we were delusional if we felt like things would stay the same.  Prior to this I felt like this last round of interviews and the upcoming court case were formalities, but now I'm kind of worried.   I guess my questions are the following:   1) Can third party custody be granted in a case where there's a perfectly good set of parents available?   2) Is it true that we can't be granted full l custody bc we crossed state lines?   3) Can a petitioner asking pro se get information from the GAL that wasn't also given to us?   Note: We've seen a lawyer, but she won't talk further to us until we pay her initial fee, which we're doing tomorrow. This is more to set my mind at ease than to direct action.  Thank you in advance for any advice you have!"	Yes
1005	"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
1006	Currently, a family member has legal guardianship of my sister who is not fit to care for her. I would like to obtain guardianship, but have not been able to get in contact with legal aid. CYFD claims that there is a 90 day window that I can use to gain the court's favor, but I'm not sure how that works. Where do I start?	Yes
1007	TL;DR: my father is mentally ill, his wife tried to kill him and has beaten him up in front of his doctors. Can I sue her?  I posted some time ago an AmA regarding my father's abusive relationship.  The situation has been getting steadily worse and worse until he has (finally) been hospitalized in the psychiatry department to treat his sever anxiety. Over the past month he has been staying in a psychiatry facility to continue with his therapy.  Last friday, his wife was there. His wife is extremely abusive and violent. She has already beat him up in the past, and has always been psychologically abusive. On friday she became furious over a discussion they had with the doctors. She took my father out of the facility for the afternoon (a temporary leave with the doctors' approval), and once they were out of the facility she tried to steer the car off the road. The car was damaged but luckily nothing happened to him. Once they were back in the parking lot, she started screaming and beating him.  He is mentally ill and completely unable to break out of the abuse. He will not press charges nor try to avoid her (in fact, he hoped he would be discharged soon to go back home with her).  What can I do? Can I sue her for attempted murder over the car incident? The doctors are on our side, and just yesterday the MRI results came in indicating that his brain is starting to get compromised because of the illness: can I get the court to declare him unable?  Thanks.	Yes
1008	"We got divorced earlier this year. I got full physical custody of the kids, but we share legal. She was supposed to look after them during the afternoon hours, however, she does not. When we got the lawyers, I asked him ""What if she does not?"" ""Then she has to pay someone to look after the kids."" No alimony and no child support, however, I do owe her some money. We split the equity of the house and she got half. I am paying her that money over the next couple of years.   Today, she asked me if I have her August money. I did not reply back to her message yet. Since she is unavailable and does not look after the kids, do I still have to give her the money? I am paying a nanny out of my pocket. For hours that she is suppose to cover.   Can I just tell her ""No, because I need the money for nanny services or do I have to go through the court system?"""	Yes
1009	"First off I live in Australia and I'm on mobile (and I'm kinda tipsy so I apologise if this is incoherent).  When this happened the ambulance was called but the cops showed up first and they've deemed my brother as the ""aggrevied"" and myself as the ""respondant."" I'm not really sure what this means or how he's managed to play the victim (the police filed this not him which I don't really understand either). He had no wounds from this incident beyond cuts on his hand from the ceramic breaking on my face. I've since filed a protection order for myself against him but did not show up to the first court hearing as being in public with my fucked up face causes me great anxiety. (I already had problems with going into public but this is a major setback with my mental health situation).  First I was wondering if I should show up to the next court hearing and how to get some sort of compensation for the loss of work and as I'm  currently looking for another job, loss of being able to find a new one while the stitches dissolve and past that, because well, my face is fucked up now and it likely will be that way for a long time. Also compensation for the setback with my mental health.  As much as I want to get a restraining order, we both live with my parents and if I do that they'll likely kick me out (my mother is a narcissist and I am not the golden child).  I also haven't gotten any sort of apology from him (it's been 10 days) and feel extremely uncomfortable in his presence. Mostly, I just want a written apology. He's fucked up my face for life and hasn't even said sorry or shown any kind of remorse at all. Some sort of compensation for my face would be nice also (he makes more money than me) but isn't necessary.  I'm also worried for his current girlfriend and future partners because if you can do this kind of crap to your own sister, I'm sure he's capable of much worse to others.  I'm not completely sure of the advice I'm asking for really but thank you in advance for any replies."	Yes
1010	Posting for my friend. She's in California.   She's finally gotten out of her abusive and toxic marriage (uncontested divorce, he served 18 months prison time for dealing drugs and is now out)  Ever since he got out he's been showing up at her parents home (where she currently resides with their 6 year old daughter). At all times during the day and night. Yelling, throwing bricks through windows but vanishes after 20 min or so to avoid the cops.  He's threatening to cut her up and needless to say she's terrified. They filed for a RO which has been granted but he seems to be dodging the cops so they can't serve him? So they don't want to do anything really since he can't break a restraining order he's unaware of?   They have security cameras and video of him flipping out and terrorizing the whole family. But the cops won't do anything.   She just wants to start over and get her daughter away from her ex and his violence and the drugs.   What can she do now? I'm at a loss. I know these posts occasionally show up here but I've never really paid attention to it. I'd love to be able to actually help her figure out her next steps and not only be there to be a shoulder to cry on.  We talked about getting her to come to us for a couple months (Texas) but she's afraid he'll flip out more or she'll loose custody like he threatened to call the cops on her for Kidnapping his daughter if they were to leave the state. I'm waiting to hear back what her divorce decree says about custody.	Yes
1011	Hi there!  I'm looking for anyone who may have gone through a similar situation to what I'm about to go through and can tell me what my options might end up being.  Here's what I have now: A husband who at best doesn't care about me and at worst is emotionally and verbally abusive to me. A young daughter who relies on me for everything, and who my husband and I both love dearly. A job lined up 2000 miles away in AZ (my home state). Two amazing friends who are willing to help me get from here (GA) to AZ and get me set up there.  My biggest issue now is that if I make the move and take the job, I'll have to leave my daughter behind.  I won't be able to immediately afford to take care of her, and I know long-distance divorces and custody battles can be particularly nasty.  What I'm worried about is that it will look like I abandoned her- otherwise, I can almost guarantee I'd get custody.  I've been wanting to get away from my husband for a long time- my anxiety and depression have run rampant here with him, and I'm at the end of my rope.  I have no family here I can go live with, they're all either just as toxic as my husband or in no position to be taking me in.  I haven't left previously because moving takes money, which requires a job, and this job is the first I'll ever have, if I take it.  My options here are to stay and be miserable until I can manage to get a job that will support myself and my daughter, or I can go, be happier with my life, but leave my daughter behind.  Any perspectives on the legal aspect of all this?	Yes
1012	On July 9th, my dad died, it was sudden and although expected was still unexpected.   On July 11th, his wife since 2003 arranged his funeral and service and during that time explained to my brother and I that my dad's 401k was recently being transferred to a new finance company but that the old finance company was saying that they never received the paperwork. She was working the issue between the old and new companies.   On July 15th, we had a service, it was there that she started to freak out about the house because it was not willed to her, it was willed to my brother and I. The home was purchased in 2002 prior to the marriage. She was told us that she was unsure who the executor was during that convo. She also asked that I purchase his truck that had a $10k bank bill in good standing.   On July 17th, I went to the house to drop off the truck I borrowed, her and her adult daughter handed the will to me and told me to read it. It says that the home goes to my brother and I 50/50 and that she is to stay in the home until she dies. No mention of who pays the hoa dues, property tax etc. She was very upset because she only receives $1600 a month through SSD and a stipend from my dad's life insurance. I figured but did not say 'well we'll charge her to live here at whatever the property tax and hoa dues equate too, which would be $750 a month. She now tells me that the 401k has been transferred to the new company but no one will return her calls.   Emotional moment, I give zero shits about any of this stuff. My dad died. But I do want to move through the process and basically get there new normal figured out.   Back to July 17th, she tells me meet that the executor is a close cousin, my dad's niece and wife is unhappy about this because she doesn't believe executor will be fair. I tell her it's a piece of paper and there is really no way to mess around with it. Executor is a fair person, was not given any significant assets in the will, she has zero skin in the game.   Later that evening, wife's daughter calls me and is very upset because the will says that the executor was supposed to arrange the funeral and wife had done it without even inviting or extending courtesy to executor. She is also upset that my brother and I may charge 'rent' to her mom, she feels that my brother and I should pay $330 a month for hoa dues and $4k a year for property taxes. I simply said 'well, I really need to see the 401k distribution to see where I am financially'   July 18th, wife calls me and says we can't charge her to live there, a lawyer says so and she only has to pay hoa dues but we're on the hook for property taxes. I said okay, have you notified executor, she hadn't so I did because this is bullshit.   Executor did not know she was named because wife had told her right after my dad died that wife was. Apparently, my dad had drafted a new will prior to death but it was never signed and she was asking around to family how to get that will invoked, it gave her portion of the house and left items to daughter. I told wife that this will needs to be given to executor so she can begin the process, wife tells me that she has hired a probate lawyer and has been instructed to not give executor the will. She then tells me that the $10k truck bill and $2k credit card will have to paid by executor and that she has gone to the bank and closed out or taken my dad off the checking and savings accounts. She says the physical items left in the will for my brother and I are community property and she doesn't have to hand it over, we're talking about stuff my dad had looooong before he ever this lady and stuff that my family brought over from Italy in 1920 when they became citizens. Still no word on the 401k.   I'm at a fucking loss here. Wtaf.   I'm ready to hire a lawyer for my family because this lady is sneaky as shit.   Like I said, whatever the will says it will be followed, my brother and I don't care. There is an issue with us paying for the property tax though, neither of us can afford it. We both have houses of our own with incredibly high property tax (Yay king county), we both have 2 small kids, I'm not married. We both do alright in life but it's not like we have money lying around wanting to be spent on someone that isn't even a relative.   Can she really live there and my brother and I have to foot the bill? What if she remarries, what if she moves in her jobless daughter, her jobless husband and kid, do you we pay for that too?   Can she really remove the executor just because she doesn't like it? Can she withhold the 401k distribution? Can she really drag this out?  My dad was not a rich man, he lived simple, had a paid off home, some 401k and some things that were important to him. So we aren't talking a million dollars here. To me this is ludicrous.	Yes
1013	Hi. My sister is 15 years old and I'm 24. I live on my own and have a stable job. Our mother recently remarried to a decent man, but he has three kids (18M, 17M, 13F) from an earlier marriage. The two oldest are constantly picking on my sister. They take stuff from her, go through her drawers, keep tampons and pads from her, feed her hamster things it shouldn't eat, the list goes on and on.   She's so broken up about this. I've tried talking to my mom and her husband about it, but they just brush it off as my sister overreacting and trying to get mom's new husband in trouble, which isn't true.   So, what I'm wondering is if it's legal for me to let her stay at my place? I won't be taking her out of state or keep her from seeing her family. Our mother will still be her guardian.   It's my sister who's suggested this, but I just want to make sure this is on the up and up. I don't want to get in trouble, but I desperately want to help my sister.   Thanks in advance!	Yes
1014	He plead no contest.  I haven't seen him outside of court for 18 months.  He made a lot of false claims on the application.	Yes
1015	My father was forced to retire in November, due to being diagnosed with dementia.  Part of the divorce settlement between my mother and father was that he would pay her an amount from his retirement account after he retired.  We have since set him up with a financial manager to help with managing his retirement.  As of July 1st, I took over the bulk of his finances, excluding the his IRA.  Based on the advice form the financial manager, we learned that he can get out of paying taxes if he gets a QDRO.  We have an appointment to take care of that this week.  My question is this: is there anything we can do about the harassment?  He isn't able to explain things as well because of the dementia, and at this point, her behavior is nothing more than bullying.  Also, is he at risk of going to jail because he hasn't yet paid?  Additionally, can anyone help me understand the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) a little better?  Any tips for handling this situation would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
1016	A friend of mine is on the run right now. Her mother tried to shoot her, and threatened to kill her little sister if she goes to the police. She's the only witness. Obviously she has to go to the police: what does she tell them so they lock the mother up and ensure her and her sister's safety? She's the only eyewitness right now. This is after a previous incident of assault after she ran away from home, also unreported no marks remaining. Thank you.	Yes
1017	I have never liked my first name and recently I have undergone some emotional trauma related to it, so I want to legally continue using my second name instead. I'm a 23 year old senior college student and I would like to know what would be the legal repercussions and what I should start to do in order to stick to this identity. I have read about some people being able to do this without changing their name but I fear that I might do something wrong in the process. I will greatly appreciate any and all feedback.	Yes
1018	"My husband and I are at a point where civility is the best way to describe our relationship. He has cheated in the past and despite trying my best to work through it, things are not good. I'm very tired of feeling bad about myself and this relationship is toxic. We are living with his parents in the UK and we're separated for six months. I have spoken to him about how I feel and his response was ""tough, but put up with it for the kids"". I am suspicious he is cheating again. The trouble is he says I can leave, move out to my own place or whatever but he won't let the kids go.   I have always thought he is a great and loving dad but he talks to my daughter in the most unpleasant manner (she was with him when I left, it was a decision made by everyone). He curses at her ie STFU and yells - this is unacceptable to me regardless of how she behaves. He has always yelled and cursed and broken things and I've learned to let it go but I don't want my daughter to think that's how men are supported to be. Today he told me ""what am I doing to you that's so bad? I don't beat you!"" I couldn't articulate how that in itself is an insult to me, like I'm supposed to be glad I'm not beaten?   I want to return to the USA, both my kids have American passports - what can I do? Do I have any legal recourse to take them with me?   Please advise."	Yes
1019	Hi r/legaladvice!   Here's a complicated issue for you all. This is regarding my aunt and uncle, and my aunt has to make a decision regarding a forbearance agreement by the middle of August. I've tried to keep the explanation succinct and impersonal.  There are 3 important parties in this discussion. Company, Partner A (Anna) and Partner B (Bob). Anna &amp; Bob are getting a divorce after 20+ years of marriage. The company was started by Bob, but Anna has signing rights. Bob has become an expat and has essentially dumped the failing company onto the company executives and Anna.  Company has been struggling for the past 10 years, and losing money. A unknown number of years ago (between 5 and 10) a loan of 1M was taken out for the company. The collateral was the family home. This was the only home at the time.  Now, Bob lives in [expat country] in a house that was purchased by both Anna and Bob but the house is listed only under Bob's name. Anna lives in Canada in the family home. Divorce agreements were set up such that Bob would keep the expat house and Anna would keep the Canadian house.  A couple of weeks ago, the bank decided that the company was too much of a liability and sent the executives a forbearance agreement. The forbearance asked for 600,000$ against Anna's family home. The company must prove that they are doing better by February or the bank will seize the house as payment. Note that the husband (bob) is not risking his own home and that Anna would not receive any money from the home since it is in his name.  Please advise! Anna doesn't know if she should sign this forbearance or not. Either, Anna doesn't sign and the bank could sell the house and she would receive approximately 900,000 after the bank takes what is owed. She would then need to split that with her husband. If she signs the forbearance than the company *might* do well in the next 6 months, OR the house might need to be sold in February and she would get half of 400,000.  Any advise regarding any of these things would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
1020	There is currently an open investigation on my boyfriend (I don't want to give out any details). Because of it, he was forced out of the home until the investigation is closed. My ex husband and I have 50/50 split custody. I was told by both the detective on the case and the child protective service worker that as long as I comply and keep my boyfriend away from the house then I'm allowed to have my children as normal. He has been out of the house since Friday. I was suppose to pick up my children on Sunday night but he was able to refuse them to me despite what the detective, CPS, and the court order custody agreement says. I've already been in contact with friend of the court and they won't do anything either. I just want to see my children. What can I do?	Yes
1021	Good day /r/legaladvice!  I desperately seek advice in family law. My 'boy'friend had a girlfriend last year who - when he wanted to leave her - stopped taking the pill and got pregnant without telling him early on so then she couldn't have an abortion. Fast forward to today - she got the baby and he still lives extremely unhappy at her place not knowing what he should do, as this is also a financial matter for him. So to this point they are not really together anymore but he just keeps things up as they are - he has his own room in her apartment and also takes care of his baby. Now this takes place in switzerland where we have a law since this year that men don't only need to pay for the kid but also for the kid's mother even if they were not married before. Now for what she has done to him (and even more in the past) he doesn't want to pay money for her but only for his kid. Also because she works currently 60% and still earns more than he does when he works 100%. She could be completely self sustainable. Now she told him, if he leaves her for real, she will stop working just so he will have to pay her shitloads of money. He is now completely devastated and doesn't know how he wouldn't also become financially ruined by her.  Now I had this idea and I don't know if it would work and here I need your advice. I just bought an apartment and therefore I basically have a debt of 800'000$ - and as he and I anyway want to be together in case he manages to finally leave that place, I thought I could bring my 800'000$ debt into more use.  Now if I would let him join my debt, would he still have to pay her or could he get out like that? I mean he would probably not be able to get a loan after she would go after his money, but if he joins my debt before she has the chance to do so, he wouldn't be able to pay her aswell?  Or do you have any other idea what a guy could do to save himself from a corrupt girlfriend like this?  Also, what happens if he would leave, but gets at one point a new family. Will this reduce the payments to his current girlfriend because he needs more money to sustain his own family?	Yes
1022	My boyfriend has a 4 year old. On March 12, 2017, he was dropped off with us for 1 week, per verbal and written agreement. It was to be a one week on, one week off arrangement.   She neglected him, leaving him alone all day when he was little, resulting in him being behind mentally, emotionally and behaviorally. She passed him off to babysitters at random.  She has another child, a 7 year old that she did sign over her rights to the child's fathers sister.   I asked her to sign over her rights to me and our boys father, but she refused.   It has since been 17 months since she has had any contact whatsoever with her son, and he is to be enrolled in pre-k in a month. Legally, she can show up and take him.   I've been told that 6 months is abandonment, and to terminate rights you have to put something in the paper for 3 weeks to notify her. Being that it's been almost 18 months, is there any other way we can go to court without getting a lawyer and fighting?	Yes
1023	My childhood was a messy one. Both parents lost custody of me and my grandmother took custody for my entire childhood when she wasn't supposed to. I want all the records from back then. Am I entitled to them?	Yes
1024	Bare minimum details, a family member is harassing my Son. The family member lives in another state (Washington or utah) we will call her gina There have been numerous texts and phone calls made to my son harassing him. Gina is tring to goade him into believing false and inflammatory information about my son's mother. It hasn't stopped. What can we do?	Yes
1025	My wife and I have been going through a gruesome divorce where she's taken everything I've ever worked for. Long, long story short:  -Wife had partial custody of my daughters (12,14,16) but neglected them they came on their own merit with me overseas.  -I left everything I had to get away from her including my house and all the valuables inside. -She's now breaking into my said house and looting it.  I need to know if I can send back my daughter (18) without her getting in legal trouble or a way to retrieve all that I have left to my name.   I've abridged 4 years of a downhill battle so if there's anything that I've left out, please feel free to ask.	Yes
1026	Texas.  I have a bank account which was opened when I was 18 with my mother and step-father being co-signatures (big mistake). This means they have full access to my bank account. I used the account to deposit social security checks that I collected in my fathers name since he died. I'm told that I was eligible for the checks (around ~1800 each month) as long as I am in school full time. Since I graduated High School last month I don't believe I will see another one even though I am attending a 4-year University in the fall. If anybody can confirm this that would be great because my parents haven't given me a lot of details.  Anyway the checks had my name on it since I turned 18 and I endorsed them when depositing them into my account. I was told that the money would be used to pay for college, but I always knew that my mom took out a little each month to pay for general expenses. However I recently gained access to online banking (which they didn't allow me to view) where I have found out that they have taken a lot more than they said they had been. I found over 3,000 dollars in withdraws at an ATM in a casino...  Let me repeat that. They have withdrew over $3,000 dollars from my college savings account and used the money for gambling. I am beyond mad.  I also found over $9,000 has been transferred from the savings account into their general checking account. All of this has occurred in the 12 months since I turned 18 meaning that every dime that was even in the account was 100% mine since I received it as an adult with my name on the check. I realize the difficulties that pose in the situation since my parents are co-signatures on the account and therefore have the same right to the money as I do...  I confronted them yesterday and they acted offended that I question what they are doing with my money (!) and attempted to kick me out of the house. My mom is 100% convinced she is justified in taking my money and spending it on gambling and is completely outraged that I would object otherwise. My mom is a narc and my step-dad is just a dick who hates me. I see no way in getting them to pay back the money they took from me.  Ultimately, I understand that legally I probably don't have grounds to sue. Nor do I intend on suing my parents. If possible, I would like to get a lawyer to compose a document indicating that I believe they owe me this money and they should pay me otherwise I will take it to court. This would let them know that I am very serious about the matter because otherwise they will just ignore me.  I have since closed my accounts at that bank and withdrew all the money I had available.  What is upsetting is that this money was the only savings I had for college since my parents have refused to save their money for my college (they can't even keep their fingers out of money I saved). They will certainly offer me no financial assistance while in college so I am forced to take out $100k in loans to attend college. Side note: if I declare emancipation will that open me up for need-based financial aid considering my income is 0?  Anyway, thank you for reading this far. I am stuck in a very difficult situation and afraid I cannot reason with my parents. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
1027	He left her via text and I was wondering about the procedure to help her get child support payments. He says he wants to be involved but does nothing so he may just want to waive all parental rights. I'm just a 17 year old with an immense passion for law and politics and I want to seek justice for her.	Yes
1028	"So in just over 24 hours I have a ""hearing to determine dependency"" with children and youth. The paperwork I received says that ""the child is without proper care or control"" and that she will be placed in ""kinship foster care"". What do those things mean? Also, I was told that once the issue involved is no longer an issue, she will be able to go right back to me. Does it work like that, or will there need to be another hearing? I applied for and was given a public defender, that I have so far not been able to get in contact with."	Yes
1029	"Hello everyone, so my little brother (17 years old, clearly a minor) got ""arrested"" and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. He was being an idiot with some friends from school late at night in his car and they were smoking when I guess someone who lived nearby reported my brothers car for suspicious activity. A cop showed up, found a bong (this is the ""drug paraphanelia"" he was charged for) in my brothers trunk and the other guys he was with were charged with actual possession of weed and other things as they had a few grams and joints/blunts on their person. My brother did not have any of that on him, and the bong in the trunk isn't even his, it belongs to one of the other boys but nobody admitted to who's it was when the cop asked, so the cop said if nobody admits to it then they will all be responsible. Additionally, my brother said the officer made it seem like since my brother was in the drivers seat (car was off and parked) and its his car, he would be automatically assumed to be the owner of said bong, so he just ended up saying it was his.   Now my parents dont know about this and my brother wants me to be the one to help him through this. I went to pick him up from the police station where the officer was pretty nice about it and explained that we will be getting a letter in the mail regarding a court date and that is when his charges will be decided I guess.   **Bold**WHAT I NEED HELP WITH IS: what can we say or do when his court date arrives to ensure that this will not stay with him on his record after he turns 18? Basically I want this to stay as a juvenile thing and not follow him as he realizes his mistake and knows to never allow himself into this situation again. Will this follow him throughout life? Will all future job/loan/college applications be affected by this? Should he plead guilty and just explain how sorry he is or try to fight it?  Thanks in advance for any/all advise, it is immensely appreciated!"	Yes
1030	"A little backstory... I Dated this girl i thought i liked for a few months... ended up being a horrible, manipulative, compulsive lying, sending nudes to her other baby while she lived with me, bitch. Had sex a lot unprotected, i know im an idiot. Didnt bother to ask if she was on any BC.. assumed she was cause she already has one kid. At one point she was really pushing to have a kid with me. Its not that im scared of being a father, well yes i kinda am, i just dont want anything to do at all with her. I despise her. I could write 5 more pages about just how awful she is.. so i broke up with her back in late February or early March cant remember exactly. Blocked all communications with her but shes  persistent and emailed me.. she had been saying she was pregnant but of course i didnt believe her since she said she was pregnant while we were dating and had an abortion on a fuckin sunday at planned parenthood.. she obvioulsy thinks im stupid which pisses me off to no end. So she just sent me a few photos basically confirming she is in fact pregnant.. literally makes me sick to my stomach. The fucked up thing is i have no idea where she lives right now.. shes from cali and has friends out there so that'd be my guess but shes saying she lives in florida with her ""friend"".. im so lost, scared,angry idk what to do.. any advice would be great.. ill try to post pics still fairly new to reddit.."	Yes
1031	"Hi guys, I had a few questions regarding property ownership rights and financial rights in California.  My wife and I are going through a divorce, we have a a house together and joint credit card, checking and savings.  In short what are my my rights to the money in the checking and savings.  Also, what should I do with the property, what does it mean for her to ""buy me out"" regarding the property?    If you're curious about the situation, please see my previous posts.  In a gist we have a house which she says I don't contribute enough, even though she knew before hand that I would be on deployment and have my own living expenses."	Yes
1032	I don't know where to begin to get this done and if it will interfere with what my parents are doing since I have two kids with my wife who ran off.  My parents are going through the state to get custody of kids, who are living with them. What I really want to know is how do I file for a divorce with a runaway wife with children involved while parents are trying to get custody? And if it means anything there are court orders for both of us to pay child support. She's been avoiding it and I have been paying mine steadily every month. Sorry for poor punctuation and format I am on a bad phone. Is it going to cause a problem since I'm in a different state or do I have to contact the state the marriage took place? If it helps I'm in CT,  marriage took place in CA where parents and kids live.	Yes
1033	Location: Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and maybe Florida  Background: When my 2nd? cousin went to apply for a credit card, we found they had a number of loans in default from several years ago when they were under 18. We're about 90% sure their biological father stole their identity and have already filed a police report and they frozen their credit. They're on their way back to some semblance of normalcy, but the new issue is they have a large number of half siblings from their biological father, my shitty cousin. We aren't entirely sure how many, but my uncle, his dad, had met 17 of them, though relatives estimate around 25 to 30 altogether scattered through various states.  Problem: We realized if my cousin had stolen his oldest child's identity, it was likely he had done so to his other children as well. Unfortunately, as none of the others lived in that town, there was nothing the police could do to help. He works under the table to dodge child support, and can only be reached at a PO box in Indianapolis. Unfortunately, he would only respond to his dad. (After walking out on his family, he made it clear he wouldn't be around them. We decided to keep inviting them and he never forgave us for wronging him so horribly, but his dad was out of the picture at the time) Unfortunately, his dad was recently arrested  for selling meth and decided to skip town on bail.  Is there any way we could try to track down the other kids to let the mothers know to check? I know this whole thing sounds absurd, and quite frankly I would rather not air out family laundry online, but it would be inexcusable to allow him to rob his kids.	Yes
1034	This whole thing is going on in PA. I'm 33, my GF is 25, her Ex is 28 (i think) and their son is 4  So here's a rundown of events  I'll refer to my girlfriends son as G from here on out  My girlfriend is very into giving her son education opportunities. Last year, she was able to get G into a very organized and solid Pre-K program (at no cost due to her low income)  Her ex fought her on it. They have split custody, almost even amount of time is allocated between parents (a little heavier on the moms time).   The dads main beef was he'll lose time with his son, not to mention he had no transportation to drop him off or pick him up. Her ex lives with his parents, and they are great grandparents, but I think they are tired of their sons bs. He doesn't really have his life together.   We understood, so we setup a special thing with the school where G could go part time (1/2 days, 3 days per week). Since G was only 3 at the time, he would be eligible for the same Pre-K program the following year (coming up) and go to kindergarten the year after that.  It was kind of a pain agreeing to her ex'es demands to go part time. Her ex has no ride, so my GF would drive across town before work to take him to school even though it wasn't her day with him. I was in a position to pick him up around lunch time without issue.  Her ex verbally agreed that if their son liked going to school, he could go full time the following year.  Now the time has come to officially enroll him for the upcoming school year, and her ex is absolutely refusing to allow G to go full time. He likes the agreement where G only goes part time and we drive G back and forth.  A couple weeks ago he said he would agree to whatever G said he wanted. And G said he wanted to go to school more, and his dad agreed, and even verified all this via text to my GF. But her ex also had G for 3 days following this conversation, and once we picked G up, her ex said that G had changed his mind and didn't want to go to school more. When we press G why not, he says he doesn't want to make his dad angry (I don't suspect any physical abuse). I told G that dad wouldn't be mad att him, he would be mad at mom. But G is clearly a bit upset about the recent mom &amp; dad fighting on the phone, and being pressured to make a decision.  My GF is fed up with it and told the school to enroll G full time anyways, the ex called the school and told them not to. And now the school says we have until the end of this week to make a decision or G will lose his spot entirely. We view her ex's attitude as extremely selfish at this point, and find the mental conditioning he's trying to put on G very disturbing.  Is there anything legally we can do to get things moving that benefit G the most? Something that might be a small wake up call to the dad?	Yes
1035	Spouse and i are still technically married, nothing has been filed yet. (I plan to, can't afford it right now even with the reduced fees i was offered)  Spouse abandoned us and now lives in a different state halfway across the country and has pretty much left me with sole custody. Are there any legal hiccups that would prevent me from moving my child and i to a different state to be closer to my family?	Yes
1036	Hello!   My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force.   Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	Yes
1037	"So essentially i was brought up under the guise of paternal alienation and covert incest. On top of a this, she also told all of us that Grandma would leave us an money when she died but 2 years after he death the will has been put into probate and we have been refused to see the will. She knows we are poor and she seemingly will just hold on to it till she dies.  First aspect, parental alienation. My mother would rarely ever speak positively of her my Dad. She belittled at every turn. Worse, she belittle his attempts at counseling and essentially use us to make him hit rock bottom (arrested usually.) my Mom did this portray herself as the valiant Mom. These things made bonding with him difficult and this only made things worse for him. She would never stage support for him, only ridicule him. He was like Lisa with Charlie Brown's football. We had to move 3000 miles to find work in the South because he failed a pisstest at his job. He has mental illness for sometime and figure she knew how to manipulate him. He lost so many opprotunities but my mother would always play the Wight Knight for him. Meth and pot arrests were big ones, however I witnessed her engage in these activities as well. Only after she would quickly criticize him. He was punching bag.   Stage 2: Covert incest, my mother always crossed every boundary with me. As a 4 year old, she bought me happy meals every day. She would constantly take me places and spend abhorrent time with me. I had a very hard time making connections with people. As I grew up after the move, I began to try and distance. But she would still act in ways that were inappropriate. The in 2008, my father tried leaving for the 1st time. Me and my sister quickly became each others escape. I would try and spend as much time with her as I could so I would not have to see my mother. The. In July my sister left with Dad for custody. I stayed with Mom and I believe she sexually manipulated. It got out of hand it was incredibly harming my 13 year old mind. Graphic depictions of sex and touchiness. These began the unwanted sexual thoughts that still plague me today. She offered me to come ""to bed with her"" one night. Of course that seemed like a sexual invite considering the previous events. But she knew I would have strong reaction that. All these thoughts made me turn to drugs and alcohol. I hung out with the wrong people. And she encouraged this. She would pretend like it was all okay. Then my Dad decided to come back and I would try rebuild a relationship with him. My mother interviened ever chance she got. She always would bad mouth any effort he made to connect. I thus would hang out and seek people who had drugs. This also impacted my relationship with Dad. Anytime he tried to stop me, my mother would constantly remind him about his past deeds.this only made me get worse.  Eventually in 2012 I started stealing some of my Moms tramadol pills because I was experiencing profound depression. She never addressed with me. But she knew it was going on and moved the bottle around and did try and intervene. This was the begining of a two year binge encouraged by my Mom and lead to me losing my scholarship. She practically encouraged me to leave school. My father left shortly after this. Now that he was gone for good, it was back to sexual manipulation and using drugs as a means to control. I quit tramadol on my own and then she began to romanticize her drug use and then a new substance for me. As this went I became more and more depressed and she began treating me worse and worse.the only reason I put up with was because she promised Grandma would leave an inheiritance. She would die and then she refused to talk about. I eventually was fed up and tried talking with my 17 year old sister for help. I was planning on getting help with that money. Turns out, my mother had manipulated her into blaming her father's absence on me. My sister geniunely complains about issues I can not fix. I left shortly after my mother refuses to help me in anyway.my father is so broken and he lives many miles away.   There is the issue of the will as well. i have checked the county office and the will is not in probate. She is ripping of my sister me and my two cousins. I think she is promising my sister money.   Thats the most polished way to put it. Is there anything I can do about the trust? Oh and she has stalled the divorce for three years. Its all just jumbled up and designed to be confusing as hell. Is there anyway to proceed with anything?"	Yes
1038	Please let me know of any errors and things that I can improve upon. Sorry in advance.   I can't take this anymore. I want to leave this house and be my own person. I am tired of being threatened to leave by my parents. I do so much for them and they hate me.  I am 20 years old, unemployed, and have no car or drivers license. I was adopted unofficially and have no legal paperwork and have no idea if I even have a SSN or any means to get legal help in my situation. For all my life I have been treated as a glorified slave and nanny. I have pretty much raised all 3 of my younger siblings because my parents always had to work (which I understand) but it's way past the normal help here and there. I watched them as babies and fed and bathed them, I took them to school and all of that since I was 8 or so. For 20 years I have been the backbone of my family.  Although I didn't provide financial help I did do pretty much every thing else even cooking and cleaning after my siblings parents and grandparents. They don't even seem to realize how unhappy I am. I asked my parents for my information so I could get a job and they don't have it, they  flat out refused for 20 years to help me change that. Since  I graduated HS in 2015 they've been telling me to leave the house and to get a job but I simply can't because they all ask for my ID and what not and I don't have it. I hate not having my own identity to prove who I am to future employers. I want a change and I am totally helpless and powerless. I have no control over my life and it's already taken a toll on my mental health. I need an escape badly.   I've attempted suicide more than 5 times from 13-20 years of age and I always change my mind because these people are not worth my life. Yes they did raise me but it feels like they only did so, so they could keep me as free labor. I'm basically just a tool to them they don't even let me stay over family members houses or go out simply because they want me to watch the kids so THEY can go out or sleep or whatever. It's so maddening and I do it only because I love my siblings they need me and I need them especially the youngest one, she loves me more than our parents or anyone combined and I can't bare to leave her with them.    I'm so conflicted because they do this to me but on the other hand when we go out together and do family things I feel loved. But the good is only about 10% while the other 90% makes it not worth it in the long run.  Please if anyone knows what I can do to get myself as far away from here as possible, let me know. I'm going to die if I keep living like this. I will gladly give any information I can if you need it. Just please I need advice asap.	Yes
1039	The mom and I broke up before she was even born. Since then, the mom has battled substance abuse problems so that is why she resides with her uncle. My name is not on her birth certificate. I just really want to gradually become a part of her life. Recently, I reached out to the uncle and he was not supportive of it. However, I don't want to give up and I feel that I have so much to offer her. Any advice?	Yes
1040	My ex and I went through a court battle for custody and access of our child, the justice's order was that access and custody be 50/50.  She now wants to change our child's name, which I'm against.  Is there any way she can have this done without my consent?  And is the justice's order for custody and access difficult to change?  It's been keeping me up at night, as the court order was just recently won in my favour restoring my access and custody, and I constantly worry what she can do to overturn a justice's decision.  Advice and any insight appreciated.	Yes
1041	"My wife has brainwashed my children and they now have fulminant parental alienation syndrome, clinically speaking. What can the courts do to help beyond ordering parenting classes and specialized counseling for the kids? What are the possible repercussions and what recourse could there possible be? The court does not currently see or recognize the alienation and I am wondering what I have to gain by spending the time and money establishing this fact. The court initially chose to not call it parental alienation because I'm transgender and  ""I am the one who deviated from the family structure we established""...   Thanks in advance!"	Yes
1042	My sister, Anne, (30s) is mentally ill. I am not sure of her exact diagnosis, but she has been on and off medication and in and out of therapy since we were teens.   She has a 3 year old with her ex, John, who lives 1 hour away; John is employed, responsible, and a good dad. My sister moved back in with my parents when they broke up shortly after my nephew was born.   Anne has custody during the week and one weekend a month. John gets Nephew three weekends a month. My other sister and I live out of state and don't engage with Anne or the situation much.   Anne and our parents have a volatile relationship. Anne doesn't work, does not parent, and loses her shit if my parents try to set boundaries or engage with my nephew when my sister doesn't want them to.   Without getting into details, there's all kinds of damaging shit happening to my nephew - including some concerns that triggered a visit from CPS.   Suffice it to say my sister is an unfit mother, and my parents have been in what has felt, to them, like an impossible situation. They've been terrified for my nephew's well-being and have been hesitant to lay down the law with my sister because she's so volatile. They've thought it was better to put up with the insanity as long as Nephew lived where they could keep an eye on him.  But things have apparently come to a head. My sister left my parents' house several weeks ago, taking Nephew with her. They're apparently staying at a friend's house. Again, my sister doesn't work.   The last time John and Anne met to do the handoff for John's weekend, Anne refused to turn over Nephew and John called the police. So there are files with police and CPS related to this situation.  John has told my parents he is pursuing sole custody, and my parents are supportive of this. They have spoken with John's attorney and will be fully cooperative. John's attorney sent a certified letter to my sister at my parents' house, but she hasn't lived there for a few weeks and has not come to pick it up.   As of now, Anne does not know this custody suit is happening, and I am concerned Nephew will be in physical danger once she finds out. She is obsessed with someone taking away her son and will absolutely lose her mind. She has had violent episodes with family in the past.  My questions: 1. Do my parents need an attorney? Not necessarily to pursue their own rights, but just to guide them through this to ensure the safety of Nephew.  2. I'm concerned my nephew might be in danger once Anne finds out about the custody suit. How should that whole thing be handled?   I'm actually terrified that she'll find out while she has my nephew and may hurt or kidnap him, when really the best scenario is that she finds out while Nephew is with John.   Is there anything that can be done to remove him from her care for his own safety while the custody suit is ongoing?  3. Is there anything I can do? I feel so helpless.  4. What are we (myself, my parents, my sister) not thinking of that we should be doing?  Our biggest goal right now is just to make sure that Nephew is physically safe, now and when Anne eventually finds out about the suit.	Yes
1043	My best friends son is in Maine visiting his father. He was supposed to be returned yesterday to Tennessee. The father is ignoring the mother's phone calls, the police have been notified. They won't do anything because it's not kidnapping, it is 'restraint by another parent'. They told her to go to a lawyer in Tennessee, and Tennessee lawyers are telling her to get a lawyer in Maine. She set up a gofundme page, but it's unlikely she will raise money within a significant amount of time.  She tried Pine Tree Legal, they don't deal with family matters. She went to the court in Tennessee AND phoned Maine's court, and was told she needed a lawyer before filling out the forms, and/or told about a 30 day waiting period.  The court order states that the father only gets custody every other Saturday, Father's Day, half of Christmas and Thanksgiving.  They made a verbal agreement that the boy would be returned yesterday, but now they are in hiding. The police have gone to his address and his family's addresses.  What can she do???	Yes
1044	I'm married to someone with a phd, 2 Masters degrees, and who also is a CPA candidate. She refuses to look for work or work. She doesn't do anything at home either in terms of taking care of the home or taking care of me.      In a divorce I'd have to give her half which basically would leave us both with not enough to live on. We have a mortgage and debt.      I want to divorce her and her get a job so I don't have to pay forever. I made it clear to her from the beginning that she needed to contribute.      How can I get the court to force her to get a job?	Yes
1045	Throwaway for obvious reasons:  I'm writing this on behalf of my sister whom after over 10 years of marriage is faced with a failing marriage. I would personally define the relationship as abusive on both sides. However the Husband physically has abused her on occasions and has basically financially dominated the household, where my sister gets what she gets and that's it.  There is also a business involved. I can get specifics as needed however I wanted to start a discussion.  My Sister was informed by her Husband that he's gone to a lawyer and has removed a good portion of the business account to an account in his name - apparently under advice from his lawyer. He's also cancelled all of the credit cards of my sister as well.  She still has access to the buisness account and asked me if she should take the money a lawyer on her side would want (5k is the number I was given) however I'm not sure on the specifics again.  Her plea to me is honestly, she doesn't know what to do. She's depressed all the time in an abusive relationship. There are two Children involved in their teens. Their assets look good from the outside however there is a mortgage that isn't getting paid apparently. Like I said, she's just overwhelmed and does not know what steps she can take.  Also - just as to why I'm doing this - he has keyloggers on all the computers in the house, tracks her moves through her phone. The only reason why I haven't gone numerous times to deal with him is honestly the legal ramifications. So I want to help my sister but honestly I don't have the answers so I feel I'd reach out here.  I wish I could give more but obviously my sister is ashamed of all this, as we come from a divorced household she views this as a huge failure on our side.  Thank you for any advice and I will do my best to answer followup questions if there are any.	Yes
1046	Hello,  Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I first communicated to my exwife my concern of overexposition to the stock market two years ago.  She ignored it.  I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax.   I feel overburdened because the stewardship over these funds fall on me.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.  Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months, just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.   Any advice appreciated.	Yes
1047	Please help.  I am a young woman undergoing a divorce for a very short term marriage. Here's the deets:  1. Married for 6 months - Separated for 8 months. I left, he filed.  2. No children 3. Annulments/dissolutions out of question - Can't agree on retrieving my belongings 4. He has wedding jewelry and engagement ring, wedding money, and all my premarital belongings (lived together 5 years).  I left with only the clothes on my back. 5. He has only let me retrieve anything I could list with the aid of a magistrates order. (i.e. he kept anything I didn't specifically list - things like college diplomas/tax return documents/mail/family heirlooms etc)  I have not been allowed on the property since January 2017. I want a walk through to pack because it's impossible to list everything I owned. 6. Got my clothes back after 3 months - clothes damaged 7. Got some family furniture back after 7 months - damages 8. He is asking for my 401K (he has worked for 7 years, I have worked for 1 - I have stopped contributing once I found out he wanted it, but don't know what judge would rule in his favor)  9. Attempted court ordered mediation, but could not agree on time to meet with mediator (his choice of course)  My lawyer is very...relaxed.  Tells me I don't need to prepare anything for our defense for our pretrial that's upcoming.  Any advice?    1. Should I be working to build a defense?  I have photos of damages, harassment, texts proving he still has my jewelry, proof he deposited all the wedding money into his own account, credit card statements proving I purchased a bulk of premarital items that he wont let me retrieve, etc. But my lawyer says I don't need any of that.  2. Does he have a shot at my 401k? Does he have a shot at the money saved between marriage date and now? Or between marriage date and date which I left the martial residence?  3. What happens after the pretrial?  Wishing I was more educated on my rights. Please help. Thank you Reddit fam.	Yes
1048	I'm 25 and from North Carolina. I haven't seen my 2 kids in 3 months and she keeps demanding I pay child support. Two weeks ago I sent her a formal email renouncing my parenting rights but she demands I continue paying child support. Is this legal? If so, how do I make her stop without taking her to court?	Yes
1049	I am one week from moving to a new state and out of nowhere my wife wants a divorce. We have a toddler aged daughter. She had been the one pleading for the move. Ive already quit my current job, and cannot get it back. I have no option financially but to take this job. The job pays significantly more than what I am making now. I am freaking out, if i leave the state, am i giving up all the rights to my daughter? She is hounding me now about rescinding our notice and allowing her to stay in the house we are renting. I am in shock right now. She locked me out of the house with no access to a car. I am worried ill never see my daughter again.  I am contacting lawyers and getting answering services. Hoping one gets back to me soon. Just hoping someone could give me some guidance here. I am completely stuck.	Yes
1050	"My mother is in her late 80s and her husband (my dad) died recently. My mom has dementia, which has worsened gradually over the last 3 years. During this time my mother and sister have blocked any attempt by my father and I for them, now only her, to move into a senior or assisted living environment.  Ok, so now my mom is a nutty, but tiny congenial woman who is living is the past and also some alternative weirdly twisted related universes.  I'm terrified at how vulnerable she is, physically (!!!) and financially.   Add to the mix, my sister (who has multiple mental heath issues) is now handling ""mother"" but is not  sharing any documentation or information regarding our father's estate, taxes, and/or our mother's health or financial situation.    I don't know whether her lack of transparency is due to my sister's complete inability to deal with any level of personal responsibility, change, or conflict or whether she's being sketchy. Our parents had many toys and lifestyle advantages my sister and her husband could not afford, and would lose access to it if our mother's lifestyle was simplified due to her dementia and our dad's death.  Add to the mix, I live out of town and came very close to dying myself recently and though my recovery is positive, it will be protracted. I'm not really up for a big legal fight. I'd like to avoid the ugly legal situation of having my mother declared legally incompetent, fighting my sister for guardianship, reporting mom's case to public trustee, etc...  My wife is fine with moving my mother into our house, wrapping her into our lifestyle, and completely footing the bill, but stipulates that we need to freeze my mom's credit and protect her assets from exploitation. She absolutely doesn't trust my sister or her husband. My wife has been very honest, that although my parents have never been there for us, because she loves and respects me and my moral code and obligation,  will back me on how I deal with my family.   How reasonable is it to freeze my mother's assets/debit without getting into a big legal mess?"	Yes
1051	"I am primary custodian of two children who live with me and have visitation with the non-custodial parent every other weekend and a large chunk of summer. the NCP and I have a joint custody order that is very extensive due to the NCPs unwillingness to work with me, the court, or the children multiple times. Due to some things that happened in the past, (threats to vanish with the children and not return) one of the current (many) stipulations of our order is that the non-custodial parent may not remove or block access to the minor child's cell phone.  After a series of gradually escalating confrontations, which are culminating in yet another upcoming court date, the non-custodial parent has refused her own visitation with one child (15 yo) and is continuing to exercise visitation with the other (12).  Now, it has become apparent that the non-custodial parent is taking the child's phone against our orders, and is sending text messages to the custodial parent (me) and step-parent in the guise of the child. The spelling, grammar, and phrases used do not match the child's way of writing or speaking at all, and are very consistent with the NCP instead. The ""Child"" is stating that they are having a great time visiting their NCP, when less than 24 hours prior they were extremely hesitant to visit the NCP due to their cumulative past experiences.  Afterwards, we both received messages from the ACTUAL child that the NCP has been sending messages to us and she has been forced to hand over her phone.  It is also important to note that a child that is normally very good about communicating has gone largely silent since this most recent visitation began, and that is very largely out of character as well.  I've contacted my lawyer already, who is involving the children's ad litem attorney in the situation. What I guess I'm seeking is- has anyone ever heard of anything like this happening before (NCP pretending to be the child in text messages) and how is it best handled (other than ""contact your lawyer"")?"	Yes
1052	"Here's my story, I'm sorry it's very long. Might need several parts. I just really wanted to share after reading some other posts here. I've missed some details, otherwise we'll be here forever.   Also, I would really appreciate some friendly legal advice, reason why will make sense as I explain everything.   Here we go:  My mother left me with her family when I was 2 and moved to a different country. My father went through a battle to get me from them (they're a family of absolute nutters, poor reputation wherever they go). Eventually my father kidnapped me.  A little about my father: He's from a poor family in Africa, but he's dad did all he can and passed on work ethics and educated his kids with the little he had. My mother and my father met when he was 19 and she was 18. Her mother married her off (she was abusive towards her). They had me when she was 20 and he was 21. My dad quit his studies and joined his father in the line of carpentry to provide for us. When I turned two, my mum left my dad and took me with her to her family because there was an opportunity for her to migrate to Europe. Shortly after she left the country, my father came looking for me at her family home and my great uncle chased him away with a shovel.  My dad eventually found an opportunity to kidnap me and take me with him. Our homes were only 10 minutes apart, so it was a constant battle of kidnapping.   Fast forward: I'm now five. My father had been struggling financially for as long as I was old enough to notice. But he did absolutely everything he could to have me privately educated, get me a nanny to take me to school and back home, to cook for me etc. etc.  My father and I  spent every evening together after dinner. We'd usually spend it with him teaching me maths, French and other subjects, then we'd do some reading before bed. On the weekends when off school I used to follow him to work and play outside. We were best friends, he respected me and I was free to tell him everything and anything. When I was naughty, he used to take the time to explain to me why he's mad and would very rarely shout.   When I turned 6, he began dating this woman and once when dad was at work, she slapped me (I don't remember why), I told my dad when he returned. All I remember is my dad hitting her, packing her stuff and kicking out. Dad apologised to me for leaving me with her.   One weekend when I followed dad to work, I was playing outside and my dad was talking to someone. I noticed a cousin of mine from mum's family, I followed her and they kidnapped me. They took me to my nMum's family home. I never liked them, they were so loud and disrespectful; so very different to the calm life I lived with dad. When my father came for me I started crying to go back home with him. They kept me in the house and were shouting at my father. He's response was, ""I'm sorry you're feeling very upset right now, but I need to take my daughter, she has school tomorrow"". They kicked him out. They kept me at their house and away from school. (I now know it was at the request of my mother, because she was planning to come and get me).   One day, (after what seemed like forever, but was only probably a week) I said to my grandmother (nMum's mum) I was going outside to play, she let me. I took the opportunity and ran to my grandfather's house (dad's dad). My dad came for me and we moved away to stay with his friend in a different district. He's friend was pretty well off, and I think his the one that enrolled me in a new private school.  By this time I was 7 years old. One day my dad came home from work and he said ""PeePee, we need to talk"". He told me my nMum's back and he asked if I'd like to see her, I said no. He convinced me to at least say hello. So we went to see her; she was having a beer and she tried to give me a sip whilst I was sitting on her lap and my dad snatched me.  Discretion: my dad had never taught me hate for my mother or her family. He'd always say ""family's family and you can't change them, what's important is what and who you are"".   After some time, my grandmother came to take me, presumably because my nMum and dad wanted to talk. She proposed that she takes me to London for better education opportunity. My dad being an academic junkie, agreed.  That night I didn't want to stay with nMum, I went back home with my dad. He explained what nMum had said and asked what I wanted to do, I said I didn't want to go with her. We both cried and he begged me to go because I'd have a better opportunity in the UK. A week later we were preparing for departure. I spent the whole with my dad, we took pictures and I cried — a lot.    I'm now 8 living in London with nMum. At first she'd allow me call my father, but she became increasingly jealous of our relationship and started making comments (jokingly) about me and him being in some sort of witchcraft pact.  I'm now 9, nMum left me at her aunts house so she can have her free time as a 29 year old. I didn't mind, there were other kids there. Never really saw nMum. I started going to a school nearby great aunt's house. The school used to ask me a lot of questions (I now know it's because I used to come into school dirty and no one ever came to pick me up until 5-6pm, schools here finish at 3:15pm). I think my great aunt asked my mum to come and get me because she didn't want trouble. The day nMum came, my dad called (coincidentally). He asked to speak to me. nMum's aunt grabbed the phone said some disrespectful things to my dad, and told him to not call the house phone again because I'm no longer his daughter, nMum just laughed. I was quite baffled.   I'm now living with nMum, the abuse gradually starts. I once heard her say to a friend; ""I'm like the devil, I'm the type of child that would shit in your house"". Paid no notice. She used to snap a lot and give me dirty looks, I became scared of what I can and cannot say. She enrolled me to a school locally, the school instructed that I must be taken to school and picked up because of  its distance from home address. This did not go down well with nMum. One morning I'm getting ready for school and she snapped at me for putting on tights the wrong way and gave me a morning beating.  I'm now ten and finally allowed to go to school by myself. I had no friends because I was this creepy kid with weird clothes, so I'd walk to school by myself. By now I had a new routine, when I get up in the morning I have to clean the house before I go to school, and god forbid if I messed up.  I once did the washing and left the plates and cutleries out to dry, nMum lost her bollocks; she called me over to the room, sat me on the floor, grabbed the knife, pierced it on my thigh and said ""what happens if somebody comes in here to fight me and sees this knife, they will stab me, and before that happens, I will stab you first if you do not put them in the draws next time"" then she proceeded with the beating. Her favourite was stripping me, laying me on my front and whipping me with a skipping rope or a belt on my back until she felt it was enough. I remember once she swung me by my hair and banged my head against the wall and I had a blood clot in my eye (somehow).   I had this aunt on nMum's side, me and her grew quite close. She used to come pick me up for the weekends, or I'd spend school holidays with her. When nMum noticed how close we were getting, she began causing problems. I was no longer allowed to go to her house, or any of her other relatives. nMum said to me ""those people do not like me, and if they do not like me they will never like you either"". Then she proceeded to telling me all these deep dark secrets about her family.    I'm now 11, we move into a bigger house and nMum's boyfriend moves in with us. He was a lovely man, and whenever nMum would start hitting me, he'd step in. One day, nMum said to him ""she doesn't like you anyway, she told me"" I was so confused. Absolutely confused.  The stress of being in the same house as nMum was too much for me, I started thinking of different ways I could end it. I once took a knife to school, went to the bathroom and contemplated about stabbing myself. I chickened out. I then thought taking a mixture of 5 different pills and mashing them in my cornflakes would do the trick. After eating it, I laid under my bed and waited to die. Nothing. So I thought of slashing my wrist like in the movies, it was too painful.   I'm now 12. At this point nMum would only hit me if her partner is not around and if I ever dared utter a word, boy would I get it.   So this is where things start getting interesting.  We once went to a family gathering (wedding I think) and so I took the opportunity to tell my aunt everything my mum had said (above). My aunt told her mother and the whole family started calling my mum to ask her questions. That night she hit me for so long (skipping rope and all sorts) that she'd even take breaks in between.  In the morning as I was getting ready for school nMum came to me and said ""if anyone asks say (insert aunts name here) is the one who told you all those things"". I had no choice, so I did. Aunt's mum and everyone started calling and made it seem as if I'm a problematic child. They said I should never step foot in their houses again, I'm a liar blah blah. Aunt still stood by me.  The following day I woke up and decide I'd had enough. Called my aunt and said I'm running away. She said ""come to my house"". Silly me packed everything in black bags, so getting on a bus was a hassle. As I was getting on my second bus, the driver stopped me and called the police. Police came, I said ""I'm visiting my aunt"", they asked my mum's details, I cried and begged them and showed them the whooping from night before. They call nMum anyway. Social service came and took me to aunt but said I had to go back in a week.   This continued until I was about 13. I decided to runaway again. I had a boyfriend (14) by this time. I stayed with him and his mum for almost a year. I wasn't going to school, so my aunt and I came to an agreement (against her mum's wishes) that I move in with her and enrol at the local school. So I did.   I'm now 14 and studying again. nMum comes by and manipulates me into moving back in with her ""because those people will never love me the way they love their own children and only she loves me"". I agree, but decided to stay at the same school. Not long, nMum strikes again. School tried to get me into social services, not happening. Doctor even saw my injuries.   I'm now rebellious. Get involved with the wrong crowed, began smoking and just doing what the fuck I want. I had enough of her. Eventually social services placed me in foster care for 6 months. Following their assessment, they deemed I was not at risk. They sent me back home  I'm now 15 and began shop lifting because nMum never gave me money (luckily travel for under eighteens on bus is free). I got arrested many times. She started calling my dad telling him ""I told you she's like this and that"". I spoke to dad and we both cried and he apologised and said ""I should never had let you go with her, I should have kept you here no matter the struggle, it's all my fault, I'm sorry"".   I runaway again, social services refuse to help and old my mother I said ""I don't like her and her kids (with partner) because she shows them love"". So they fucked any chances of me ever going back there.  I stayed on the streets, I made friends with some older girls (16 and 19) and they both had their own places. They allowed me stay, but I had to fend for myself. Eventually I had to leave their places and started staying everywhere and anywhere. Sometimes in strangers houses, or I'll just take buses from start to finish. I ended up getting raped by a guy I knew, and then again by another guy.  I'm now 16, I got a solicitor to help me with social services (through legal aid), they accept to house me following further investigations. They placed me in a shared accommodation with another girl, whom I became best friends with. I felt a little settled, so I enrolled in a college. 6 months later S.Services drop me again. I'm now lodging at former housemates and dropped college because I had no money.  I turned 17 and decided I have no choice, but to go back to nMum, apologise to her and just do whatever she says. Not a great idea, but I had to, I really wanted to go back to school.  So I did exactly that, I'd grounded myself and went back to college. Once I'd turned eighteen, I convinced nMum to give me my passport because I had to apply for work; instead I was working with a charity behind her back, they were helping me move into a hostel.   I'm now 19 and decide to leave the hostel and go off to university. I went, and lived on campus. nMum is suddenly my best friend, not because I was studying, but for my student loan money. She told me several times to quit and just get a job. Not happening.   20 move in with mates from uni, still speaking to nMum but very rarely.   21 I meet a guy from a very wealthy, educated, yet grounded family.  At 22 we move in together and nMum pops up again. She visits and brings over my partner's favourite meal. She'd always want to speak to him on the phone to say hello. She'd guilt trip me into buying her things ranging from holidays, perfumes and give her money. Honestly, my partner and I were doing it out of the kindness of our heart, we didn't think much of it.  23 I've now graduated (I'm the only graduate in her entire family tree) and nMum says we should go to Africa and see my dad and her family. I guess she wanted to play the good mum card, y'know, ""the I raised her"", but my father is too smart for that. By now I was no longer scared of her and would often say whatever came to mind.  My father asked her about my partner and she said, ""oh I don't know if I'm sure about him, but I guess if she likes him"" I flipped, told her next time she needs something she can go fuck herself. It was our trip to Africa that made me realise she was only using me and my partner. When we came back I cut all ties.  Back home in London I began drinking a lot (never used to drink). My relationship started falling apart. Won't go into too much details about that, but we broke up.   I'm now 24 found a well paying job and moved to an apartment of my own in a nice area in SE London, started my Master Degree, began funding my two sibling's (3 and 5 —dad's kids) private schooling in Africa and providing for my father as well. By this time I was still heavily drinking. I was lonely, had no family and I was never the type to confide in friends. I lost my job last year (unfair dismissal) and fell into a depressed state. Began binging and spending all my savings.  I became worried that I would fail my studies due to always being hungover, so I told the university and they put me on sick leave. My siblings had to leave school because I could no longer afford it. It made me feel even worst  In November (last year) I decided to seek help with my doctor. She put me on medication and advised I be around people. In came nMum. I called her. She came over and brought me some food. But then she started again with saying ""you'll always need your mother blah blah"" I guess it was a high moment for her. By the end of November I began self harming, attempted suicide twice and admitted in hospital. She said to go and stay with her. Worst mistake, but I needed someone, everyone probably thought I was crazy and a burden, because they'd all left. I move my stuff to nMum's garden and stayed with her. She started financially exploiting me again. My ex partner told me to leave and go stay with him. So I did. nMum stopped calling.   It's January of this year and I attempt my final suicide. Ex partner found me foaming, called ambulance and I was admitted. We call nMum and her partner said they didn't want to hear it. I later found out she'd demonised me to him and told my siblings I'm not their sister.   It's now March, and I've been moved to rehab for depression. Not having heard from nMum or her partner.  In June, I got in my car and went to get my stuff from nMum with my ex Partner. When I tried to ask her why she told my siblings such thing, she began pushing me. Adrenaline took the best of me and I pushed her back. And started shouting at her. She pushed me and shut the door in my face, so I continued shouting through the letter box. I told her exactly how disgusting I think she is and that she'll one day pay for what she'd done to me.    My psychiatric nurse suggest I may have PTSD and borderline personality disorder. I will start seeing a therapist soon for a final diagnosis.   I'm now 25 and as we speak, I've left the rehab, changed my number and not in contact with anyone from my past. I go to my local gym and library just to get out of the house. I'm taking swimming lessons and trying my hardest to stay active. Being unproductive makes my depression worst. Doctor has advised I stay away from work for a little longer due to frequent anxiety attacks and paranoia. She's been the most amazing GP anyone could ever ask for. Does all she possibly can to help.   I'm due to return to university for my master's degree next year. Maybe once I start therapy it'll get better. In the meantime I'm working on a charity project to support lone students estranged from family. Hopefully it'll work out, if so, then I'll probably dedicate the rest of my life on that as my prime job.    So yeah, that's my story. I think I have a much more positive outlook now.  As for her — I pity her .I think she just blames me for everything. She has a dark heart and it must be difficult for her. I'm just glad I spent my crucial years with my dad. I really wish she'll one day seek help. Whilst she is not abusive towards her other kids (she has 3 now), two of them dislike her.   The legal question:   I've been thinking of taking legal action against the local authority due to neglect. Much of this could've been avoided had they helped me. All the physical evidence of abuse were there and school headmasters tried desperately to help me. What are the odds?   Forgive me for my poor grammar. I wrote all this at 3am, having already taken sleeping pills. Very tired!    Update: spoke to dad today.❤️"	Yes
1053	Practically speaking, are there advantages to being legally married at the time of your child's birth? I always heard that it was but I'm now struggling to find information on exactly why that is. I'm in MA.	Yes
1054	My Grandmother lives in Florida, I live in Maine.   For some context, my Grandfather has Alzheimer's Disease and my Grandmother is the trustee of all his accounts. More context, I sent my Grandmother my old phone a couple years ago, she just upgraded and sent me back my phone without resetting it.   While clearing the junk out I noticed some suspicious messages between her and another guy so I started reading more. She is in a long distance relationship with this man and he keeps asking for money for things, thousands at a time. This has been going on for 13 months and she has sent him over $48k, and intends to send more.   She has emptied out her own IRA for this, and has nearly emptied my Grandfather's IRA, and is now using his Social Security checks to send more money, sending them further into debt. Their car is about to be reposessed, their TV, Internet, and phone are being shut of regularly, she can't pay their bills because of this.  My mother (who lives in Maine as well) wants to get legal guardianship of my Grandfather and remove my Grandmother's name from his accounts, and bring him up here with us. My Grandmother has expressed interest in the messages with the scammer that she wants to get rid of my Grandfather as soon as possible, and my mother and I want him away from her now that we know what she's doing.  Problem is, I have no idea where to start. Please help!  If you need any more information let me know, my mind is kinda scattered at the moment.	Yes
1055	"My parents were in the process of renovating an expensive historic home when they divorced, ten years ago.   The mortgage has been paid one way or another since then, but nobody has liven in it, but both are still on the mortgage.  Parent A would like to get the home to rentable condition, and start making income. A has already invested money in restoring the home.  Parent B would like nothing to do with Parent A, hence why this issue has not been addressed for so long.   Parent A is concerned about Parent B coming after A's rental income or the value of the property, and wants B to sign a ""quit claim deed"", eliminating A's interest in the property.   I advised B not to sign anything, after some googleing suggested that this would not eliminate the responsibility to pay the mortgage.   Would it be possible to informally draft a contract that covers these concepts? Or is an attorney strongly advised in this situation?  - While A pays the mortgage, B won't make any claims or interfere. - If A pays off the mortgage (or refinances), B will sign the quit claim deed.  Both have a large amount of illiquid assets.   Any other advice?"	Yes
1056	I apologize in advance for the ramblings   So my boyfriend of 5 years has 2 boys (6 &amp; 8) with his ex wife. When they divorced he got full custody of the older child and she got full custody of the younger child with weekends switching off.   1.5 years ago she got another divorce, and being unable to care for the child, he came to live with us for 5 months. She got remarried (husband #4) and took the child back. After a few months they separated and she moved to another city. A month later they got back together and she moved back. After domestic violence issues she finally handed the child over to us and checked herself into a mental hospital for a week and filed for divorce from husband #4. The poor kid was in 4 different schools last year.    Now she's asking for his birth certificate and ss card because she wants to take him back. She has only seen the kids a handful of times since he's been living with us and my boyfriend has never denied her access to the kids whatsoever.we don't plan on letting him go back to live with her full time, as he should be with his brother in a stable house and not living with his mother in a converted school bus...... In the past she has threatened to call police for kidnapping if we didn't give him back.   TLDR;   I guess my question is, since the child is living with us full time, can she just show up and take him back whenever she decides she wants to? What rights does the father	Yes
1057	"Created a throwaway for this.   I live in Belize, in Central America. I have an uncle who has three of his four children currently living with him and his girlfriend. The children's ages (who live with him) are between 7 years- 18 months. There's a lot to this story but I'll try to be succinct.  My uncle drinks and smokes heavily, and his girlfriend drinks heavily as well, and is affiliated with gangs. They have always had a tumultuous relationship, rife with domestic abuse from both parties, among other things.   They had their oldest, the 7 year old, and it was with her the abuse started. She has been burnt with flat irons (at the age of 2), sexually abused by the girlfriend's friends since the age of 3, beaten on a daily basis, and so many other things. I know all this because I can hear everything that goes on in their home, and the child tells anyone who will listen to her. Everyone brushes it off and ignores it.   The middle child is 3 years old. Since his birth he has been cursed and called names, now he is beaten on a daily basis. He has had remote controls thrown at his head and broken on his little body. Everytime we see him, he has new bruises. He as been chased out of his home by his drunken mother at 3 AM because she was mad at his father. My family and I are closer to this child because his mother would always send him over to our house (which is right across the street) because she didn't want to take care of him and thought she could get free babysitting services from us. We would bathe him, feed him, clothe him, take him on trips, you name it. He became one of our own.   The youngest, is almost 1 1/2 years old. Again, since her birth she has been neglected, cursed like an adult, and beaten.   About a month ago, shit started to hit the fan. One night we heard the boy screaming as if they were torturing him. The parents were drinking heavily with a friend and were not paying attention to the children. My father went over to pick up the boy and slammed the front door in the process. The boy was in a state of shock because it took him an hour to calm down and tell us what happened. His father had punched him in the nose because the boy was annoying him. My uncle started yelling death threats at my father, saying that he would shoot him in the streets because he disrespected him by slamming the door to his house. He screamed at us for over an hour. We called the police and when they arrived, he changed the story to us kidnapping his son. We went to the station and made a statement against him, but that statement was eventually lost and therefore is no longer valid.   After this incident we went to see a lawyer. The lawyer called the human services agency (there was already a case set in motion but they had all but forgotten about it) and the case worker decided to pay a visit to the 7 year old's school on that same day. They called the father (my uncle) to inform him and he told his girlfriend and they both went into a rage.   We were not aware of the school visit, so we were at our house at the time, and the 3 year old was too (he hadn't bathed or eaten from the day prior) when the girlfriend decided to come over to our house to curse at us. She screamed for the 3 year old to ""get his fucking as here now"" meaning to leave our house and join her by our gate. As she walked away with the 3 year old in her arms, she screamed death threats at us too, saying that she would burn down our house, place bombs in our cars, slit my throat, and shoot my little brother in the streets, because ""it is now war, and we were going to get it"". My mother and I were the only ones at home and we became incredibly frightened so we called anyone who could help, my grandfather, the police, my father, anyone. The police came and didn't do anything. The case worker who came with the police was more interested in going home because she had a vacation that started the next day. We went to the station and my mother and I gave statements against my uncle's girlfriend (they have been living together for quite some time so he refers to her as his wife now). After we gave the statements the sergeant in charge asked us, including my uncle and his girlfriend, to go back to the station to ""mediate"". It didn't do a lot of good, because my uncle and his girlfriend denied everything and called us the liars. After this they said that the boy would never be allowed at our house again. He tries to run away to our house whenever he can, and sometimes they send him because they get frustrated very easily with the children.   On Facebook, they are the perfect parents, but no one knows or understands what happens when the cameras are not on. Everyone in my family turns a blind eye to it. We were instructed to close our windows and doors when the children scream to that it doesn't bother us. We live right across from them so it is incredibly hard to ignore the noise.   They also blast loud music whenever they feel like it, sometimes in the middle of the day, sometimes until 4 AM. They have alienated themselves from my entire family, and still make themselves out to be the victims.   I apologize for jumping all over the place with this, but I don't know what to do. I suffer from a anxiety disorder so just typing this out has my mind reeling. We have done everything we could, and it has backfired in our faces. The children are still being beaten harshly, just now the boy was screaming in an agonizing way that I've never heard before, because his mother didn't want him to play with his toys, so she hurt him. We can hear everything that happens, sometimes we can catch it on video, but we are not always lucky when it comes to evidence.   The children are constantly neglected, fed ramen noodles because the mother doesn't feel like cooking most of the time, they rarely bathe unless they decide to bathe themselves, they stay shut up in their house all day and night, and they aren't allowed to interact with the rest of my family, they are beaten during the day by the mother, and at night by the father.   Whenever I speak to close friends about it, no one really wants to hear about it, and they just change the subject. I've been seeing a counsellor, but I guess there is only so much the counsellor can say.   We're living in a hostile situation right now, and I'm not sure how to alleviate the problem. I don't know what to do now. If someone can give advice, that would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
1058	Hello. I live in Virginia and I'm recently separated from my spouse. I'm in the house and will be paying for all utilities and mortgage starting In September. Our son went to private school for the first time last year. With separation and pending divorce it's not feasible to continue to pay for private school and also drive 30mins each way to pick him up(majority of the pick ups would be me doing them due to my schedule). I told my former spouse I was not going to pay for schooling and she said she wouldn't consent or sign to have him transferred to the school right by my house(great public school, he has friends here, and bus stop is in front of my house). We haven't established primary custody because it will be 50/50. However she doesn't have a babysitter while I do. She also wouldn't be able to provide him with transportation every day at the private school.  Do I need her written consent to transfer his school?	Yes
1059	We live in Kentucky and my wife got a DUI / OVI in Ohio. We have multiple kids around the toddler age. I have documented proof of infidelity via messages from a former partner of hers. We both have college degrees. Neither of us have criminal records (except for her recent DUI). My wife does have an alcohol issue, but it's never been treated nor documented in any formal way (minus the DUI). I will more than likely file for a divorce. Do I stand a chance of gaining full custody of my kids? What's a best case scenario?	Yes
1060	"Hello, sorry for the poorly worded title.  My girlfriends sister is married to a sergeant on the local police force.  I don't know the full story between her sister and the husband, however he was extremely verbally abusive/manipulative last night.  He took her phone, her money, cards, purse.  Unsure how, but she got out of the house with the kids, borrowed a phone and called my gf to help her.  They went to a hospital because the sister was having a panic attack.  She was cleared and the doctor told her to leave our city because she cannot use our police if something happens.  She is in a neighboring city and is staying in hotel with the kids.  The husband called my girlfriends home, her dad answered.  The brother in law repeatedly said ""where is she"".  The dad repeatedly told him that she's safe and that he will not tell him.  I don't know anymore detail on the call other than that it was a long call and the son in law kept repeating ""where is she"".  This was at 1230am.  Then at 130pm the son in law shows up at the home and tries to enter!  Luckily the doors were locked.  He did not break anything but was there for an extended period of time shaking door knob! He's about 6'5"" 250lbs, so he could easily break it if he wanted.  A little more backstory on him.  He has an ex-wife that he always told us was crazy.  Never met her, don't know anything else about her except that he got everything in the divorce and their daughter is at his home every single time I've seen them.    I just found out about him showing up.  My girlfriend said in the text that she is afraid he is going to do something.    So far I have told her that the sister needs to contact a divorce attorney as soon as possible, but that was prior to him trying to enter my girlfriends home at 130am.  With him being a sergeant, will the police even do anything?    We don't know what to do, please help."	Yes
1061	I'm in the middle of getting my flight (China Eastern from US to Japan) cancelled in order to attend my great grandmother's funeral. In order to get the full refund, they're asking for legal proof of relation in addition to the death certificate since we don't have the same last name. Her grandson (my father) doesn't have the same last name either. Any tips for how to go about this? When I google I only see stuff about immigration.	Yes

1063	So basically my gf's mother has always had substance abuse issues, until recently they were manageable. She lost her husband and has gone back to them harder than ever. Xanax being her drug of choice her young son has found her asleep in a bowl of food and in the garage with a cigarette. She just got out of rehab this last week and it didn't seem to help. She is going to endanger herself, the family's house/possessions and we don't know what to do. My gf of course consented to posting this. We are thinking of getting the license plate and name of the dealer that no one knows and is driving her around to find more drugs and calling the cops. Can they help? Any options at all here?  Thank you tons in advance and please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit.	Yes
1064	Found out my ex-wife is driving around on a suspended license. I told her not to take our kids anywhere and she refused. She left yesterday with them. Her license is suspended for not renewing her car registration or inspection. She claims to have over $300 in EZ pass bills so she can't afford to pay the fines and have her registration renewed. Since she won't listen to me about taking the kids on a suspended license, should I call the cops on her? I'd do my best to keep my kids out of it in any way possible, but this could be my only opportunity to prove to the court system that she is irresponsible and that I should have primary custody of my children.   Call the cops and have them handle it, or let her keep doing it until she gets caught?	Yes
1065	My wife and I have two very young children (both under the age of 2) who are babysat and adored by family friends who are about our age. They love our kids almost as much as we do. We're trying to make plans for the future, including a will, and want the family friends to raise the kids if something happens to us. They have accepted (tears of joy were involved), and we just need to figure out the legal path.  Our own parents are late in their own life stages due to the age at which we chose to have children, with the youngest of our kids' grandparents about 60 years old. We have concerns with the idea of our kids losing their parents, and then potentially having to deal with losing a new set of parents in their teens (or earlier--three of the four grandparents have serious health conditions). Only one, the wife's grandmother, has what might be considered an ongoing relationship, and that's only once or twice a month for 2-3 hours at a time, always with us around.  The problem is that we expect the grandmother and the father's parents to not take this well (that's a relationship issue and not in play for this post) and to fight it legally. We'd like to know what to expect when we select a lawyer to figure out the path, and what is involved in ensuring that there is an opportunity for the grandparents to be in our kids' lives but not have the opportunity to gain custody. This is prep work to make as easy as possible what is going to be, at least in some ways, a very difficult process.	Yes
1066	**Background:** I am a 27 year old female. I have been with my now ex boyfriend for about 6 years. I was a stay at home mom to his special needs child from another marriage for about 4 of thous years. Very unexpectedly 4 days ago he decided that when he returned from deployment we would no longer be together. Since then I made a post on /r/personal finance discussing my financial status and asking for advice on how to get on my own two feet again. Many responses urged me to seek legal advice and try to get my ex boyfriend to pay me more than what he is offering me. **I do not wish to take him to court. I am happy with what he is offering.** However, due to the nature of him being deployed and me still living in his home until he returns I am seeking advice on how to cover my ass legally so to speak.   **Details:**    - Location: Virginia Beach, VA    - He and his ex wife and her new husband are all active duty Navy     - He bought the home himself I am not legally tied to it in any way    - The only account of his that my name is on is our cell phone bill, and I have a solid plan on how to exit that smoothly    - He has offered to let me stay in the house until he returns from deployment in September    - Neither one of us are petty, spiteful, nor hateful people- but shit happens and we are trying to deal with it maturely     - There has been no talk of taking legal action and I don't think there will be but I'd rather be protected rather than naive     - Due to a job offer I may be out of the house sooner than he would like (by about 4-6 weeks depending on his return date) and will find proper temporary housing for our.. well now his dog.      - If at all possible I would like to never have to see him face to face again.    **My Current Plan**    - Make an itemized list of what I am taking from the house    - Have a witness present when I remove items from the house    - Have witness do a walk through of the condition of the house     - record walk through on video and send it to him before he returns    - ask his ex wife to take the dog temporarily until he returns    - discuss prior to me leaving landscaping plans with my ex       - I will surrender the keys to his ex wife with his written permission. **My Questions**    - Will the ex wife be a reliable choice as a witness or do I require someone less bias (she loves me and has a healthy amount of hate for him)? Or should I ask the next door neighbor? (we're not close and sharing something so personal with him seems very odd but he is someone we both would trust to stay impartial)    - speaking of written proof, do emails and facebook messages count?    -  is there anything else I should be thinking of to make sure I am protected in this situation?    **THANK YOU** Thank you so much for your advice, help, and support in advance.	Yes
1067	My mom has schizophrenia. Her brother is the trustee of a large inheritance given to her by her Dad. This inheritance is her main source of income. He's also the executor of my Dad's estate who just recently passed away.   My uncle wants to sell her house and put her in a assisted living home. She's only 60. She wants to stay in her home, where we she is currently being taken care of by a caregiver.   He's not providing her any sort of autonomy or transparency about the decisions he's making. He also refuses to allow me to have any  knowledge of how much she has and how its being invested. I know she has (800k+).  Right now I'm trying to figure out where her rights start and his end. And also if it would be worth applying for guardianship, I'm only 25 and not exactly that established yet. Would applying for her guardianship allow me to hold him accountable for decisions?  I just hate the idea that he's making these life decisions she doesn't agree with. He's doing this under the guise of it being in her best interest, but if that were the case he would allow her to be apart of that decision and would be sensitive to the fact that her husband just died four months ago. He wants the sell the house she's lived in for over 17 years and put her there within the next few months. From my understanding he wants to do this to lessen his responsibilities of taking care of her.   I'm also concerned about him making decisions about the kind of medical care she receives. She has the mental capacity I believe to make her own medical decisions. With other family members in the past, he has prioritized money over care, and I would hate to see him do the same thing with my Mom.   Does anyone have any idea about how to approach this? I don't where to start or how I go about any of this. Am I asking the right questions?	Yes
1068	I'm going through a divorce right now and I was hoping to get some guidance here. Im currently stationed in Virginia but was married in Alabama and thats where my soon to be ex-wife is currently living with our 2 children. So we have a mutual agreement contract which states she'll be taking all payments of the second vehicle and Ill be giving her a certain amount of money for child support until our children have reached the age of 18. The contract is signed by both of us and is notarized as well.  So on the beginning of this month when the contract was supposed to take place she told that she didnt want to buy the car from me because she doesn't want it.  So now Im stuck paying for another car I cant afford and was wondering if itll be worth getting an attorny to help with that along with the divorce paperwork. Like what would happen if I got an attorney to press that case for me? What would be the negative consequence of her breaching a contract? Or would I be out of more money than before because I now have to take that route. I was also hoping someone could tell me how long we have to be separated in Alabamas laws in order to file for divorce. Ive googled and I cant find anything on an amount of time we need to be separated. I know Virginias laws and they're easy to find but thats not the case for Alabama since we were married there.   Im planning on getting an attorney but I want to have as much knowledge as possible before I do. If you have any questions please ask. I'm activr military and Ive already spoken with legal quite a few times but it always comes down to then telling me to find an attorney in Alabama without any real guidance.   Thanks in advance!	Yes
1069	I'm currently waiting the 21 days until I can request for a default decision to be made for the complaint of annulment I've filed (my STBX has been served and is not signing). We had no children, assets, nor debts to share, so it should be straightforward.  Has anyone ever either filed to move forward in default for complaint of annulment or divorce in Nevada, and how long did the turnaround take to get the decision? Were you requested to appear in court to verify anything? I have evidence I will submit with the affidavit to prove the annulment is valid--is there any chance that for some reason it wouldn't be granted to me? I want this over asap and I'm just trying to gauge what kind of timeline I should expect to continue having to deal with this.   Also, if there is anyone out there who knows how I can add divorce as a backup option within my affidavit, like an addition within my complaint statement, maybe in an exhibit, that would give me a bit of reassurance. Thanks so much!	Yes
1070	We had an argument over a pizza since I realized I forgot my wallet when we got to the restaurant. So we drive back home and I'm trying to de-escalate the situation. I accidentally spill his drink and bend over to place it upright, but while I'm bent over he picks me up, walks over to my car and throws me against the car door. He picks me up again, I'm scratching at his arms in an effort to get him to let go, he throws me on the street and kicks me in the leg. He then gets on his hands and knees over me and I'm biting and scratching to get him off. When that doesn't work scream for someone to call for help. When to cops get there they arrest us both because we both had injuries and they don't know who started the fight. The only witness was the neighbor who called the cops and told them they saw a male on top of a female. We're both being charged for class 4 misdemeanor domestic assault. I've never had any legal troubles in the past and I'm mainly just worried that he will try to spin the story to make me look bad. It's pretty much just my word against his, aside from our injuries. What is likely to happen in this situation?	Yes
1071	Hey guys,  I need some advice in regards to my fathers income tax return. We are really stuck right now and could use the money for a down payment or even deposit on a house/Rental property. Hear me out and please let me know if you can help out.   Here goes nothing, I guess.    So, my dad recently claimed his tax returns but was denied compensation because he has a standing order for custody for my siblings an I from January of this year.    You see, my parents have been divorced for almost 5 years now and my siblings and I have been living with my father since 2013. However, even though my parents have been divorced some time now, my mother has always had custody even though we have been living with my father for the past 4 years.    When my dad filed his tax return and claimed us the first time around, the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) quickly denied it and requested for proof of us living with him in which he provided them with proof and sent them documents. And now we are here. Rejected once more because of a court order my dad has for custody.   At this point we are both puzzled and unsure on what to do next. Every time we speak with the lawyer he requests money; which we do not have, unfortunately. I believe that he should get his money. It is not fair. We have been living with him for 4 years. Even if he did not have custody he should still be able to claim us on his taxes and get his hard earned money.   Please help.  Thank you,  Moe	Yes
1072	My ex husband died on deployment a year ago. He left behind our 6 year old. I've always been the primary caregiver as he was often deployed/stationed elsewhere.   We are about to begin a lengthy court battle for custody as they have decided that I am unfit.   The reasons they give are below. I am not the perfect parent. I always try to do better than the day before. That isn't to say I don't make mistakes.   I've gotten a call, the first one , but they have been reporting for the better part of year.   They don't have grandparents rights but I have voluntarily let them see our son every other Saturday since my ex died and they also saw him every other Saturday during any deployment or out of state station. This isn't court ordered.  I do worry that some of their reports might have merit  1) Instead of distracting him or forbidding him from humping. I let him do that in the privacy of his own room where no one can see him. I've talked to a doctor about it. She suggested distraction but when I informed her a month after that it wasn't working all the time she told me that I should just keep encouraging distraction but not to make him feel ashamed and just make sure he does it alone in his room.   2) I don't spank or use negative reinforcement in any way. He earns things by making the right decisions and being a good person but if he makes the wrong decisions we usually just talk it out. Sometimes we compromise where possible. I only take away things when absolutely necessary.    3) Sometimes we don't always get to bed right at 8:30. He is a tough sleeper and we try every day but there are days where he just won't go to sleep until 9:30. A few times, especially since his dad died, he has outlasted me and I've fallen asleep by accident next to his bed and woken up at 11 to find him playing with toys quietly ( he goes to therapy, we are working on it)   4) One of my neighbors smoke weed and I hate it. You can sometimes smell it vaguely in my apartment and right outside the door. I report it to the office and security each time. I have three months of back and forth emails. I can't just move but I have moved my son's bedroom to the master suite near the back of the apartment so that it would never be smelled in there (the guest bedroom is closer to the living room and the smell). My ex mother in law came to get him once and smelled it and demanded to look around the apartment. I let her because it isn't in my apartment. It is upstairs. Not something I can completely control but while she was there the security officer stopped by to take another report since I had reported it immediately. I don't plan to renew my lease but I am going to have to power through it until I can afford to move. I've gotten humidifiers and purifiers and candles but it isn't insanely strong, just notable about once a month.   Now even typing that I see things I could do better and plan to implement them but I am worried about the reports and what I can do. This is all stuff they have reported. And I encourage them to report when I do something wrong but this doesn't seem rise to the level of DCSF wrong. More like I need to read a parenting book and maybe get some advice from an aunt wrong.    Is any of this stuff that I need to be worried about in the report? I'm type A so I have back ups of back ups of everything and I am CYA at every turn.   I'd ask my lawyer but it seems like $250 every time I call him about something and I know I should and would. But I just have to wait until payday.   I am not poor. I am just not I have tons of money to throw at a lawyer at the drop of every hat rich.   I just thought maybe someone here to could let me know if this is something, legally, I should worry about or if the report will come and go and be look into and then nothing will come of it.   I am especially worried about the smoke smell. I've a binder ready to go of all the information about it where I tried to solve it all outside of moving. Would it be a better idea to just move? And just owe the money (and eventually pay it but like maybe set up a payment plan or something)?   I should note that I don't have any family so basically his parents are using my lack of a support system ( I technically had one before the divorce). as motivator for them seeking custody. I'm no poor and have a job and support myself just fine, it just happens that my parents died in my 20's and I was an only child. I mean I have aunts but we aren't close.   Sorry this is so long. I'm in Northwest Arkansas if that makes a difference.	Yes
1073	"Throwaway obviously and I'm looking for advice on how to help my big brother. Both families involved are from GA but soon to be ex wife is currently in NC and brother was recently reassigned to GA.  He is a Marine, been in over a decade and in his early thirties. About eight years ago, he married a woman who already had two children from different men. The fathers were in jail/on drugs/out of the picture and brother eventually adopted them both. She was ""finding herself"" and he enabled her to be a stay at home mom and payed for her to take numerous classes, from real estate to nutrition and now to yoga certifications, but she has never been gainfully employed since they've been married. She also has a chronically ill (alcoholic, smoker, possible MS) mother who lives in GA, who she drives to ""check on"" weekly and buys groceries for (with his money).  She has decided the military life isn't for her and she doesn't love him anymore, and wants a divorce. He is expecting to have to pay $1k per child per month + their mortgage payment (~$1k) on the NC house, which leaves him no money to support himself. He doesn't want to get a lawyer but I feel like he is totally being taken advantage of and that those sums are crazy.  If you need more info to help, please let me know and I will provide it. It breaks my heart to see him lose everything."	Yes
1074	"I am trying to divorce my abusive spouse. We've been married 12 years and have a six year old daughter. He has been physically violent for years and has continued to stalk me pretty aggressively throughout our separation. I moved out in Nov. 2016 and officially filed with the courts in Feb. 2017 pro se. He counter petitioned and as I did not have an attorney I was bullied into giving majority custody to him of our daughter. This has proved to be a bad decision as he does not care for her emotional well being and she is now seeing a therapist. He also continues to break the morality clause in our custody orders. I have gone to authorities to attempt to get a Protective Order against him, once with a bruise from him on my body, and they stated that as we are still married and have a child together they thought it best to deny. I have had to fight to get a criminal trespass warning for my home. Since I decided to leave I have been seeing someone else. My boyfriend has been hit multiple times and charges were pressed but they never went anywhere. The local police told him he should just stop seeing me and that I'm getting what I deserve bc I shouldn't be seeing someone while I'm still technically married. On top of physical stalking, he works in IT security and cyber stalks me constantly. He hacks into ALL of my online accounts, wipes or locks out my phone (which he is not on the account or any of my accounts), gets into my bank accounts, paypal etc, and has begun hacking into the network where I work and messing with my payroll stuff as well as posting inappropriate pictures for all of my coworkers to see. Meanwhile, no one will listen to me or acknowledge whats going on no matter what I report. He even reads all my text messages, etc, tracks my whereabouts constantly, and does petty things like driving by my house and setting of my car alarm in the middle of the night. He has recently been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder after a suicide attempt and I feel he is unfit to parent our child. However, I cant afford a retainer for an attorney. I now pay approximately 45% of my income to him for child support, insurance for our daughter, daycare for her while shes with him, and other medical fees each month. My check is already small so this has left me on the brink of homelessness even though I work full time and clean houses on the side. He tells our child awful things like I don't love her and I'm a quote ""fucking whore"" etc constantly which has been very detrimental to her. At this point I'm at my wits end. I feel like no one is listening and I have no where to turn. I would love to free myself and my daughter from this abuse and unsustainable situation, but I don't know what to do. Could anyone tell me how long he can ride this out without signing divorce papers since he counter petitioned? What can I do to lower the amount I pay to him as I am in such dire straits and he makes a few thousand a month more than I do already? Without everything coming out I currently bring home less than a minimum wage employee and cant find an attorney willing to help"	Yes
1075	Oh my poor mom.   First of all, she has a house in Fl where she says she's living at. That's where her FL ID says she is and that's where her mail gets sent to. She's struggling with mortgage payments and has the possibility of getting the house foreclosed on. That's a whole other issue but relevant to this story. She's been making money by renting out 2 of the 3 rooms for short or long term periods. This has been going on for 3 years but recently the HOA got involved and said she couldn't do this the way she wanted to anymore. Now the HOA only wants a minimum of a 1 year commitment from the tenants and they have to be approved by them with an application. She's struggling to find people to move in but she found someone last week. When she was trying to fly back from Idaho, her new husband (diagnosed with Alzheimer's) became distressed and the plans fell through(check out my history for that story). She paid for my plane ticket and I flew back to help out with the room rental instead.   Now I'm here and going through all of her mail. She wanted me to open everything and alert her of everything going on. There were several documents from the court. Here's what I gathered:  My father is an angry person who separated himself from all of us and then accused my mom of taking his children away (he said this in a threatening email to her, we're in our 30s, wtf). She was receiving alimony but recently he was able to convince the court to reduce alimony by 75% retroactively for 3 years.  The docs show that he gets a certain amount of money from SS and has a job. Apparently he no longer works and only receives SS. Makes sense to reduce the alimony. But making it retroactive? I don't understand that.  Yet, my mom, being ignorant and not realizing what you should and shouldn't do, didn't know that she would stop receiving alimony when she got re-married and didn't tell the FL court. She received 2 more checks, she thought it was weird, called SS, they said since the checks were already made then she can cash them. (I don't think she called SS to see if it was okay if she thought getting married wouldn't cancel alimony..). She was ordered by the court to repay money from those checks but also ordered to pay another monthly sum to pay back the last 3 years of supposedly receiving too much money from the alimony.   She is now aware that she shouldn't have cashed those checks and is paying it back now but wasn't aware of the retroactive payments. She's, umm, not very good at speaking and understanding English so it sounds like a miscommunication to me. She missed 4 months of payments. My dad alerted the court and set up a court date for March. My mom was never personally served, instead, the Sheriff's Office contacted her by phone and alerted her of the date. She refused to answer any questions and said she couldn't return for a couple of months. She thought this was about the house and not about those repayments.   So of course, she failed to show up. A hearing was then scheduled for May and then a Motion for Civil Contempt/Enforcement set for July. My dad was present at the hearing in July, but not my mom and she was not represented by Legal Counsel.  The conclusion shows that she has the ability to comply with previous judgements and orders of the court and has willfully refused to do so.  My mom had absolutely no idea that she was supposed to pay these retroactive monthly payments even though a year and a half ago is when the alimony was reduced by 75%. It's odd to me that she has to make those payments back and that the payments were required to start on April of this year.   She's dealing with a lot, can't travel/leave her husbands side, can't rent out her rooms and has the possibility of being foreclosed on. Any recommendations?	Yes
1076	Hi my dad is abusive not physically but its enough. I cannot take anymore of this and feel like doing extreme measures just to get away. I wont go into detail to derail the post. The bills of the house (water,electric,ect) come in with his name. My mom and dad share a bank account and he is the holder on it. So he has to make the decisions my mom cant.  I dont think if we ever went to the law if would be in our favor because of this. Hes a good manipulator to others. Im afraid anything will be in favor of him. Is there anything i can do? Do i have to start recording his psychotic episodes for evidence. He does not listen to anything we say ever so talking to him is not an option for he will not listen.	Yes
1077	Hello!   My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the  past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment.  We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force. Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	Yes
1078	TL;DR My uncle stole ~$1000 from my father after his final social security direct deposit and we have proof. We want to force payment since we don't think he will cooperate, but we don't want to put his ass in jail. Can someone comment on whether we could seek a judgment to garnish his wages in a civil suit and not a criminal suit?  Long version: My father died at the beginning of July and my uncle helped himself to his final social security deposit afterwards, we believe by way of forging checks.  We wish to recoup this money and apply it to funeral expenses. On principle I'd rather not let him get away with this. But my brother and I agree that we don't really wanna put the fool behind bars for this and we're not sure if this would be criminal or civil if it came to court. My brother is in the process of getting executorship because I am overseas and it's easier for him.  My question is, could we press charges and keep him from being incarcerated? We both had the thought that since it's related to social security and that's federal, this could blow up in a way we don't want.   We're of course trying to settle this out of court first and foremost, but my uncle stays unbelievably intoxicated between alcohol and prescription pills he gets from the VA. He is almost never in a sober state of mind and therefore next to impossible to reason with. In some stupid way he was actually trying to dupe us into believing the bank was at fault for the money he withdrew and that is the reason he actually mailed the bank statement proving his guilt to us.  Thanks in advance.	Yes
1079	"Not sure what to do at this point but I'm hoping for some advice.  My mom is in a marriage with a guy who seems to be mentally unstable. They have been married for almost 9 years. He verbally abuses my mom, saying very nasty things to her, of which some have been recorded. He has an extremely bad anger issue and will literally get mad over anything and everything. She had him arrested once for getting extremely angry and throwing her phone against a wall. He has even told my mom that he will ""beat the sh*t"" out of my brother and I if we ever go to the house that is in my moms name.  My mom had left the house about three weeks ago due to him being angry. She lived out of a hotel for about 2 weeks and is currently living in a RV. Today, he closed all the bank accounts, which have a fairly large sum of money and told her that she has to come back and be a ""good little wife"" or she will never see the money again. The accounts where joint accounts. He also started to throw out her property since she left the house.  She had hired a lawyer around the same time she left the house and yesterday had to fire him due to his office taking too long on the paper work and barely responded to her phone calls and emails.  I'm not sure what to do and I'm trying to figure out what my mom should do next. She says she going back to him because she has no other choice, financially. My mom is 70 and he is in his late 60's. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
1080	"This might end up being quite long and complicated, so I apologize in advance, but I really do need advice. I'm not entirely sure where to start, or which parts of the story are relevant or not, so I'll try to do a quick summary in chronological order.   Background: My mom and I have had a very rocky relationship since my childhood. I won't get into much detail on that as I don't know if it's relevant or not, and I don't want to draw attention away from the more pressing questions I have. I think what's important to note though is she has the tendency to be very manipulative and controlling, and uses her money (she's quite rich)/position (as a mother) to get her way with pretty much everything. She'll result to yelling, physical abuse, threatening to withdraw financial support, etc. to sort of force you into doing whatever it is she wants. She absolutely has to have her way about everything every single time, or she'll have some kind of crazy violent outburst.  My dad's a calm and quiet man - the complete opposite of my mother. He's very understanding and is ""passively supportive"". He'll let you live your own life and make your own decisions, and will help out when asked. However, he's very laid back, and will try to avoid confrontation as much as possible, so he tends to stay quiet and let my mom go crazy and have her way with whatever she wants, only stepping in sometimes, when she gets excessively violent.   Summary: [2007] I had a son when I was 18 out of an abusive relationship with my then boyfriend who was 19 at the time. The relation very quickly deteriorated upon me finding out I was pregnant, so much so that by the time the child was delivered, we were barely speaking to each other, which is why he isn't on the child's birth certificate at all. I was in college at the time, and unable to adequately provide for myself and my son, so I stayed at home, and my parents provided for my son. My mom would rub this fact in my face throughout the years, but I figured she's right anyway, so I might as well endure, as I really won't be able to afford the same standard of living she can provide for me and my kid.  [2011] Moving a few years forward, I'm 21 (my son is 3) and my family decides to migrate to the US. My mom and sisters would be able to apply as dependends of my dad who had a work visa at the time, but my son and I could not, as I was already 21, and he isn't legally my dad's dependent. The plan was we all go together, visit other relatives and tour around the US, help my family get settled, then go back home with my son. When we got back, I'd finish with university and get a job to be able to support us both. I figured this would be a good time for a fresh start and to finally get away from her manipulative ways without stirring up any trouble.  [2012] When it was about time to go back home, my mom started hinting that I should leave my son in the US with them, as they'll be better able to provide for him. I told her I'd prefer to take him home with me, even if it'll be harder for me. She then started to say things like ""Well if you insist on going back, I can't stop you, but the fact that you're choosing to leave despite my objection means you don't need my help, so don't expect any support from me when you get back."" or ""How are you gonna pay for school, and where are you gonna live? Are you gonna live at my house?"" Being still quite young at the time, her statements scared me. I knew I'd be able to survive on my own, but I also knew it'd be so much harder, specially since I had to provide for both myself and my son. I knew I could take it, and for me it was worth the hardship to finally be free of her, but I didn't want him to suffer being poor just because I couldn't stand my mom anymore. I felt like getting away was something I desperately needed, but I also felt like I was being selfish - taking away an opportunity at a better life for him just because of my strained relationship with my mom. I had a talk with my dad afterwards and he said I'd always be his daughter so he'll always be there for me, but it really was in both my son's and my best interests for him to stay behind with them, as I could focus on finishing up school and getting my act together without having to worry about being able to provide for my son. So in the end, I gave in to what my mom wanted and left the country without my son.  [2013] Mom tells me that she needs me to grant her legal guardianship so she can enroll my son to school. She says she's talked to a lawyer about it and will send over papers for me to sign. It seemed reasonable and innocent enough at the time, and nothing untoward happened so far, so I figured it'd be alright. She sends me the papers and I sign then send them back, my son starts going to school, no problems.  [2015?] My entire family (dad, mom and sisters) get their green cards and become legal permanent residents, as opposed to just legal dependents on my dad's work visa. Mom says she'll need custody of my son so he legally becomes their dependent and would thus also legally qualify for a green card. I don't remember the entire conversation in precise detail, but she said something about how I'd have to legally abandon him, or relinquish my rights or something in order for her to be granted custody. I was of course taken aback by this and didn't wanna sign any papers because I didn't like the idea of abandoning my son or relinquishing my rights, even if it was to my mother. .She assured me it'd all just be on paper, that he'd still be my son, that it was just so he could get a green card, it was for his future, etc. Also we' (mom and I) have stopped fighting so much after we started living in different countries. She repeatedly said this was the only way, and I decided it truly was what was best for my son's future, so like before, I had her send me the paperwork, I signed and sent them back. I think it was around this time she said something like it might be best to stop trying to contact my son so it actually looks like I abandoned him, and so he won't get confused if he has to go to court or something. I figured I'm signing the papers anyway, I might as well do what I can to make this go smoothly for my son. It's the least I could do for not being able to provide for him myself. She gets granted custody, and they start the process of getting my son legal permanent resident status.  [2016] I'm finally done with university and am free to visit my family. My son (who's 8 by this time) and I make up for all the time we lost by being around each other pretty much all the time. He follows me around everywhere and sticks by me pretty much all the time, wanting to do everything with me. I think this is only natural, as we haven't seen each other in 5 years. Everything's going alright but I start to notice mom getting jealous. Every now and then she'll say things like ""remember that I'm in charge here"" ""he's under my care here so I'm the authority on him, not you"" ""you have no rights here so I get to make the decisions"". It gets offensive from time to time but I let it go for the most part because I figured there'd be no point in starting an arguement with her. She'll just go crazy til she gets what she wants anyway. I can tolerate her controlling to an extent, because she really is providing my son with a kind of lifestyle I can't afford to provide. I just graduated and flew here to see them pretty much immediately after, so I don't exactly have much saved up. I mean, she is my mom and she has been providing for my son this whole time, so I really do owe her a lot. Plus, her house, her rules, right? They get along quite fine anyway, and from what I've seen, she very rarely gets physically violent with him, so it seems like her relationship with him is nowhere near as messed up as mine. The only thing that really gets to me is every now and then, she'll call him aside, and tell him things like ""I'm the only one who cares for you around here, so you should listen to me"" or ""Your mom doesn't think youre the most important thing, thats why she left you here with me and that's why I'm in charge of you"", things like that. I don't know if that qualifies as brainwashing, but what bothers me even more is if she says things like that to him when she knows I can hear them, what kind of things does she tell him when I'm not around?  [2017] It's almost time for me to go back, and my relationship with my mom has pretty much gone back to what it originally was - extremely strained and borderline dysfucntional. We've had a few fights where she ended up getting violent (literally dragging my son away from me, pulling my hair, clawing at me, etc.) and it's gotten to a point where I've pretty much lost my patience so I actually fight back, specially when she starts pulling my son away. That just really gets to me fast. Fights like that only end when she decides to walk away, as I literally have nowhere else to go. Sometimes she takes my son with her, or sometimes she leaves him with me when she walks off. On a few occassions she's forbidden him to come near me and things like that, but things usually settle down and go back to normal after a few days.   Sometime last week, another such fight broke out, where she was again dragging my son away from me while yelling ""I'm the authority over him you have no rights here"", and as per usual when she started going for my son, I decided to fight back. She started getting physical again, so of course I fought back, and eventually my dad stepped in and pulled her away from me and my son. She disappeared for the rest of that day, came back the next day and everything was as normal as it gets around here. After a few days, she gets into another one of her ""I'm in charge of you and I'm the one who takes care of you"" talks with my son, and I really couldn't stand it anymore so I tell her to stop, and just say what she has to say without any of the brainwashing crap. We get into another argument (purely verbal this time), and she starts yelling ""I reported you to the police you know, I can have you deported"" among other things.  Ever since I left him here in 2012, I've always had that feeling of regret with me. I feel like I should have just taken him with me because even if we did end up poor, we'd be together, plus even if my mom stopped supporting us, my dad would still be there, and my dad would never abandon us. But I always told myself this was for the best, because this gives him the best chance at a stable future. I told myself it doesn't matter if I miss him or if I'm sad or if it's hard for me, as long as he's okay, because it's all for him in the end.   Now though, 5 years later, I feel like I'm facing the exact same situation again. I don't know if I'm being selfish,  but I feel like this time I shouldn't give him up and I should just take him back home with me even if it means my mom will withdraw financial support (or any kind of support for that matter). I brought it up briefly with my dad after the fight last week, and he said it's not a problem with him, and he supports me taking my son with me if that was what I really wanted, but that I shouldn't make a decision while I'm mad.  I'm still thinking things through, but I might be running out of time, so I thought it'd be best to explore what my options actually are before making a decision. If I decide to take him home with me, my mom is gonna object for sure, so I wanted to figure out if taking him with me is an actual option in the first place, and if not, what should I do about that? I know that if I do decide on bringing him back with me I'll have to get an actual family lawyer, but I figured maybe I could avoid having to pay for a lawyer first and find out if I actually stand a chance? Because if we do go back together I'll need every penny I have, so I'm trying to avoid having to pay a lawyer hundreds if not thousands of dollars if there's no chance I can get him back.  -----  TLDR; Signed custody of my son over to my mom a few years ago, relationship with mom has deteriorated beyond repair, I wanna take him back but I have no idea if I'm legally allowed to. She has a lot of money, and I don't."	Yes
1081	"My sister M is currently 13. Earlier this year, she started self harming and one of her friends reported it to the school. M talked to a school counselor and confessed that she had been molested as a child by one of my cousins. The counselor then shared this information with my family (and the police I assume? Aren't school counselors mandated reporters?). None of us had even suspected a thing and it was horrible for pretty much everyone in my immediate family (no one outside my parents and siblings knew or even suspected). Now here's the part where I want legal advice:  My sister M was 7 when my 16 year old cousin molested her on 3 different occasions. She is now 13, like I said. Even if M does decide she wants to press charges (and I don't think she is currently in a place to feel comfortable doing so), is there like any chance in hell that something will come of it? The cousin who molested her was a minor at the time, no one witnessed it, and while I and my family of course believe M, it happened 6 years ago so I'm afraid there's not any ""proof."" Note: this cousin joined the military out of high school and we have not seen him in years. Does being in the military affect this at all, if charges were to be brought against him? I'm mostly terrified that he will be able to hurt (or has already hurt) other children and, of course, I also want him to rot in hell/jail for what he did to my sister. Pressing charges is ultimately going to be M's decision (with support from her therapist and all of us), but what are the odds that it's even worth our time (ie, will actually go somewhere legally) and her possibly having to see him again in court to press charges?"	Yes
1082	I'm not 100% sure if this belongs here, but I have a friend with an abusive husband and I haven't heard from her in 3 weeks. The last text I sent mentioned a shelter for women and children who are victims of domestic abuse and I don't know if her husband saw it. I'm not sure if I should call the police for a wellness check? I feel like that might make the situation worse if he's home when they do it.  If a different sub would be a better fit for this question like /r/legaladviceofftopic , please let me know. I'm just looking for advice on whether police should be involved or if I should try to find another way to deal with this.  I have her address but I think she's moving in 2 days last I heard so I need to do something pretty soon here.  We're located in Washington state.	Yes
1083	I hear it all the time in Michigan that you can move out at the age of 17. Planning to move my GF out of her home at that age and just wanna be sure that her cop brother can't touch me when i do.	Yes
1084	"Hi r/legaladvice.  Important background info: I am a minor who will be applying to colleges starting in November. I have 5 months left until I turn 18. My mom is disabled and her sole income is from SSI.  Two years ago, my dad told us that him and my mom have been divorced since 2003; however, she did not recall ever signing dissolution papers. He had also been living with us this whole time and taking almost all of my mom's money. He gave us a big binder full of unorganized papers and left us with almost no money. Upon rehashing the papers, I showed my mom her signature and she said that is was not hers. So at this point, she had been unknowingly divorced for 12 years.  My dad had paid for my brother's college education, but he told me last week that he would not be contributing anything to my education. I do not expect my mom to contribute much, however, because she has a small income. So, growing frustrated with this whole mess, I drove to my local courthouse and asked to open the file in case there were some papers we didn't have.   As I went through the file, I discovered that a judge had ordered all of the petitions and papers ""void ab initio"" only a month after them being filed. The reasoning was because they were all prepared by a lawyer who was not licensed to practice in Illinois.  I went to a lawyer to ask him to just decipher the language for me and he told me what it all meant. He was also concerned why I was doing most of this alone, and it is because my mom is deathly afraid of my dad. When he left, he threatened us to not file anything in court, or else he will kick us out of our own house.  I told her today what is going on. She is speechless but has agreed that, with my support, she will go to the court to file the petition for dissolution, as well as a petition for college expenses.   We are both wondering now if we should get an attorney before we file the petitions? Should we go file them first? What happens if this case is not resolved once I turn 18--does it all go to dust? Can we call 911 if he comes to our house to threaten us again?  Thank you in advance for any advice. I am a little overwhelmed as I am the supporter for both my mom and myself, but I would really like this to be solved and done with before next autumn."	Yes
1085	i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	Yes
1086	Background info: My mom is an alcoholic and has been for about 4 years. She got arrested about 3 years ago for a *dwi* and earlier this year she got a TIPS surgery because her liver is shit.  6 day's ago my mom picked me(16) up from the cinema and my sister(14) who was in the car along with my step-sister(15) and cousin (8) told me that my mom had bought some alcohol when she when nobody was watching her (this is like the 5th time she has relapsed since her surgery). I got in the car and she drove off, heading home. I called 911 and told the operator the situation and an officer pulled us over and arrested my mom. She stayed in jail for 24 hours after her parents bailed her out. Now, 4 days later, she is getting her license revoked for 5-10 years and going to jail for a year if she doesn't get a lawyer. What do we do?	Yes
1087	This is a serious question.  I'm in a relationship with a woman who is very unhappy with me.  We entered into a relationship, moved in together, entered a loosely defined business relationship as well.  For personality reasons, things have not been financially successful.  Also due to the added expense of her (I pay for all of our living expenses, and I pay her money each month), I'm almost broke.  Our relationship has dissolved, we live together (separate ends of the house), there is no sex or intimacy.  She screams at me from the time she wakes up til evening.  She's accused me of stealing money from her (from a questionably joint account in my name, which was used for household expenses).    I know there's a lot to digest but my biggest question is, her constant screaming has become abusive in my opinion.  Is screaming, harassing, insulting, using disparaging remarks, a crime?  Are they assault?    If I as a man were to behave this way, even if I weren't happy with some arrangement, I am convinced I would be arrested for assault.  I want to to know my options legally for getting out of this relationship.  I feel there's a chance I have been gaslighted, hoodwinked, taken advantage of... We are not married, there are no written agreements, which is my regret.    What are my options?  Ask questions, I'll gladly provide answers to the best of my ability.	Yes
1088	I'm a divorced mom of 3. My husband took me to court and got temporary custody of the children, because I was abusing adderall and meth. I moved away and went through outpatient treatment and was able to see my kids every other weekend supervised. After I completed treatment, I received my portion of my ex-husband's 401k from the divorce. Well, that money led to a relapse and the temporary custody order was finalized.   I went further away this time to an inpatient rehab. I signed up for a year but decided to leave early. Right now I'm living in a halfway house. I've been clean almost 6 months.   My ex said he's willing to reconcile whenever I'm ready to move back. He's forgiven me for everything.  The problem is, I fell in love with a guy in rehab. He's been clean for over 2 years though, because he was in prison for over a year. My ex found out about it and isn't too happy.   So, my question is....if I move back to my hometown and live with my new boyfriend, would family court take into consideration his criminal history when deciding on custody?  I love my children, and I would do anything to get them back. But I don't want to walk away from a potentially amazing relationship. Any advice would be much appreciated.	Yes
1089	-This is in Arizona  When we first got divorced 6 months ago the child support order stated that although the amount on the child support worksheet was $1400, child support payments should only be $800 as to not put unnecessary burden on me financially.  Now, 6 months later, she wants to change that and filed to modify child support for the full amount.   Given that it has only been 6 months, and there have been no changes to income or medical or anything, is it worth requesting a hearing to avoid the increase, or is there nothing I can do?  Any options? Thank you for your help.	Yes
1090	Hello Everybody - First and foremost, I sincerely appreciate any and all assistance you can offer.  &amp;nbsp;  TLDR= Wisconsin - Never married, Child is 14, have 50/50 custody/placement, there has been no order for support since 2007 when we amended the custody order for 50/50.  Is my Ex entitled/able to acquire to any of my payout?  &amp;nbsp;   Full Story = Recently discovered I will be getting some money, not Millions but still a life altering amount for my situation(lowish six figures).  My primary question/concern is how best to proceed to ensure that my ex is prevented/limited in her ability to stake any form of claim in the payout I will get.  My goal is to maximize the positive impact this payout can have on my life and my son's life only.  &amp;nbsp;  Basics of it are as outlined in the TLDR, we have had 50/50 custody/placement since I got out of the Military in 2007, she 100% agreed to sharing everything, we developed the current agreement together, without lawyers and both submitted it, judge signed off on it.  We were never married, when the support order was active during my service (03-07) I never missed a single child support payment, voluntarily updated child support every time I received a raise.  We split every cost for him 50/50(I write checks and have paper record of everything), we share all major decisions, we agree/share the same approach when it comes to teaching/disciplining our Son, IE when he's grounded there I ground him here and vice versa, we support each other in that fashion.  Overall I would say my Ex and I have a pretty good co-parenting relationship, I really couldn't ask for more as far as all of that goes.    &amp;nbsp;  My Son has indicated a desire to live with me several times, he has also stated this desire to his Mother.  I would love for him to live with me, that said, I recognize the reason he wants to live with me is because he and I share a lot of the same interests and overall have a ton of fun.  This is largely due to the fact that he is my only child, so he gets 100% of my attention/recreational spending, at his Mother's he is the oldest of 3 children, so gets far less attention and a lot more misc chores due to the larger household.   &amp;nbsp;  I typed all of that out to attempt to help inform your responses, not trying to kill you with a wall of letters.  Regarding finances, she is married, they have probably double the household income that I have, we don't really share our finances but we did include in our court order, neither of us have asked the other about anything for years.  We alternate yearly on claiming my son as a dependent on taxes.  My basic concern is that once she learns about my anticipated payout she will file for child support.  I have performed some basic research, in WI it looks like they utilize a formula for 50/50 situations similar to ours where they analyze the difference between the two parents income.  How does that all relate to taxable lump sum payouts?  I know I probably need to hire an Attorney, there is also the possibility that I will get the payout and she would never even know unless I deviated from my current lifestyle to drastically.  &amp;nbsp;  Thank you again for any and all assistance	Yes
1091	My stepfather is highly emotionally and verbally abusive, but he has never hit the family. His threats range from breaking bones to killing my mother if she tries to leave, and otherwise he is always belittling everyone in very mean ways. He has caused me and my mom to have both anxiety and depression. My mom has four children with him and wont try to leave him for fear that he'll get custody and manipulate the hell out of them.  I was talking to my mom and she said that emotional abuse holds no grounds in court for a divorce or a custody battle because there is no physical proof. Is this true? If both my mother and I stated that he is emotionally abusive and gave a plethora of examples, would there still be no help for us? We need to get out of this toxic environment, but my mom says we cant get help unless he's physically violent.	Yes
1092	"Hello friends,  So I am in quite the predicament and needing some help from reddit!  This is a throwaway account as the person discussed is also a regular visitor.  My fiance and I recently found out that we are moving due to a job I received.    Background: We are both currently living in an apartment near her mother.  About 1.5 years ago, her mother helped her find an apartment and purchased several pieces of furniture to help her furnish the new place.  Her mother obviously not on the lease nor has keys.   Fast-forward to today: Her mother is demanding that she give back all the things that she ""loaned"" to her to furnish the apartment.  She is obviously upset that we are moving away and is trying to do anything to force us to stay nearby.  She has threatened to take us to court for ""her"" belongings.  Are we obligated to give back every item her mother purchased for the apartment?  This includes: a futon, bed frame, kitchen table, bar stools, and entertainment center.  Thanks again everyone for all your help."	Yes
1093	Me and my daughter were assaulted by my wife and she was charged with assault in the 4th degree and domestic mischief in the 3rd. She was a stay-at-home mother of our 1yr old daughter, but with the protection order I put in place for her own safety, her mother isn't allowed to see her.  I live in Bellevue, WA, and was already living pretty modestly, but it's damn expensive here and considering the immediate legal fees I'm going to have filing for divorce and full custody, I barely had enough to get by BEFORE all this happened.  Daycare centers are $2000/mo, and I already checked don't have any immediate openings, and I haven't been able to find a nanny on care.com for less than $15/hr.  I had a nanny, but it was a friend of my wife was was being paid with the meager income my wife had. She quit abruptly and I can't use my wife's income to pay for another.  I'm trying not to panic, but what can I do? It's going to take me some time to scale back my modest expenses (moving, primarily). I just moved here, so I don't have any friends who could help, and my family is too otherwise obligated and far away to help more than a week or so.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.	Yes
1094	Okay so I've been on my own for quite a few years now but all I have is my social security card. I just turned 18 few months back and I'd like to get my birth certificate, drivers license, and a credit card. However each of those things require one of the other to receive (ex. Need a drivers license to get a birth certificate, need a birth certificate to get a drivers license, need a birth certificate to get a credit card, etc.)  Please any advice is welcome, I'm going to need to get a job and find a house of my own by the end of the year and I can't do that without all of the above... help!	Yes
1095	About 20 years ago I divorced my husband. Since I was a stay at home mom during our marriage I was awarded the equivalent half of his retirement for the years we were married. The stipulation was I couldn't cash it in until I reached retirement age. Well that age is approaching in 2 weeks, so I would like to start the process, but I have no idea where to start. I no longer live in the same state as he does and cannot find a copy of the original divorce decree.	Yes
1096	Long story short, I met a woman on reddit from India, we have been talking for months, and well obviously hit it off. We decided it may be best for her to come to the US so we can get married, and so she can get treatment for a particularly rare mental illness. As I understand it the best way to do this is on a K-1 visa. Now here is my question. How do I go about proving that we actually have a relationship? We have been communicating on Skype for a few months, but I would really not want to print out those transcripts because it talks a lot about the mental illness, as well as other personal things. I am going into my senior year of college, and can't really afford a lawyer, although should be able to pick up a job in a years time. This is also hopefully, when this plan would come into place. Still would prefer to not hire a lawyer because of the expense however. Should I make a new Skype, and only talk to her there about things we wouldn't mind being printed out, and used as evidence of a relationship? Can customs ask to see her phone, and look through everything? I know I am supposed to meet her in person once for the K-1, and when I do I will make sure to take plenty of pictures. Anything else I can start doing now, before next year?	Yes
1097	I am an American married to a Canadian, and the marriage is not working out. A year ago we got married in the state of Ohio and I moved up to Canada with him. He is a Canadian citizen, and I an American citizen with permanent residency in Canada.  I wish to divorce and move my possessions and automobile back to the states. However I have a few questions about what will happen / how to handle the situation.  1. Do we have to divorce in Ohio where we were married, or am I able to file for a divorce at my current residence in Canada?  2. How will the border likely handle me bringing my possessions back into USA? I have a fair amount of goods that would be returning with me. 3. Will this null my permanent residency as I gained it through marriage? 4. What other effects will this possibly bring about?  5: rough estimate of cost?   If anyone has useful information about any of these things I would greatly appreciate it. Cheers!	Yes
1098	In 2005 I had a child with my Ex -- things were not very smooth in the custody process. My ex had primary custody of my daughter up until about 2012 when the state removed the children (she had other children with another father later on) from her due to allegations of abuse and neglect.  In 2012 I was granted sole custody and have maintained sole custody since. The child abuse allegations never came to fruition and she ended up getting all her children back aside from my daughter who is now 12 years old.  My daughter has consistently seen a therapist throughout the years and still suffers from PTSD and has on multiple occasions told the therapist about the abuse she endured (mostly at the hand of my Ex's current husband). Every therapist that she has seen (they have changed as we moved from Montana to St. Louis for a year and then again moved to Colorado about 2 years ago -- all work related moves), all agree that it's in the best interest for my daughter to stay in my custody.  There is a parenting plan in place currently that allows for phone contact. These phone conversations tend to last no more than 10-15 seconds as my daughter has no interest or desire to talk to or be with her biological mother, and in fact gets anxiety from having to have any communication at all.  I have now received certified documents showing that her biological mother is filing a motion to amend a final parenting plan that includes giving her full custody of my daughter, as well as seeking attorney fee compensation, with very little visitation granted to me.  My current plans are to get an attorney here in CO and have the case transferred here as she (my daughter) is a resident here, and has not lived in MT (where this all originally started) in almost 4 years.  Anyone with experience in this kind of situation? How high are the chances that the mother gets what she's seeking?  Asking here, because it's going to take some time to speak with an attorney directly as the weekend approaches and I'm hoping to ease my anxiety.  Thanks!	Yes
1099	Hi everyone. I don't know who to go to for this but my parents have been married for 31 years and are discussing divorce. No one has cheated on anyone but they have been miserable for years (almost daily fighting for the past 17 years). And frankly, my mother is extremely emotionally abusive.  They have a house and lots of stuff but they are in more debt than the house is worth (they refinanced when the house was worth $200,000 more than it is now). My mother is trying to tell my dad that she will keep everything other than a couple things she has no interest in (like his workout equipment).  They live in California and have no minor children (three adult children - one of which lives with them).  I believe they should sell everything they can sell (they have lots of expensive furniture and antiques), including their house, to minimize their shared debt as much as possible and split the debt that is left over and go their separate ways. I don't believe my mother can make the mortgage payments anyway (she hasn't in months and months) and they have a tax lien on the house. But I have no experience or training in this field.   I am worried that my dad doesn't have enough knowledge to know what he can reasonably ask for / expect in his divorce. Neither of them can afford legal representation so my mom is banking on that to get everything she wants.  ***Most importantly,*** I'm concerned because my mother has made the majority of the mortgage payments the past 8 or so years after my parents left their well paying professional careers. It is important to note that my dad's contribution to their marriage is not less because she made more mortgage payments after their bank accounts were separated - he raised the kids, cleaned the house, took care of the pets, did all of the grocery shopping, all of the cooking, took us to all of our doctors appointments, emergency room visits, took care of the house, all of the cleaning, literally everything other than the majority of payments were done by him our whole lives whereas my mom took over as majority breadwinner the past 8ish years (all bills were shared beforehand). I'm concerned that this financial record will give her the say in what is done with the house and most of the things they bought together the past 31 years.  Any and all advice is super appreciated!  Thank you! From a daughter who wants what is fair.	Yes
1100	"Orange County/Osceola County, Florida  The father decided to jump the gun and instead of waiting to receive the paperwork to claim paternity through DCF (I'm on government assistance) he hired a lawyer. He did this because I wanted to go through custody hearing before he could see the child. (I know him well enough that he would try and snatch the child away.) I am not sure how to add photos/docs, so I'll try my best to explain. I get an email July 19th, showing I have been summoned. ""A lawsuit has been filed against you. You have 20 calendar days after this summons is served on you to file a written response to the attached complaint/petition with the clerk of this circuit court, located at: Orange County Courthouse, 425 N. Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801. A phone call will not protect you. Your written response, including the case number given above and the names of the parties, must be filed if you want the Court to hear your side of the case.""  The lawsuit was filed July 7th. I did not know the lawsuit was filed until the 19th when the lawyer sent me an email. 12 days passed. The address they have on the file is not my address. So if I was served, I would have no idea I was. Now I have to have a written response by the 27th. I sought legal aide in Orlando, FL on the 21st, but it was going to cost me $1 a minute. I did not have money to pay for legal consultation. Tomorrow I'm going to another legal aid location in Osceola County, FL, but just in case I am unable to get any help by July 27th, how would I write a response? Is there a template out there that could help me out?  A few other questions.  1.His lawyer wants me to pay legal fees (""Petitioner has employed the undersigned attorney to represent him in this action and has agreed to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Petitioner is financially unable to pay said attorney or the costs of this action, but Mother is well able to do so.""), but how would I go about not paying that in case I have to end up self-representing? I am on gov. assistance unemployed with no bank account nor assets, and the father has 2 jobs. Also, I have been diligently searching for work, I'm so desperate I've applied to Mcd's and Wendy's. My indeed profile has showed I've applied to over 140 jobs.  2. How would I go about not sharing 50/50 custody and only doing visitation? I don't want to sound like a b-word, but I really do not trust him to be alone with a baby. I have text messages, voicemails, video, and witnesses as proof regarding his behavior. (He gets up and goes to sleep smoking weed. He drives erratically under the influence without a seatbelt. He has been in 3 car accidents in less than 3 months. He started a fight at a Target. He threw money at my face to get an abortion, grabbed me by the collar and threw me on his bed then proceeded to sexually assault me. He cursed out and almost started a fight with a mechanic who was working on his car after one of the accidents because the bill was $140 more than he quoted. He showed up at the hospital as I was walking to go to the elevator to get an ultrasound to be induced and refused to let me get on the elevator, security was called. He gave me an STD and proceeded to have sex with women while having sex with me - unbeknownst to me until I ""hacked"" into his phone. He had a felony for domestic battery. The list goes on.)  3. I am really having a hard time finding employment. Before I found out I was pregnant, I had a decent job in FL standards for someone without a college degree ($16.50 an hour). I think it's because I seem ""unreliable"" with an infant, they always asks why did I resign from my last job (Dr. told me to get off my feet). If I do not find something even minimum wage, part time, I am planning on moving back to my home state (CT) where it is easier for me to find a job, pay is better, and public transit in major cities is easier to navigate (different family members are going to chip in to pay for airfare and a friend has an extra bedroom rent-free if need be). How would I go about presenting that to a judge? I just started applying for jobs in CT, should I wait until I have a definite yes before I present the out of state move?   I am sorry for the long text. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
1101	[Virginia, USA] Throwaway.  I do architectural surveys and while I was on one, I saw what I think is evidence of child neglect.  Ant infestations everywhere, the child's feces in the trash can (like they were using it as the toilet. not cleaning up an accident), trash on the floor throughout the home (that they rapidly tried to clean up while I was there), stains, and otherwise disarray.  Obviously I want to help the kid.  But I'm I concerned about being there because I was on the job.  I know I'm not a mandatory reporter by Virginia's standards, but if I do report I can remain anonymous with the reporter (and that I'm protected on the report even if I do give them my name and information unless the court wants me to testify).  But I'm concerned the mother will know it's me (since I don't know how many other strangers came into the home) and try to get me/my company in trouble.  My boss is not particularly understanding.  It's a small family business, and I'm debating even telling him about it if I do report.  I believe I am protected from retaliation for this, but I'm not sure how far it goes.  What is my best course of action to legally protect myself while also reporting this to CPS?	Yes
1102	"My ex-wife has agreed to reduce the amount of monthly alimony I give to her.. courts.ca.gov says:  ""If the spouses or domestic partners can reach an agreement on a new amount of spousal or partner support, they can write it up as an agreement/stipulation and give it to the judge for signature to have it become a new court order.""  I cannot seem to find anything that really explains how to DIY this process.  Any suggestions?  thanks!"	Yes
1103	"Looking for advice/a restraining order. This woman has done nothing but torment my wife and my children and constantly enrage me. Wife has said she'd take care of it multiple times, but she still hasn't, years later. Now I do have some idea of the time-frame of the following events, but not all of them. Some of them were last year.  Here's a fun story about my Mother-in-law:  12/2015 It comes out that she's been cheating on her husband for ~3 years with her husband's best friend, it comes out her daughter did the same thing for 4 months. Threatens his life multiple times to everyone who'll listen, for five months lies to everyone around her about the whole situation because of ""what he did to both of them"", comes out that she's still seeing the bf, divorces husband and marries bf so he can get his green-card.  -Multiple times has run up to my wife in the store, immediately berating her over not letting the kids come around anymore. Kids now refer to her as ""scary monster lady who yells a lot"".  -Corners my wife when she goes to pick up the kids at her grandmother's house, again immediately barging into the house screaming at the wife.  -We literally move an hour away, just to be in a different area  where there's ""no chance"" of seeing her or bf ever.  -Wife graduates college, specifically tells friends, family, etc. not to even tell her mother about it, so obviously MIL shows up but hangs around in the back so nobody sees her until halfway through, then nobody tells me because they know exactly how I'd react. Thank god for family, right? Wife breaks down about it later. Great job guys.  8/2/17 0915 Shows up at my front door, knocks, gawks at my daughter, then son as I'm coming out of restroom. Is already almost in her truck by the time I reach the front door. Pulls out in a hurry. Kid says ""why was monster lady here? I thought she couldn't find us anymore.""  She has been told on all of these occasions by my wife and I both to stay away from my family to the point that she knows what we'll say before we say it. She is consistently and actively harassing, stalking and taunting us causing us to have to watch over our shoulders when we go out, as a result not really wanting to go anywhere. Would love for this bullshit to stop and for this bitch to stop getting away with trying to insert herself into our and our kids' lives. It's disgusting and disrespectful and I wish she'd drop dead.  **TL;DR** Need crazy MIL to stay away from my family."	Yes
1104	My husband has no name of father on his birth certificate and his mother has passed. We found[ this document](http://imgur.com/a/Peunt) among her things. We believe that the letters in section A stand for Bureau of Vital Statistics, and that CSE is likely Child Support Enforcement. My husband emailed someone who was initially trying to look for records but then couldn't find anything and didn't reply when the document itself was sent.   My question is - is it worth it to go there in person with the document? Would they actually be legally allowed to give my husband any information, particularly if this was his mother trying to get child support from this person unsuccessfully?  Alternately has anyone seen a similar document? Are we incorrect about what it is? Can you think of why it seems there are two documents sort of scanned on top of each other it looks like?  Any help is appreciated. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post.	Yes
1105	My parents have always had a rocky marriage, and my dad was (and is) extremely verbally abusive and controlling.  Mom stayed for many complicated reasons, the primary of which is that she worked in ministry, and divorce at the time would have required her to take an unpaid leave of absence (and been a potential career killer).  They are now both retired.  Throughout their marriage, Mom was the primary wage earner, as Dad sabotaged a variety of jobs through (surprise) bad attitude and behavior.  She was also the primary homemaker and caregiver for my sister and I (now both adults).  Dad was verbally and sometimes physically abusive to us as well (think taking corporal punishment a step too far). She has a substantial pension, life insurance, and a significant inheritance from her aunt and uncle, and co-owns the house my parents live in (though the down payment all came from her).    Furthermore, my dad has a history of TERRIBLE spending decisions.  Pyramid schemes, miracle supplements and cures, fake investment opportunities, flat-out scams... you name it, he's thrown money at it, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.  (Most recently he handed over all their banking info to a guy claiming to be from a tech support firm that would provide better security...than the bank. $8k vanished before he was finally willing to admit he'd been had, and then he tried to blame the bank.) And of course, he hassles her about every penny she spends (including recently pitching a fit because she bought my daughter a watercolor paint kit for all of $12.)  My mom recently consulted a lawyer about divorce, and while she wants to ensure he has enough to live comfortably, she was alarmed to discover that NJ law is such that Dad would automatically be entitled to half of all their assets.  She is balking now at leaving him, because she is convinced (for good reason) that he would blow through all of it and leave nothing for the kids/grandkids.  Plus it is just deeply upsetting to her that after all her hard work and his poor treatment of her, he would get half of everything she earned as well as half her inheritance from her family.  Does she have ANY options for moving/reallocating even some of that money to keep it out of his hands? I would hate for this to be the reason she stays with him.   TLDR: Mom wants to leave Dad, she earned/inherited most of their assets, he's a controlling jerk who's terrible with money, any way to keep him from getting 50% of everything in a NJ divorce?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
1106	My older brothers house was raided by police. He has 2 kids which were taken into protective services. Right now I guess he is being charged with burglary, theft, possession of an illegal firearm, child abuse , possession of controlled substance. His wife is being charged with receiving stolen property, and possession of illegal substance. According to my younger brother who was staying there and witnessed the whole thing, all that was in the house was stolen stuff, and 3 meth pipes. Now I love my brother very much and I want to do what I can to help, but he's in Nebraska, and I'm in California. I don't think he can afford a lawyer so I was wondering if I could hire a lawyer from here to defend him in another state. I also want to see about taking custody of his kids while this all gets sorted out. Wtf do I do?There is more, but I'm on my phone right now.	Yes
1107	First off- I don't believe there is anything nefarious going on (such as sexual molestation).  I do have a lawyer from my past custody issues, but he is currently not on retainer.  Before I take it there, I want to know if I'm overreacting, and if the family court will even care.  I know that co-sleeping is not illegal, and it is not in violation of our current parenting plan.  I have two sons (7 and 9) and have been divorced for 5ish years.  My current issue is that my ex-husband is co-sleeping with our nine year old.  My son sees a pediatric psychiatrist for ADHD, and in mentioning it to her, she believes it's unhealthy and detrimental for his development.  I think it's also unhealthy, and given that my son is in the beginning stages of puberty (and the fact that he's not a toddler), the co-sleeping situation to me is just flat out weird.    I've been discussing this with him for months, since March 2017 that I have written proof of (we communicate via Our Family Wizard).  I understand that transitioning him to his own room can be a process, but given that it's nearly August, I feel that this process should be completed at this point.  He's full of excuses and he doesn't think it's weird or unusual in the slightest.  I believe that my ex-husband is lonely and very co-dependent on our children, which is also unhealthy.  Having my son in his room at night is likely a crutch for his emotional instability.  Will family court even address this?  Thanks.	Yes
1108	"Ftp, on mobile, please excuse formating.   I need some family law advice. Here's the situation: me (37f) was named god mother to 2 lovely young women when they were born. Now the younger of the 2 (17f in AR), is working 2 jobs as a Senior in HS, lost over 10% of her body weight in just 3 months (140 -&gt; 110) and still losing, she losing hair, doesnt sleep. Shes helps pay rent, buys school clothes for herself and younger sibs, and buy groceries. Her mom (the one who named me godmom) works while her POS step dad doesnt. Im terrified that if I cant get her out, she may attempt suicide because (and Im quoting here), ""I dont wanna live anymore."" Added complication, I live in a different state. What, if anything, can I do?"	Yes
1109	"I went with a friend to his custody hearing yesterday, and I have an odd feeling about the situation.  He had cancer 18 years ago, and has been on SSI/SSDI after they overdosed him with Chemo and he was paralyzed. After years of physical therapy, he can now walk short distances with a cane, but is still very limited and had his disability reviewed/reapproved just 6 months ago.  During the case the Judge has been pressing him by asking things like ""Well you can still sit at a desk and answer phones right?"" And now she wants to see his Soc. Award because she is considering ordering child support based off of minimum wage instead of his actual ~$700 full disability income.  Is this a violation of the ADA at all? He was declared disabled by SSI/SSDI, but can the judge overrule this and charge child support because SHE thinks he can work, even though he has a full disability declaration?"	Yes
1110	I need help, more accurately my grandma needs help. She is getting evicted at the end of August. She has had my mother staying with her. My grandma is the sweetest little old lady and can't see that my mother is a leech. My mother hasn't paid rent, she doesn't clean, she does nothing to help my grandma. She has the money to help get my grandma from being evicted but is just letting it happen. My mother is paranoid. Is manic depressive, and has bipolar all untreated. She is a leech to the point her own father wont take her in and he has done it once before.   I want to know if there is anything I can do to get my mother away from my grandma or to make her pay up. I would prefer to remove her from my 73 year old grandma.   I would rather have my grandma hate me over her supporting her daughter till she passes. My grandma also still works. My mother should be supporting grandma not the other way around.   I also live in albany, ny. They are on long island. I have a month to do something. If you need more info just message me please and thank you.  (Not sure if tag is right but I'm not sure what this would fall into)	Yes
1111	I'm asking for my brother-in-law. His wife wouldn't let him in the house last week, so he stayed at his mom's house and my house. Yesterday, after the fifth day away from home, he decided he would just go back home. His wife and 2 year old daughter were at a friends house. She let him come get the daughter so he could spend time with her.   He kept her at the house last night and his wife stayed at their friend's house. Wife is now wanting to come back and take the daughter and keep her for the week....which would mean dad only got to see her for one day in a two week span.  He wants me to come over and be in the house when she shows up...no idea what I would do.   He wants to keep the daughter at home with him (I'm obviously biased, but I think he's the more responsible parent). Would it cause problems if he packed up some bags and came to my house or went to his mom's house? Would that be twisted into some sort of kidnapping type situation when the divorce proceedings *do* start?  She has made it clear she has no desire to preserve the marriage. Neither one has sought legal council yet, but I have told him to quit calling me and call a lawyer. Right now I'm just looking for a quick answer to what will go down today.	Yes
1112	So basically she has been with this guy on and off for like 8 years now. She has broken up with him like 3 times now, but he always finds some way back in. I know he smokes weed and cigarettes. Sometimes he will use mine and my little sisters bathroom (I'm 16 and she's 13) to take a crap and smoke. He has taken my things and sold them when I was younger and seemingly convinced my mom he didn't do it. He is a previous sex offender but is off parole. He also used to do drugs. He just got back out of jail and a got back together with my mom recently. He always acts like he owns the place.   The point of this is I have told my mom time and time again to kick him out or I am gonna leave. However since I'm only 16 and she claims I can't. My whole family knows he's a dick. Am I able to go stay with a differently family member? Can I file some kind of restraining order against him? What are the legal issues with this whole process?	Yes
1113	My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.  My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?  Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.   I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!	Yes
1114	I have a friend who is a minor who lives in the UAE (united arab emirates) whose parents just divorced. They are all citizens of the US and not of the UAE. There may be some up-coming custody issues and what court system they would take place in would completely change the outcome. So the question is where would the decision take place? In the US where they are citizens, or in the UAE where they live most of the year?	Yes
1115	Hello,  My father recently found out about trips his spouse has taken with another man. He received travel documents. I am wondering how asset division would work in the case he filed for divorce under adultery in Alberta.  They have been married for about 10 years. Previously, my Father owned a house with about 150,000 in mortgage equity. He has since refinanced his mortage twice and has a little under 100,000 in the house. This money was primarily used to pay off debt associated with businesses his wife started. This included planning, construction, etc, of said establishments.   How would the business assets and house be distributed in such a divorce? The equity in the house is less than before the marriage, does that mean the wife is not entitled to the house, and must give up some business assets?  He wishes to part amicably, I'd just like to know how this would go if it got dirty.	Yes
1116	"This is a non contested divorce, we no longer live together and here shortly I will be moving to the opposite end of the country. She refused to sign the papers earlier and now I was wondering is my presence in front of a Judge (in the jurisdiction of where we previously lived) still necessary?  Her excuse (via text message) was, ""I refuse to sign the papers until you find somebody who loves you."" In other words, to be manipulative."	Yes
1117	Current location: Colorado  Original birth certificate: Virginia  Name change:  Illinois  During a recent move, my birth certificate got destroyed.  To do some recently-moved legal things in Colorado, like switch my license, I need to order a certified copy.  Do I need to contact the Virginia vital records for my original birth certificate, or do I contact the Illinois vital records because an Illinois judge signed off on my name change?  Thanks!	Yes
1118	Hello /r/legal advice, I am an emancipated minor in the state of California. I had my hearing in June and the judge granted my petition - I have all of my legal documentation. I also have a passport card I got when I was 14. I'm visiting my godmother in San Diego and I'm thinking of spending a day in Tijuana. Will being 17 but emancipated pose an issue?	Yes
1119	I left NY to go stay with family out of state for what I originally thought would only be a few days (due to extremely unhealthy fighting with my fiance.) I'm realising now that the relationship isn't salvageable. I have my child with me as I'm a stay at home mom. I would have to stay in PA with family as I don't have a place to stay in NY. Do I have to file for custody in NY since that's where I lived or do I file in PA since that's where I'd be moving? I appreciate the advice.	Yes
1120	I'll try to keep this short and keep as little reference to names or job titles as possible. Basically, about 6 years ago I met a girl who had semi-famous parents and I ended up marrying. During the course of our relationship, I suggested starting a YouTube channel and various social media with her father who was a professional athlete. My intent was to build a brand around it under the idea that eventually my wife and I would take over once they retire and that we could live off of the fame and publicity (my wife also became a pro athlete after I convinced her to let her father mentor her). Everything was fine, until she decided it would be a good idea to cheat on me and move to a completely different state with the dude randomly. I waited and tried to reconcile with her for over a year with no luck and it tore me up extremely badly. She also ran off with the majority of our assets and money and left me with very little. So not only did my wife disappear over night but also my career. She and her family also refused to give me my filming equipment back until just recently we had it court ordered back to me next month. Over the period with the drama between my wife and I, my in-laws approached me about buying me out in both person and through text. I informed them that I still wanted to wait and see if my wife returned before I made any big decisions, and I was also concerned about whether she would try and claim it as community property or not and if I would get in trouble for selling before we reached a settlement. Everything was created before we were married, so that's not the problem. The problem is that eventually they texted me wanting to buy me out still and after consulting with my family lawyer they thought that if I could get an offer that we could draft up a contract that would legally absolve any possible right my wife had to the stake in IP and social media. I asked them to give me an offer and they did not. After a couple of weeks I was then informed that they were suing me and placing a restraining order against me (even thought I had not voluntarily contacted them in over a year). Since we were family, we had no formal contract- But the agreement always was that I kept the revenue from the channel in exchange for building her dads fame and increasing his value  (which it did EXPONENTIALLY). The YouTube account and all contracts associated are all under my name. The Logo was also created by me and I have all original photoshop, sony vegas, and over 7 TB of footage and pictures to show my ownership- But hiring an IP lawyer is going to cost me a minimum of a $20,000 retaining fee. And I have very little money thanks to my wife taking everything with her and my inability to get my equipment back to be gainfully employed normally. I feel like they are trying to back me into a corner so that I settle for much less than it's worth or just give it up. But this is the last 6 years of my life work and I would prefer if I could at least get some startup money for a future venture of my own so that I can start new. What should be my next step? We're talking potentially millions of dollars worth of value in assets and I know that he is feeling the hurt and pressure from his sponsors otherwise he wouldn't be trying to get it so badly. Especially given the fact that he always belittled my work and acted as if it had no actual value to him (even though he always wanted to continue doing it).   Hopefully this is easy to understand. This is a throwaway account just for the record because I'm not sure if names getting out would hurt me or just them.	Yes
1121	"Sorry I've never poster in this sub so not sure if this is the right place.  My wife and I use to work together at the same small company years ago. I left there about 3 years ago for another job and my wife still works there. The company owner is a nice person but he used to do some subtle shady shit that made me think he was scamming people. A decade ago he asked me to photoshop and change some information on a contract that had already been signed by someone. Other weird things.  Anyways.  My wife calls me the other day to tell me what had happened at work that day. Her and another co-worker were trying to remember the owner's middle name because he was really embarrassed of it and they thought it would be funny to put it on some gag gift, so they started googling his name to see if it would pull up. On the first page of results, it showed some marriage records stating that the owner had just gotten married in 2006. Um thats weird. Owner, has been married to his wife since the early 90's. They even have two kids in college. Everybody at that office knows his wife (who is a financial planner) and she is very active at office events and friendly to everybody. Some of the older employees even went to their wedding in the 90's. She is very sweet and they are very loving to each other and don't seem to have any major problems in their marriage.   Scrolling down in the google results she finds divorce records for them in about the year 2000. My wife's co-worker starts to remember that years back, when she would check the office mail, that the owner would receive child support payment notices and she never really thought about it at the time. Everybody in this office is very close and would know if the owner had divorced his wife and remarried to her years later. My wife brought this info to her manager who has been an employee there since the owner started the company. She had been at their wedding in the 90's. She had house sat for them during this time they would have been divorced. Me and my wife even house sat for them while they would have been divorced. My wife's manager was weirded out about this whole thing and told her to delete her search history and not bring it up to anyone else.  So to get to my point: We are pretty sure the owner of this company and his wife (who is a financial planner at a large financial company) officially divorced on paper, kept living together telling no one, the owner paid child support to his ""ex"" wife to keep up appearances, and then secretly re-married on paper years later telling no one.   Is this some sort of tax scam? How could someone benefit from being legally divorced on paper from their spouse while still actually being married to each other and then secretly re-marry years later? I can try to get more details if it helps solve this mystery. Thanks"	Yes
1122	What actions can she take? I tried looking up resources, but it seems like it's either the family court or calling the police. She's terrified for her life. Her mother doesn't have enough money to leave the situation.	Yes
1123	"I received a summons for divorce and it has a part that states "" for an order awarding plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and cost of suit."" What does that mean and what does statutory amount of Child Support mean? Any help would be great."	Yes
1124	"Hello! 21 year old girl here. I was assaulted by my ex-boyfriend at least 4 times in a single night. Went to the police and told them everything. In my ptsd therapy, I'm beginning to remember incidents that built up to the March event.  I've been trying to contact the police officer who documented everything, but sometimes it takes a while to hear back.   In the mean time, we wait for the legal proceedings. Its been months. I will testify to a grand jury, and one thing has been bugging me.   So much happened that night, but there were so much more that happened in the months that built to that. On the spot, I don't think i'll be able to remember all those details. Its been hard enough recalling them after my physical and mental state left the ""survival"" fight-or-flight response mode. Will I be allowed a paper full of notes into the court room? I left out a lot of details in the Restraining Order hearing, simply because i forgot a lot of stuff. The hearing was only a few weeks after the assaults.   I would do much better if I had notes with me, but is that even allowed? I've never been a victim in a criminal case before, much less a victim of domestic violence."	Yes
1125	"Someone I know is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this."	Yes
1126	"Our joint custody agreement was made in Texas naming me the primary custodian, which, in Texas, means I make the decisions about where my son lives, goes to school. Actually, I believe the term is ""conservator,"" rather than custodian. This year his father and I have agreed that my son will be living with his dad in Tennessee for the next year only.  The school (I have called them to confirm) is requesting that I get a letter notarized stating that I give primary custodianship to the father, because in TN whoever the child lives with has custodianship. I am not about to sign my rights away. The father and I have recently had an amicable relationship though he has made attempts in the past to get sole custody and I do not trust him. School is starting soon, so what are my options?"	Yes
1127	Pretty straight forward. I lost it and not sure what steps to take to get another one...	Yes
1128	I plan on doing a name change. What legal or non legal hurdles will I confront before/during/after this process? I would like to know as much information on this subject as possible. Any thoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.	Yes
1129	"My SIL has been in and out of homeless shelters with her 5 children, including my 2 nieces for about 2 years. She has asked us to keep my nieces for a minimum of a year until she ""gets her life together"". She currently lives in NV and I live in CA. She is willing to sign them over to us. I'd really like to put them on my insurance and enroll them in school. What do I need to do? I'm at a complete loss."	Yes
1130	Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I need help in a big way. It's a complicated story between me and my wife and children, but, I'm trying my hardest to remain in the relationship and I got us into counseling because I want to save the marriage. But I am not sure if I can deal with the abuse (pretty severe emotional abuse I believe is from a depression from past experiences) and so therefore I want to ask this question as a means of protecting myself should the worst happen. I put that out there as the background but don't want to get too into personal details about it and detract from the real question, which is how to sell a home I recently inherited but keep it separate from our joint marital assets in NYC.  I became 25% owner of a two family house, within an LLC, about 10 years ago in NYS, and became full owner after my mother died in 2017. I am now sole owner of the LLC and there is nothing else within the LLC outside of this 2 family home. I am interested in selling this this home within the next few months because it is a lot of work to maintain it, I have zero experience in home ownership and the place needs repairs, and each month it costs money which we don't have. I could manage to hold onto it and rent out both units, but really my wife wants to move into a better school zone for our children. Given all this, we are both interested in selling in the next 6 months. it's taken too much time and money from us.  My wife and I are going through hard times and I am not sure if we will stay together. I hope we do but I want to protect myself. As I understand it, since the property and LLC came to me through inheritance, it is not part of the marital assets that gets divided with my wife should we divorce. However, if I do sell it I believe it can become co-mingled and become part of the martial assets that can be divided with my wife. I don't want it to be co-mingled and I would like to figure out what to do to keep this separated from our joint martial assets. Are people here familiar with this at all? What is the best way to structure the sale so that it remains with me and separate from the martial assets should we divorce? I heard that if I sell it I can keep the money from the sale in a separate bank account, not co-mingled in a joint account, as a way of keeping it separate, but I am not sure if this is true. Someone mentioned something about a trust to me but I had no idea what that meant and if they were accurate. I want to see what other options there may be. thank you very much for any help.	Yes
1131	Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.  I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.  Thank you all	Yes
1132	Mom is in CA, Biological father is in NV My parents divorced when I was young (I'm 38) in CA. My mom has the divorce paperwork stating the custody and child support amount for my sister and I, $300 a month. He has never paid and was locked up for 20 years begining when I was 11 or 12. He is a felon and has since been released and now live is NV. My mom was never on welfare and never notified anyone that he wasn't paying. She has talked to an attorney in CA who said she needs to contact a NV attorney.   My questions are...  * Is it feasible/realistic to go after him since so much time has passed?  * Is this something only an attorney can handle, or is there a way to file and let the state go after him? If she can file, where would she start?  * Since he is a felon, could this put him back in prison?  Thank you!!	Yes
1133	I was a misclassified 1099 employee by a company I was with for over a year. I am in the process of filling out the ss8 and I am 100% sure I will be ruled as being an employee. However, in that case I would like the state of IL to investigate overtime wages I have been due that amount to a little over 5k.   Can I file both documents at once?  Or should I wait to file the DOL wage complaint?  In my previous post about this issue I had someone mention I didn't have to wait to file the DOL wage claim but I would like to know how they'd be able to investigate or make a determination if I haven't been ruled an employee yet?   Thanks guys.	No
1134	I have a spouse who's an ALT(English teacher), and we're moving to Japan in the near future. I have a 16yo criminal conviction (non-drug related) that I'm in the midst of expunging, and I've been granted a dependent Visa.  Is it worth waiting for the expungement to go through before I fly, or is it safe to assume that the age and circumstances of my situation would make it a nonissue?	No
1135	So I was an idiot and signed a year's apartment lease without noticing that there was a notice that the building is being converted to condominiums at an unspecified date, and that we can be obligated to leave because of this. My roommate saw this and won't sign, and neither will her co-signer. Am I still held to this lease and responsible for covering all of the rent? The contract does not allow subletters. In the event that we can leave, are we entitled our security deposit back?  Los Angeles people, does this kind of notice to convert and remodel generally mean that demolition would occur during my lease?	No
1136	"Northern California, my friend rents the separate but shared wall basement of someones house. A family with three children live above her, not the landlords. My friend purchased and had installed her own separate washer and dryer, for which they pay utilities like water and electricity. The washer and dryer are in a shared garage, where the upstairs tenants park their car and my friend is allowed the washer and dryer and some space to store boxes.   My apartment complex just changed owners, and the laundry facilities here have been...iffy. It's hard to know when the laundry rooms will be open, and I have tried 3 times to add money to my empty laundry card to no avail. I have really bad dust allergies, so once a week is the minimum I can wash my sheets. I was complaining to my friend that I would have to spend hours at a laundromat and my friend, being amazing, let me bring my stuff over so I don't have to stress about when or where I can do laundry. In the past 2 and a half weeks she has let me come over 3 times- twice for sheets and clothes, which I run in the same load, and once for sheets from family visiting, which was two loads.   My friend actually caught me the other day almost going to a laundry mat because I don't like being an imposition, and insisted. Which brings me to yesterday. The upstairs neighbor, the husband, was loading his kids into their car in the garage and saw me loading my laundry. I said hi, he didn't really talk, so I finished up and went inside. My friend told me today they told the landlord she had let me do laundry ""3 times a week"" (her quote) and she is not allowed to let me do laundry there. Is this at all enforceable? Do her landlords have the right to limit her letting me use her washer and dryer when she paid for them, and associated utilities, in a shared space?   TLDR; My friend lets me do laundry in a washer and dryer she purchased herself, using water and electricity she solely pays for, in a garage she shares with other tenants, who have their own separate washer and dryer in their part of the house. Landlords say she can't let me do that."	No
1137	For the past few months I've had an issue with continuously being charged overages on my utilities each month. Even following my 2 roommates moving out, the overage charges remained similar to what they were before.   In July, my overages were charged for the entire month in only the second week. This leads me to believe that the utility company could be charging me based on extrapolating data.   Is this legal or standard practice? Is there anything I can do? My searches on google left me with little information	No
1138	My parents decided they wanted to move closer to their youngest grandkids. Before getting a realtor they asked their neighbors if anyone wanted to buy. One of their neighbors (let's call them the Smith's) was very interested. Due to some financing issues on the Smith's part, the moving dates were agreed upon fairly suddenly. Since my parents were building a house, they had to rent until the house will be done. They asked the Smith's if they could store some tools and other things in the outbuildings. The Smith's said it was fine. There was no length of time discussed, but the Smith's knew my parents were building, and that the house would likely not be finished until the end of summer.   My parents discussed storage with my sister, and found they were able to store some stuff in my sister's outbuildings. They made arrangements with the Smith's to get some of their items. When they got there, there were some areas blocked off that my parents had items stored in. They also found some big items missing (lumber, copper wire, etc). The Smith's claimed to know nothing. My parents packed up bins that were stored there that had tools and other items, along with the last of the machinery and brought it to my sister's house. When going through the bins, my dad found almost all of the more expensive tools he had stored in them were now gone (routers, heat  guns, etc). Again, the neighbors claim no knowledge. The latest, that had my mom in tears, when they tried to pick up my mom's garden art and planters, they're also missing. Many of these items were given by family over the years, and are irreplaceable.  A few points... -the house my parents sold is in the middle of nowhere. They lived there 20 years and never had anything stolen. -we've known the neighbors for many years. There have been a few issues here and there, but nothing to suggest they'd behave like this.  Is there anything we can do to get my parents stuff back (or replacement value)? Many of the items my parents were planning on using to work on their house. Any suggestions are welcome.	No
1139	A neighbor hired a contractor to come in my land and remove ivy plants that had been growing up my trees for decades. I've spoken to four arborists, and all say they don't value trees or plants, and that I have to ask the insurance company for a valuation. For obvious reasons, I'd rather have my own number going into this.	No
1140	"Nearly 2 years ago my husband and I signed a lease to rent a house. The owner of the home had contracted with a company to handle all the legal paperwork, collection of rent, repairs etc...The lease agreement stated that once the lease up after a year we can either sign a new lease for a year or it goes month to month.   Last year nearing the time the lease was going to be up for renewal, our contact at the rental company told us that the owner was ""considering selling the house"" and that we would be going month to month instead of another year long lease agreement.  We were ok with this.   End of the March 2017, a major hail storm sweeps through and most of the homes in our town had some sort of damage.  Our home had a window broke and enough damage to the roof that the ceiling right inside the front door was leaking and a small ( maybe an inch wide after 2 rains ) appeared.   My husband called the day after the hailstorm and left a message about the damage from the storm.   No Response.   A week later he calls again, brings up the damages from the hailstorm and also informs them that the day before this call the air conditioning unit had stopped working.  He is  told to use the website they have to inform them about the damage and to schedule repairs.   My husband did what they told him to do .   Someone did come out and tape heavy plastic up to cover the broken window and fix the pressing issues surrounding the air conditioning.   After that, nothing is done about the roof nor is the window repaired.   2 weeks later he calls again and gets a call back from the contact person informing him that our landlord wants to sell the home. If we want to buy it we have first right of refusal.  After maybe an hour long discussion we decided we didn't want to buy that house and we started to look for a new rental.   We were fortunate enough to find a home close buy that met our needs, contacted the rental agent, were approved with in a week.   We then went about and gave a 45 day written notice to our current contact at the rental company.  We also wrote a short paragraph on the contact website that stated while we were moving out we still expected to have the roof and window fixed.   While all this time has passed no one has come to fix the window or the roof.   We proceeded to move into our new home. We pack, we move, we clean, etc.... At one point the contact did come over to take pictures of the window and damage to the ceiling caused by damage to the roof. He informed my husband that they would be flying a drone over the house to access the damage.   3 days before our final day of the old house, we got a call saying someone from a carpet company was coming over to measure the rooms because the home would be listed for sale the week after we move out.  We let him in, it took a few minutes, and he left.    Our last day there we had the carpets cleaned , by a company we used before. Same guy came out, and we chatted before and I asked him about the quality of the carpets. He informed me I would be hard pressed to find cheaper carpets out there. I left the receipt for the carpet cleaning on the counter for the rental company to see that I had in good faith, according our our lease, had the carpets cleaned as we were moving out.   The window was still broken when we moved out. As for the roof being fixed, I don't know. I had gotten sick and wasn't able to go to the house for a week and half, so it might have gotten done in that time.  So now it's June 3, more than 2 months since the hailstorm.  We have moved out, and are awaiting our security deposit.  Halfway through the next month my husband checked the website that we used to contact the rental company about repairs, maintenance and pay rent, etc...  He sees a charge on there for $700 and some change, which we automatically assumed was for things I will admit were our liability. ( The carpet in my boys room did need replacing and they had accidentally knocked a hole in the wall which my husband repaired).   My husband called twice in the next 2 weeks, left messages for the contact to call him.   No response.   We finally received a security deposit statement not quite 2 weeks ago.   They charged $650 for touch up painting and repair.  They also charge $2175 and change for carpet replacement.   I now owe them money, allegedly.   I was shocked but I guess I shouldn't be.   I immediately googled my old address and the real estate listing came up. Lots of pictures attached. Not only has all the old carpet been replace, but its much nicer quality, and in rooms where there was no carpet. Also, the kitchen floor has had all the old flooring removed and new tile floors put in. The entire house has been repainted and the master bathroom tile floors have either been painted or replaced.  I should also had that in the years before we moved in, our neighbors had tried to reason with the rental company about an issue with the privacy fencing. 2 neighbors had to replace their fence portions and legally speaking ( according to them and town law) my rental company has to share the cost of the fence replacement. One neighbor claims she is owed a fair sum and they refuse to return her calls. One neighbor informed us as he was moving out that he spent years asking the rental company to replace our fence as it was an eye sore.   If you have made it this far, Thank You. I am sorry its such a long post. I do appreciate any and all advice. Is this worth filing on my own or lawyer-ing up, do I have a case or should I just role over and pay them the $1500 they are alleging I owe. Should I be concerned of the counter suing us for anything above and beyond what is stated in the statement, ie the fence which is now in amazing condition compared to the what it was the last 2 years."	No
1141	We hired a local company to redo our gutters. Our house sits on a hill so we were getting a lot of pooling in the back so they said they could reroute that water to the front of the house. They had both back gutters flow to one output they extended about halfway to the front of the house. We asked on two separate occasions if the water should be extended to the front. Both times we were told the hill was enough to continue moving it forward and it would all flow to the street. The first big rain which was overnight our basement flooded right by the output on the side of our home. Our basement is finished and so we had to pull the sideboards off and pull the carpet up. We purchased a dehumidifier and large fans and dried it out while spraying with bleach water to prevent mold. We let the company know what happened and they said it was because the guys didn't angle the gutter away from the house and claimed that was just a hard rain, which it wasn't comparatively. They said they wanted to make it right though and did extend the gutter to the front of the house, free of charge, and had one of their guys restretch and tack the carpet back down once it dried. They want now the bill paid promptly. Would we be within reason to also request 20% off this bill? Or less or more? We did have a lot of inconvenience due to this and money out of pocket. The company doesn't seem like they want to do anything else about it. Just wondering what others thought as I haven't dealt with something like this before! Thanks Reddit!	No
1142	"I've been living in my current building for two years and In the last five months the building has become infested with roaches, there are violent drug addicts that live in the building that have punched holes in the walls and puked all over the hallways, many people don't have working keys to their own apartments and the landlord hasn't done anything despite months of pleading with him. Beyond that, it's a six unit three story row house and 2/3 bedrooms don't have access to the fire escape because the middle windowless room has the second exit boarded up.   Yesterday my apartment was broken into and what estimates at $4000 worth of my belongings and cash were stolen. My neighbors bike was also stolen. I was at the beach celebrating my birthday and my landlord told me it's my fault I was robbed because I was not home. He was in my kitchen yesterday fixing a problem (after four months of begging him to do it) and he told me he saw my door open even though he knew I wasn't home. I suspect him of course, but I truly don't think he's THAT shady, but I suspect one of the shoddy shady as fuck people he hired to ""fix"" the problems did. The cops busted our door down a month ago and the man he sent to fix the doorframe did it so badly that you have to practically bodyslam the front door to actually lock it.   Due to the very illegal situation here and the fact that two tenets haven't paid rent in half a year everybody in the building has banded together and agreed to stop paying rent (we are all 25-30 years old with no kids and the ability to pick up and move but now we all have to save money to actually do it). I want to make sure we do this right and I'm no expert on my rights in this situation.   What can I do?"	No
1143	"So about a month ago I posted here asking about ""above and beyond"" normal wear and tear, and a landlord who kept a bunch of my deposit for ""cleaning"". I sent them a demand letter for the amount wrongfully withheld, prefacing taking them to small-claims if they refused. Their lawyer just sent me a letter, and in it he says they were being nice by charging me ""at a discounted rate for cleaning and repairs"", and if I took them to small-claims, they would counter-sue for the ""original, full"" amount. Like ""we charged you $100 for fixing a hole, but we'll come after you for $300"". My question is can they even do that? When they send you an itemized list of deductions from your deposit, isn't that amount ""final""? It doesn't make sense to me that a business like an apartment complex would be giving out ""discounted"" rates for recouping costs from damage and cleaning. It sounds like ""we're trying to sound like we are being nice to you, so you don't come after us for disputed charges"", almost a bullying tactic. He also added on several ""damages"" that were not accounted for originally, but that they would tack on in a counter-suit."	No
1144	"I bought a home (in Virginia) a month ago, and the home inspector that I used didn't see any of the red flags that where all over the house. There was previous water in the basement, there was mold already growing. We noticed water in the basement just last weekend, so we decided to take care of the issue, so we hired  water remediation company. They told my wife and I, that more than likely the previous owner knew that there was mold already growing. Brought a plumber because of issues, and he said that the plumbing work throughout the different sinks in the house was shoddily done; said he ""can't even imagine what's behind the walls."" I've been in this house for 29 days and I already regret my purchase and wish that I had not bought this house. If the inspector had told us about the issues, I would have not purchased this ""ready to move-in house."" Also, if the previous owner had not ""hid"" the mold issue, we would have not purchased this house. This purchase was made through a VA loan.   What is the best course of action? What are my options?   I want to at least get some money back from what I'm going to have to spend in order to fix the water and mold issues."	No
1145	Hi there! I live in Colorado and have a question about a security deposit dispute I'm having with my landlord. Colorado law states that SDs must be returned within 30 days, unless the lease states another period, which can be no more than 60 days. My lease stated 60 days.   I contacted my landlord (a company that owns a bunch of apartment buildings) on day 71 after my lease ended, inquiring where my security deposit was, as I hadn't received it. The leasing manager told me that it had been mailed out 30 days ago, and gave me the address it was sent to, which was wrong. I double checked that I had given her the correct address, which I had, and I let her know that it was mistaken. She apologized for the clerical error and said they would write me a new check and send it out asap.   I finally received the check in the mail 85 days after my lease ended, and found that they had taken out $134 from a $500 security deposit, and did not provide an itemized list of the reasons.   I'm planning to write a 7 day demand letter, since a) they did not provide me a list of the deductions taken, which is illegal, and b) CO law states that if the landlord sends the SD after the 60 day period, they are not able to take any money out of it.  I'm hoping for some advice as to whether the above checks out. I'm particularly wondering if the fact that they sent out the check within the window, just to the wrong address, at their own error, in any way negates the fact that they sent it late, or whether the fact that I received it 85 days after moving out is all that matters. Thanks for reading and I'd appreciate any insight, this is my first time dealing with something like this.	No
1146	Might be a dumb question, this is my first apartment. When our original lease ended we agreed with our landlord to keep living here and paying month-to-month the same amount. Our AC is out and since we are not currently on a lease does the landlord have any obligation to pay for it? He hasn't in the past since the lease ended.	No
1147	"Hi everyone,   This ended up being a longer recount than it probably needs to be. There’s a tl;dr at the end.   I like to think I’m a rational, reasonable and responsible person but my landlord has really been pushing me to my limits with this situation.  I have lived in my apartment since June 2013 with virtually no issues until now. All communications with my landlord have been over text regarding this specific saga unless otherwise specified.  My dishwasher broke on June 13.  He asked me to fix it myself and he would reimburse me. After doing some research, I think it was just the latch that needed to be replaced but I didn’t have the tools, nor the technical knowledge and confidence to replace it myself without messing things up more.  Two weeks after I told him it was broke, we finally arrangements for him to swing by my apartment to ""take a look"" requiring me to take time off work. He showed up with nothing but a motorcycle helmet and fumbled around trying to reinsert the plastic piece that snapped off and fell out. Clearly ill-prepared, he asked to borrow a measuring tape (good thing I had one) and measured the INSIDE of the machine and informed me that he would order a replacement.  About a week later, I asked him for an update with no response. I asked again the next day and unsurprisingly, he responded asking me to confirm the measurements. I gave him the measurements of the space and he said he would get a new one ordered. Again, a week later, asked him for an update with no response. A few days later, Saturday, July 8 I asked again he said that it was the weekend and he would have an update for Monday (without passive-aggressively informing me it’s Saturday). Of course, I did not hear anything on Monday. I texted him again for an update on Tuesday at which point he finally confirmed a new machine would be delivered that Saturday. He asked me to have the machine unhooked, unplugged and that it would be taken away. Again, I don’t know anything about dishwashers so I just shut off the water supply and flipped the switch in the fuse box.  Saturday rolls around and he texts to reminds me that the machine is being delivered and asks me to meet the guy in the foyer. I get a call from him to tell me it’s there so I head down. I meet the delivery guy and before bringing the machine up, he asks if I’ll be accompanying him to the other property. It’s obvious he thinks I’m the landlord and kindly inform him that I’m just a tenant and that I’m not going anywhere with him. He brings it up and starts walking out. I asked him about installing it and removing the old one. He said the arrangement was just to deliver the machine and to take it up with my landlord (he called to confirm this with his boss while standing in my apartment). Now I have the old dishwasher still sitting uselessly under the counter and a new one sitting in the middle of my (bachelor) apartment. I call my landlord to tell him what happened and he said that was not the arrangement and that he would ""try to"" swing by on Monday. Lo-and-behold, Monday (July 17) comes and goes with not even a peep from my landlord.  I give him a couple more days and so I finally text him this past Thursday outlining my frustrations regarding this scenario. This along with the fact that over the course of this transpiring, my toilet seat bumpers broke and now it sits flat against the rim. I asked him to replace this as well and was instructed to buy it myself and he would reimburse me. Given how long it has taken to replace the dishwasher, I have no confidence that I will ever see that money again. Not only that but my four post-dated cheques (the only reason why I still have cheques is to pay rent) were stolen out of his office that was ""broken into"". I don't believe there was any physical break-in because when I went to meet him to renew my lease at his downtown office, his office door was wide-open despite him responding he double-booked and left for another meeting. It would have cost me $12.50 per cheque to put a stop-payment at my bank so I just closed the account and reopened a new one requiring me to update all my direct deposits, withdrawals, etc. I said that I just want a functioning dishwasher again and that I didn’t want this to ruin our relationship as I do otherwise like living here In his text response, he acknowledged that we don’t seem to be getting along well. That he was renting under market value and while “happy to replace things like the dishwasher and toilet seat” that he’s looking for tenants to do more than “sit around waiting for everything to be done for them.” This is precisely one of the reason why I rent: I don’t want to be bothered to figure any of this out. He then went on to say he has no plans to re lease this unit after the lease is up, that he plans to sell this unit and that I’m welcome to leave before or at the end of my lease.  Note that other than saying he was happy to, he said nothing installing the new dishwasher, removing the old one nor replacing the toilet seat.  Again, living here has been relatively uneventful until now. At this point, all I want is the dishwasher to be replaced and to start looking for a new place to live (since no one wants to move in December…). What reimbursement/abatements am I entitled to? How can I get him to install it? If there isn’t anything I can legally do, what can I do to hire someone and make sure I get reimbursed for it? Is his text message saying I can leave before the end of my lease enough for me to leave when I want without me legally being required to pay through the end of the lease?  Tl;dr: Dishwasher broke on June 15. New machine delivered on July 15 and has been sitting in the middle of my apartment since then. How can I get him to install this? What abatements am I entitled to and how can I acquire it? I got a text from him saying I can leave before the lease is up if I want to. If I agree, is this enough for me to do so without any legal repercussions?  Thank you so much for taking the time to read and help me out!"	No
1148	I go to college in rural Missouri at a private school.  My school is creating a new residency building due to recent overcrowding during the first semester. I am one of the students who were supposed to move into the building (signed contracts at the end of last term), but we have just today been informed that the building will not be ready. I am now expected to live in an off campus 2 bedroom house with 7 other women (4 of them I have never met) for the first four weeks of school while the building is finished. This could be more or less time, we have never been given an answer on when the building would be finished.  We were told when signing contracts that there was a possibility that the building would be incomplete for the first week or two of the semester, but that has moved to four+ weeks.  The only compensation we will get is $125 for every four weeks that we are there. If we are there for less time we will not receive anything. Room and board included, it costs $38 a day to live on campus.  In addition to this, I don't have a car to get to campus.   Are there specific rules for college housing?  I do not want to live in a 2 bedroom house with 7 other girls.  I don't know 4 of them, and I have had problems with theft on campus and I don't trust living with people I don't know.  Is there a way out of this situation from a legal standpoint? Commuting is not an option for me as I have no car and my parents live 4-5 hours away.	No
1149	Location is Alaska. My friend is 17, his brother is 20. Two nights ago they got drunk and his brother beat the shit out of him multiple times. Brother would let him walk away, then go beat him up again. My friend eventually got away, went home and got his AR15. He then spent an hour or so hunting his brother, chasing him around town and shooting at him when he saw him. He chased him through the woods behind my house, heard him unload 40-60 rounds at his brother. He was blackout drunk so he missed every time. Troopers came in yesterday, couldn't find my friend so they left. He's still hiding out. What will he be charged with? Attempted murder and evading arrest? How long will he get when he's caught?	No
1150	"I am currently renting a 2 bedroom home with one other person. He rents this place as well, but he was living here before me. He rented the house and had an extra room that he decided he wanted to rent out. I am officially on the lease with the landlord of the house.  Now, after over a year, my roommate is saying that he wants me out. He's telling me I am moving out, I told him he can't kick me out because I'm on the lease, which he responded ""Not for long. Get your move out plan ready, because you're leaving."" This is over a personal issue, a total of three arguments we've had over the entire year and a half (same issue each time). This time he started out with saying that he doesn't like me anymore, we don't run with the same crowds, and he can afford the place on his own now since business is going well. Side Note: I spend most of my time in my room, out of the way. We don't communicate very often as we're more of acquaintances and not friends (he's right that we don't run with the same crowds). My room is a shitshow mess, but I keep common area's clean for the most part. Also, when I try to leave something in a common area such as the living room or bathroom he moves it back to my bedroom.   Since he was here first can he kick me out? The lease renews in September and I believe his strategy is to tell the landlords to remove me from the lease once the current one is up. Do I get any say in staying on the lease? I have been here for almost two years; he's been here about a year longer than me.  *I definitely would like to move out, but I don't currently have a job so I can't afford moving costs, security deposits, or first/last months rent stuff. I plan to move out as soon as I save up enough money, but my roommate is having none of that and trying to kick me out immediately.  I have paid rent on time every single month, and even without a job I have been keeping up with all of the bills. Can the landlords remove me from the lease without notice, if the current one is ending?  If I do get evicted at the end of this lease, is there anything I can do?  I am proactively looking for a new place, but again it is out of my affordability - I will end up homeless as soon as I lose this place. I live in San Diego, California."	No
1151	"I am a certified teacher and was offered a position teaching at a performance arts summer camp for 5 weeks for 2k. I could bring my child so it was really ideal for summer pay. Since taking the position, basically everything has turned out to be a lie. I was supposed to teach Pre-K. Instead I'm teaching PreK-2nd grade all in one classroom.  Okay cool, part of being a teacher is being flexible and making it work- I can do that. Also the number of campers was supposed to be 100, and instead there's 45 at best. We're also in a low socioeconomic area in my city where many of the parents just haven't paid and we're finishing week 3.  Payday is supposed to be this Friday with half of my pay due. I wasn't feeling very confident about her reliability with paying so I asked her today. She basically said she doesn't have it but has around 1/3 of it. Meanwhile we started with around 6 teachers and are now down to only 2 because everyone else has quit or was told the camp was ""closing"" because basically she couldn't afford to pay them.  If she doesn't pay Friday, I'm done. Both myself and the other remaining teacher will not be returning if she doesn't pay us. I've been flexible with a smile on my face and she's so worried about a final performance that it's literally trumping the fact that half the kids in the main roles haven't even paid to come to camp. What are my next steps to get paid if she can't pay us on Friday?  I'm also super frustrated because on the 4th she actually text me and said she was sorry but camp was closing (in reality she knew she couldn't afford to pay me). Then proceeded to ask me to come back 2 days later after I had asked my previous place of employment if I could be added to their schedule a few days a week. So now I feel like a fool but I really love the kids... help! :(  Tldr; I've been teaching at a camp that has basically turned out to be complete lies. I've taught for 3 weeks and now that we're nearing 1/2 of the pay days she ""doesn't know if she can come up with it"". What are my next steps if she says she can't pay me?"	No
1152	Hi guys, so here is the scenario. I took my car to get a free code scan to an autoshop (Goodyear). They gave a sheet with the codes and gave me the car keys back. When I went to my car, I found the car smashed in. I went inside and asked them what happened. The manager and the employee who drove my car denied the car crash. They said they didn't do anything and it was there already. I called the cops and then the manager made a claim through their company corporate. The manager told me that the company doesn't have its own insurance but it has a third party insurance. The manager told me that the car will be inspected and an estimate of the damage will be calculated. Afterwards the company will either have a body shop fix it or pay the amount for the damage depending who is seen to be at fault. He said that their insurance will be contacting my car insurance. He only said that my car's front bumper is damaged, when in fact i disagreed. The car's bumper is dented in; the grill came off; a part of the undercarriage frame is bent; car takes longer to crank up now. UPDATE: Goodyear's insurance denied the car crash and they denied the claim that was requested by the manager. The Goodyear insurance person said that the damage was not caused by the employees but it might have been one of their customers since they claim to have a footage from a nearby store. Here are the problems that I have with this: 1. This cannot go through my insurance, there are way too many claims (all no fault) on there already. I won't be able to afford a further increase for the car insurance. What can I do if they refuse to reimburse me from their insurance company? Would the next step be to go to small claims court?  2. If I take it to small claims court, how does the process work? and how would i get the amount for the damage the manager said there is and also the damage he said there is not?   3. Should I use these estimates as proof to claim there is more damage than the company agree to?   4. This is what i prefer: I want the company to pay for the damage and I want to fix it myself. Is this possible? What do I do to get them to pay me instead of fixing it through their body shop?  5. What should i do if they claim it through my insurance company? I don't want this  I know this is a long post, I am frustrated and confused. I don't know where to start, please give any information you think is helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read my whole post.	No
1153	"Alright, I've been working property management for the past 3 years. I've worked this property for just over the past year now. We've had disputes with multiple residents but they've been professional. There's been one resident who has consistently been a pain in the ass (called local news stations to spread a bullshit story, damages property left and right, and is confrontational with residents and employees alike.) My manager decided to search FaceBook for anything. She found a photo of myself posted by this gentleman. [FaceBook Post.](http://imgur.com/a/IzsVj) These injuries were caused by the couple running across a highway, 30ft south of a crosswalk with a stop-light for traffic, and tripping over a loose storm drain the city hadn't serviced. It was my first day on the property so I was unfamiliar with the residents. These two walk in looking like a mess, bloodied, and quite-frankly homeless. Nonetheless, I offered first aid, which prompted him to call me a nazi, told me to go fuck myself, then threatened to beat my ass if I helped. They proceed up the elevator, I learn who they are, and the story starts from there pretty much. Since then, he'll just film me getting in and out of my car, sitting behind the desk, and hell has waited outside the restroom door to cite me on taking over a 5-minute restroom break.  My company won't do anything about this guy. I'm personally tired of him terrorizing myself, my coworkers, and his neighbors. I'd like to know if with his actions, history, and this post what I can personally do to go after this guy. Even if it's slander or defamation of character since I'm trying to build a professional image and climb the corporate ladder. This is publicly out there and easily attainable. I wouldn't want a future employer to see anything like this, especially since it is beyond false. Comments on the post go on to say how I should spend a weekend at his buddy's house ""and never be seen again"" yada yada. I'm in Broward, FL, USA.

1154	My grandmother passed away in February. Originally, my aunt was supposed to buy the house (about 50% left on the mortgage). She has since decided to move to another state. My mother presented me with the opportunity to take it over instead.   We've been setting plans for my wife and I to move from Massachusetts (where we live) to Indiana (where my grandmother's house is).   I grew up lower middle class and my Grandmother is the only person my family to have a consistent living space for more than a few years. She had it paid off at one point and has since taken a second mortgage (im not certain on my terminology).   This has felt like a true blessing. My wife and I have even talked about starting our family. I never thought I'd be able to buy a house at 26, let alone my grandmother's house! It's been grandma's house since before i was born.  Today, a week from moving there, my mother found out medicaid took a lein on her estate.   Please tell me anything i can do. I'm so scared of losing my grandma's house. We are paycheck to paycheck people doing our best and this felt like the break that comes once in 3 lifetimes. My grandma worked hard her entire life for this house.	No
1155	"Hey guys, so I'm starting a new job and they're having me sign a non-compete agreement, and I had a few concerns about the wording of it so my boyfriend suggested I post here.   Firstly, I work in advertising, so a non-compete agreement is pretty standard I'm told. But there are a few sections that seem really unreasonable to me if I'm reading them correctly. I live in Tennessee if that matters. (I've also replaced the company name with XXX)  The first section:  'Employee shall devote all professional time and attention to the business of XXX. During the term of this Agreement, all persons from or for whom Employee solicits business or performs advertising, marketing, direct marketing, digital marketing or public relations services shall be clients of XXX, and all fees, commissions and other compensation for Employee’s services, direct or indirect, shall be payable solely to XXX. All clients, and all services rendered by Employee to or for all clients, shall be approved by XXX before any services are rendered by Employee to said clients. During Employee’s employment with XXX, Employee shall not render any services or engage in any activity which is competitive with or adverse to XXX’s business, either alone, as a partner, officer, director, employee, shareholder or otherwise on behalf of any other business.""  Does this mean I'm not allowed to do freelance work at all? I run a few networking groups for the online community that are fairly popular, and while I don't make money on them now, I could in the future. And as well, I often have people within the network who offer to pay me to consult them about their online brands, social media, etc. And on top of that, I have my own social media channels that I don't currently make money on, but might in the future. Firstly, is that not allowed? And secondly, do I have to disclose all of it to the company? and Finally, does this mean they could stake a claim to my personal properties online that I'm working on outside of work - like the networking groups I do social media for, my personal accounts that are creative/marketing based?   The second section: During Employee’s employment with XXX and for a period of one (1) year after Employee’s employment with XXX is terminated for any reason by either party, Employee will not, unless acting in his capacity as an employee of XXX in the performance of services under this Agreement, either directly or indirectly, on Employee’s behalf or on behalf of any other advertising, marketing, direct marketing, digital marketing or public relations agency, or in conjunction with any other person, firm or corporation, interfere with the business relationships between XXX and its employees, XXX and XXX Clients and/or XXX Clients and their employees by:  accepting employment with or doing free-lance work for another advertising agency, in-house advertising agency, media buying service, public relations agency, digital marketing agency or direct marketing agency in Tennessee, or influencing other XXX employees or XXX Client’s employees to do so.""  Further down it says:   ""Thus, it is agreed that, in the event of any breach of Subparagraph A or Subparagraph B of Paragraph 5 above, in addition to any other legal or equitable relief to which XXX may be entitled, Employee shall pay to XXX as liquidated damages for the breach thereof an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the gross income (including commissions, fees and retainers) received from any such XXX Client by Employee or by any other agency with whom Employee may hereafter, either directly or indirectly, be associated, for a period beginning with the breach of these provisions and extending three (3) years from the date of the breach of these provisions or from the date of termination of Employee's employment by CTA, whichever is the later.""  Does this mean that if I decide to leave my job or get fired for any reason, I'm not allowed to work in my field of expertise where I live for a year?! And if I do they'll try to take 50% of my compensation for 3 years?   My friends think I'm being overdramatic about this, but I really want to make sure I understand what this is saying before I sign it because I don't want to be in a situation later that could have been avoided. Any clarification or advice you guys can give is really appreciated!"	No
1156	"Earlier today roommate and I discovered that our landlord wedged a 6-7' long piece of wood to support a tree branch that is getting heavy. The wooden piece is in no way secure at all, simply wedged between the bottom of the branch and the ground. Upon inspecting the tree it seems that the branch is getting heavy and there is risk of it breaking off.  The tree in question is right next to our parking spaces and we are concerned that there may be significant damage to our cars if the branch fails. Now, first question: if the branch were to fall in this case, could an automotive insurance company refuse to pay out claiming it was an ""act of God""? Keep in mind the presence of the wood means that the landlord has identified a potential weakness in the tree.  We have spoken to the landlord about our concerns, and he says that he will tie a rope around the wooden piece and the branch to secure it. I'm not sure this would serve as a good permanent solution, as it would still be possible for a breakage to occur. So far he is unwilling to trim the tree to lessen the weight. In case the branch does fail, what legal recourse do we have? Would our landlord be liable for damages?   Any suggestions on how to deal with this scenario are appreciated."	No
1157	"I am in the process of gathering information to find an attorney to bring this up with, and I can't figure out what type of firm this fall under.  I am located in Oklahoma, the company I have an issue with is located in Pittsburg, PA, and has servers located in Costa Rica.  The developer in question I believe is also located in the new england area.  The issue involves an online game that has a MLM type incentive structure, you get returns based on the people under you. It also has a vibrant economy that has real world implications as to results of some games/minigames which are promised to be ""fair"" and ""random"".   Issue 1: The lead developer changed the incentive structure and cut the earnings from downstream in half.  He justified this as saying it prevents people trying to steal downstreams by profit sharing, as now he ""automatically"" gives the profit sharing back to the downstream. Even though some people did not profit share and so realized a very real 50% or more cut in income.  Issue 2: Over the past few years the developer has made many statements of things he would ""never do/wont happen"" that were then used to make economic choices, but then he does them a few months/a year later to the economic detriment of those who took actions based on his statements. Given that the lead developer and employees have not changed in this time period, it's felt he's still liable for the contradiction.  Issue 3: The lead developer has made several statements about the fairness/programming of some of the minigames in this game, that are either provably false, or probabilisticaly unlikely to be true, that has similar economic damage. While randomness is hard to prove/disprove, deviations can be shown on results in-game vs an out of game programmed simulation with the same ""rules"".  So my questions are:   1. What type of firm should i be looking for?  Civil litigation? Fraud?    2. What jurisdiction am I looking at/will i need to get a national/out of state firm or is it not an entire waste of time to check in-state consultations first?  Sorry if this just seems so basic, I just don't want to be wasting peoples time barking up the wrong tree. Thank you for the help!"	No
1158	Hi there.   Im leaving my apartment 2 months before the end of my lease and I have found someone else to take it over. If I had stayed my rent would have gone up 1.5% meaning for me it would have been an increase from 1260 to 1278. My question is would this still apply to the new tenant if they take over my lease or can the apartment management give him a totally arbitrary number for rent? He wants to sign for a full year but Im not sure whether he would be paying my protected price of 1278 after september or some higher number that the company would like to give.	No
1159	Australian, but all help is welcome. Tenants that have been living there for around a year and a half have been crying their clothes and not using proper ventilation causing mold. I've made many attempts to fix the issue, installing fans and creating more ventilation (have evidence) yet they continue to keep causing it. They plan on breaking the lease which in fine with but not so happy they are attempting to get compensation for this. I plan on getting local advice soon but please comment, all help is welcome. Additionally I have evidence that I have made many attempts to do right by this current tenants: painting the house, fixing things/paying for fixing things.	No
1160	I'm renting a house. The husband and wife landlords have been nice, though pretty hands-off and ... well I'd hesitate to use the word incompetent, but maybe lazy is a good word for it. I've had no real complaints aside from them taking forever to fix certain things (they want to get the best deal first), and it's time to renew my lease.  Technically my lease expired on July 1, but I don't think my landlords know that. All rent has always been paid on time and they like me as a tenant. I was wondering how to go about getting some amendments made to the lease.   What I want in new lease:  * Fixed chimney (power went out this winter and we couldn't stay warm since the chimney has never been cleaned and is likely a fire hazard; landlords said they'd fix in winter, still haven't done it)  * Pet amendment (we're interested in getting a small cat, maybe a medium sized dog like a golden retriever)  The advice I was given was to print off the current lease I have, staple on a page saying I'll cover a deposit for a pet to cover cleaning fees should something bad happen as well as some kind of page that details that the landlords should fix the chimney by a certain date. I'm pretty confident if I were to sign that and sent in to them they wouldn't think twice about just filing it away and never thinking about it.  Is this a reasonable course of action? Do I need anything notarized to make it official or is this seen as some kind of nefarious, subversive behavior that might be frowned upon?	No
1161	Hello Everyone,  I was moved to Pittsburgh by a company that I am interning with for three months over the summer. When moving in, we handed them a promissory note saying our internship dates and after that we are no longer getting paid. Due to this being my roommates and my first apartment, we were unaware we had to give them the 30 days notice because we thought we gave them the 90 days notice when we signed the 3 month lease along with handing the promissory note in.   We ended up handing in our official 30 day notice on the 20th, but they ended up switching us to a month to month lease, so we have to pay for the entire month. They apartment complex has a way of giving their residents mail by simply putting the letters in the doorways. They said they put multiple notices in our door, when in reality we only got one telling us about a change in office hours. My question is, I know that we made a mistake, but is there anything we can do since we handed in the 90 day notice? We were already paying a premium for the short term lease and as of the end of the internship, none of us will be working since I'm getting surgery and my roommates are going on vacation. Lessons were learned, but having to pay tuition and rent for my apartment near school, I would appreciate not shelling out $700. Thank you in advance.	No
1162	In 2000 I took out a student loan through my state, for $8500.  I have been going to school off and on since then, and have had periods of deferral or and payment.  To this date I have paid over 9000 dollars, and owe over 9000 dollars due to interest.  Do I have any options to not be continually ass raped by this aside from taking out a different loan with lower interest?	No
1163	So my wife and I took a weekend trip. The highway we took is one of the older highways that has a ton of little towns where speeds go from 65 down to 45 and back up again constantly. At one point there was a speed change that my wife didn't notice and she was also coasting down a hill doing 60-65 we aren't sure in a 45. The cop stops us an writes her a ticket for 70 in a 45. My wife is also in the process of getting a job where a clean driving record is a must. Is there any recourse we can take to ensure this doesn't make it to her record? She got the ticket this weekend and after months of back forth with a company she got the job offer today. It's her only ticket and no prior warnings either. The state is arkansas.	No
1164	"I moved into a townhome back in May with my three year old son. The company that owns the property is a nonprofit and the leasing office is responsible for two other properties nearby. The day I signed the lease, I did a move-in inspection with one of the women who worked in the leasing office. I wrote down all the items that needed to be repaired/replaced (weather stripping on the front door, broken porch light, washer/dryer inoperable, bathroom door off the hinges, etc.) and signed that as well. I really needed a place as my son and I were essentially homeless, and rent here is cheap being that the property is owned by a non-profit company. Since, in my opinion, none of the needed repairs made the home uninhabitable, I moved in anyway figuring they would be fixed later.   I've called the maintenance hotline multiple times, and they have come to my apartment to repair a leak so they are aware of what needs doing around here but every time I ask when are they going to fix my washer/dryer I get an arbitrary time frame (""the manufacturer technician will be there soon"" ""some time next week"", etc) but he never comes. I last spoke to maintenance two weeks ago but the last time they were out here was a month ago. At this point it seems they're either completely ignoring my requests or prioritizing other units over mine. Where should I go from here?  tl;dr I need a handful of repairs done on various things throughout my apartment that maintenance hasn't taken care of since I moved in back in May. What do?"	No
1165	I know in most states, a landlord has to give 24 hours before entering a rental property unless there is an emergency.  I am renting a room in a house.  I changed the lock to my room when I moved in and offered a copy of the key to my landlady.  She said she did not want it.  I am counting down the days until I leave this place and my landlady is starting to show rooms to potential victims.  Does Utah have a law where she has to give 24 hour notice before showing my room?	No
1166	Hey All,  Just looking for some legal advice on a mortgage that is under my name.  So here’s the story. I was renting an apartment until my cousin’s wife and kids wanted to move to Alberta from Hong Kong to go to high school, but they couldn’t afford the down payment on a house because the bank requires a 35% down payment since they do not have a Canadian income. They proposed that we buy a house together under my name so the bank does not require a 35% down payment. This idea sounded a win-win at the time because I was and still am willing to help them adjust to Alberta life and show them the ropes around the city and I would get to have a garage and live in a house with “family”. We ended up buying the house together and I lived in the basement while my cousin’s wife and two kids lived upstairs. My cousin remained in Hong Kong for his job and sends money over to his wife.  But after about a year my cousin’s wife completely shut me out without explanation. She stopped talking to me and put a lock on the door that separates the main floor from the basement. I confronted her about it and basically she said that I went upstairs too much and that we aren’t a family and they wanted their privacy and she wants to live in a separate house but they can’t afford it. After the confrontation she became more passive-aggressive by doing the following: leaving my mail in the mailbox when she checks it, bought her own laundry washer and dryer for the main floor (the original washer/dryer is in the basement). It seems obvious that my cousin’s wife wants her and her two kids to live entirely separate from me.  I contacted my cousin and told him I wanted him to buy me out, initially he agreed to it but now he is having money issues and even if he does buy me out I can’t get another mortgage for a condo because of this house. I also cannot transfer the house to their name because the bank requires them to buy the house from me and then they would need a 35% down payment again.  Living here has become stressful. The basement I live in is a lot worse than when I was renting and now I am stuck with a mortgage under my name so I can’t even buy a condo for myself I wanted to.  I feel like they used me in order to benefit themselves at the cost of my well-being  Here are some quick facts that I feel are applicable to the advice I am seeking:  * Mortgage is under my name only  * Mortgage payments are paid 50/50 (they pay me cash and I the mortgage comes from my account).  * They pay all utilities because there are more of them. Utilities are under my cousin’s wife’s name.  * The main floor is larger, has windows, and has better kitchen appliances. (I would love to live upstairs)  * They paid a higher portion of the down payment (65/35). They paid their portion through a bank transfer from Hong Kong.   I was wondering what legal options I have to get out of this situation. I was thinking that we should just sell the house and go our separate ways, but they won’t agree to it basically because they would have to down-size, live in a townhouse in a worse neighborhood etc.  Am I legally allowed to sell the house without their permission?   Thank you.	No
1167	My landlord sent me a letter saying they were terminating the lease, changing the locks, and throwing away any property in the room. Consequently, we left the apartment.  I sent a letter to my landlord, asking for my deposit back and for moving costs.   Their lawyer sent me a letter saying that they could still come after me for the rent in the future, and that they would not pay the deposit back. They claim they need to make fixes to the apartment, even though the landlord told us months before we moved they needed to make fixes to bring the apartment up to code. Is that legal?  Does it make sense to sue them for the deposit?  Can they terminate the lease and still demand rent?  Sense lawyers letter contained factual errors, can I make a complaint to the state bar association?	No
1168	I was arrested in Big Bend in May (Federal checkpoint) for possession of less than a half ounce of marijuana. After being fingerprinted, photographed and waiting in the cell for two hours, I was released. The judge didn't accept the case, they said. No charges were filed, no citations were issued. I signed no documents and was not asked to reappear at a future date. Without asking too many questions, I got the hell out of there.  &amp;nbsp;  Naturally, I became very concerned for my record, and looked into getting the record expunged. I called several lawyers, both in my city of residence, as well as a few in west Texas.  &amp;nbsp;  However, before I got far, none of them could even find the arrest in the system. I figured at least the court/county that denied my case would have record of it, but they didn't. I also checked the DMV database ($3 fee), and it brought up nothing.  &amp;nbsp;  Can someone explain to me why this might be?	No
1169	Posted in r/personalfinance originally   Not sure if best place to post, but have found help on this sub-Reddit before   My grandfather passed away this weekend and I have been off work since. My partner went to work on Monday but came home early and has since taken Tuesday and Wednesday off as well. Partially as she is upset and partially to support me.  Now, the thing is she has been temping at a company the past few weeks (in the uk) and she has been called this morning to be told she is no longer wanted as she is 'unreliable'   To me this seems wholly unfair, as she is taking compassionate leave, and if she had been asked to go in, she would have.  My question is, is this right? Is there anything that can be done here?	No
1170	I moved out of my apartment end of last month 6/29 the day before my lease ended 6/30. I notified the apartment almost 2 months prior to vacating that I would not be renewing my lease due to military relocation that happened to line up with the end of my lease. New forwarding address was given to them a couple of weeks prior to move out and I double checked they had it on day of move out. That being said, I'm pretty sure I've covered all my bases.  It is now 25 days past my move out date and they have 20 days to return my security deposit according to RI state rental laws. During the walk through they mentioned a couple of things (what I thought were nit-picky things -- very minor scratches in glass top stove, etc.) that they were probably going to charge me for. Now that they are over their date for returning the security deposit am I entitled to 100% of it? I have read that elsewhere and in other threads but never with sources. Maybe that is just in certain states, but I have not found anywhere to back it up.  I just want to know my rights before going to the next step and writing a demand letter. Also, how long should I give in the demand letter before filing in small claims? Because of the military move I'm obviously no longer located in the state so having to go to small claims would be an inconvenience to say the least.  For additional information, I lived in a large apartment complex (~70 units) and the owner of the building is a property manager out of New Hampshire who owns a couple dozen properties throughout New England... so this isn't their first rodeo by far.	No
1171	Hi,   I am typing this in front of nice lake I am staying at the next a few days while this issue has been going on.     I signed a lease agreement back in March 2017 with a roommate for the period of Aug 2017 to July 2018. The end of June the roommate wanted to get out of the lease so I released him and took care of his part. On Aug 1st, I contacted the landlord to reschedule key pickup to the 2nd. On Aug 2nd, I again called landlord to schedule a key pick up and a walk through of the house. During this call, the landlord asked for the payment of Aug's rent plus last two months of the lease in advance because I do not have a co signer (foreign student). I asked the landlord if I can pay more than half ($2000) of the total amount $3600. And the rest will be paid in a week or two after receiving an international wire. They refused to comply and told me to pay the full amount or no keys. After the call, I read the lease agreement multiple times. And the clauses in the contract dont mention anything about paying last two months or even a co signer. However, the agreement of paying the last two months was only verbal back in March. One thing to mention, the contract has stated the amount of one month rent to receive the keys. Another thing, they have a late payment clause which 10% of the amount. Anyway, after deep thinking, I made an online pmt of $1200 which is August rent to put them legally liable in case of attorneys involvement. What do you think I should do in this case?    I am now living in my car the past few days. I am mentally exhausted and restless with lack of sleep and not sure what to do.   Thank you.	No
1172	I run a bar in a commercial building in the State of Florida.  My neighbor, who is also my landlord, has a massive bitcoin mining operation next door.  It is clearly written in our lease that he may not take any action that interferes with my ability to conduct my business.  About three weeks ago, he installed some massive exhaust fans to help with cooling his operation.  Ever since then, there has been noticeable suction in our property (most noticeable when opening a door).  The air conditioning is running constantly, and is not able to pull down to temp (July in FL doesn't help, but we've been open for over a year, and it has never been an issue before).  Our floor and sink drains are exhausting a terrible sewage smell.  We've had repeated conversations with the neighbor/landlord (and his employee who is his surrogate for landlord activities) about it, and he has basically told us to F off.  He says something like we should have sealed our space better (He built the walls between our space!  They were pre-existing!).  The only way we've found to alleviate the problem is to leave all of our doors open, but then it is miserably hot and bright in the space.  Otherwise, it smells like sewage.  This is really costing us customers.  I figure I can take him to court somehow.  But, what preparations should I make?  What evidence could I bring?  I can't think of a way to prove a smell, or prove loss of revenue.  Our plumber doesn't know what to do.  Our HVAC contractor doesn't know what to do.  I talked to a lawyer about it, but he basically said it didn't sound big enough for his time, and I should keep trying to find a way to resolve it with the landlord or file a suit on my own.  But the landlord isn't budging and we are losing customers.	No
1173	I've run into a bit of an issue with my dishwasher and I would be interested in getting your opinions on how to resolve it.  The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.  After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.  After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options:  -Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher  -40% off a new Bosch replacement.  I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?  The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.  What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this?   A 40% discount would have seemed to be a fair, good faith resolution if it wasn't for the inflated pricing and all of the associated inconveniences.	No
1174	"[The New York Attorney General](https://www.thelpa.com/lpa/landlord-tenant-law/new-york-tenant-rights.html) outlines tenant rights here.

1175	Hello,   I graduated High School this past summer, and bought my macbook from the school. The guarantee was that once the laptop was fully paid for, the school technology department would remove unnamed management software. I don't know if it is a keylogger, website monitoring software, or what additional restrictions exist. I know that I can not change my energy settings nor control my security and privacy options.  After I paid the school the full balance, the software was not removed. I emailed the technology department requesting removal and received a preliminary response days later stating the the lead for such matters had previously been on vacation, despite not having turned on any sort of automatic reply indicator.  I am currently overseas, and have limited wifi options. I requested that the technology department give me a timeslot that they needed me to connect to the internet within. I told them that I would make whatever time they gave work.  In response, I was told that they were unable to give me a time slot, but that it just had to be connected for a short period of time. I further emailed and explained that I was unable to just randomly have it on, as my time zone is multiple hours ahead and wifi is very limited in the city where I live, so I needed them to provide a time that worked for them, and I would cooperate with whatever time they set.  Since then, I have not received a single reply despite nearly 3 business days elapsing.  I understand that this issue may seem minor, but I bank off my computer, and am soon going to be hoping to use it for purposes of a more sensitive nature where I am legally unable to have outer management software installed on my device.   Thank you in advance for any information or advice.	No
1176	"I am on the lease with my partner, who has loved on this property for 5 years now. In the past 5 years, ownership of the property has shifted from a private couple to a development company. And the development company obviously wants us out so they can do their job and develop the property.   Original owners were great. When something would break down I am handy. New toilet handle, garbage disposal, drain clogged, lock needed to be changed, I was on it. We also paint the interior of the house yearly. When we do something like this we would contact the landlord and let them know, send the receipt and all would be well.   New owners come in and buy up the place. Simply copy and paste the original leases and put their names at the top with the condition that ""we will build in a year.""  That's fine, because in West Hollywood, where we live, we get a nice payout from them once they kick us out. So we are okay with that. One day, the lock on the front door gets jammed up and needs to be fixed. I email the landlords and ask if its cool that I fix it, send them a copy of the key if need be. They send over some unlicensed guy the next day to fix it.   Outlets, a new sink, clogged drains, all worked on by guys who clearly had very little experience working with this stuff, just handymen. Code enforcement was called by me several times to inspect the handiwork and make sure a pipe would not burst or a wire would not burn the house down. I documented every incident and presented it to code enforcement for the city, asking that they back me up and fine the development company.   I was told by a city official that no fines would be brought against the development company as the properties were slotted for development. I was told by my landlord that any change I made to the property I would break the lease, even if it took 3 days for them to fix a water leak after we turned the water off. I have a copy of the original lease, none of this is present on there. I do not think the landlord even has a copy.  I have emails from city officials detailing a maintenance moratorium (nothing in the city's standards and practices mentions a procedure for designating a property to be under a maintenance moratorium) for the properties. One of the developers is on the board of planning for the city, has not recused himself for this project, I have documentations of numerous violations of the city code and timelines which show fines should have been levied by code enforcement but have not, I have a city council member's ear, documentations of unlicensed workers doing work which has left my home in a substandard condition, and plenty more.   I am this close to hiring an attorney and filing suit, the only reason I have not is I do not want the city officials to circle the wagons and try to shut me out. What are my options at this point? All I want is the home to be kept up to the standard laid out by code enforcement."	No
1177	A neighbor of mine has caused a lot of major neighborhood problems. He's mostly yelled at neighbors, unprovoked (i.e., riding up to them on his bike and calling them names), trespassed after being asked not to, and actually just yesterday assaulted someone with a shovel. I don't know the situation on that last one (whether it was provoked or not, but there was a woman screaming at him that he had raped her daughter. He also happens to have a conviction for child rape. Goody.), but my husband and I got security camera footage of it sent to the cops,so we'll see what happens there.     Anyway, before yesterday's assault incident, a cop who had come out previously for a disruption hinted at, though never outright said, that the disruptive neighbor may have schizophrenia or another severe mental illness, and suggested that we as a neighborhood (not an official HOA or anything but we've all been affected by this guy) write a letter to his parents, who own the house he's in.    Are there legal guidelines for this (i.e., citing each incident we've had), or is it open to interpretation?	No
1178	So I've known about this for years and years but honestly recently started using Reddit for real.   Growing up on the cotton farm my grandmother cared for her grandmother who was very ill. She was closer to her than much of the family. When she died my grandmother was in Italy with her army husband and couldn't go to Texas where the probate court is for all this land out in Texas she got, which has oil on it, a lot. That side of the family who did go get it ended up in politics and doing very well.  She has anxiety, always has, and is afraid of getting killed over trying to claim it due to the amount involved. She's almost 80 now and I'm not sure if this is something worth looking into since there have been some deaths around it. I called up the Clarksville Texas court to pull the old document that outlined what happened but they said it was incredibly long.   Is this something worth looking into? Sums involved are in the millions.	No
1179	I moved into an apartment in Florida with a roommate and paid the entire deposit (chalking that one up to a life lesson). Now that we are moving out, I am moving to a separate state and she is simply moving to a smaller apartment in the same complex. Because she is staying, the complex is automatically moving our deposit from the current apartment into her new one, and not cutting any portion in a check.  Both of our names are on the current lease, only her name is on the new lease. Am I just out all this money or do I have any legal grounds to force her to send me half? Is there any way I can force the apartment to send a check instead of simply giving the entire deposit to her?	No
1180	The police officer blatantly lied in the police report and if I can locate the victim, I can prove it. The victim (a store clerk) didn't even speak English but the police report has sentences of things I supposedly said to him, including a death threat which I never made. If I can locate that store clerk and have him verify  1. he didn't understand what I was saying 2. as such, he didn't understand a death threat I never made 3. he was not scared for his life based on that death threat   then: 4. i'm not guilty of criminal threats, which is what i plead guilty to.  How to do that I don't know. I've emailed several lawyers and none respond. I imagine this doesn't fit within the confines of their usual churning out plea bargain framework so they don't want to bother with it.   Thanks for any help.	No
1181	She told me not to use my air conditioning until she has it fixed. It has been 3 weeks. Is she required to fix it in some time frame, and it not, am I legally required to not run my AC?	No
1182	"and i qoute   ""Your unit was professionally cleaned prior to your move in. We expect it back in the same condition with confirmation via a receipt or invoice from the cleaning service used. Please e-mail the receipt or invoice to""  It does not say this is mandatory anywhere in our lease. We moved in and the place was filthy. We complained and they sent a cleaning service. We didn't explicity request it ourselves."	No
1183	"So a little background my dad is 77, a widow.  He had a heart attack about 18 months ago and now was diagnosed with Parkinsons at the beginning of 2017.    I am his only child, his will is updated since my mom's death so everything goes to me.  He owns the home he lives in free and clear and it's worth about $180,000.  My wife keeps  nagging me to have the ownership of the home transferred from him to me.  Her belief is that if he have to put him in a nursing home at some point, that they will come after the home.  She believes this because her mother has told her this for years and is what they did to ""protect"" their grandparents home.    From my reading, if he was placed in a nursing home his medicare would kick in first, and they he would probably be eligible for medicaid (he doesn't have much money besides teh house).  I would rather not put it in my name, because I would face potential capital gains on the sale of it, whereas if i inherit it and sell it i'm paying nothing.  In the end, we don't want to lose the house.  I would rather pay the capital gains than lose it but i don't believe me wife is correct.  Thanks"	No
1184	"My friend [early 20s F] lives in the dorms on her job's campus. Monday night, she was at an employee social until early in the morning, but ended up getting a fairly good parking spot near her dorm. She was the designated driver for a few of her coworkers. Later on Tuesday morning (around 11am) she discovered damage to the back corner or her vehicle. Deep scratches and a missing reflector. She was unable to find the reflector anywhere in the lot, and assumed cleaners had picked it up. Of course we were both upset, but there isn't much to do when the parking lot has no cameras.   Cue Saturday morning. At my advisement, she finally tells her mother about the damage to the vehicle since the car is not titled in her name. Her mother is a bit of a hardass, so she told a white lie and said she was unaware of the damage until today (since she had waited so long. Strike one against her).   Saturday afternoon, she's summoned to the local police station and is questioned by officers. She called me right after the questioning, but I have little details as to the tone of the interaction. Whoever had hit her car originally had taken the reflector and given it to the police, stating she caused the accident. STRIKE TWO: she told the police she was unaware of the damage until today so her story would remain straight in the eyes of her mother. I disagree, but I'm currently too far away to take action about it. I believe I can pull text messages from five days ago where she told me she discovered the damage.   While I'm furious with her over that, there isn't much she can do about it at this point. What steps should she take now? My late grandparents were retired police officers when I was growing up, and I wouldn't dream of lying to an officer. I have no advice for her now. I met this girl in college and we have been close for awhile now-I would love to find a solution for her. Is there anyone who knows what to do in this situation?   (There is also not a doubt in my mind that she is innocent. The fact that it took the other person four days to present this ""evidence"" to the officer should also be of credit to her.)  TLDR: Friend is being framed for a hit and run by the actual perpetrator days after the accident. There are no cameras or witnesses. How should she proceed?"	No
1185	We have had water damage in our bathroom ceiling for over two weeks and I have contacted the landlord once via text and once via a letter. when we texted she said she would send someone but never did, and she has not responded to my letter yet, although its only been two days. We have been planning to move soon (which the landlord knows), but now we are considering leaving at the end of the month and forfeiting our security deposit.the problem is that seems wrong to me because it feels like we are legally in the right. I have looked at the RTA but I still do not know the legality of leaving or how long she has to fix something like water damage. any legal help is appreciated as I do not know how to proceed and I am worried she will come after us for rent if we bail without giving a months notice.	No
1186	"I went to a big box store and parked. When I got out I was stuck between two large SUV which limited my view going back. I honestly slowly went back when a car blasted their horn and sped. I would say around me but at no time were we closer than 8 feet. I let it go I did not even honk back or give them the finger or yell anything to them.  I had already put my windows down because the temperature was only ~80 degrees. My mistake. I happened to use the same exit as that person because there are only really two ways to get out.  I left at least one car space probably more. The passenger gets out of the car. Cars are coming into the big box store so I cannot go around. I am blocked on the right by a sidewalk and the passenger coming at me. There are cars already behind me.  The guy comes at me with fists drawn and in a threatening manner already yelling ""I am going to kick your fucking ass."" I panic and remembered I had pepper spray. I fumble for it as he is already at my car screaming. I yell ""GO back to your car"" at least 4 times and he takes a swipe at me and then spits at me right into my face and eye. I spray the pepper spray directly into his face. He immediately walks away and then his wife (driver of car) starts screaming at me. I call 911 the moment the situation was calmer.  He and she are screaming at me. I finally close my window (I forgot to do that) The police are there in about two minutes which is really quick. I tell my story. The other guy is warned to stay over there cause he keeps trying to get close to me. The police tell me that his story does not make sense and to tell me my story twice now. 4 more officers come. I tell them each and they warned me that I might be arrested because pepper spray is ""illegal"" in new jersey and that ""spitting does not constitute an assault""  Luckily a supervisor says that my pepper spray (bought on amazon which limits which size I can buy in my state) is legal and that spitting does constitute an assault or something else. I was still quite amped up to understand exactly what he said.  At the end, all of the officers told me had it happened to them they would have done the same or even more (one officer said I would have beat the living shit out of him) But they gave me my license, my pepper spray back, and a police report number no ticket was issued to me. I am not sure of the other person.  They said that the passenger already said that he will be pressing charges against me. The police told me at 9 am Monday to go to the police station pick up the police report and file charges against the passenger.  I would like to know what am I facing? Can I use a self defense claim? I never left the vehicle, he came into my vehicle trying to punch me and spit into my face.  What would I counter charge him with? Can I press charges against the driver of the vehicle as well as she preventing me from leaving.  Was anything I did illegal?"	No
1187	For the last 32 days both our AC unit and dishwasher have both been out of service. Also for the last month local temperatures have been ranging from 75-102 daily - including two week long heat waves where the weather wouldn't be lower than 80 at 10:00pm at night.   They did install a temporary AC unit but it literally only cools within a 5-foot radius of the thing and doesn't reach any of the three bedrooms or kitchen. I bake as a part-time job from home and spend upwards of five hours at a time in front of the oven which is miserable in this heat.   I just got an update that they'll be installing the new dishwasher (that's been sitting on our balcony in its box for the last three weeks) next Wednesday the 19th. Apparently they haven't had the man power to install it.   We pay $2,765 for a 1,192 sq foot apartment. Our energy bill last month was $206.09, compared to our usual bill ~$130.00 - because of constantly having to run the temporary AC unit.   I told them about our high energy bill and they offered to credit our account $300.00 - which covers our PG&amp;E Bill and (1) day of rent which calculates to $91.16). Not only that but because it's already mid-July I'm positive we'll be expecting another ridiculous energy bill.   While I'm grateful that they offered to cover it, but is that enough of a credit because we've had to live in this miserable heat indoors while also not having a functioning dishwasher?   Any info would help - thanks in advance.	No
1188	Last year I made the poor decision to live with randoms. It went horribly and the other two don't speak to each other. We just moved out and we're waiting for our move out fines to come in. I already know it's going to be at least 300 or more because one of them got caught with a cat and we got a 250 pet fine. Unfortunately we're all on one lease and that technically means that all three of us are equally responsible for all the fines.  This is where I'm worried because both of them are irresponsible and I don't see them trying to take responsibility of the fines and probably doesn't care if they get sent to collections. They also know that I really care about my credit and would probably wait for me to eventually pay it.   I want to know if there's anything I could do legally to encourage them to pay the fines?   I looked up small claims court and it costs almost $120 to file in my state which at that point I'd have to decide if it's worth it (which I won't know until the 31st of this month).   Could I get a lawyer to maybe write them a letter? What are my options?	No
1189	"My aunt and uncle have a building on the edge of their property line that is frequently flooded by runoff from their neighbor's parking lot water runoff that washes down a hill and into the side of the building.   They have asked the neighbors (a labor union) if they could do something so that their building is not frequently affected by the water that pours in from the hill, but were blown off by them.  My aunt and uncle have told me that the union's property is ""grandfathered in,"" so there isn't much that can be done. Is this true, or is there something to be done?"	No
1190	"I worked at a restaurant as a dish washer for about 5 1/2 hours as a ""trial"" period. I decided not to continue with them after that time. I gave them my information, it's been a week and haven't received any sort of compensation for my work.  What do I do if I do not get paid? There's no proof that I actually worked that night, I didn't sign in or anything like that. I just showed up and got to work, then left."	No
1191	Hey guys, wondering if you can help  My girlfriend and I rent a 1 bedroom apartment through an estate agent. 2 weeks after the lease commencing, a leak developed through the bedroom ceiling from the apartment above.   this took 3 weeks to rectify. a total of 10 days of the 3 weeks we have builders in the apartment, 4 different builders in total. often turning up un announced at 7am. we both work night shifts in hospitality so would need to wake up to give them access. during this time we could not use the bedroom to sleep in, we had to set up an air bed in the living area. we could obviously not have any visitors or entertain any guests as our living area was full with an air bed and blankets etc.  when the repair was finally fixed i asked the estate agent for compensation. we requested 2 weeks rent as we believed this was fair for the inconvenience we had suffered.  after 2 months, the estate agent has now come back and said that as the apartment was inhabitable and we didn't have to move out, their builder is not insured to pay out and we will not receive any compensation for this matter.  any ideas?	No
1192	"I'm in Switzerland and I know the laws might be a bit different here compared to the US; I'm just looking for some general advice and for someone to tell me that I'm not crazy for being angry about this...  On the 29th of May I bought 3 tickets online for a medium sized festival (it's pretty well known but it's not a huge festival). When I still had not received the tickets after a month, I sent proof of payment and asked what was up. I never recieved a reply but a week later I received a ""payment confirmation"" in an envelope with a small rip in the side. I thought nothing of it and hoped the tickets would arrive soon. Last week, when they still hadn't arrived, I sent another email to which I received no reply. I sent another email at the beginning of this week. (There's no phone number on the website, only email.) Still no response. So I sent a message to the festival's Facebook page, and finally received a reply. They said that they had already sent me the ""bracelets"" around the time they sent the payment confirmation. They don't send tickets, just the wrist bands to enter the festival, with no way to identify them (no number, bar code, name or anything...just wrist bands with the festival name on them). I'm pretty sure that they were in the envelope with the payment confirmation and someone at the post office ripped open the letter and stole them. I've explained what I think happened and sent photos of my payment confirmation and the envelope with a rip in the side and they aren't replying. I paid over 400 francs for those three wrist bands. It's insane that they have no proper tickets and no way to identify the wtist bands; they're just asking to be stolen. Whoever has them is going to be able to get into the festival for free no questions asked. I'm so angry right now and so afraid they won't believe me and will refuse to send me more wrist bands. The festival is from the 3rd to the 5th of August. What should I do? File a complaint with the post office? Wait for the festival people to reply (when they've been super shitty about replying)?   Thanks for any advice you can give me  Tl;dr: festival sent me wrist bands which were stolen out of an envelope in the post. They have been slow to reply and I'm very worried they won't believe me"	No
1193	Hey all, I'm just looking for a few next steps to take regarding this. I moved out sometime mid-may and was greeted with a $137 bill for alleged damages to the apartment. To be fair, the feet of my couch did damage some linoleum flooring so I wasn't expecting the security deposit to cover all of it. I paid my $137 bill and went about my business.   Late June they decide to send a revised statement with adjusted amounts charging $2000+ for replacing flooring and $400 for painting. This is after they cashed the original check as well. This amount is close to a whole other month of rent and I can't just take this in stride. Is there anything I can do to contest this?	No
1194	So two years ago my fiance was attending a university in New Hampshire and she received health insurance through the university. After a year she took a leave of absence and moved to California for a job. She received health insurance through her job in California. The university did not cancel her insurance in New Hampshire, so she submitted a form to the insurance company in December 2016 to waive the insurance in New Hampshire and the waiver was refused. She repeatedly reached out to the insurance for several months to sort out why they would not cancel her insurance and she's now finding out (through the university, which has done nothing to alleviate the problem) that there were claims submitted in January, February, and March of 2017. Being in California she couldn't have used the New Hampshire insurance since it was only accepted at the university's medical network. She has proof that she was clocked in at work in California for the times associated with the claims.   The university states that all students (even those on a leave of absence must have health insurance that meets their requirements). Her leave of absence ended a month ago.   I've already read through the [FTC's medical identity theft](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0171-medical-identity-theft) page and plan to follow the instructions there. Is there anything else that we can do to solve this? What would be the best way to get the insurance cancelled?	No
1195	I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.	No
1196	So I moved out of my last apartment July first even though my lease says that I have it until July 31st. Rent is all paid up so pretty much I was renting two apartments for the month of July. Today I stopped by my old apartment to check if there was any mail that was not forwarded and new tenants have already moved in. Normally I wouldn't care but this land lord has given me a hard time for the past year. Is there anything that I can do regarding this since technically he is in breach of the lease?	No
1197	"Got in an accident a while back.  Sought legal assistance.  The lawyer I found dropped my case after a month and I felt they wasted my time.  I left them a single negative review online containing hard facts, all of which were true. I can back up any of my claims with evidence from multiple sources.  I settled with the driver on my own and figured it was time to move on.  The lawyer felt otherwise.  Since our ""falling out,"" the lawyer has taken the following actions:  * Called me to threaten legal action against me if I do not take down my factual review * Called my employer to try to convince them to fire me, saying he knows their business partners etc. * Called various family members of mine and made them feel harassed. * Has emailed me countless times threatening multiple lawsuits. * Has emailed me threatening to employ a private investigator for the situation. * Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false. * Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer) * Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident * Is threatening me with lawsuits, again  I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.  what do you think?  1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment? 2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since. 3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?"	No
1198	I live in Ontario, Canada.  My sibling has hereditary back problems and gets massage therapy or something to help with it, but this requires a doctor's note/prescription or something (I'm honestly not certain of the details). They have mentioned to me how my school's insurance covers a good chunk of the cost if I were to try it out, so I said sure and asked my doctor for a note as well, which was very willingly given to me. I never ended up using it, so my sibling took the note and used it for themselves. They then asked my mother for my student number and made an account under my name on my school's insurance website or whatever to claim back some of the money they spent on the massage stuff, without my knowledge or consent (I heard about this through my mother). I'm pretty sure this is insurance fraud and identity theft; please correct me if I am wrong. What can I do? How can I stop them from doing more of this?	No
1199	My apartment recently received a letter from the water utility company that we were past due and the water was about to be shut off. We were quite confused as we had never paid the water bill in the years that we had lived there and had never had a problem with this before. After reviewing our lease and speaking with our Landlord we have some questions regarding our rights and responsibilities in this situation. Here is a brief rundown of what is going on:  We do not have individual meters going into our apartment building. It is one master meter for a few units.  The property management company changed hands about a year ago. The previous management company was paying the water bill and not billing us.  The new management company paid the past due water bill after this came to light and now wants to charge us for all the water bills retroactively.  The landlord wants to divide the water bill equally between the units since there is no way to determine how much each unit is using individually. I don't like this as I would not want to potentially pay more if my neighbors are using more than me.  In our lease it states that we must pay for all utilities for the unit. However, it does not state anything about splitting the water bill equally between units or how the bills are determined.  The landlord is paying the electric bills for the common area and we are not required to split those bills between the units.  Since nothing is in writing and it is very vague what happens if I pay my part of the bill but my neighbors do not? Can the landlord come after me for the rest of it?  In conclusion, I have no problem with paying my dues, but I don't want to be on the hook for the water that my neighbors are using. What are my rights in this situation? Thanks!	No
1200	"On June 24th I ""moved in"" to my new apartment. Several of my friends helped me move in and several different sized boxes were placed everywhere, including some on top of the stove.    When I moved in I was kind of irked because there was no power, apparently it was my responsibility to call the power company and have them turn it on. Upon calling the power company I was greeted with a message that they were not open until the following Monday. Not wanting to stay in an apartment with no electricity or A/C in the middle of a hot June I decided I would travel 2 hours to stay with my grandfather in another city.    Fast forward to the following Monday, I called the power company and asked when the soonest I could get power turned on in my apartment and they said the following day, they also asked that I turn the breakers in the apartment off and I agreed. This kind of bummed me out because it meant I'd have to travel to and from my grandfathers to go to university until then.    The next day I make my way up to my apartment and wait around for several hours, trying to get furniture where I like it, unpacking a couple of the things. I remember specifically going to switch the breakers to what I thought was OFF.    After waiting for several hours I call the power company and ask if they still plan to turn my power on that day and they say yes, it should be done before the end of the business day. I wait another hour before I leave as it's now around 4-4:30ish and I have to drive across the city to get to my class that starts at 5:30pm. Surprisingly I get there early and grab a bite to eat.     Class starts and the professor is explaining the exam we'd take that day, about 15 minutes into the exam I start feeling my phone vibrate, because this is an exam I ignore it. It continues to vibrate, over and over it doesn't stop for a good 2 minutes.Thinking something might be wrong I ask my teacher if I could go outside the class and answer it because I feel like something might be wrong. She isn't happy about it but allows me to go outside the class. I see 4-5 missed calls and messages from my new apartment manager and 2 missed calls from my grandfather. I immediately call my apartment manager and ask what the deal is.    ""Honey, your apartment is on fire!""    ""What? For real?""    ""Yes, you need to get down here quick!""    I immediately go back into my class, tell my professor that my apartment is on fire and I have to go. She just smiles at me at first then asks if I'm serious. I say yes, I have to go now. She covers her mouth in horror and everyone has stopped taking the test and they're all looking at me.     As soon as I'm out the door I call my grandfather and assure him I'm ok.     The next call is to my rental insurance company USAA.    I talk to them via the Bluetooth connection in my car as I'm trying to get back to my apartment as soon as possible. The first thing I ask them is ""Am I covered?""    ""Yes, you've been covered in the new apartment since the date you moved in on the 24th.""    Thank goodness.    The claims adjuster then begins asking me a ton of details about the fire that I can't answer because I'm not there yet. I tell him I'll call him back asap when I see the damage. I'm freaking out, not sure if my apartment is completely destroyed or what's going on.  I finally get to my apartment and observe a fire truck and what I assume are other fire department vehicles and to my horror there is water gushing everywhere, creating rivers in the ditches near the roads and small lakes in between the apartment complexes and I think ""Oh my god my apartment is going to be soaked in water.""     I park a ways away and walk straight through the small lakes of water to get to where my apartment manager and a maintenance man are standing.     I ask what happened.    They tell me the fire department has said that for some reason one of the burners on the stove was on and when the power was switched on it caught some of my boxes on fire. The apartment manager said it's the power companies fault, it's their responsibility and standard operating procedure to physically go into the apartment to make sure the breakers are turned off, that they're supposed to go to the apartment manager if a tenant is not home to be let in to check the breakers. I tell her that I thought I'd turned the breakers off. She then told me it didn't matter if I had or not they the power company didn't follow proper procedure and the exact same thing happened a few years prior and the power company had to pay for it.    I finally went and talked to the Fire Chief and he told me the same thing. He was upset with the power company and said that no matter what I did it was their fault for not coming into the apartment and making sure the breakers were turned off.    After a while I was finally permitted to go into my apartment and to my astonishment there was no water anywhere, everything looked normal apart from the kitchen which had several holes in the walls, black melted plastic and several of my burned kitchen items plastic cups, silverware, a few liquor bottles, a few bags of food. Not much was destroyed outright HOWEVER the entire apartment smelled god awful and after leaving I had a difficult time breathing and got a terrible sinus headache. Burnt plastic ash had gotten over and on literally EVERYTHING in the apartment. All my clothes, bed, furniture, etc... fortunately almost 90% of all my belongings were still packed in boxes/dressers.     Half of the breakers were on and half were off in my apartment when the fire department entered.    I take several pictures, talk to the Red Cross chaplain who offers me a place to stay, talk with the fire department and my apartment managers for a bit and then inspect my apartment some more. Finally I grab some of my clothes, my iPad, and my phone charger and I leave. I call my insurance and let them know everything, post the pictures on their website, give the name and contact info of the fire department and the apartment complex. I decide to drive back to my grandfathers as I'm still sort of stunned all this happened. I wash my clothes there 3-4 times to get the smell out. Get a hold of my boss and let her know I'm not likely to be able to make it to work for a few days until I get this figured out, same with my professor.    The next day, the 28th of June, 2017. I give a call to my rental insurance and start asking about what all it pays for. They say they can pay for a hotel stay until I get back in the apartment, realizing it might be a while, I accept so I can at least keep going to school and work. They also set up a time/date for a contractor to come out and evaluate my stuff, how much it'd cost to fix/replace.    In between the time I called and the time the contractor came to evaluate my stuff I was able to get the fire report from the fire department. I talked to the fire chief again who reiterated it was the power companies fault and not my fault and that I shouldn't even have to pay a deductible to get my stuff fixed. After leaving the fire department I read the fire report and it was incredibly vague. Did not place blame on anyone, just established the fire departments narrative. I thought this was strange but whatever I've never been through this situation before.     All of my stuff is covered for up to $10,000. The contractor evaluates it'd cost about $9500 to fix it all. I agree to let them fix everything.    I've been living out of a couple of trash bags full of clothes in a hotel behind work since the 28-29th of June. Over the past few days I've talked to my insurance adjuster who says I'll have to pay $250 deductible to get my stuff fixed and they'll pay the rest. When I told him the fire chief said I shouldn't have to pay the insurance adjuster said I'd have to pay for now and when they got a hold of the power companies insurance company if they're able to recoup their costs then I should get my $250 back.    After getting a rough date of when I can move back in and all my stuff will be fixed (July 24,2017) I started adding up all the things I'm out money for. My rent is $619/month so $619/30days is $20.63x27 days $557.10 I'm out of for rent, the $250 deductible, and a $50 energy bill from the energy company who for some reason despite the fire report saying otherwise, didn't turn off my power. Half of that bill is is a $28 hookup fee. The other power is apparently power used by my apartment complex maintenance to fix my apartment. As soon as I found out the power was still on and it was still in my name I immediately had it shut off. So all in all $557.10+$250+$50=$857.10.    Armed with this number and after talking to my insurance adjuster I call the claims department of the power company that leads me to the power company insurance. They ask for all the same info as my insurance, they tell me to email photos and all info to an email address. I send dozens of images and info including all the costs of my insurance, the cost to fix my stuff, the cost of my hotel stay (26-27 days) my personal costs and what I'd personally like to be reimbursed.     Coincidentally, a few hours after sending this email I get a call not from the power companies insurance, but from a sergeant at the fire department. She claimed she just wanted a statement from me about what went on that day as I'd left before she could get one. I asked her pretty directly if the reason she was calling is because I'd contacted the power companies insurance a few hours before and she evaded the question. I gave her my narrative, then asked her point blank if it was still the power companies fault. She then told me that she was going to rule it no ones fault. This pissed me off, how can the fire chief of the fire department tell me over and over it was the power companies fault, then the fire report points no fingers and now this Sergeant is telling me it's no ones fault?    All in all I still have yet to hear anything from the power companies insurance. I've talked to a lawyer who advised that I keep all receipts and costs for everything and that it'd be best if I tried to work out the power company paying me and if they didn't it'd be much cheaper and less time consuming if I took them to small claims court.    I've been studying and talking to multiple people about small claims court. I'm moving back into my apartment on the 24th, this coming Monday.    I would just like to know what are my options here? Is going to small claims court viable? Where can I find the regulations regarding how the power company is supposed to hook up power so I can see if the power company actually did break regulation? Would it be ok to try and get a direct statement from the fire chief saying it was the power companies fault? I surmise he'd probably change his view and become evasive if I asked for a signed document from him saying it was the power companies fault, I'm rarely certain both the city power company and the fire department both work for the city and are likely going to try to cover each other. Any advice?  TL;DR My apartment caught fire before I could sleep a night in it. The fire department chief blamed the power company for not following regulations when they did not turn off the breakers however the actual fire report was vague and blamed no one. Fortunately I have rental insurance, that is paying for my repairs, however I am still out $857.10 for lost rent, rental insurance deductible, and power bill. Would it be in my best interest to go to small claims court if the power company refuses to reimburse me? Where can I find regulations regarding hooking up power in my state (Kentucky)? Would I be wasting my time trying to get a statement from the fire chief saying again, this time officially it was the power companies fault?"	No
1201	Hello everyone I'm in a bit of a bind. I called a doctor's office to set up an appointment in January. I made an appointment and they told me I needed a referral. I told them to cancel the appointment and call me when they received the referral. This was all in the same phone conversation.  Here it is 6 months later and after sending two referrals, they never called. I received this bill last week for $50 for a no show appointment. I cancelled that appointment and even if it was still an active appointment there was no reminder call/text/email which I opted for.  So, I call the office and get an answering service. She directs my call to the office manager who does not answer. Her answering machine clearly stated that of the call was for a no show bill to submit in writing. So these people send out these bills so often that she needed to put that on her message. I left her a message stating who I was, why I was calling, and asked for the address to send this letter to. No call back. I've called several more times and still nothing.  I've really had it with this office. I looked at their review on Google and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue. They have horrible reviews and some very similar to my experience.  So, what is your advice?   Thank you so much!	No
1202	Hi,  My wife signed us up for Gerber Life Insurance a while back. We tried to cancel it because Life insurance for a one-year-old isn't a necessary expense.  But, Gerber Life insurance has saw fit to have their login server conveniently down(has been for a while), they tried to get her to stay by mentioning a bunch of dead children, and won't let her cancel the insurance unless we fill out a long form listing our complaints about the insurance and a set of signatures that are hers.  I'm starting to get more and more suspicious that Gerber is inefficient on purpose. Provided that I can prove it, is it legal for them to impede customers from canceling in this way?	No
1203	The title says it all. My sister's probation officer is as negligible as a law enforcement professional can be.   A bit of a back story on how my sister ended up on probation is needed. My sister at 7 months pregnant decided to drive heavily intoxicated with my 2 nieces. She was arrested, charged with 3 counts of child abuse/endangerment and a DUI. Even after being released from a short stay in jail and giving birth to my nephew, she continued to drink. Her PO gave her an option - 3 months mandatory in rehab or 3 months in jail. She decided to go to rehab and things were going pretty well.   Fast forward to today and she has not done any of her mandatory parenting classes or DUI classes and she is continuing to do drugs and drink. And this is not my opinion. If you took one look at my sister, you would know. Her behavior has caused my nephews and nieces assigned social worker to contact her PO and tell him that he needs to take a closer look at what is going on.   To top it all off, she has committed fraud 2 times already. First time she stole a check from a mailbox, went to a cash checking place and cashed it. The business found out what went on and filed a police report. Just today my dad's accountant made him aware of 3 stolen personal checks that my sister cashed. My dad filed a report with police but they stated that they can issue a warrant because it's hear say even though my dad had images of the stolen checks.   My parents called the PO and let him know they are extremely worried about her and his response was that he is aware of what is going on and that  he's going to give her a week to get it together! It's a joke. My parents response was that she could be dead in a week with how fast she is spiraling out of control. Yet she goes to probation today and nothing happens.   Somehow she has managed to pull one over this guy and it's sickening how oblivious to everything this guy is. He is completely negligent. She has somehow passed her drug/alcohol tests for probation (which are scheduled by the way and only a mouth swab) but she has not done any of her mandatory random drug tests for social services because they are random urine tests that she will fail.   My family and I want to file a grievance because the man is not doing his job. To be honest, I think he's sleeping with her. He doesn't know where she lives and she is lying about having a job. It's mind boggling. What do I do? I'm in Orange county, California.	No
1204	Months ago my coworker told me that he was in love with me and I told him that I did not have romantic feelings for him and asked him to keep it professional. He has since gone on to tell me that he is suicidal and continues to pester me with personal questions, following me around at work and asking to hang out outside of work. Today after being bombarded with personal questions I told him once again to leave me alone and keep it professional, that he was making my job miserable and stressful. At this point I was met with extreme hostility, the coworker disappeared, and I told my boss that I was leaving for fear of my safety.   It's my understanding that my boss knew that my coworker has been suicidal, and also that he had feelings for me. I have not officially quit my job and will be expected to join a conference call tomorrow. What should I know about my rights in this situation? Btw, I am a female referring to a male coworker.	No
1205	Hi,  I've been scouring the internet and can't seem to find the information I'm looking for.   According to California law, if I was renting from a roommate but had no communication with the landlord and I was not on the lease, who is responsible for returning my deposit, my ex roommate or the landlord of the apartment?  My roommate says I get no return until he finds my replacement but my agreement was with him alone, not the landlord.  Thank you for your time.	No
1206	"Hello all.   I signed a year long lease for a two bedroom apartment in Maryland in October of last year. I moved in with my sister at the time. She wanted to move back home in April, so she signed a deletion form the next day at the leasing office to have her name removed from the lease. The people at the office told her she was good to go.   My girlfriend signed an addition form to have her name placed on the lease in place of my sisters. We were also told by the leasing office that we were good to go.   She moved her stuff in after my sister moved out.   Now, in July, we were three days late to pay our rent. I did not realize that they would retaliate so heavily.   Rent was due on 7/4. I paid the rent, along with the late fee (and ""court fees"", which I was unaware at the time what that even meant) on 7/7. It was paid through the online portal. My account shows a zero balance. I checked my mail today and found a complaint from my apartment written on 7/19, with a court date listed for 7/27, for failure to pay rent and with the full amount of rent listed as still due. The tenants listed on the summons are myself, and my sister, who's name should have been deleted from the lease MONTHS ago.   What are my options? If my account is fully paid, do I really need to waste my time going to court? This is my first time being late to pay ANYTHING and I'm shocked that they still want me to appear to court when my account is currently paid in full. I am currently the only employee at my job and it is incredibly difficult for me to take time off, let alone at such short notice. Can I have the case closed without having to appear? And if I do have to appear, would my sister have to as well?"	No
1207	"I need to disclaim some funds I would otherwise be inheriting so that they can go back to the Estate to settle outstanding debts. These funds are with Vanguard.   I submitted the paperwork they gave me and that is all in order but I also need to write up a document specifically disclaiming the funds by account number. The agent I've been dealing with was unable to give me a ""blueprint"" but said what I write up must include the account numbers and their reference number.   The Estate is already in the red, I don't want to pay the lawyer another $250 out of pocket to do this simple task if I can avoid it and I need to get this settled soon.    I'm in NY and another sibling in MA has to submit a similar document for their shares. Any suggestions?"	No
1208	"Hi everyone. This is my first time ever posting, so please forgive me if my formatting is weird as I am also on mobile.    I live in a college town where lack of housing close to campus is an issue. For this reason, many students, such as myself and my roommates, are stuck in apartments that are far from perfect. Over the past year in this apartment, my roommates and I have had a constant battle with our landlord company.   Directly stated in our lease in reads:  MAINTENANCE BY LANDLORD. Landlord shall: a. Comply with the requirements of applicable building and housing codes materially account health and safety.  b. Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep dwelling unit in a fit and habitable condition.  c. Maintain in good and safe working order and condition all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances, including elevators supplies or required to be supplied by Landlord. d. Landlord shall not be liable for any injury caused by any object or materials which belong to, or which have been placed by, Tenants in the common areas of the premises used by Tenants.   We have had NUMEROUS problems in our unit throughout the year, however, I will only describe the ones that I think are a direct violation of this clause.   The building in which we live is a large home that is subdivided into 4 apartments, with ours being a 4 bed 3 bath, on the main and basement floors with 2 bedrooms on each floor, 2 bathrooms on the main level, and one in the basement.   Our first problem arose on the very day we moved in. My bedroom, along with the other in the basement, is carpeted. When we moved in, the carpet was SOAKING WET and the entire basement smelled of mold. We were unable to move into the basement for about two weeks and slept on the couches upstairs, which the carpet took that ENTIRE TIME to dry. The Landlord provided fans to dry the carpet. The entire basement smelled of mold, which we complained about for months, and no one was sent to check it out no matter how many times we called. Additionally, every time it rained, as the basement is carpeted, it would flood so much that we were actually able to""splash"" in the water that would flood in. I ended up getting so sick that I got bronchitis and was very sick for two months, and I now have an inhaler. Again, we called and called with no avail until a future possible tenant for the following year made a comment during a showing and the carpet was removed the next day. As we suspected, there was mold under the carpet, however, the water would still flood in. Eventually, it was mostly fixed, but then, as strange as it sounds, water then began to flood in from the ceiling fan in the basement bathroom, so much that we had to put an entire trash can underneath to catch all the water. As we prepared to move out this week, the carpet cleaners found, as we suspected and reported to or management multiple  times, a great deal of black mold in our unit.    There is a long list of other small things that add up. However, I think the mold is the biggest thing that clearly violates our lease agreement, especially since our landlord was well-aware of our living conditions the entire time. Today while turning in my keys, I said to my landlord that he apartment is u safe and unfit for living, and she said ""I agree."" I know that there are people that signed the lease and are supposed to move in August 1. I am concerned for their health and safety. Do we have grounds to sue? I am more than happy to provide and more information.  We have photo/video evidence of a LOT of the issues. Thank you!!  TLDR; my apartment is filled with mold and unsafe living conditions as a direct violation of our lease. can we sue?"	No
1209	"I caught a dui case in January of 2017. I was sentenced to a year probation and was told to get an alcohol assessment and I am required to follow the recommendations from the alcohol assessment. Below is my story.     Jan 26 2017 I had an appointment with a lady named Katie at Dawn Farms  for my alcohol assessment. I was court ordered to have an alcohol assessment. During the assessment, Katie recommended that I do 24 weeks of outpatient group therapy at dawn farms with a lady named Hannah on wednesdays from 2-3:30. Katie was training a young lady and explained the rules and asked if I had any questions regarding the assessment. She asked me to sign a piece of paper confirming everything that we went over and that I was to attend 24 weeks of outpatient meetings as well as attend 2 aa meetings per week.  I attended the 24 weeks with no issue. After the first 12 weeks, I didn't get a review over my performance or acknowledged on how I did. I was just given a piece of paper that I had to write new goals on and that was it. After completing the 24 weeks on July 12th 2017, Hannah mentioned to me that I could either continue to do the Wednesday's 2pm groups or switch to Thursday's.  There was never a discussion I had with anyone from Dawn Farms regarding another 12 weeks. The program has two phases, recovery group support and recovery support. One is 24 weeks and the other is 12. Not everyone does 36 weeks, or 24 weeks. Some people do 12 weeks but everyone signs the same form that states that in order to complete the Dawn farms program, you have to do 36 weeks. There are check marks next to both phases that you are recommended to do. My contract had the recovery support phase checked off and had it wrote by Katie in pen ""2 sets of 12=24 weeks"". I was not court ordered to complete the program, I was court ordered to get an assessment and to attend the recommended meetings that were given to me during the assessment. Every individual is different went it comes to the assessment. Katie might recommend something completely different than what another person might recommend, but she did my intake and no one else did. And since everyone is different, she assessed me based on the information I provided her and made the decision to give me 24 weeks of outpatient therapy. And That was her job but she no longer works there.  On July 14th I went to dawn farms at about 3:10 to speak with someone who could help me better understand why the piece of paper says something different than what was said to me from Hannah. A lady gave me a card and told me to speak to ray, who is the coordinator of the program.  I got ahold of ray at about 5pm and spoke with him about the issue. I explained to him the piece of paper and he said Katie may have screwed up with my intake. I told him that was not my fault, but we can't talk to her anyways because she no longer works there. Did she really screw up? These are done on an individual basis. He said that things may have changed from when I originally signed the paper in January. I told him that if that was the case then I was to sign a new form.  He told me that he wants to talk to his staff about this to make sure there are no loop holes like this again. This is not considered a loophole if this is something that they recommend to other people in treatment. This does not seem fair. Everyone who signs the same form would have to do 36 weeks. I was planning on signing up for classes at washtenaw community college. How am I suppose to plan things out for myself if there is a lack of communication and a lack of review after the 12 week period? He said that he would not write a letter saying that I completed the 36 weeks at dawn farms. I never asked him to write a letter to be dishonest and say that i did something I didn't do. I told him I want him to write a letter stating that I completed my 24 week recovery support group at dawn farm. I told him I would pick it up next week. My probation officer told me that I need to do whatever they tell me to do basically... but I did! I did the 24 weeks with no issue and out of no where they are telling me I need to do 12 more! Am I wrong for trying to fight this?    In terms of the dawn farms client handbook, it states that the staff will not lie to you or emotionally or physically abuse you. I feel like I was lied to and it's emotionally hurtful to know that I was mislead and it's causing me anxiety. I should feel good about being sober, not bad. I haven't had any screw ups since I've been at Dawn Farms.     Dawn farms website states ""Group therapy – Several group therapy options are offered that are designed to help clients with varying needs, levels of motivation and intensity of substance use problems. Groups range in duration from 8 to 24 weeks depending upon client needs and preference.""    If I signed a contract for leasing a vehicle for 24 months. That's what I would expect. I wouldn't expect the dealer to call me at the 24 month period to tell me that things changed and that it was actually a 36 month lease without me being aware."	No
1210	"My sister's roommate gave us her old washer and dryer to replace our older washer and dryer. Sunday afternoon, the moving company that the roommate hired brought them to us and installed them both, but it felt like they were rushing things to get out of there. They left and forgot to turn the water back on, which I realized when I tried to give the washer a test run.  Today (Tuesday), I discovered that the floor in the laundry room had water under it. In addition, the wall of my bathroom was wet, and a puddle has formed behind the toilet (laundry room and bathroom are back-to-back). I turn off the washer's water valve and my sister called a plumber for me. He found out that the washer's connection to the house's water valve wasn't tightened and was leaking water when turned on, and he was able to turn it a good 5 or so times to tighten it. My sister also had to call a carpet cleaner company to come dry the affected floors and walls, which they're doing now.  My sister called the movers and told them the situation and asked for reimbursement. They refused, saying that it wasn't their fault since they weren't the ones that turned on the valve. They also said that if they really didn't tighten it, then it would've leaked while they were there (it didn't leak while they were there because they forgot to turn on the water though). My sister decides that she'll have to take them to small claims court.  So I'm not exactly familiar with how these proceedings work, so what exactly should we do here? I feel like we have somewhat of a solid case, but I don't want anything to go wrong. Do they have a case for anything with the point of ""we didn't turn on that valve, we can't be responsible?"" I want to say it sounds stupid, but I could be wrong. Any advice?"	No
1211	Signed up for a 1099 sales job last year.  Commission was great and was doing very well.  The company then halved the commission awarded and several people quit.  They then switch to minimum wage + commission type, and had us sign a non-compete work contract.  Since then, they have added minimum sales quotas, set hours, and even further reduced our commission.  Am I bound by this new non-compete clause?	No
1212	Hey all, ill keep this short. Cop pulled me over today, suspected pot in my car, I complied and cooperated fully. They searched my car and found a one hitter, as well as the roach to a joint. The officer threw the roach on the ground, and took the one hitter. He let me off with a warning. Are there any long lasting repercussions for insurance, criminal record, possible summons in the mail, etc? Im 23 and live in minnesota.	No
1213	"On my lease it states ""Resident shall keep all gardens, lawns, trees and shrubbery upon the property neatly trimmed, watered and free of all weeds.  Lawn must be fertilized and weed controlled. Pest and insect control is at Residents expense. The grounds during May - September will be maintained by the Landlord who will hire a crew of their choice and will charge the Resident $45 per week, for a total of $180  rent  increase during those months. The increase is considered rent."" The first violation came in after May when they were suppose to start taking care of the grounds, to which we made an agreement that we would take care of everything right then and after that it was their problem. Now they gave us another citation stating ""The flower beds in the front and the back need to be weeded, as well as the planning ring in the back yard The lawn needs to have fertilizer applied to get rid of the weeds in the lawn, professional or you can do it The back area in the back half of the yard is your responsibility. It needs to be cleared of any and all weeds. The grass does not grow in that area and needs to be maintained weed free. The lawn company maintains the grass growing lawn part. The yard is so big after they mow, edge and blow off everything for that area there is no money left over for other yard work such as weeding, raking, fertilizing, ect. This is your responsibility.""  This is clearly against our lease."	No
1214	Howdy all.. Can someone point me at the statutes regarding changing locks as a tenant in Texas (and bonus points for Dallas County)..

Pretty sure notice and copies of keys are required to be delivered, but can't find the statute   Thanks	No
1215	On July 7, 2017 tenants were all notified that exterior painting contractors would be at the building and that this was a 48 hour notice to enter premises.  Painting was estimated to last nine weeks.  Go forward to August 8. I went to take my trash out and returned to find not one, not two, but three painters standing in my apartment!  I live on the top floor of a seven story apartment. They had used the cherry picker to access the deck, climbed over the rail, and entered my apartment through the slider.  They were not working on my deck or anywhere near my apartment that day.  They said they entered to shut a slightly open bedroom window, and that they had knocked and called out and discovered I was not home and entered. I was gone about five minutes since we have a garbage chute on our floor.  I went to the property manager regarding this scary entry at 8 a.m.  Today we received notice that the July 7 48 hour notice to enter qualifies the painters to enter our units at any time, whether we are there or not, without an employee of the property manager, for the duration of their contract!  Does a 48 hour notice give free access to all contractors for the duration of the contract?  These contractors (three, remember, to close a bedroom window that was open an inch and nowhere close to their work area) now have open access to all apartments, even though this is exterior work!  Thank you for any guidance on this. I've tried looking up local codes for this and can only find landlords right to enter with a 48 hour notice.	No
1216	Hey r/legaladvice, do you think my girlfriend should do something about her latest manager? To keep it straight and to the point: her new manager told her employees to start thinking of a few days to go on vacation next month. When asked why, she responded that any employee who couldn't take vacation would have to work 1 less day per week.  Is that even legal? Is there something my girlfriend can do before she is forced to drop from 40 hours to 30-32 a week? Losing 1/4 of your income is pretty harsh so Im hoping that there is a way she can defend herself from losing that money.  Some minor details: This manager just replaced the previous manager who was fired for raking up more HR charges than Weinstein.   She is new and was hired from an entirely different industry. There was an interim manager that worked in this company for 18 years and surpassed all previous metrics from the previous manager before being replaced by someone who never worked for this entire industry before!   This new manager wants these employees to go on vacation because this company doesnt take vacation out of the payroll budget that is involved with the managers bonus.  This is a forbes 500 company. Idk if that pertains, but I figured it might be worth mentioning  Thanks in advance to all who may be willing to help :)	No
1217	I’m currently in settlement negotiations with a creditor for approximately $3k.  It’s not a whole lot of money, so I am trying to negotiate that the creditor remove all information in my credit report before paying them.  The attorney representing the creditor said ‘no,’ but I can’t imagine the creditor willing to pay more for a lawsuit than what it actually owed.  Do I have any leverage here at all? Does the creditor even own the account anymore or did they account to the law firm? The creditor is a nationwide company.  Any info or advice about negotiations would be appreciated.  Please hold any holier-than-thou speeches of paying bills on time.  Thank you.	No
1218	"Sorry if my post is a little messy, this just happened yesterday and I've been a complete wreck.  A little backstory: my cat was about 13 or 15 years old (I can't recall what age I adopted him, I think I was 7 or 8), and I'd had him since he was about three weeks old, and we grew up together. I have severe anxiety due to mental illness, childhood abuse, and the death of my father, and he was classified as a therapy animal by my therapist who'd I'd been seeing for four years at that point. He was my best and only friend and I'm just beside myself.  On Sunday I let my cat outside (he had arthritis and liked to lie out in the sun for a couple of hours before coming inside, I guess it helped because he started walking better once it got sunny) and went about my day. Later as I was outside, I saw a huge Boxer dog carrying something in his mouth; once I realized it was my cat, I streaked across the lawns to the neighbor's house where I basically had to fight the dog off my cat so I could hold him as he died in my arms. I was inconsolable and traumatized. The owner wasn't present, but her mother was and assured me that she was sorry and informed me that the young child in the house had incorrectly tethered the Boxer dog to its chain, causing it to break out of its yard and run into mine, where it found my cat.  After wrapping my cat up and talking to the owner when she got home, she apologized and offered to pay for any bills, which I accepted. I called a vet, got an estimate for cremation, and everything at that point seemed as settled as it could be.  I walked to her house this morning as I was headed over to the vet appointment to ask her for the finances she offered, and she refused, saying she didn't have the money and that she has leukemia and simply doesn't make enough to cover the bills. I told her I was sorry that she was ill but she is responsible for my cat's death and she needed to take responsibility, and she told me to contact her attorney. My mom offered to pay for my cat's cremation, but now I don't have money for an urn to put the ashes in (the vet doesn't offer free urns so it would come in a sealed bag).  **Since she told me to take her to court, I'm here asking for advice. Here's a TL;DR bulletpoint with information**  **My therapy cat was killed by an unleashed Boxer dog and the owner refuses to take financial responsibility.**  * The leash law in West Virginia states:   &gt; §19-20-13. Dog running at large; liability of owner.  &gt; Any owner or keeper of any dog who permits such dog to run at large shall be liable for any damages inflicted upon the person or property of another by such dog while so running at* large.  * My city within West Virginia's leash law states:  &gt;  The City Code of Ordinances Chapter 4 states that ""no person shall allow any dog owned by him or in his custody to run at large within the city. The term ""running at large"" means allowing a dog to leave the property limits of property owned, leased or occupied by its owner without restraint. The term ""restraint"" means being secured by a leash or lead, or being under the control of a responsible person and obedient to that person's command.""  * The owner admitted fault and offered to pay for damages * The owner then refused to pay for damages she previously offered * The owner requested that I take her to court * The owner verbally attacked me when I went to her house on Monday (I don't know if this is relevant but I'm including it) * The owner admitted negligence in allowing her young child to handle a Boxer dog three times her size (again I don't know if this is relevant but she admitted to being negligent in this respect) * The owner keeps three dogs in a 3x4 kennel in the backyard, which is way too small for the size of her dogs * The owner admitted that her Boxer dog was actually looking for a different cat that has been wandering around her yard lately, so she admitted to knowledge that her dog had vicious intent but did nothing to prevent it  I can't think of anything else. I don't want pain and suffering money, I don't want to hurt her, I just want her to pay for the price of my cat's urn. I want to put this behind me so I can grieve my best friend. I haven't had a day of restful sleep or without crying and and wailing into a pillow for two days. I'm really hoping you guys have any advice, and I thank you in advance."	No
1219	Hello all. My roommate is wanting to sue me for unpaid rent (three months) in Texas. Our TAA lease was a co-sign, where it does not state who pays what or how much. Our relationship ended on awful terms with her saying she'd be happy to take over the rent if I wanted to leave (I have multiple text messages over this).   Our lease ends today 7/31/17 and so I went to look at the property before turning in my key (moved out three months ago) and now one of her friends and dog are staying there (against the lease- which I have video evidence of her stating she's been staying there- also showing her belongings in the spare room)  The property management company did a walk through three days ago (before the lease was up) to assess security deposit refund. I have been upset with this, because my roommate is still living on the property and they are allowing her to lease the home starting 8/1/17. Meaning she does not have to move out and they assessed the property with her belongings still there (how that works - I have no idea) but the management company assured me I will get a full deposit back. Guess I will have to wait 30 days to see if this holds true.  I also have evidence of her tampering with and opening my mail (all in text messages) as well as throwing the document away (all admitted to in a text message). As well as evidence of her dog living there for over a year and not being on the lease.  I guess I'm just wanting to make sure/ see what I should be doing in the meantime so that if she does trying to sue me I can have a fair fight.   I paid $1450 total in deposits and she paid $525 total. She has agreed to now split the deposit evenly distributed by who paid what in the original deposits but is stating she's going to take me to small claims court for the three months rent. Will that even hold up in court with all of the evidence I have against her?  She also didn't ask for this rent money until after already paying all of the rent on the lease term. And has made claims since the 18th of the month that she will be suing me for unpaid rent.   I think I got all the important details down. This is just stressing me out and I feel like I've done nothing wrong. Not sure what to do from here.	No
1220	"To my shame upon moving into my current home I didn't think it was super important to have my name on the lease, my boyfriend signed his when I wasn't home.    The landlord saw us view the apartment together and even referred to us as tenants on the phone when we both payed rent in full about a week early.   My belongings are here. I have nowhere to go. Last night ex called the police because I was annoyed with him and we argued, after he held the ""lease"" thing over me he threatened to kick me out, started grabbing my stuff etc. I dared him to call the police (I thought he would smarten up because he has illegal things in the house and the last time he called the police they were very kind to me and told him to leave)   An RCMP officer yelled at me that I have no right to be in the apartment if he doesn't want me there. I explained that I pay half rent and that boyfriend won't deny that but the officer said that doesn't matter because my name isn't on the lease. Since I had nowhere to go, the ex said he would leave for the night until 12am. He is now telling me that I can stay as long as I'm not such a bitch.    I need to know if this is legal. I've heard about squatters rights and all the ridiculous rights renters have. But can I legally be kicked out onto the street of my own home where I live and own things because I don't have my name on the lease?"	No

1222	"I have a fairly high end computer (custom built) that was a few years old.   Recently I started having lots of issues with it and upon further troubleshooting/inspection noticed some of the modular connections on my power supply were melted.  Oddly enough the machine continued to limp along until I made this discovery.  The power supply is a ""high end"" 1000W and had a 5 year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. Was a fairly painless transaction.  My issues persisted even with the new power supply (instability, etc)   I tried my ram sticks one at a time and the issue continued with all four and so I figured my motherboard had been damaged (in hindsight i should have bought all new ram at the same time)  Being a high end X99 platform it made sense to just replace the motherboard as any kind of an upgrade would be very expensive and not much gain to me as I just use it for office/IT tech work and gaming.  The replacement motherboard did not fix the issue so I started to suspect my ram/processor.  I am awaiting a replacement processor from Intel and new ram from amazon.  I have been in contact with a seemingly helpful/friendly person from the PSU company and had originally shipped them my motherboard for further inspection. I have not yet heard back their diagnosis on the motherboard but regardless I will not be using it again.  I emailed them today and explained everything ive done and money it has cost me and i've asked what they can do for me.   If they don't offer a reasonable settlement to this matter is it a good idea to sue them in small claims court? I have spent many hours troubleshooting and dealing with this system including loss of productivity at work from having to use my laptop which is not ideal for IT work.   In hind sight I should have just bought all new components right away after the PSU failure and then tried to work out compensation with them but I opted to try to fix it one part at a time."	No
1223	Kind of strange situation. Girl friend and I lived in a small 1br apt. 555/month, cheap for the area for 3 years. Literally our last month the owner sold and changed management companies, giving our deposit to this new person who we would have otherwise no contact with.   Checked out with new manager 5/30 returned keys. Apt was very clean aside from the oven had some burnt stuff inside which was documented.   We've contacted new manager twice regarding our deposit and gotten no where so I looked up the owner using public records and mailed him [this letter via certified mail] (http://i.imgur.com/LgT1Mz7.png) basically asking for 1000 dollars citing **MN statute 504B.178.** It's been over twice the 21 days MN allows, I want to make sure my demands are reasonable.  What are next steps assuming he doesn't respond?	No
1224	Massachusetts renter here.   I recently had to vacate long time apartment due to sale of the home. Had lived in apartment for 8 years, and was in a month to month agreement with landlord. Received 30 notice to vacate on July 6th, found new apartment and moved out on July 28th.  Prior to moving landlord made some comments about his eagerness to retain my security deposit, which came out of left field, as I've been a model tenant for the entirety of my time renting (rent paid in full/on time every WEEK for 8 years)   When I left the apartment I left 5 larger pieces of furniture (bed/frame , bureau, hutch, love seat, and computer desk) that I had no room and/or use for in my new apartment.   Landlord had previously reached out to me and told me he would be away from August 5th (date I needed to be out of apartment) until some time this week.   He called me yesterday to confirm that I was out of the apartment, I told him I was/had been since the 28th, and also explained about the larger pieces of furniture, and suggested that he used the security deposit to pay someone to remove them.   He had since called me multiple times (I have not answered) and left 2 aggressive messages, threatening to file eviction proceedings if I do not remove my property.   I am not living in the home from which he is threatening to evict, I have up to date rent receipt  for the past 8 years showing I do not owe him $$, and I believe I am well within my rights to leave the property and abandon my deposit. I have spent well over $3000 on moving expenses over the past month, and frankly cannot afford to spend several hundred dollars to dispose of my old property, especially without knowing whether I will recoup my security deposit or not.   Am I within my rights, or could I possibly lose an eviction case, despite not living in the property?	No
1225	I would appreciate anyone/everyone's thought on my situation. I am not sure if I should discuss this with an attorney at this point.  My apartment sent a renewal contract by forgot to add a number (instead of $1500/month, they wrote $500/month). I signed it and sent it back to them for their signature. Management has now signed the new lease keeping this lower amount. According to the lease, any changes have to be done as amendment, in writing, signed by both parties.  Legally, does the apartment complex have the right to challenge this? Do you recommend I hire an attorney preemptively? I live in Texas. Any thoughts would be appreciated.	No
1226	Hello everyone,  Long time lurker (on other accounts), first time poster here.  I live in a building that has developed a substantial mold problem. We've contacted our landlord but the repairs they've provided have not been sufficient.  My roommates and I have tested the mold ourselves (DIY kit via Amazon) and confirmed dangerous spores in our apartment.  I'm looking for recommendations on organizations to contact and get some student lawyers to assist me in this case and do some work with the landlord and company on my behalf. If it's not pro-bono, ok fine, but I just need to be pointed in the right direction.  There are websites I've found initially, but I don't really know what to trust (I've never had to do any kind of legal battling myself). Like [Lawyer's Committee For Better Housing](http://lcbh.org/) and [Center for Renter's Rights](https://www.renters-rights.com/chicago/). (Any advice related to these sites would be helpful).  If you'd like additional details regarding the situation, I will provide what I can. Thank you for your time.	No
1227	In the lease agreement it states that the landlord is responsible for taking care of garbage. It was only after moving in that the garbage company said that we need to put things in a special bag that costs like $15-20 bucks for 5 of them or they won't take the garbage away. Shouldn't the landlord have to supply the bags or take care of the garbage if it's left out? I honestly am curious and don't like wasting money.	No
1228	First off, thank you for taking the time to read over my ordeal. Basically, I have a loose gravel driveway, and my wife and I are sick of tracking in dirt in the house. It’s seriously like a sandy beach in here. So I call around to a bunch of businesses, but I couldn’t find a concrete company to give me the time of day because everyone is slammed with business. Some companies were even sending me off with “I know a guy who knows a guy, his name is Jimmy, he might be able to help”. So I’m doing some more in depth Googling (Ha!), and I come across a website called Thumbtack. You type what it is that you need, and they send contractors your way. Too easy. I get a guy and he’s out at my house immediately that afternoon. He’s eager for the job, and quotes me $3975 for a new driveway. It’s 70 feet long, and 15 feet wide, with an additional slab on the side of our carport that is 20 feet long, and 4 feet wide. I couldn’t find a consistent number online that could give me a ball park price, so when Rudy comes out and gives me that price, I was pretty happy about it.    Rudy said he was brand new to Thumbtack, so that’s why he didn’t have any ratings, but that he was licensed, bonded, and insured (he insisted that he wouldn’t be able to operate without it). I was hesitant because Rudy comes off as a fast talker, but decided to give him my business because he is a fellow veteran, and he needs the work. No biggie, I’m happy to help someone in a tight spot. Rudy explained that the job would be easy as there is no tear up (of existing concrete), and he would “take care of [me]” by pouring it 6 inches thick, and giving me wire mesh which came with a 2 year warranty. He says he’ll get his Bobcat out here, and it’ll go by real quick. I agree, so he sends me a contract, and asks for $2050 up front for materials, along with some photos of work that he’s done. I know you know where this is going, hang tight.    I signed the contract and sent the money. Let’s go over the contract. What I linked is exactly what he sent. An MS Word, piece of hot garbage. They spelled my name wrong, spelled his name wrong, so I kicked it back and they fixed it, no biggie. Shortly after, he emailed me my receipt. He then calls me back and says that he needs $25 more to cover the credit card charges, fuck it, I’m excited to get a new driveway, so I agree (I know, just hush).     The next day (13JUL2017), Rudy and his crew are out at my house at 9 am sharp. There’s a cranky old guy who’s got something like 50 years in the business, and two Mexicans who speak like 3 words of English. Everyone was cool, the Mexican guys were like a slapstick duo, talking shit to one another, and the old guy constantly bitching about them under his breath. I eventually brought out coffee, ice water, and oranges because when I used to do construction (pool enclosures), it was nice to do work for a homeowner who cared. I quickly noticed there was a lack of aforementioned Bobcat, so no dirt was getting dug, and Hose A and Hose B (that’s how cranky old man introduced them) were filling up a cracked and warped Rubbermaid tub full of dirt and sliding it back and forth between the side of the house and filling in the driveway. Again, me being an understanding person, I assumed that Rudy had his Bobcat out at another project (which I was correct), so I allowed his crew to use all my tools and wheelbarrow to make things go faster. I didn’t mind because I knew forming wasn’t going to take all day, and they’d be done in a few hours.    About that time I notice cranky old guy laying down 2x4s. I walked up to him and asked him how thick the concrete was going to be. He said 4 inches. I said no, I signed a contract for 6 inches, and showed him. He said I’d have to talk to Rudy, because he wasn’t sure. So Rudy pulls up about 15 minutes later, and I ask him again about the thickness. He reassured me that the concrete would indeed be 6 inches thick, to not worry, because when it’s poured, it’ll “SINK DOWN”, and it’ll be 6 inches when he’s done. So I kept it in the back of my head, because it sounded like some cock and balls bullshit. Around 2 pm, the crew finishes forming up and Rudy walks up to me. He explains that, since the side of the house didn’t have any gravel like the front, it’s going to cost a little extra because he’s going to need more concrete, because it’s going to sink deeper into the soft ground back there. Ok, that one really threw up some red flags. That’s twice he’s asked for more money. I told him I would talk it over with the wife. What I really did was call around to about 5 different concrete companies. Each and every single one of them confirmed what I knew deep down inside: the guy is a scam artist, he’s taking me for my money, concrete sets at the thickness in which you pour it (i.e. it doesn’t sink), and that a contract is a contract, and I am not obligated to pay more than what I signed for.    So embarrassed and downright ashamed of myself, I go online to see what can be done legally with people like him. I click on an Angie’s List article dealing with concrete repair scams, and LOW AND FUCKING BEHOLD, there is the exact same picture headlining the article that he sent to me, which he claimed was a previous project of his. Now I’m really pissed. I look back over the photos and my receipts, and wouldn’t you know it, at the bottom of the receipt is where he forged my signature. It’s so blatantly obvious that it was forged, it’s down right insulting.    Here’s my conundrum: I’m no attorney, but I believe technically he hasn’t broken the contract yet because the concrete isn’t poured. It’s just 2x4s outlining the driveway. So I don’t think I have any ground to stand on by demanding my money back, do I? Either I want a complete refund, or I (reluctantly) want him to do the job that I paid him to do. I’m planning on calling him first thing tomorrow morning and recording the conversation. I called the bank, and they said they can open a dispute and refund me my money, but the ultimate decision would be left to the case manager as to whether or not I’m in the right (seeing as how I willingly agreed to give this person my money).  Before he left, Rudy asked if he could finish the job on Monday because he had to go to Miami for the weekend, and couldn’t coordinate the cement trucks until late Friday night. So I said yes, that’s not a problem. He also asked me to call him later that night to let him know about the extra charges, and what I wanted to do. So I called twice and no answer.   What are my options?    [The Contract] (http://imgur.com/a/FPP5O)	No
1229	"Police saw I had a fake or otherwise not mine, parking pass one day while I wasn't with my car. Long story short They found me a week later in my car about to leave it on the street in a 2hour parking. I didn't give it to them but I may have given them enough information to meet the low standard of probable cause. The officer wanted to meet with me later in the week so I could hand him the pass and, ""aren't in any trouble just want the pass"". I talked to two criminal attorneys that said to not meet or give up the pass to this guy. My thing is, during the initial talk I gave him my license to check and my cell phone #. If he does end up trying to call me my idea is to not answer. Not that the problem will necessarily go away but I don't want to give any more information to this guy. Thoughts?   If i get a criminal complaint, will be hiring a lawyer for the clerk hearing for sure."	No
1230	My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	No
1231	"I live in the state of Alabama, and we noticed yesterday around 3pm that there was a steady stream of water running down the parking lot. I immediately called the water company who was out within 30mins and he assisted me in determining that the break was on the Apartments side not the water company. So around 4pm I called the apartments emergency maintenance number and stated the issue on a voicemail machine. The ""head"" maintenance man came over around 4:40pm and said along the lines ""that it is Friday and he can't do the work by himself and everyone was gone that it would have to wait till first thing Monday morning"". The issue is we have no toilets, water for bathing, or can't even cook. My daughter has Celiac disease so all our cooking has to be done at home. We have used all our cook ware being 3 meals into the issue already, I have access to JAG but does no good being the weekend. My neighbors have already stated that if I make to many waves that I would be evicted for the smallest infraction they could find, so please if anyone has any sort of advice please help!"	No
1232	Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm just looking for some quick advice. Yesterday, I got pulled over in Crownpoint, Indiana for going 104 in a 70.(Yes, I know it was stupid and I learned my lesson). The officer that pulled me over said he was only going to give me a ticket instead of something worse. I'm just wondering how much the ticket would be since I have to wait four to six weeks. Also, since this is my very first offense, does it lower the price or anything? Don't know if this means anything, but I admitted fault to the officer and told him I was in the wrong. (I guess that's why I got off with just a ticket and not a misdemeanor or anything.) Thanks in advance.	No
1233	I met my girlfriend in high school and we've been together for about a year now. Before she dated me she dated somebody else who had problems. They broke up because he physically abused her and cheated on her.  A while back, I want to say about four or five months ago, he began stalking her. Circumstance had it set that while they were dating, he activated some kind of software on her phone and was able to completely bug her. Anyone's voice or location could be visible/audible when in the vicinity of this phone. He used it to track her down and try god-knows-what. He hit her one time while I was at work. There was a police report and all this and that, and an emergency restraining order.   This is really only the spark-notes of it. There was a lot more going on. A lot of nights I went without sleep and jumping at every creek and bump in the night. Since then, however, (As far as we know) this bug as been disabled and we got her a new phone for the time being.  Recently, this phone broke and, after wiping her old phone clean (New iCloud account, all this Apple jargon that I can't decipher being an android man) she switched back to it. We're planning on moving here soon so getting these luxuries aren't primarily on our minds.  Now, since having been switched back to Phone A, this stalking continues. She lives with me now and we're planning to move out of state, so I feel like I have a better grasp on her safety. Still, these texts come and go of this stalker begging to see her, come drop off old memorabilia, just one last talk, etc etc. Through chance(?) he's ran into her while running errands, and threats of macing out of self defense were thrown around. He often texts me trying to get under my skin, but beyond that he's afraid of me and rightly so. My blood is boiling typing this out. Again the long nights of no sleep and investigating every minor sound and dog bark continue. I feel like I'm driving myself nuts. I always keep an ear out for any movement, vibration, whatever in this house. Thankfully she stays with good friends or my mother while I'm at work.  I'm scared and angry. What do we do?  Throwaway, because hey. This stalker scrambles for our social media at every chance.	No
1234	I rent a condo in Chicago. It is a private owner, but I have never met him. He hired a leasing/management company to manage my unit. They're pretty bad. I notify them, they wait a month to come out. This led to a huge water leak that went un-treated for a month.  I know who the owner is because I sometimes get his old mail.   The management company is trying to come after me for the damages and is saying he is really unhappy. I have a feeling they are claiming I never notified them.   Is is a breach of anything for me to reach out to the landlord?	No
1235	This is Washington State, US.   I applied to work for a company called [Fun Flicks](http://funflicks.com/). It was a strange process to get this job. The interview was conducted outside and was really casual. It seemed too easy to get the job. It was an unusually small amount of time from application to being on board. Almost all of our communication has been via text, and I have not been shown the building they operate out of. I gave them my application with some sensitive information on it, that's all I am worried about. None of the information seemed out of the ordinary for a job application, but it is still concerning. They said I was 'on board' in May, and nothing happened after that besides some texting about the position. The last time we talked was a month ago. It all seems very odd. I can't even find one in Washington on Google maps. Either they are sort of unprofessional, or something sinister is afoot. What can I do to check the legitimacy of this company/job offer? Is there even a scam like this? Thanks	No
1236	Lenexa, KS  Long story short.... Brand New Apartment 8/12 months completed of lease.  Rain Storm 6/17- Caused water to come in through window damaging walls, floors, and bedding wet. Call apartment complex, said they would send someone out from the onsite contractors.   7/12- Another storm- same result. Once again contacted property management said they were not sure what to do, and would be fixed within the week. Dropped off a $50 gift card.  7/22- Another storm- Same result however I was not home to move things out of the way, and my bed has been damaged along with floor, walls.  I am concerned with the growth of mold because I have severe asthma. I have looked at the tenant handbook from the state, not much help.   I have spoken with executive leaders of the property management and they could care less.  What are options in terms of course of action to get out of lease and pursue damages?	No
1237	Hey r/legaladvice,  A few weeks ago, our A/C went out, and our Landlord was very prompt in getting it fixed. Cue a couple inspections from the city, her, and the A/C company.  Anyway, I'm at work right now, and my landlord just sent an email (she inspected the house today while me and my three roommates were at work) with her reactions to our house.  Here's the weird bit: one of my roommates locked his door before he left, and she went into his room and complained about an odor and the general uncleanliness. Now, she's not demanding or threatening anything, but it does seem questionable. Aside from this, we've gotten along decently with her. But this seems like an invasion of privacy.  What do you think? Are we overreacting? Or did she breach our privacy?	No
1238	In the fall of 2015 I found myself in a situation where I needed to get a new car. The car that I had been driving needed so much work done to it, that for me it wasn’t worth fixing. At the time I was also taking care of medical bills that had piled up while I was out of work the previous year, and my credit wasn’t in the place it is now, so I couldn’t get approved for a loan myself. My girlfriend at the time offered to take a car loan out in her name that I would make the payments on. At the time there was no signed agreement between her and I made regarding me making the payments, and my name wasn’t on the car loan whatsoever. I was only an insured driver on her policy, something she did to make her own insurance less expensive, while also making it easier on me. I drove the car and made the payments on time every month for a year, until September of 2016.   Long story short, she was unhappy in the relationship and suggested I move out, which lead to us ultimately breaking up very shortly after I moved out. Of course, this resulted in me returning the car to her. She decided to sell the car at a loss very quickly so she didn’t have to deal with it, while making me feel as though I had to reimburse her for the money she lost on the sale. She drafted up an agreement at the time, saying the amount that I owed her, with a payment plan. Having been completely blindsided by her request to me move out, I wasn’t in a clear headspace and very depressed. I was out of the apartment that I had lived in for two years, she kept both of our cats that we had (one of which was MY LIFE), and I had no car.   For reasons I can’t explain now, I felt obligated to agree to and sign her agreement. I have begrudgingly sent her a check for $200 every month for the past 14 months, all the while thinking the agreement that we have is unfair. I’ve done some research on signed agreements, and feel as though hers has holes in it, but am not sure. The agreement doesn’t detail what the money is for. The agreement provides an address that I am to send the payment to, but that has changed since the agreement began. (One of the bullet points on the agreement state “Any modifications to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.”) I don’t feel like I’m legally obligated to pay her back for a car she sold that didn’t have my name anywhere on it, especially since there was no signed agreement in the beginning, when I originally got the car.    I have a copy of the agreement, and can retype (changing names) and send as a PM.	No
1239	"Hi Reddit! I posted a similar thread a few weeks ago over in a relationships thread - but I have a follow-up post as well as sneaking some advice. We live in Santa Monica, Los Angeles.   In short, my boyfriend and I just moved to a nicer, higher rent area. We were disappointed to find out that upstairs neighbor (""Alexandria"") is AirBnB'ing her place and the high traffic of guests make us feel uncomfortable. The guests have to walk in front of our front door/bedroom to get to our neighbors' place. There was like a new family/guest almost every three nights. While the guests are mostly quiet, they always seem to come in and out at weird hours which gets annoying. We have approached our neighbor but nothing has changed. She doesn't seem to care about our comfort.  I should also mention that AirBnB'ing is also illegal in Santa Monica, not to mention violating the terms of our agreement.   Since nothing changed - my boyfriend and I decided to email the AirBnB listing to our landlord and her husband. The immediately called us, appreciated our efforts, and said that they would shut this down. They confirmed that the listing has been removed. They also said that they would leave our names out of it.  Alexandria has since moved back in and we have seen a lot more of her these last few weeks.  So apparently Alexandria also has a dog and smokes on property. Again, she's violating MORE terms on the lease agreement. It's also illegal to smoke in apartments in Santa Monica.   We live in a little enclave environment - so we can hear the dog all the time and smell the smoke.   Honestly, my boyfriend and I wouldn't care if she smokes or has a dog or even Air BnB *if she kept it more secret*. Instead, we have to deal with the smoke, the dog, as well as random people walking by our front door almost every other day (until the AirBnB was shut down). I want to reiterate that we just moved to the neighborhood and pay much higher in rent; if we knew this was happening we wouldn't have moved here!  Anyways, my boyfriend and I decided to stay quiet about the smoking and dog.... until a few days ago. Alexandria left her dog out in the little courtyard area right in front of our apartment. She left it there for a good while (over an hour). It was barking and whimpering. My boyfriend works from home and got fed up. He sent Alexandria a text that said:  ""Hi Alexandria. Your dog is barking right outside our window. I am trying to work and this is very distracting. I would appreciate it if you collected your dog. Cheers""  No response. Alexandria came down 15 minutes later, got her dog, and went back upstairs.  An hour later, she knocks at our front door and proceeds to go on absolute tirade at my boyfriend. Here are some the highlights from her incoherent outburst:  - She told us to lose her number and that we will need a lawyer ""for harassing"" her so much. (THE FUCK?)  - She told us that we need to move out and live on a farm if we can't handle ""the typical happenings of a neighbor""  - She repeatedly told us that we were evil and that we need to ""GET OUT""  - She said that's she's going to be the miserable neighbor and make our lives a living hell  - She said we complain too much - to which my boyfriend responded, ""What are you talking about?"" She goes ""You know - the dog, the smoking, the AirBnB!"" My boyfriend replied ""What AirBnB?"" She goes ""Whatever.""  My boyfriend remained calm the entire time (bless his heart). We were both trying to stifle laughter because we couldn't believe how ridiculous she was being.  The only correspondence we've with Alexandria is on two occasions 1) We offered to buy her a rug to help quell the noise upstairs from all her guests; she gladly took our $100  and 2) a text message about the dog. That's it. The correspondence has been nothing but polite. Lots of ""thank yous"" and smiley faces.   ANYWAYS. Here's the kicker. About a month ago when we noticed the AirBnB ramping up - **we decided to purchase a security camera.** Thank goodness we did that, because we got her whole outburst on video.  From the looks of it, it appears that she basically ADMITTED on camera to smoking, having a dog, and AirBnB'ing. (BTW, we have never complained to her or the landlord about smoking or the dog...)  We immediately sent the security footage video to our landlords. They called us immediately afterwards and said that they will ""deal with it.""   Interestingly enough, Alexandria left for vacation the very next morning.  We suspect that Alexandria will get evicted at this point. That issue is between Alexandria and the landlords.  My boyfriend and I are wondering what else we can do to protect ourselves in the event that Alexandria tries to sue us for harassment. Should we make the first move here since we have documented proof of her acting crazy? Should we send this footage (of her threatening us) to the police? Should we try to get a retraining order first? Should we send all the evidence of her AirBnB'ing illegally? We realize that we have some ammunition here, but we want to make sure we use it in the smartest way possible. We are also worried about her retaliating. The previous tenant was never around so Alexandria was able to get away with having a dog/AirBnBing/smoking/etc. for many years until we moved in. I worry that she will try to seek revenge (she just seems like that type of person, we have a gut feeling about this).  My boyfriend and I have somehow NEVER had to deal with a crazy neighbor in all our apartment-living in Los Angeles. We appreciate all your help."	No
1240	Hello, Im in Ontario, Canada.  I have an idea for a business (a solution to the adblock problem).  I am not in a position to make my own company or pay for a prototype to be built.  I was considering using the idea as leverage (lets assume the idea is good) to get a job with an advertising agency that could actually utilize it.  My issue is if I reveal my idea and the company just runs with it without me, would I have any legal recourse? (I am assuming not)  And if not, how could I approach this in a way to cover myself? Would provisional patent be relevant?  The idea in question is pretty basic (in fact I am shocked that no one is doing it) so it would be very easy to steal.  Any advice?	No
1241	My former roommates and I rented a house for one year, and we moved out at the end of May as the lease said.  Only days ago we received separate invoices telling us how much money we would get back after damages to the house, late fees, etc.  We want to go to small claims and get either our full security deposit back or double the amount as per NH law.  Am I correct that the law says we should get double our security deposits back because we received no deposit or invoice within a month of us leaving the premises?   My only concerns are that they might argue the damages took longer than 30 days to fix (a couple fist sized holes in the wall) or our lease didn't specify how long they could take to return our deposits, but are those points legit?	No
1242	I am a resident of Virginia and am being harassed by my abusive ex who lives in Indiana. When our relationship ended four years ago, I was granted a no contact order and a temporary restraining order; I left the state shortly after and thought that was the end of it. He has recently begun harassing me again via phone calls and texts from various numbers. I have changed my number twice and he managed to get the new number both times. Is there any legal recourse from a different state?	No
1243	"Hi everyone! This story takes place in Los Angeles, CA.  To spare you some reading time, I'll present some bullet-points about my landlord to give you all an idea of who I am dealing with:   - Lost in court against my former neighbors after it was found that he was illegally raising their rent. Was forced to pay over $5,000.  - Berated another tenant for not paying him on the 1st of the month (even though she left her check in the dropbox at 10pm on the 1st) and insulted her special needs son.  - Attempted to evict another tenant and gave her 14 days to leave the premises under threat of keeping the entirety of her security deposit. She ended up calling the Sheriff and was able to remain in the building...she still left as soon as she could.  - Complained to tenants about all of the legal fees he's accrued and why this caused him to raise costs in our Laundry Room.   - Took out the grass in the front of the building and paved it over to create a parking spot without any notice of the intensive construction to tenants. We had to use milk crates as steps during this time and dirt was caked over anything that was left outside the building...our cars in the carport included.  Now, my question is related to the last issue. The area in which he created the driveway to the new parking spot is next to a street sweeping sign put in place by the city. Today, I was awakened by the sound of a saw and, when I looked out over my balcony, I saw my landlord removing the street sweeping sign. He quickly replaced it with two new signs: one that states ""Active Driveway: Tow-Away Zone"" and another that says ""No Parking Anytime"". They look authentic but were definitely put in place by him.  Now, I get that he's got a right to create this driveway, however, he placed the sign in front of a perfectly good parking space. As some of you might not know, street parking in Los Angeles is hard to come by and finding parking on our street is damn near impossible. My roommates and I only get two parking spaces for our 3 Bedroom apartment so we utilized this space often, usually the moment it opened up after street sweeping.  So, can I report him removing the street sweeping sign? I also don't think he got a permit for the construction of the driveway, can I report this as well? Or am I an asshole tenant and is this just a lost cause and I should just look into new apartments even sooner than I was planning to?"	No
1244	"to start off, my landlords are terrible people. They own roughly 40 rental properties in my town of around 10k people. I have know many people who have rented from them, and have spoken with various city officials who all agree that these guys are slumlords. In the almost 4 years I have lived in my house, the roof has never been leak free, and the only time they have ever gotten anything minor repaired was the afternoon they sent an unlicensed handyman/meth dealer (who i later found out was about to be charged with child abuse) to my home. why do I stay? Well, since finding the house I am in (3 bed, 2 bath, fenced yard, 2 car detached garage) rent has skyrocketed in my town. I would be lucky to find a shitty 2 bedroom apartment for the amount i pay- which is $650.  About me: I am a newly single mom. My ex left right after our 3rd son was born, and I am trying to make the best of it.    Where I am going with this: my 4 year old son had to have a physical to start kindergarten in the fall, he tested positive for lead poisoning. I then had my other two boys checked, and my oldest son also has elevated blood lead levels. their levels were 8 and 9... which is serious, but not serious enough to start living our lives from inside hazmat suits. So, I bought some lead paint tests. .. Well, there is a lot of lead paint in my house. its everywhere, and all very unstable (cracking, crumbling, peeling). And most of it is in places where it can easily become airborne, inside window sills, and door jambs. I am a in shock.  I must be so naive. I never received a lead paint disclosure (which i have in past rental situations). And shortly after i moved in I found out that the house had in the recent past, burned.. and had (as far as i understood) been gutted and remodeled, while salvaging the pretty painted victorian woodwork. I thought the chipped paint inside the window sills was just caused by rainwater entering over the years. because typically you find lead paint underneath many many coats of newer, safer paint. but here, there is only one layer.  Anyway, after telling my landlords, who have never given a shit about anything.. they are all of a sudden my new best friends, but keep showing up at my house without notice to confront me and ""iron out a plan"". they told me to just keep sweeping and vacuuming up the dust which, the EPA, poison control, and the health department have specifically told me not to do. that i needed to remove the dust by wet wiping as to not create airborne dust particles.   My landlords are hiring a painting company that as far as google shows, has been permanently shut down... and when i asked my landlords if the company was EPA lead-safe certified, they immediately showed up at my door and offered to move me to another property, a much nicer 4 bedroom house, and match the rent i pay now, and that they would give me my deposit back outright, and waive my deposit there. But they never answered me about whether or not this company is certified to safely treat lead paint in a home where children reside... these guys keep ambushing me, to talk when i don't know what I am doing, and furthermore I have no options. I am literally at their mercy, because i have no where else to go. and I know that they are going to further endanger my kids, so that they can save a buck.  so, in addition to my problems, I started thinking about what their other tenants may be going through without realizing... I have asked a couple former tenants and they never received disclosures either. Most of the properties they own were built in the early 1900s so, I am sure they do contain lead paint. could we potentially have a class-action law-suit? Should i go knock on doors? I am morally obligated to report them to the EPA, my kids and others' could have life long injuries due to their negligence.  but i am really really scared of doing it.  like I said, I have nowhere to go, and I am afraid they are going to start working on the house just to make me uncomfortable and eventually force me out. I have in the 4 years definitely violated the terms of my month to month lease. I have cats, and have made improvements to the house without permission..  but they have done nothing but compliment me on what a model tenant i am, and how well I keep the house... so.  any advice is greatly appreciated. I apologize for the rambling and altogether disorganized thoughts. I likely have much higher blood lead levels than my kids, so that's my excuse.  please ask any questions you may have, and thanks!"	No
1245	So here goes: The apartment complex where my wife and I currently live (central KY) was recently sold to a new investment company. After hearing various whispers in the wind of evictions, I decided to stop by the leasing office and see what's actually going on. Seems the new investors have decided to serve each building a 30-day notice stating they should terminate their lease early, receive a full reimbursement of security deposit, and then the building will be torn apart for renovation. The other option is to remain for the duration of your lease and slowly be driven to death or insanity by construction both in and around your home. Being that we have a baby on the way, choice 2 is unlikely.  All this said, how do I proceed with option 1? Does my landlord owe me relocation expenses? Should I quietly pack my things and be happy I don't have to pay an early termination fee?	No
1246	Good evening,  Apologies if this has been answered already or with a simple google search but I come here because my fiancé and I are in a bit of a weird situation.   My sisters significant other wants to gift us a house for our wedding present but doesn't want to do so for a few years (he said it was until they moved for some reason ). My fiancé and I want to make sure that within these few years prior to being gifted the house that he doesn't turn around and kick us out for any old reason.   Tl;dr : can we have a contract written up where we can live in a house rent free and upon an agreed upon date be gifted the house	No
1247	I'm in the waiting room at the Regie du logement for an audience against my former landlord. My case is strong (we didn't have a bathroom ceiling for three months, I have tons of documentation and pictures.)  A representative from the management company who is not authorized to represent the landlord is here. She says the landlord is not available and the lawyer isn't either, and they tried to send me a request to reschedule in the mail but it was returned. She sent it to my old address (their location) even though I filed a change of address last year and the new address is available by looking up the file on the regie website.  What are my options here? I need to see the regisseur anyway to hopefully get my old roommate off the file (he lives in America.) Can I ask for them to decide the case without the landlord because he failed to notify me? Can I ask for even more moral damages for the delay, and if so, how much?  Thank you.	No
1248	I know someone who works at Walmart. They were fired for violating the patriot act according to Walmart. My Friend who I will name Bob(23)  is the Walmart worker. Bob's friend Stu is 16. Stu's dad wanted to send him some money but couldn't because he isn't 18. Instead Stu's dad sends the money to Bob, Bob then signs for the wired money while on break (isn't the issue). Stu also signs the wire transfer. Walmart then fires Bob for violating the Patriot Act and alleges money laundering. Stu was using the money to buy something at the store. Did Bob violate the patriot act?	No
1249	I'm asking for my friend since we're not sure.   On July 1st, she spoke with the manager and got the okay to extend the rent until July 14th. Yesterday she received a eviction notice to pay or quit, but it didn't include late fees like it did the last time (8 months ago, under different management).    And also, the rent amount is wrong. It's supposed to be 1028.46 but the manager put 1024.86 cents. She's fine with paying the correct amount, but there isn't a late fee included. Thanks in advance :)   Her lease does include late fees, but not sure if eviction notice walls under that or if it has to be precise on wording.	No
1250	"Hi! First and foremost, my name is Tyler and I'm happy to meet you all. I've heard from a few friends of mine that this sub tends to point people in the right direction who need it, so hopefully, we can figure something out!  Okay, so, here goes. My GF and I have been together for roughly three years. As long as I can remember, the schedule has always been with her kids (not mine, even though I love them as such), that we get them on the weekends.   This is something that we communicated to our landlord when we signed the lease, and it was something he was very much aware of. Now, this is where it starts to get muddled. We had a 6 month term lease, nothing too out of the ordinary on it with things looking decent. Tbh, we got this place sort of as a last minute steal, so we were very happy.  After the 6 month lease was over, he called us in to talk to him. Now, another important factor here, is that our landlord LITERALLY lives in front of us. We live in his backyard, kinda. He had an office for a business that he used to run, and it became bankrupt. With that, he had an empty space to offer us, and he did.   Now, I checked the guy out, making sure he was clean. He had a few bad hits on his record, like road aggression, but he had a strange charge with traveling or waiting too close to a school. I can get the actual charge number as well if that would help.   Anyways, he seemed cool enough, but when we talked to him about renewal, he had mentioned that we were no longer going to do a 6 month lease, and that we would switch to a month to month. It was a little bit fishy there, but whatever. I trusted him and I never thought he would kick us out with only two weeks to find a new place. He placed a notice on our doorstep saying:  July 15, 2017  ""By this writing, this is notification that in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement entered into on the 1st day of July, 2017, between [all parties], per item no. 15, you are in hereby in default of the agreement.  As of this date you are being notified that this Lease Agreement is null and void. You have until July 31, 2017 by 6:00 pm to vacate the premises...""  There was more, but the important part is what No. 15 is: Rental agreement is for tenant's only. Any other persons staying on property ninety-six (96) hrs., or more than four (4) days per month, is subject to additional charges at the rate of 20$ per occupant, unless landlord has agreed.""  Now, we've talked about this with him. Since the beginning, we've had the kids every weekend, almost every month. They're sweet, sweet kids (besides the point), and they were here on Summer vacation. Now, on like, the 5th day, they decided to leave that notice.   What do I do? Tbh, to me, that no. 15 isn't very clear. Does that mean we pay it at the end of the month along with our rent? Do we notify him ahead of time? For the second, we did, we told him summer vacation is coming up and we have the kids, and he told us that was fine. Perhaps, this was his plan from the beginning.  What do I do, and is there anything I can do?"	No
1251	"So a little backstory here, my neighbor is in her late 20s and ever since she moved in I haven't paid her much attention due to the fact that she is white trash...  constantly blaring rap music and yelling at her kids all kinds of obscenities.  The other day a few of these kids were in our backyard swearing and woke up my gf so she went out there and told them to beat it and they told her to fuck off, etc.  The kids are like 11 and younger.. but then the mom comes out cussing and swearing at my gf and they exchange some words.    On the weekend my gfs daughter who is 8 and has some mental issues went outside to play with her friend who also lives in the neighbourhood and I hear my crazy bitch neighbor cussing at her as soon as she walked out the door.  I lost my shit and went out there and told her if she was gonna talk shit to an 8 year old she could talk shit to me.  She proceeded to tell me her ""niggers"" would be by later to handle me and all this other crap.  Anyways, fast forward a few days and literally anytime I leave my house to head to work, take out trash, anything this bitch starts yelling from her backyard or her windows all kinds of crazy shit.  I've been ignoring it for the most part but it's annoying as hell when I'm just trying to live my life here and any chance she gets she and her kids are harassing me, my gf and her little one.  I have hesitated on contacting police as I know she's the type that would just start calling me cop caller or something else instead..  anyone have any legal advice or any options on what I could do?  I've thought about video taping from my phone every time I go outside but it's kind of obvious and could escalate the situation..  I'm open to anything though, any advice is much appreciated..  thanks."	No
1252	"My ex found this low-income apartment last September (2016) and needed to make sure I could stay there, too.  For it to remain low-income and affordable, I couldn't be included on the lease or it wouldn't be possible, as we would make too much money(?) although I am disabled, do not currently work, and receive SSI.  This was discussed with the landlord, and was a huge part of why my ex chose this place, as the landlord and he had a verbal agreement I was allowed to live here.  The other issue was that I this is a no pet building, but the landlord took a pet deposit under the table ($250) so I wouldn't be departed from the cat I've had for over 10 years.  Fast forward to around mid-May, my ex and I decided to break-up, ending a 7-year-long relationship.  He was moving off to California to pursue a job opportunity and, knowing I couldn't afford this apartment on my own and with the lease up in early October, chose to pay the rent for me while I located a new place.  I've been working with a housing case manager and social worker to find housing for disabled persons, but it has been going insanely slow.  In addition to that, I have vocational rehabilitation for employment options so I am fairly heavily invested in staying at least within the area.  I ended up locating a new place, as in I met a couple who were really nice and we meshed well.  They needed me to fill out a background check with the landlord, who I discovered is also the landlord of the apartment I was currently staying in.  They told me the landlord said as long as I passed a criminal history check, I was fine.  No stress on my part, because I have nothing in my history.  The same day I met with the couple I filled out and returned the background check (July 10th.)  The receptionist I turned it in to (also the landlord's wife) saw that my address was in their building, and began to question me about not being on the lease, how/why I was living there.  I explained the situation, to which she suggested I try to find another place to live.  I told her the background check was for another property of theirs so that I could have a roommate situation, she reassured me to try to find a new place to live as back-up again.  Okay, I guess!  Weeks go by, the couple I am trying to room with says they have been trying to contact the landlord every other day about the background check.  They say each time they get some excuse (ex. ""He's very busy"" or ""He's on vacation."")  On July 22nd, for the 900th time the tenant above me is beating and screaming at their child, who is wailing loudly.  Things are banging against the wall, there is running, rumbling, yelling.  This is /not/ the first time and my ex has reported it as well.  He was basically told to be sympathetic about the single mother by the receptionist (landlord's wife.)  I call the receptionist (landlord's wife) to make a complaint.  She's /extremely/ salty with me over the phone, and straight up rude, saying I am not even supposed to be in that room.    The same day (July 22nd) she sends a letter to my ex, my ex tells me to open it, and the letter says in summary this:  ""tismtater is living in your apartment, we have no record of this.  tismtater can live here if you renew your lease with us for one year, but if not we are ""vacating"" her on August 1st.""  Now, prior to this letter I had no idea they were chucking me out.  We had been paying the rent and everything.  I start to think that I was being retaliated against for reporting the issue of the potential child abuse, and with the context of the letter being sent out the same day I reported it in addition to her attitude, I figured I may be right.  I make lots of calls, talk to my ex, talk to the potential roommate couple.  I tell my ex to cancel the lease because I am not comfortable being used as a bargaining chip to try to force him to renew the lease, he agrees, and he is well within his 60 days to cancel the lease anyways.    He calls up the landlord about the situation, the landlord vehemently denies ever saying I could live here, and says I can only live here if my ex renews the lease for a year.  My ex tries to bargain with him and tells him he has been paying the rent on time every month since September, and that he simply won't be here for two months while he pays for me to stay here.  Landlord tells him ""no"" and hangs up on him.  Well, considering I had that couple as roommate backups, I called them to check on the status of the background check the landlord hadn't been doing.  They called to tell me that the landlord told them he would absolutely not let me room with them, that he had rented to me before (except... he hasn't) and quoting them ""I absolutely won't let that one live here.""  The couple is very confused and irritated now, and ask him why?  Rather, they press him for answers as to why.  They jokingly ask if I killed someone, to which the landlord laughs and says no... but then says, ""I have had confrontations with Arab families in the past.""  First off, I am not Arab... but... okay.  I am a pale, freckly about-to-be-homeless person.  I have never met, spoken to, or even seen this landlord in my entire life.  Anywho, I have no interest in living in any of this psychopath's properties, but I need to know what I can do legally against this type of person and situation.  I am currently waiting to hear back from my housing case manager and social worker about some sort of expedited housing option, but it isn't sounding good.  Any advice would be appreciated."	No
1253	We have a rental property and just received a letter from our bank that the Strata has put a lien on it. When we contacted the building management company to find out what the lien was for, they told us there was a special levy 2 years ago for ~$1500, and the strata has since been adding fines (total of around $3500) for none payment.  The Strata said that they have sent us mail and called us every month about the none payment, but they were sending the mail to the property itself and have been calling the wrong number. We gave them all our correct contact information 3 years ago.  This is the second time this has happened, in 2014/2015 we had an outstanding balance with them, and they were using the wrong address to contact us. Once we found out (via a lien) we contacted them, paid the balance and gave them the correct contact information.  I doubt this is relevant, but the monthly strata fees have been paid without interruption the whole time as we setup an automatic payment for them.  We have no issue with paying the levy but we think that the fines are extortionate. To us it looks like they have been purposefully using the incorrect contact information so they have an excuse to apply new fines every month.  Unfortunately, when we gave them the updated contact information in 2015, the communication was all over the phone, so we don't have any hard proof  of this.  Is there anything we can do about the fines, or are we just screwed?	No
1254	"I accepted a job offer and started working there. They mentioned me having to sign a contract and they would be bringing one to me. It is 6 months since then and I still have not been approached by anyone.  In the electronic offer an email said this, ""This offer is contingent upon your signing a written employment agreement.""    I guess, I am worried if I left they would come after for all they have paid me since I never signed, or am I good?"	No
1255	"I moved out of my apartment at the end of July last year. I didn't get a statement about the deposit until the end of November. On the statement they gave me a ridiculous amount of charges, saying I owed $650~ on top of my $750 deposit. ($1200~ worth of damages!). Some of the charges were unclear, for instance a contractors fee? Which they still haven't explained even though I've asked them to twice. They also charged me for damages to doors, replacing 3 entire doors which were damaged when I moved in. There was a switch in owners during my time there and they said they had an inventory list from the previous owner which I also haven't seen. I emailed them within the 30 days of receiving the bill in December and they agreed to lower the amount owed to $242 about a month later in January. I still felt the amount was unfair and hadn't paid anything. I looked up their reviews and other customers have been reporting the same experience of ridiculous charges after moving out.  Now they have hired a debt collector attorney's office and are asking for the previous amount of $650~ plus interest. I talked to the office and told them I had emails discussing the amount owed and had it lowered to $242. They said I could send them a dispute. I sent them an email dispute explaining my situation and they sent a letter back saying they ""withdrew the offer with the reduction in fees for failure of payment"".   I've been in contact with my previous room mates parents who are saying that the 4 months it took for us to receive the initial bill and we shouldn't have to pay anything. The last thing I told them was that I sent the email disputing the amount but haven't told them yet that they raised the amount again. They sent a cease a desist request before I received this letter saying that legally they don't have a leg to stand on because they had all of our information to contact us but didn't send us a bill until 4 months after moving out, even though the charges were listed in August. The bill is dated late November.  I'm not sure they'll back down on these charges unless it's taken to court. What is the pricing like for an attorney for something like this? According to a Kansas statute if they must notify us of the status of the deposit within 30 days and failure to do so they should have to pay 150% of the deposit. They had our emails and phone numbers for both of us room mates and our co-payers but we received nothing for 4 months.   Do we have a case here to win the money?  TLDR: Landlord sent bill for damages 4 months after moving out which is too long in Kansas. The amount owed was disputed and agreed upon to be lower then they raised it again when hiring a debt collector. Needing advice about an attorney or at least to get them to cease and desist as my previous room mates parents say according to a Kansas statute they don't legally have legs to stand on."	No
1256	My lease expiring in four days has standard information about how tenants are responsible for professional carpet cleaning from an approved list. The approved list is an addendum piece to the rental agreement with one company listed. We signed this a year ago not knowing that this carpet cleaning company was run by the landlord's brother. I've called and he's quoting $650 to clean a 2-bedroom apartment, while other places I've called are saying it'll be more around $200. Is this enforcable/legal?	No
1257	"Hey guys, I need your help as I am super frustrated and losing my patience with my apartment complex.  I am currently living in an apartment complex in Florida. They recently came in to install ""updates"" to my apartment. The current one involved an upgrade to my kitchen. After they finished their install, the garbage disposal ceased to work. I assume it had to do with the install as it stopped working the day they finished the work. I submitted a service request soon thereafter along with another one for an exterior light outside my apartment that is out and leaves the hallway pitch black. A week went by with no response. I placed another request for the same services. Another week went by without a response.  I decided to email the front office staff through the portal we use to communicate/pay rent etc. with a letter regarding my disappointment with the lack of communication on their part and expressing my dissatisfaction. No response but the following day they sent out a maintenance worker to check out and I assume fix the problem. He came in and took a look and said, it seems to be an electrical issue and he'd need to come back the following day with his supervisor but that he would fix the exterior light now.   It's been 4 days and no one has shown up and my exterior light is now flickering but still not at all well enough to see leaving my wife, dog, and I stumbling around in the dark where there is a set of stairs we need to go down. And the dishwasher now has a puddle of water at the bottom that won't drain.   They even had the audacity to send me an email saying the service request was completed. My wife went in and talked to them Saturday showing them all the emails and request we put in as well as pictures of what's happening. They said they would send someone out Monday to fix it. But with all the nothing they've done, I have lost all faith in them to complete it in a timely manner.  What can I do to get them to actually complete the requests. What are my options legally if any?   tl;dr: Apartment complex ignoring all requests for servicing a maintenance issue caused by their work done in my apartment and now appliance is deemed unusable and hallway outside leading to staircase is left pitch black and dangerous. What are my legal options to get them to complete the requests?  Thanks for the support. I just want to walk down my stairs with light and not have an unusable dishwasher."	No
1258	That is California, not Canada.  I purchased my condo about 4 years ago and I've been consistently receiving first-class mail addressed to what is apparently a business the previous owner ran. I usually tossed them but opened a few out of curiosity and they apparently owe import taxes to the state.  I've sent the agency emails stating it's the old resident and in fact, a quick google easily finds their new address. I've also called and left a message stating the same yet the letters keep coming and today, I received a certified letter (addressed to their business name with my address) which I rejected.  Is there the possibility they'll place a lien on my property? Or anything else? Or am I ok to continue ignoring the notices? Thank you.	No
1259	My father went to prison  a while ago (September-ish) and got a POA to take care of my brother and his property which is an older neighbor of mine. I moved in November 11th ever since then they have took my mail and would only deliver certain things to the house for me, took my birth certificate and title to my car, and then I was at work one day two weeks ago and they came into my house stole my laundry to “teach me a lesson.” I just didn’t fold my laundry at that time and he went and locked my belongings in the garage from me.  I went over to there house because I was getting sick of them taking belongings so I marched over there and told them I demand my belgonings back and that it is illegal to take my belongings.  (I recorded the conversation too btw.) But they pushed me out of their house, threatened to call the police on me and told me to get the fuck off their property.  So I went and called the police myself. I didn’t want to do anything to irrational so I asked the police to just call them and explain what is illegal and legal for them to do as a tenant/owner of the property. Which when the cop called back he said they were understanding and said they knew it was wrong to do.  Well ever since that day anytime I tried to talk to him he would push me and tell me to leave, even if I never said anything I was just there.  Today he served me an eviction notice at work but on the top of the “Notice to quit to recover possession of property Landlord-Tenant” there is no court approval or stamp and no description of why I would be revicted especially because there was never an aggrement on rent at all.   Is this legal? What can I do about it.	No
1260	"Hello /r/legaladvice, so one day this past week I came home (we live in Raleigh, NC) in the evening to find that a pipe had burst on the 2nd story of my town home and flooded the entire thing. My SO and I do not have rental insurance but, luckily, almost nothing of ours was destroyed. We immediately contacted our landlord and water damage contractors came out the next day to rip out all of the carpet/tiling on the first floor and take out lots of the sheetrock/drywall throughout the townhome. Also the HVAC is pretty trashed. I am also lucky to have lots of family in the area so we have easily found places to live temporarily for the foreseeable future. Our landlord is just now beginning to get quotes for contractors to repair the place (once the water damage is under control/no mold) and its somewhat looking like September before it will be live-able again.  The general question I have is am I entitled to request money for certain things from my landlord?  Our landlord is just ""some guy"" and we are lucky to have a pretty good relationship with him (we only know him from renting the place). I have already had a conversation with him that we are not paying rent until the place is live-able again (obviously) but I have not discussed any other matters. Also, because we do not have a very accurate estimate of when the place will be live-able again, we have not discussed potentially breaking the lease with our landlord and finding another place.  After reading our lease, this is the most applicable section for our problem:  &gt;**Destruction of Premises:** In the event the leased premises shall be destroyed or rendered totally untenable by fire, windstorm, or any other cause beyond the control of Landlord, then this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date of such destruction, and the rent shall then be accounted for between Landlord and Tenant  up to the time of such damage or destruction of said premises as if being prorated as of that date. In the event the leased premises are damaged by fire, windstorm or other cause beyond the control of Landlord so as to render the same partially untenable, but repairable withing a reasonable time, then this lease shall remain in force and effect and the Landlord shall, within said reasonable time, restore said premises to substantially the condition the premises were in prior to said damage, and there shall be an abatement in rent in proportion to the relationship the damaged portion of the lease premises bears to the whole of said premises.  Some more specific questions I have:  * Is my landlord supposed to give me money to live somewhere else (via his insurance)? Or is this something that rental insurance would cover? Landlord already knows I have lots of family in the area and am staying with them for free.  * Is my landlord obligated to pay our utilities while we are not living there? I'm pretty certain he should be obligated to pay the huge water bill and huge electrical bill from the damage &amp; repair of the place.  * I feel like the lease is very vague with regards to ""repairable within a reasonable time""... do both us and our landlord basically just have to agree that the repairs are not going to happen in ""reasonable time"" if we both want to breach the lease? What happens if the landlord disagrees with us thinking it is not ""reasonable time""?  Any other tips/suggestions would be much appreciated!  FYI, posted in /r/personalfinance but was recommended over here."	No
1261	Almost ten years ago, I took a Jiu Jitsu class at the local YMCA.   During a drill on a basic technique, the girl I was paired with broke her arm after falling awkwardly. It was a spider guard technique, done under the supervision of the teacher. Not a submission or anything, just a freak accident. Minor break, i'm not sure of the details of her injury.   This will come into play later.  A few classes later, my teacher has a friend come in and practice with us. A blue belt in akido. He, the teacher, insists I practice with this person, and my hand gets broken during this practice.   I recently found out that the person was the girl's boyfriend. and he broke my hand on purpose.   Is there anything I can do? The true cause of the injury wasn't known until this year.   I know the statute of limitations is up for personal injury, 2 years, but considering that I didn't find out the true cause until recently, would the 'clock' start when I found out this information?   Is there anything I can do legally at this point?	No
1262	Background: my building has a bad roach/water bug problem. My unit has it the worst because I'm right in front of the trash chute. Every day when I come home from work, I see at least 1 or 2 in my unit (dead, alive and/or dying). I also see them in the trash chute area, I see them in the stairway, I see them in the parking garage.  I have all of this documented with complaints and video/images.  In November 2016, they were so bad that I complained to the landlord, which resulted in them spraying my unit. They entered my unit without permission back in November, which I complained about, but I forgave.   The pests are back, and in greater numbers. Once again I wrote my landlord a certified letter on 7/14/2017 explaining the situation and asked that they **schedule** an exterminator for my apartment, or at least communicate with me what they plan to do to remedy the problem.   I had a feeling they wouldn't comply, like last time, so I put up a security camera. Sure enough, they came into my unit without **any** communication whatsoever.   I want out of my lease. Does this constitute a violation in the Chicago RTLO that is serious enough to allow me to *break* my lease?  Thank you for any help!	No
1263	I work at my state university, and there is a cap on the hours a student may work (25 hours/week). I am an instructional aid (I teach the chemistry labs), but instead of paying per hour that you are actually there they pay you at a rate of 7 hours per every lab you teach (factoring in 3 hours per lab plus 2 office hours and 2 hours grading), and 3 hours for every recitation class you teach. Now, this summer I teach 3 labs and 3 recitations per week: this should equal 30 hours per week, but since I'm capped at 25 hours, I can only enter that many on my timesheet.   I thought that this was far, since often times the 7 hours they pay you for doesn't really equal 7 hours of actual work, but then I thought that they're making me work more per week for the same amount of pay as another student who works 5 hours less than I do.   Is this legal? Thank you in advance for any help!	No
1264	I've just received a copy of the trust documents and do plan to speak to an attorney on my behalf, but my grandma's husband's attorney also sent a w-9 form to be mailed to my grandparents home. His lawyer stated there is nothing to be distributed at this time (I'm assuming because they each has a sub-trust and if one of them dies the other can do what they want) and their grandchildren will each get half after their house is sold. The trust states that the surviving spouse gets to live in the house until their death if they so choose. So I'm not expecting to see any sort of money from that for a seriously long time. I've never had do taxes or fill out any IRS forms on my behalf and just want to know what the point of me sending this form to him would be. My dad used every penny that was left to my brother and I years ago when we were minors so I'm just really skeptical about everything going on right now.	No
1265	"My Fiancee and I were on driving back home from Montreal to NJ yesterday morning, July 30. Literally around 10 miles after crossing the border from Canada back into the US, I got pulled over for speeding, 80 mph in a 65 mph highway (I-87). My question is if it's worth it fight the ticket, whether driving back for the court date or hiring an attorney. A few bullets below:  * Last speeding ticket in NY was like August 17, 2014. * Had a speeding ticket in CT in Feb 2015, but it was reduced to a ""traffic violation"" * I live right by NYC, so it would be a 5 hour drive to the local courthouse. * Worried about the fine/points since it would technically be within 3 years of my last conviction. * As stated, it was 80 in a 65. * I was driving with a couple of cars near me on a Sunny, clear morning. * I was driving in the left lane and slowed down once I saw the officer.  So what do you guys think, would it be worth it to fight it, or just pay it and plead guilty?"	No
1266	Yesterday evening I was on my bike stopped at an intersection when I got rear ended by a car. Long story short, got a concussion, a cut in my head that was stitched up, a bunch of bruises and spent the night at a trauma center.  The thing is, I found out last night that my insurance was cut off about a month ago so I don't have any coverage. I'm a graduate student who has less than $1000 in his account so there's no way I can pay it off right now and would hate to have to pay off the bills over time, stunting my personal expenses once I'm out of school and working. I don't know exactly how much it'll cost me yet but I'd guess the $6-7k ballpark since they took a bunch of scans too.  My intent is to get the woman who hit me to pay off my medical bills. Besides this, some compensation for my injuries and the time I'll have to take out of school would be good as well. I don't know anything about her but she didn't have the best car so I'm guessing she's not too well off. What is my best course of legal action?  Thank you for the advice.  Location: Atlanta, GA, USA if that helps	No
1267	This just happened. I rent a single room in a house, and have a lease agreement.  About a week ago, my landlady asked if I could temporarily move up to the attic (which is a finished, but very small space) so her son could stay in this room (which is a spacious, nice room) for a few weeks while he visits. I was a little taken aback, and told her no. I thought that was the end of it.  I came home from work today to find maybe a third of my possessions packed up in cardboard boxes, and sitting outside the door. She was out at the time, and still is out. I just brought the boxes back in and unpacked them. Nothing broken, but I'm very uncomfortable.  My agreement requires 48-hours notice if she wants to enter the room for any reason.  I'm not sure where to go from here, aside from searching for a different housing option immediately. Do I have legal recourse? It feels like she's trying to forcibly evict me.	No
1268	Backstory is my girlfriend and I recently moved in together (in Colorado) in June but her lease for her last place doesn't end until August. To be able to move in with me she couldn't afford July's portion of rent which was $425 for her. Her and her ex roommate agreed both verbally and over text that she would pay June and July utilities but my girlfriend would only have to pay for June's rent.  Now July has come along and the ex roommate is demanding she pays or she will take her to court. My girlfriend talked to her old landlord and he does remember the situation but both my girlfriend and ex roommate have two different stories and he just wants to be paid. He said he has not been paid by ex roommate  yet and is willing to give an extension to my girlfriend if she needs. He just is confused by the situation and now not really sure what was agreed upon.   Does the ex roommate have a case against my GF? Does she have one if my GF does pay rent to landlord (even though wasn't decided previously) and still try and take her to court. What are the scenarios here? My GF cant afford this and is feeling screwed over but knows nothing was signed just verbal and text agreements. It is in Fort Collins CO. Any help would be appreciated	No
1269	My daughter was refered by her dentist to another dentist to see if a very small cavity needed to be filled and to consult about possibly getting veneers. She is 17. She went back and was gone for 2 hours. The receptionist blew off my requests for information about what was going on multiple times. When they brought her out she looked like hell. They had done an unauthorized root canal on her. I am pissed off. My daughter now has a giant silver molar that was put into place without asking. What do i do here?	No
1270	"Good afternoon! I desperately need some advice. I purchased my own home a few months ago and rented out a bedroom to a couple that seemed to have fallen on hard times and decided to help them out a bit.  They have always been late on payments, causing extra drama and then not paying me $100 in rent due to said ""drama"" that they caused.  Now they're saying they found weed in the bathroom and will not be paying rent for 30 days and that I can't evict them before that.   I don't even smoke weed, the picture they sent me was like a microscopic piece of weed and my agreement with them is on a week to week lease.  Can I not just end the lease starting today and they would only have one week to move out? Please advise and thank you in advance! This Is in Houston, TX if that helps."	No
1271	I am living in a trailer home along with my mother. My mother owns the home but we rent the lot and both of our names are on the rental paperwork. I've found some info on obligations that a landlord has to their tenant but I wasn't sure how they applied to our specific situation.  They haven't responded to any complaints thus far and I was wondering if there was any potential legal backing that we could use to bolster our argument for some things to be changed.  My main issues are: Not maintaining/mowing the empty lots, common areas, and storage area. Not just unkempt but we've got some houses falling apart and grass growing waist high.   The water to the whole park being turned off multiple times a month, usually for a day or so.	No
1272	I subleased a room in a house in Virginia with air conditioning. The air conditioner has ceased functioning, and I contacted the land lord for repairs. He claims he does not maintain the air conditioners. This was not disclosed to me in my (extremely boilerplate) rental agreement.   Contractually, should the appliances not be maintained?  From my understanding, if the leasee that I am leasing from did not disclose that the air conditioner was not being maintained by the landlord I would have to pursue it with them.  However, if it was not stated that the air conditioners are not maintained so I need to pursue it with the leasee that I am subleasing from or the landlord?	No
1273	"I'll try to make this as in a nutshell as possible, and be watching the comments for any questions needing more information. Grandparent's left will for all belongings to go to my father. Uncle rarely ever visited them. Grandfather passed about 3 months ago. Uncle for whatever reason is executor of the estate. Grandmother has hardcore alzheimer's, is in bad shape (bed sore, can't feed herself) and staying at uncle's personal care home.  Uncle wants to keep her away from hospice cause ""feels like she has a while more to live"" -his words. He is getting paid any money she gets from herself and my grandfather's pension, including he stated another $1K per month for her to stay at his home. He plans on selling my grandparent's estate in order to pay for the cost of her staying there.... AKA he will get everything in cash from my father when in reality nothing was left to him. Father said he doesn't have enough cash to hire a lawyer currently, though I feel as if he's milking the estate he should be reported to having my Grandmother still at his home since she should not at all be at a care home and needs to if so be in actually nursing home with actual nurses. The care home is all run by my Uncle's side of the family.   Any advice here would be wonderful as no clue where to start calling or looking for help on this matter. My father wanted my grandparent's house to move into and didn't want to have to sell everything especially the house for my Uncle to end up taking everything when he's never been around for years. (Plus Uncle came into the house today taking bags of stuff, didn't tell us he was going or what he took, as my father installed cameras around the property).  Also, this is just outside Pittsburgh if that helps with any information on who I would contact on any of this. Thank you guys again for your time. I lurk a lot but really needed advice this time myself."	No
1274	I received a letter in the mail yesterday with my address but someone else's name on it requesting to pay for a property tax ownership change fee and I have not sold my property. I called the city about it and they said they had an ownership change on record about two weeks ago. The person said to ignore the bill and she'd look into what happened, so waiting to hear back right now. Should I be contacting a lawyer or something about this (not that I can afford one right now) or am I paranoid?	No
1275	In the state of Texas can I break my apartment lease if I have been gifted a house? The gift deed is notarized and filed with the bexar county clerks office.

1276	My boyfriend and I moved into an apartment last year. My father signed the lease as a tenant because our credit basically sucks.  We have paid the rent on time every single month. We are quiet, clean, and overall excellent tenants. Our lease is up on the 1st. My father and I have since had a falling out and he requested to be removed from the lease. We spoke to the rental office and they said that given our history, it would not be a problem to have only my boyfriend and I on the lease, though we may have to go month to month at a higher rate. Sucks, but fine, no real problem.  According to the renewal letter, we have until tomorrow to let them know if we are moving or signing a new lease, otherwise we automatically convert to month to month. We just got a notice on our door that our tenancy is being immediately terminated at the request of my father and we have until September to get out. We have no desire to move and are prepared to continue paying the rent.   I realize the landlord has the right to terminate the tenancy once we convert to month to month, but our lease isn't up yet. But can one tenant terminate the tenancy for all tenants without permission?   We are meeting with the office tomorrow, but we got the notice right as they closed. Any help and information you can provide before then would be appreciated.  We are in Los Angeles County, CA.	No
1277	I'll start at the beginning. My boyfriend &amp; I moved out of a crappy apartment in North Dakota. We moved into a nicer apartment with the same company, different offices. So my boyfriend drops off the check for rent ($700) at new apartment. A few days later, we get a call we owe late fees and rent. We show them we gave them the check for rent. They say they'll figure it out. That was almost 2 months ago. So now they called and said they messed up and gave the rent check to the old apartment. On our move out check, we got back $644. (They took over $800 for cleaning, replacing blinds, etc.) So now they're saying it's their fault for losing the check but we still owe them the $700 for first month rent. We barely scrape by as is so finding another 700 is beyond me. Is there any legal binding for me to pay the rent that they used and misplaced? They did use the money, they just accidentally gave it back a portion.	No

Or what if someone searches for ""kind girl"" (because the person might remember that ""kind"" was in the title) without knowing that ""kind"" means ""child"" in German?  It's obvious that no one would really search for this disgusting stuff on renowed websites like Pornhub but how does Pornhub react, if they see that someone allegedly searched for it and how can you prove, that it wasn't your fault?"

1281	"I live in California. My boyfriend signed a lease with a new landlady on July 13th and moved in on July 15th. He's renting a bedroom from a three-bedroom house. The second bedroom is occupied by the landlady, and the third bedroom is occupied by another tenant who's been living there for four years.  Today is July 21st. This afternoon I was over at his place and no one was home, so we had sex in his room. Afterward, I went to clean up in his shower and he stayed in his room to tidy up. While I was in the shower, his landlady came upstairs saying she heard noises and asked what was going on. His door was already a bit ajar, because I didn't shut it all the way on my way to the bathroom (I thought no one was home). She pushed the door open to see my naked boyfriend and started freaking out, asking him who was in the shower (she could hear that it was on), telling him it was not okay for him to have a guest over, especially if the guests use the utilities, and stormed downstairs after yelling all of this loudly enough for me to hear over the running shower. I ran back into his room, scared and confused and dripping wet (not one of my finest moments). He was putting his clothes on as I came back in, and went downstairs right away. They talked downstairs for about ten minutes while I hid in his room, and when he came back upstairs he told me he had a to find a new place to live. Apparently, she told him he was not allowed to have guests over (1. He didn't see that on the contract when he signed it, but he's going to get a copy of it to make sure; 2. The other tenant brings one of her friends over frequently). She told him he has a week to find a new place to live, and then she's going to kick him out because ""she can't trust him anymore."" She also said she's not going to give his security deposit back. Is she allowed to kick him out for this? He's been living here for less than a week, and he paid for an entire month of rent. Obviously he doesn't want to live here anymore regardless of the outcome, but it would be preferable if he could stay through his first month or if she could give him his money back. I especially don't understand how it's legal for her to keep his security deposit. I don't know the exact language on the contract regarding eviction, but she has to let him stay at least until the end of the month, right? Thanks for reading, and any help is appreciated."	No

1283	Good Evening,    First time here, so sorry if this is already answered. Please provide link to answer if so and I will delete this post.   **SITUATION**: Other night I tapped the bumper of a man (driver), and his pregnant wife and child (passengers). Speed at impact was no faster than walking speed. There was no damage to my bumper and a slight scuff on theirs, we exchanged insurance and contact info, and I asked to pay out of pocket if he was willing. Next day they contact me and say that they are sore and taking the wife to the dr., and that the impact dislodged the plastic wheel well in their car. However, they are still willing to let me pay out of pocket for car repairs and health insurance co-pay from the dr visit. They gave me a reasonable quote that I accepted. I don't really care if they are faking and just keeping the money, this is an inconvenience for them, and I was at fault. Additionally, the quote would be cheaper than my insurance increase in the long run.    **QUESTION**: My concern is that I will pay them, but they will still try and make a claim in the future due to injury they didn't know they had yet (or something along those lines). If I have them sign a release of liability contract in front of a notary at the time of payment, will that protect me here in Oregon? If so, is there a recommended release of liability contract template I can download for free? Or am I out of my league here? I think getting a lawyer involved would contradict any future insurance premium savings I would gain from the other party not making a claim.  Thanks for your time,  everyusernametaken2	No
1284	Last night, I was out with my coworkers. We were supposed to meet at a manager's house for dinner, so I accompanied him to his house to make dinner for the group. Most ended up not coming, one did. We had been drinking before and during dinner. I had been driving coworkers, but as the night wore on I was not fit to drive and thought it would be a good idea to stay the night.  When we were alone, he forced himself on me despite me saying no, clearly, in many ways, more than once. I did not fight him. I was drunk, and scared.  Here's the issue: I am completing probation from a DV arrest. My abusive boyfriend called the police on me during a fight, I was arrested. I have completed a year of probation and my record is due to be expunged within the month. My court-appointed counselor advised me not to make a report, due to my record. She said I am unlikely to be taken seriously.   I am no longer on probation, I am allowed to drink, and I wasn't drunk enough to not know what was going on. I remember everything. He raped me, and I feel as though I have no recourse.  It is worth mentioning that while I am his employee, I am serving out my two weeks notice and will not be an employee past the 20th of this month.  What should I do? What can I do? I have been advised by that court-appointed counselor (who I have stayed in contact with because I like and trust her) to talk to him about what happened and proceed from there, depending on whether he gets defensive or not.  I am currently in the ER waiting on a rape kit, so I have at least some evidence to protect me in case this goes from bad to worse.   Thank you for reading.	No
1285	"I have been in my current apartment for over 13 months.  My lease expired at the end of May, and at that time the property was transferred to a new owner.  Management team was kept the same but transferred employment to the new management company.  At the end of May, all apartment tenants had a lease modification/signing.  At my appointed office time for signing, I was informed that my paperwork ""was not ready yet"".  This is the very last I heard from management regarding this matter.  In early June, I opened a HUD claim alleging discrimination due to encounters and I have had with the property manager.  At the end of June, management filed a lawsuit of Unlawful Detainer, alleging me of unpaid rent for the months of May and June.  Management has even falsified a Pay up or Quit notice, allegedly placing it on my door at the end of June.  On July 1st (before I was aware of any lawsuit and or allegations of unpaid rent), I paid July's rent in full.  On July 4th, I was served notice of the Unlawful Detainer lawsuit.  I have paid all my rent by money order, placing payment through the drop slot in the business office.  I do not have my money order receipts (lesson learned) but am working with management at the stores at which I purchased the money orders, hoping they will be able to locate my purchase transaction.  After having the Plaintiff served with my response to the Unlawful Detainer, I have now been given a Notice of Intent to Enter Premises (on July 17th).  After reviewing California Civil Code, it seems the only reasons for property management to enter an occupied rental are the following:  - Emergencies - Abandonment by tenant - Repairs and inspection of repairs - Showing of unit to potential renters/owners  I suspect this is more retaliation on behalf of the manager, as they are now informed that I am fighting the allegations of Unlawful Detainer, and filing complaints with Housing and Urban Development.  As none of the reasons for entry apply to me, how do I stand my ground and deny them entry based on legality?"	No
1286	"I'm sorry if this is mostly a rant as I am sweating my face off and extremely frustrated.   Background: I have lived in this duplex since May of 2013. I enjoy living here, the rent is cheap and the landlord has generally been good about getting things done if needed. In my time here we have had the attic water heater rust through and leak through the walls, resulting in the carpet being ripped out and replaced with wood-look laminate, the breaker box has blown (I'm not sure if I'm correct on the specifically but something to the effect) where we did not have any type of power for less than 24 hours, and a few other things which have always been fixed in a very reasonable amount of time.   The situation: I have been trying to get my air conditioner fixed since July 5th. I originally called my landlord to tell her about the issue, which is that during the day the unit cannot keep my tiny 800 square foot place below 84 degrees. It is Texas and it is hot but I have not had this issue in the years previous.   The landlord sent a repairman out quickly, he basically just blew out the area where the filter is inserted and left. It worked fine as far as I can tell for about a couple of days but was back to hot very quickly after.   I emailed my landlord on July 18th when I had time for a repairman to come in and get it done again, and they sent someone out again the next day. He arrived in the morning before it was hot, did the same thing as the previous guy and said it was working fine. This time there was no result and the temperature was back up to 80+ by 3pm.   I emailed my landlord again same day and specifically requested that someone come out later so that they could observe that the temperature was high. One week ago the man came at about 9pm and observed the heat, climbed up into my attic and said it was pretty cold up there (meaning the duct work likely needed to be replaced) and left within 15 minutes saying that everything was operating fine and he didn't know why there was no cool air in the apartment other than that the insulation was insufficient but they would ""get it fixed.""   I never heard anything further. I emailed my landlord yesterday evening to check on the status and she said she has a call in to the owner and she will let me know the results. It is currently 84 degrees at 5:30pm and will likely continue to be until at least 10pm. I am at my wits end, my air conditioner is running constantly and my bill is $250+ a month to heat this tiny stupid place. I don't want to move and I don't want to sue, but I also don't have the money to get it fixed myself. What in the world am I supposed to do?  Does e-mail count as a method of notification if I have to move forward with a lawsuit or do i need to send a certified letter?  TL;DR my air conditioner doesn't work and it's been 22 days. What now?"	No
1287	Basically an obese customer was denied service since we didn't have the proper equipment to handle someone of her size. (weight limit on machine is stated as 250lbs)  She writes a bad review claiming that we really denied her because she was black since she saw another large white woman in the store (but she fails to mention the other woman was half her size)   Since her review was framed in such a way to make this seem like a case of discrimination based on race, her fb post has been shared by a few thousands and as a result we've taken a hard hit on our online reviews/scores, harassing phone calls and what not.   I feel like we could have a libel case on our hands, but I'm not sure. How do these cases usually go? I ask if it's worth it since I also don't know the process of investigation for them, and I don't necessarily know if inciting this case somewhat more publicly like that would also be good...	No
1288	There was some confusion in the last thread about the unit. Its a normal looking house, however its bisected. It has two kitchens, two bathrooms, two bedrooms, 1 backyard, 1 bisected garage with 2 doors, and it is basically one smaller home mirrored with two 1 way doors in the center. As in there is a handle on my side for my door, but no handle on my side for his door and vice versa.   So I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/66r71g/landlord_blocked_psn_xbl_steam_and_various_other/) three months ago. My solution for this issue was to hide a router and set it as the primary so he thought he was in control of the internet.    He has since found the router and blew his top.   Fun part is he went into my room to find them. As a landlord in a condo, he should not have access to my area. (May be wrong on that feel free to correct me.) I accused him of going through my side of the condo and his response was that he owned the place and he was free to do as he wished.   I informed him that the rental contract I signed made anything he said about that false. He has access to my place in emergencies or if there is a need to access it for maintenance issues.   He claimed that getting the internet working is a maintenance issue and that he had every right to enter my side of the unit.   Since then he has produced several new rules that he wants me to sign and add on to the contract.   These documents look like they came from legal zoom. They have rules governing when I am allowed to play video games, all internet gaming is banned, I am not allowed to bring over women at all, and that I am to follow any rules put forth by the landlord.   Obviously bunk paper as I have a contract with the man. Also found that because I am in control over a condo unit, I can contact my ISP. They will issue me a second modem to run off of another IP address on a second account.   This is basically what I did the instant this document was handed to me.   The ISP installed the new modem yesterday and I have been enjoying my own internet line that he knows he legally can not touch.   That night I brought my girlfriend over and played video games, quietly, well into the night. I kinda wanted to rub it in his face I guess so I broke every new rule he tried to implement.   Today he told me that he was going to have me evicted. I told him that I have broken no rules and that his new paper is not binding until signed. I ripped the paper in half when he tried to get me to sign it again.   HE said that that was my last chance and that he has no choice now but to move forward with eviction process. He said the locks would be changed when I got home from work.   I pulled up the Texas eviction laws on my phone and made him read them.   He almost chunked my phone but controlled himself. He got in my face and said that he would have me out of this unit within the month and that I would be responsible for the rest of the rent as well.   I laughed at him and told him that a judge would decide that and unless he had a legally legitimate reason to enter my side of the condo again, I would call the police for trespassing.   Main questions I have are simple.   I understand I was talking big a bit there. But does he have the right to enter my side of the condo? He had to go outside, cross the driveway, and enter through my front door to do this. Backdoor has a deadbolt.   Also I am sure the lease only talks about him entering in case of emergencies or for maintenance issues. NO wording about him not being able to enter though.   Second question is that paper of his. He still wants me to sign it and claims he can hold me to those draconian rules. I am correct in assuming that only the rental contract I signed is what is important right?  Finally if he does take me to court regarding evictions, will I be needing a lawyer? Or can this be done with arbitration or whatever. There is no binding arbitration in the rental contract but  was wondering the merits on this one.	No
1289	This is in Orange County, CA. I left the lease early because of several reasons, vermin, harassment (by landlord), and many other issues.  Now my landlord states that they don't want to deal with someone like me ever again, and won't find someone off of craigslist like before. Also claims that they have different standards now.  My question is, am I responsible for the real estate fee's because of this? As far as I'm concerned they want to find a tenant a different way whereas they were cheaper before, and I shouldn't be responsible.  I think they are doing this to keep my security deposit.	No
1290	I just purchased a home in Wisconsin and closed on May 11th. last week we had 3 days of heavy rains and unfortunately it ended up coming out of the living room and dining room wall through a dormer roof that was not properly sealed. My insurance adjuster came to take pics and informed me that the old owners filed a claim in Oct 2016 for a roof leak that caused ceiling damage. However no repairs were done to the ceiling save for repainting. What, if any legal recourse do I have?  Sellers never disclosed roof issues or water damage to the house.	No
1291	This happened a year ago, but right after it happened, I moved from New Jersey to Michigan, and next week I will be living in Ontario. I recently got a subpoena in the mail to appear for the case. It's not against me, it's state VS the guy, but I'm just going to be there as a witness. I will be 8 months pregnant during the time of the court date and I won't be able to travel, especially since I don't think I will be able to travel to the States while my citizenship paperwork is being processed in Canada. I've tried contacting the detective a few times but haven't heard anything back yet, my next step is to call the court house even though the subpoena specifically says to just contact the detective. Is there any way they can try to force me to go considering my circumstances?	No
1292	The housing market in the city I go to school in is very competitive this time of year and landlords tend to accept multiple applications for a single rental before determining who they're going to rent to. I have good rental history, but every year I still need to put in several applications on 'available' rentals in order to find a place because of this. I understand taking 2 or 3 applications because students might not have the best credit/rental history and you want to make sure you find someone, but I've heard of the property management company I just tried renting from taking 40+ applications for a single apartment. This seems like kind of a racket to me because that's $1600 in just applications. I had another experience recently where I paid the $80 (2 people) background check/application fee with a property management company for a rental and when I did I was told by their office lady that I was sure to get it but that it would take a few days to do the background check. After a week I called them back for an update and they said the address I put in the application for had just been rented to someone else, and I'm pretty sure they didn't even do a 'background check' on me because the references/landlord I put on the application never heard from them. They didn't even seem to remember who I was. If it's legal to accept multiple applications and deny people without reason what's stopping someone from just 'renting' a house for the application fees with no intention of actually renting the property to anyone.	No
1293	"My friend and roommate has a month-to-month agreement but was given her 30-day notice 30 days ago due to issues with the landlord. She and myself assumed that since the rental ""term"" is one month starting on the first of the month, she would have until August 1st to leave (e.g be out sometime tomorrow). The landlord today told her that she expects her out tonight since it would be 30 days since she was given notice.  Here is the text of the contract:  &gt; The term of this Sublease shall be on a month to month basis terminating 08-01-17. Either party may terminate the Sublease Agreement at any time with a full 30 day notice.  Who is in the right? Does my friend have to be out today, or does she have until the end of the month?"	No
1294	http://imgur.com/a/mFeJL  I believe the property line is pretty much exactly where he sprayed to. That's his garage against my yard. He does it because he doesn't see the dead grass. The rest of his yard is fenced from the garage to the house. He must be in my yard when I'm not home to even get there to spray.   Is what he's doing legal? Do I have any recourse? I had a dog that died recently (7yo) of lymphoma and I suspect his pesticides might be tied to it because I tethered him in the backyard.   If it matters, I live in Westmoreland County PA.	No
1295	"Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...  Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.  So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.  Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".  But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.  I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.  I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself. All I could picture were the pictures she used to send me. So without getting into detail, I got into my first fight. I regret in a way now, I didn't think I could go so far....  Tl:DR; Beat the shit out of a girls abusive boyfriend, no weapons involved. Definitely broke some bones. I am not proud of it believe me, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. I just want to know what to expect if he presses charges...   By the way, if the story is unnecessary let me know and I'll remove it, thank you."	No
1296	Neighbor in Massachusetts is asking that we cut down vines that grow from our house in our backyard to their back porch. They said that the previous owners had always done it before for them. We did it last year, and will probably this year, but I'd really like to know who is actually responsible for this. Whenever anything is in our yard, whether it originates from our property or not, we take care of it. We would have to enter the neighbor's property to take care of the greenery. Does anyone know the actual law regarding this maintenance? Let me know if you need more details! Thanks!	No
1297	My partner and I are moving from Illinois to separate states. He will be working in New York and I will be attending grad school in Connecticut. He currently owns a car that is registered in IL which he will be giving to me to use while I'm in school.   I am trying to work through the mess of how/when we need to transfer everything. Can we both be on the title if we live in separate states? Is it easier to transfer title to me while we are still in IL and then register the car in CT? Will there be complications if he is on title still and is not a CT resident? Ideally he would remain on title as he will be paying for insurance, maintenance, and still will drive the car when we see each other.	No
1298	Background: I live in a house with several housemates, and the set of people typically changes some each year before we renew our lease. Our relationship with the landlord has always been relaxed. We all sign one lease, but there is no vetting of applicants, we don't ever sign on time, rent increases have always been small, and informally communicated at the end of the year.  Current: This year our landlord wants to add some professionalism to the mix (vetting new lease applications), and increase rent substantially more than in the past. We are completely fine with these changes.  Problem. The issue we face is that our new lease begins in approximately a week, and we have been told varying accounts of the changes to the rent price after having already found new people to that have tentatively agreed move in. At first our landlord said to expect a small increase (a couple weeks ago). This is normal and we didn't think anything of it. With a week left, we found out today that the price if much higher, and we risk losing people who had agreed to an original price.  Does anyone have any advice? We've read all of the information regarding required time for notice of rent increase, but it doesn't address at all the case that a new lease is being drawn up. It feels like we have no legal leverage, but it feels so underhanded that i'm wondering if I missed something in my research.  I guess the worst case is that we don't find anyone and we all just move out without signing.	No
1299	"Hello everyone I was wondering if any one had legal advice for contesting a will. Sorry if this is very long winded and not the right subreddit, let me know if I should cross post it somewhere better.   Some background, there is this woman ""J"" that my father my sister and myself feel have been taking advantage of  my  grandparents.  J was  ""bought"" (male order bride and what not) from the Philippines by her first husband who was friends with my grandparents. She had two kids by the time my sister and I were past the ""cute"" stages. My grandparents have a weakness for cute children and have been drooling over this woman and her kids for the past 16 years, including the new 6 yo kid with a new husband. This kid think my grandparents are hers and has no idea me or my father were relatives, so idk what J has been telling her but that could be paranoia talking.  We honestly have felt J has been taking advantage of my grandparents to try and be put on the will, and sure enough a few years ago they put her and her three kids on it for a very very gracious amount compared to the three blood family members that are on it. The grandparents refused to show us the will because J was on it. Since my dad in the executor so he was recently able to get a copy and it is split as follows:  30% to my dad, 10% to my sister 10% to me  20% to J 5% J kid 1 5% J kid 2 5% J kid 3 And the rest to boyscouts/church/stuff like that.  I guess our main concern/question is is there a way to contest the will effectively? I know there is a less then 1% of it happening historically. We think she should be on the will but this is extreme in our opinion. Her family, who's only been close friends essentially, gets more then their only son.   Also I guess we need a sanity check. Are we paranoid or are we justified in our feeling in your best opinion?"	No
1300	"Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.   As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her.   I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked.   When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me.   Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes.   and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record.   There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.  Thank you. TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it."	No
1301	I have no contract with my subletter, and I allowed his girlfriend stay with us for a month for an extra 200 dollars. A month later, and he is now telling me he's not paying me anything extra, but she is still going to live in his room &amp; use the communal facilities and storage spaces  against my will.   What can I legally do to get her to leave? My first thought is to call the police on her for trespassing, but she now has a key to the apartment.   He's also refusing to pay last month's rent and wants me to use the security deposit instead, which is a problem because he built a bike rack on the ceiling and is refusing to take it down before he leaves. Would it be illegal eviction if I change the locks?	No
1302	This is probably a waste of time, but I wanted to ask.  My mom and my brother traveled with Greyhound last week Thursday. They had never taken a bus before and tried to maneuver it the best they could. The person working the front desk refused to put a label on two of her items -- two plain cardboard boxes that contained medical records, a bag, school supplies, and toiletries. They swore up and down the luggage would arrive in our city. Well, shocked, it did not arrive.  The real issue here is the customer service is outrageously awful. We've been hung up on, laughed at, and we were given a claim number that doesn't work. It's a 30 minute wait to reach a person and then they transfer you again.  Their compensation policy only offers $250. These items are worth more than that, and were almost certainly lost by the employees who checked them in. It was either never placed on the bus or removed.   Is there anything we can do at this point? Can we sue them? Is there anyway to get in touch with someone at the very top of the hierarchy?	No
1303	Its a long, complex and boring story so I'll just stick to the key parts.   I'm going to Cancun next week so I decided to purchase a LifeProof Nuud model.   The lady working at Target installed my case, which I thought was normal at the time, come to find out later she wasn't supposed to do that.   Anyways, I get home and then realize that the case wasn't properly tested for bubbles, or any sort of breech in the case. Also, I realize she installed the case incorrectly so that my Silence/Ringer slider was being crushed by the case.   So of course, I get sketched out, I go to Target the next day, the woman who 'helped' me the day before wasn't there but a group of employees decided to try to take the faulty case off.   Some how, they use too much to the point that my screen was cracked &amp; phone bent. Pretty much destroying it. (Didn't even get the case off.)  Now Target refuses to reimburse me for my iPhone, and I'm not sure what to do.   I'm not very rich at all, the phone was probably the most expensive thing I've owned in the past five years, so buying a new one isn't that simple.   Tl;dr: Target lady installed my new case improperly, other target people try to take and off and destroy it in the process. Target won't pay me for the phone.   P.S, sorry for horrible formatting/spelling. It's about 1 in the morning, and I've pretty exhausted from trying to deal with this.	No
1304	So, we have $850 in electricity bills at the moment and my housemates are only willing to reduce the bill by $100 even after they spent 60+ days using an 1800w heater many hours a day, have spent a significant amount of time more than me in the house and use a significant amount more than myself in general. About a month ago I made it clear I was aware of their excessive use and said it was erring expensive and prior to winter I had indicated we should try not to use the heater because it would be expensive. I want them to take $200 off of the total of the both because I've told them for the reasons above that it's unfair and that I personally reduced my use and suffered so that I could I afford it. What are my legal options in the way of making this a fair deal? The bill is in their name and I will not be paying till an agreement is reached.	No
1305	"Hello,  I am concerned over some clauses in a lease contract for an apartment located in Los Angeles, CA.   There is an insurance clause stating that I am responsible for purchasing insurance for the premise, otherwise I am liable for all damages to it, caused by any event including the owner.  Is this clause normal in leases?  That is how I understood the paragraph, which is written as follows: In consideration of this rental, Renter shall obtain and pay for any insurance coverage necessary to protect Renter from any loss or expense due to personal injury or property damage, including but not limited to that caused by any act or omission of any party, including **Owner** or co-tenants, criminal act, war, riot, insurrection, fire, or act of God. The amount of monetary damage caused to Owner by renter's breach of this agreement shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the amount of any loss sustained by the renter by any such act or event and shall offset any claim by Renter against Owner.  Another concern I have is that the property manager verbally told me I could have up to five tenants occupy the apartment, however the lease states otherwise.  It is a two bedroom apartment and the least explicitly states a maximum of two people can occupy it and only those named on the lease.  I expressed my concern with the manager and she replied that it wouldn't be an issue.  However, the written contract will always trump a verbal agreement, as I have been told.  So, should I trust her, or have them change the lease or walk away?  The following is the clause: The Premises shall not be occupied by more than the maximum number of ""Agreement"" occupants set in Section J, unless required by law, nor by any person other than the Named Renter(s) set out in Section K without the advance written consent of the Owner and at the additional rent set out in Section L(she put not permitted) or prescribed by law.  Renter's right to possession shall not be assigned nor sublet.  My final concern has to do with the fact that the building does not accept pets of any kind.  I own a dog as a Service Animal, however, when I disclose it to a leasing agent, I have been mysteriously disqualified.  So, I am not disclosing it this time until I sign the lease.  I have the documents verifying it is a Service Animal and in compliance with all vaccinations required by the City of Los Angeles.  If I continue to not disclose my Service dog after I sign the lease, can management deny the dog access to my unit? What can management legally ask of me to admit my dog into the unit?  I appreciate any advice you have for me.  I moved to California recently and chose to apply for an apartment near a major university.  This is my first time renting, so I am unsure of what is standard and what is not in a lease.  Thank you."	No
1306	I found my name on the FCC website and my real name with my real address has a comment on it saying I do not support net neutrality. It is the same spam-botted message with many other fake comments. I emailed FCC and they haven't responded. Please someone help me, I am all for NN and this is blatantly stealing my identity for supporting something I do not believe in. Can i take it this to court?  I am from New york!	No
1307	"Long story short, we held off on filing the eviction notice and was kind enough to give him until Sept 1st to move out, or else be evicted by the Sheriffs.   Well now his dad decided to type out a letter (HIS agreements, nothing from a law office), along with a $1,000 that ""if deposited then you agree to these terms."" Now we are moving forward with the eviction notice.   Question 1: I'm not depositing the check and I want to send it back to the address listed on the check. Do I need to cross out whatever is written on the check and write ""void"" in its place?   Question 2: Would I need to have the Sheriff put the eviction notice on his bedroom door? Roommate comes in through the garage and won't notice anything on the front door."	No
1308	Before moving in to our new house my brother had agreed to pay rent of 400 dollars a month. We gave him 2 free months as courtesy for doing some move work and minor housework at the new and old house and so far he has only paid for the months of March and April. He is now behind 3 months and says he will pay rent after a long discussion but now I do not feel comfortable with him being around more than ever because his temperament has only gotten worse since our discussion.  Even if he does pay what steps must I take to properly evict him and just to soothe my paranoia, what can I do if things get violent without being on the wrong side of the law.  Also just to highlight my frustration he is 35 and I am 25 but has the temperament of a 12 year old.	No
1309	"My apartment building is being sold, and the tenants are being evicted. It's going to be combined with the building next to it and turned into luxury condos. I don't have a lease.  My (now) wife was served a ""termination of tenancy"" notice via an image in a text message on June 26, by a lawyer for the seller's agent, and told to look for the actual notice in the mail. We looked and it wasn't there. We contacted the agent to let him know, and he came by with the eviction notice the next week on July 3, which my wife signed for.  The eviction notice was dated for June 26, and states we have to be out by August 1, but we didn't get the physical notice until July 3. My understanding is that the owners are required to give a full rental period for notice.  1) Does an photograph of the eviction notice sent by text count as giving notice?  2) My wife signed (and dated July 3) the late notice. Does that mean we accepted the terms to be out by August 1? Is the notice even valid?  3) If we want to get a little more time before we are evicted, how do we do that?  4) Boston has laws about condo conversions. Since the two buildings are going to be gutted and combined before they're turned into condos, do those laws apply to me?  Thank you."	No

1311	"Quick summary because this has a long explanation: I was not paid for 20+ hours of work for a restaurant, under the guise of it being a ""working interview.""  I live in VA.  Is this legal?  It's been one year since the interview happened, is it too late to do anything about it?   BACKGROUND:  Last year, I had interest in applying to a local (and highly praised) burger shop, just working in the kitchen making burgers, cleaning tables, etc.  The people that own this shop also own an extremely popular fancy restaurant.  I'm serious.  Everything that comes out of that kitchen looks like food porn.  All the people that eat there take pictures of their food when it comes out. And it's crazy expensive, all produce they use is local and they change their menu all the time based on what is available during the season or whatever.  So anyways, I am told that I have to complete 2 ""working"" interviews for these sister restaurants.  One at the burger place, one at the fancy place.  Each one had different tasks, for example the burger place did things I described earlier whereas fancy restaurant involved bussing tables, sorting silverware, etc.  Also, as you can probably tell, the fancy restaurant was a much more stressful environment and all the people that work there are pretty much professional chefs or adults.  There were a few other teens, (I was 16 at this time), but being surrounded by all these people was definitely intimidating.  More so than the laid back but still busy burger shop.  Right.  So I finish my working interview at burger shop.  I worked open to close, roughly 10 hours.  I completed the exact amount of work as the other people working that day, and was probably working 10x harder than them, considering the whole point was to demonstrate how well I worked, so I wanted to do a good job.  End of the day, I don't get paid except for splitting tips, which probably amounted to around $7.  The manager of burger shop tells me I will most likely be hired but it is ultimately up to people who own both places to decide.  I then work another ~10 hour shift at the fancy restaurant.  Now, people working here (well at the position I was applying for) are bussing tables and thus get paid below minimum wage but split tips to compensate, and with each table having bills averaging over $300, this adds up relatively well.  I did not get paid this day either, but they added me on to a list of other people bussing that night, so I assumed I would get the same tips they did? Never got those either.  Figured maybe after I was officially hired I would get them.  The end of the day, the chefs at the restaurant give me a mini interview, said I worked well, and they would give me a call.  They also said that they are known to be lazy and not call people and they ""like to see persistance"" i.e. me calling them and pestering them to give me the job if they don't call me within a week. Eye roll.  I'd like to add that this was not a competitive interview, I performed extremely well and wasn't competing against anyone else for the position.  These people literally just could not be bothered to call me.  They wanted to see me reach out. Also, I was applying to burger shop, but they had me work at both places because (very rarely) they will have people that typically work at one place work the other for a shift depending on scheduling and such.  So the fact that I worked 20+ hours with no pay is extremely annoying to me and I almost feel like that place just uses it to get free labor out of people which is off-putting considering how successful the business is and it almost seems like a bullying situation(for lack of better way to describe it.).  I ended up trying to contact the owners of the restaurant like told to (said to text her) and I didn't even get any reply, which I thought was rude.  If I didn't get the job, at least tell me.  At that point I stopped bothering to reach out just due to how disgusted I was by the people that ran the business.  I looked up if working interviews are legal in VA and from what I can tell you're required to be paid.  I would've pressed the matter if I had known this, but I was so excited at the prospects of a new job for this successful place that I sort of overlooked it.  Now, one year has gone by and I am actually kind of salty and realize how ""abusive"" they were. I feel taken advantage of. The problem is, it's one year later.  Am i too late to try and get any payment out of this? I feel stupid for not doing anything about it sooner but was wondering if I can now."	No
1312	(Indiana and California, for the bot, but I think it's all federal.)   My former cell phone provider thinks I owe them $300. I disagree, but that's not really the issue here.  I sent a general dispute letter the first time it was sent to collections, asking for verification. Instead of verification, I got a letter back from the collection agency that they were returning it to the cell provider. Today, I got a new letter in the mail from a different agency.  I plan on disputing that one as well, but if the same thing happens, is there a point where I'm done? Or can the provider just keep sending it to a new collection agency every time I dispute it, rather than having them actually send the verifications they're required to provide by law?   Sending certified letters will eventually rack up more than the debt, but I'd hate for the one I don't send certified to be the one I actually have a solid FDCPA violation with.	No
1313	This story takes place in Philadelphia, PA where I recently had a contractor underpin a portion of my home's foundation. The reason for the underpinning was a vertical crack running from the basement up to the bottom of my third floor. When I purchased the home (a little over a year ago), I paid a reputable structural engineer to evaluate this crack. He explained it was old, the house was done settling, and he didn't even want to charge me for writing up a report (I therefore only have my word and the word of my friend who was present). My question in this regard is do I have recourse? Since moving in, the crack has grown and a new engineer and an insurance agent have deemed it a structural problem in need of underpinning. Has the statute of limitations expired? Have I ruined my chances in court by having work done? What about by not possessing the original engineer's report? I have not called this engineer back, btw. On top of this debacle, the contractor who came to do work has completed its work but has not provided me with the approved plans and permits from the city of philadelphia. I have refused to pay. Although the signed contract says nothing about permits, I have email evidence in which the contractor states that permits are included in the cost of work. Additionally, the contract states that work will be performed to industry standards. Is this enough to maintain a legal case for withholding full payment (down payment was paid)? The foundation contractor is the largest of its kind in Philadelphia. The permit handler at the contractor continues to say he is trying to get the permit 6 months after the fact. I think I'm being had. I'm worried I will be charged interest for not paying in full and will be left with unpermitted work which will cost me even more money to correct and get compliant. However, I'm also assuming the contractor won't pursue me. Couldn't the contractor lose its license for not pulling permits? Should I continue to refuse to pay? Should I sue for the unpermitted work done? Will correcting this issue cost me more in the future if I don't? How should i proceed? As my home is a townhome, the work was done on a party-wall foundation which I share with my neighbor. He shared the expenses and paid in full through the contractor's financing options. What is my neighbor's path forward? Thanks for the help!	No
1314	Imagine that you are a volunteer premed working in a free clinic that serves a large immigrant population. Your duties include taking the patients’ medical history. Today you are working with an elderly patient who does not speak English and the adult son is translating for his mother. You notice that he is answering many of the questions for her without translating. During the conversation, the son tells you that if his mother has cancer he does not want her to know because the news “will kill her”. He says that in his family he speaks for the elderly mother and does not want a translator. How will you approach this situation?	No
1315	We have not acted in a way that would attract wood consuming organisms.  I have applied an exterior treatment but we still feel we are seeing the occasional termite.   The roof of our house had a leak that went untreated for over a year, recently the owner paid to have the roof sealed but had previously nailed a series of tarps that kept blowing off, the nail holes were allowing more water intrusion according to the contractor they sent for the repairs.  Are we responsible for a full blown termite extermination? I feel that because they left the roof leak untreated for so long they created a favorable environment for pests.    Do we have a case for the LL to cover the repair?	No
1316	My girlfriends son is almost 2 years old. A few weeks ago he hurt his leg, and she took him the very next day to an urgent care facility. They did X-rays and stated a sprain. A week later he was still showing pain and swelling so she took him to another imaging facility who also stated sprain after additional X-ray. Today she is at Vanderbuilt with him and the doctora there are saying a fracture.  Is there any action that can be taken against the first two facilities?	No
1317	Hi all,   I am a sublessor who signed a sublease (month-to-month) with a subtenant (found on Craigslist) who agreed to move in on August 1.  The sublessee signed a contract, but didn't pay and just backed out the last day.   I used the [California Sublease Agreement](https://rentallease.net/wp-content/uploads/california-sublease-agreement.jpg) as a template.   Because I held the room for the tenant, I am now eating the cost as I search for a new roommate.  I trusted this person, and obviously realize fully my mistake, and in the future will always get the money upon contract signature.   Is there nothing I can do legally to get some sort of reparation, or to file a claim for breach of formally signed contract?  The roommate is no longer completely dark, so if I could even convey some sort of realistic legal claim to him it could help my cause.	No
1318	Hi everyone! I'm in a apartment building in Massachusetts and hoping to be able to break our lease.   My main question is this - technically the CURRENT lease ends Aug 31, however our unit makes us resign our lease in April (3 months ago) for the following year if we plan on staying. Is it possible that since the active lease ends Aug 31 we have a chance of cancelling the lease we signed that doesn't start until Sep 1st?  Thank you for all of your help!!!	No
1319	About a year ago, our townhouse complex implemented this Poo Prints DNA testing for dog poop so that they could test poop found on the premises and fine the owners for it. As responsible dog owners, we happily agreed and took our dog to the front office so they could get a DNA swab from his mouth.  Fast forward to today and I've just received a notice that we are getting a $100 fine from a sample collected June 12th. I am beyond BAFFLED by this because we are so diligent about picking up after him, especially after the Poo Prints program started! We picked up his poop beforehand anyway, but you can bet that the idea of a fine has kept us on our toes.  I would have been the one walking him given the day/time the sample was collected, and they even state WHERE it was collected, and I do not know how in my right mind I would have left a big pile of poop right behind the clubhouse where management is?!?!? I don't remember the walk exactly because we walk him 3x a day (it's a lot of poop to pick up, but we do it because we should and because we also don't want a fine!) I just can't BELIEVE that I would have left his poop there. Unless it was soft poop that was difficult to clean up or diarrhea, I have no idea (and I can't remember if he was having digestive issues a month ago). He is a large dog- maybe it was soft poop that I didn't grab all the way?  In any case, it's incredibly frustrating because we do what we're supposed to and WE are being punished. I see piles of dog crap laying around quite often and am always surprised.  Is there anything we can do to fight/contest this? We have no other pet violations. I've done some brief poking around on the internet and it seems to me like fecal matter isn't great for DNA testing but I'm just really not sure what to do.	No

1321	This happened in Washington, DC in March 2015. I was going to school there and dating a guy. We had been dating for about 18 months when the rape happened. He was very verbally and mentally abusive, and had me completely under his thumb. I was also suffering from depression and untreated anxiety at the time. He penetrated me while I was sleeping. I immediately felt assaulted, but I didn't file a report because I was too depressed to make myself do anything and too afraid of him.  I've been haunted by this ever since it happened. I still feel violated, I still have issues with intimacy, I still have huge issues with distrust. I know he's out there being successful and living his life with no consequences while I deal with nothing but pain. I feel like the only way I can move on is if I get some sort of justice.   But there are problems:  -I don't live in Washington, DC anymore. I ended up transferring colleges.   -It was so long ago. I don't even remember the exact date and time.   -We had consensual sex before he raped me and consensual sex afterwards, because I was in shock and afraid. I know that kind of thing looks bad to police and juries though.   -He asked me if he had raped me several times and I always told him no. I only said no because I still loved him like a fool, and I was terrified. But I know it makes me look really bad.   I would change what I did and said if I could in a heartbeat, but I can't.   Do the lawyers here recommend that I report him anyway? Would I look like a liar or someone who wanted revenge? And how would I go about it since I don't live in the same state that it happened, and I don't remember some vital details?  Thank you	No
1322	"Howdy /r/legaladvice.   My wife and I recently bought a house and are looking to end our 2 year lease early. It's scheduled to be up April of next year and we anticipate being fully ""moved over"" by November.   The problem? Our landlord has no desire to work with us. I'm fully prepared to pay out the remainder if needed, but I'm really trying to find a middle ground. Our lease doesn't have any verbiage regarding terminating early.   He's stated the only way he'll let us out is if he's able to sell the house. No timeline. So if he lists it high we could end up in April 2018 anyway. He said he has no desire to re-rent the house after I offered to help find another tenant and might even leave it vacant for a bit after we leave.   From my basic understanding: That's malarkey. He has to at least ""try"".   What are my options here? What's the best way to approach it?  The situation has my wife furious because he originally tried to sell the place one month in to the 2 year lease (it fell through) and was only going to give us 2 times our security deposit for the ""inconvenience""."	No
1323	"http://i.imgur.com/tfYD2ih.jpg  This is the notice. Like I said, I don't smoke so it doesn't affect me, but I am curious I guess and probably because when this management company took over, they had pushed what ""reasonable notice"" is when dealing with other things that require entering our apartments that are non emergency."	No
1324	I'm moving out of the US and from what I understand, should have a POA to act on my behalf if needed with regard to banking, taxes, etc. I have a sibling in MI and a friend in FL that I would like to give independent POA. Obviously they can't sign one form at the same time in front of witnesses and a notary. Is it okay if I create two separate forms as long as I reference the other POA on it? Thanks in advance.	No
1325	My husband and I are moving out of an apartment in PA. When we moved in, the landlord asked for first and last month's rent, but not a security deposit. We were not given a move-out checklist nor is there anything in the lease about what needs to be done. We kept the property clean and in good shape, but we were wondering if we legally have to clean the property before we move out.  Here is what our lease says: 8. RETURN OF SECURITY DEPOSITS (B) Within 30 days after Tenant moves from the Property, Landlord will give Tenant a written list of any damage to the Property for which the Landlord claims the Tenant is responsible. (C) Landlord may deduct repair costs and any unpaid Rent and Additional Rent from Tenant's Security Deposit. Any remaining Security Deposit will be returned to Tenant within 30 days after Tenant moves from property. 17. TENANT'S CARE OF PROPERTY (A) Tenant will: 1. Keep the Property clean and safe. 2. Dispose of all trash, garbage and any other waste materials as required by Landlord and the law.  Typically, they deduct cleaning costs from the security deposit, but because we did not pay one, would we be billed for the cleaning costs anyway? As I mentioned before, the apartment isn't dirty, but the leasing agent complained that there was dust in the bathtub and grease on the stove.  I'm not trying to make a big deal out of this, but we moved 2 hours away, so it will cost us another day and a tank of gas to go clean up some dust and grease.  Any advice would help! Thank you!	No
1326	"I am in a house in MA where I paid one of the roommates directly two months worth of rent and utilities for a sublet room - some of the previous occupants of the lease have quit before it was up. Going through the lease it says anyone past 3 weeks not on the lease in the premise is considered an ""illegal subletter"" - I have given one of these people rent for two months, who have just disappeared. Their lease ends in end of August.   The roommate in question just messaged me asking to pay ""the rent"" to the other roommate despite already receiving it himself. It seems he is pocketing the money directly and I talked to the other roommate who more or less admitted to doing the same from the other subletters (there are three of us)  They seem to have no intention in making the full monthly rent in transferring the funds received to the management company. My portion of the rent is through a church's support program to combat homelessness.  What are my options here? I have been here 3 weeks. I know it's a month before you are considered a ""occupier"" I believe in MA law? I don't want to get evicted, the management company does not know I/we are here yet, but they seem to be taking advantage of everything."	No
1327	My friend has been renting a house for several years. She is always on time with her rent and has kept the property in good repair. She received an email today saying that the landlord wants her out by the end of the month. No reason was given. She had apparently received a previous email on June 29 notifying her of the landlord's decision, but she didn't see that email in her inbox. So technically she's been given a month's notice, but for all practical purposes, she's looking at losing her home in about two weeks.  Relevant/possibly relevant info:  - She's in Texas.  - She's pretty sure she wasn't sent a new lease agreement for this year (I'm not sure when her lease year was up). If she's right, she doesn't have the protection of a lease.  - She has a 14 year old daughter and 19 year old son living with her. Obviously the 19yo is an adult, but does the fact that a minor is involved affect anything?  - She works for a company, but from her home. She says that it takes more than two weeks to get the company to move her equipment to a new location, and she isn't allowed to move the equipment herself.  - She has never received a mailed notice, just email.  Does she have any options here? Is this eviction legal, especially in that short a time frame?   She could potentially move somewhere else, but not in the time frame she's looking at. She may not even be able to get her work equipment out of the house in that amount of time. Does she have any options for fighting the eviction or at least buying some time to find a new place and move?	No
1328	Hey all. Sorry if I come off as a noob when it comes to legal matters.  About 2 months ago, someone left a threatening note on my door. I was pretty certain it was my roommate's friend (let's call him michael) who I got kicked out of the apartment because he was staying there while my roommate wasn't. I filed a police report just to have it on record and notified the private security company that works for the apartment complex I'm staying at.  Just recently, while I was away for the weekend, someone broke in through my window and took my guitar and my speaker (roughly $500 - $600 in combined value). Also some of the walls are slightly damaged. I filed a supplemental police report. I strongly suspected it was Michael.   When I notified the security company, they sent one of their officers over to my unit just to ask me some questions. The officer said that he saw someone who fit Michael's exact description messing with my window and approached him and asked if he lived there. Michael told the officer that he was the one living in my unit. Then the officer just kept making his rounds around the complex.   Just this week, the apartment complex switched to a different security company. Idk if that's relevant or suspicious or anything like that. Just thought it was weird.  Really all I want is to be reimbursed for my losses, and to not be charged for damages to my apartment. Can I do anything about it? Would I have to go after the apartment complex or the security company?  Any input would be appreciated. Cheers!	No
1329	I broke a lease (I was never served a notice to vacate) with an apartment in Texas.  They charged me for the remaining months, and added all concessions from the previous months.  The balance is somewhere near $5,500 and is definitely on my credit report.  Next Summer, I'd like to buy/rent a house with my wife. By that time, it will be seven years after the first report of the debt.   Hunter Warfield owns the debt and I've never talked to anyone from the company.  They stopped calling me a long time ago.  I've considered calling and after specifying that I am not promising/making an offer to pay, nor acknowledging the validity of the debt, seeing what they'd want me to pay to satisfy the debt.    1. Does this debt act like other debt, in that it falls off after seven years, or will this be on there until I pay the collections company?  2. Am I correct that the statute of limitations for suing me for this debt has passed?  According to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code § 16.001 et seq., Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 2.725, the limit is four years.    3. Would contacting HW be a smart or stupid move?   4. Would contacting HW reset the seven-year clock?   5. Any tips for dealing with HW and not getting completely screwed? Certain verbiage or terms to use?  What's a good offer on a six-year old debt of this size?  If the answer to question 1 is that it in fact falls off, I have no interest in offering to work with HW and I don't need answers for 3, 4, &amp; 5.	No
1330	I signed a lease for an apartment, and my lease begins a week from today. The leasing agent called me this afternoon (Sunday) to ask me to establish an electric account first thing Monday morning as the current tentants have just moved out, and they have contractors coming in this week to make upgrades to the apartment and need power. The leasing agent (LA) made it sound like I HAD to do this immediately, but my roommates and I were hesitant since our lease doesn't start until a week from now, and we didn't feel comfortable paying for things like this until our lease begins. After we told LA we had reservations about paying for the electric for power tools and the AC in the summer heat, the LA begrudgingly said he could start the account and pay this week of electric.    I'm curious about the legality of this, more from a curiosity standpoint, about whether turning on electric a week before a lease begins would be the LA and the owners responsibilty, or is it the future tenant's responsibity. I didn't see anything referenced in our lease to this exact situation or online, so I'm turning here for advice!	No
1331	Ive been im the place for almost 2 months now and have never lived somewhere with an a.c. unit so Idk if I'm wrong here.   Anyways we moved in last month and had no a.c. for about a week. They came did some work and it sorta worked. Then the first of this month it took a dump and died, leaking water through the ceiling. They sent someone out to fix it around the 14th and finally ended up replacing it last week. It still is unable to keep the temperature below 80 degrees during the daytime. I have a feeling the unit is too small for the house since it's unable to keep the house cooled. I have the windows and blinds closed and the ceiling fans on. I even installd an attic fan.  Where do I go from here?	No
1332	I am from Canada so I am not terribly familiar with this situation under state laws. My friend has a sister who has been in the ICU for a couple weeks now and requires heart surgery. Without the surgery she will die, and even with it, it is highly likely she will die. They are a very poor family and already struggle to make ends meet. If the sister dies, are the parents responsible for outstanding debt?   I thought a hospital bill can only be charged to the patient, an insurance company or if someone had signed something. Just looking for some advice on how this sort of stuff works and where to go from here.	No
1333	Is it legal to post videos which are sent around on what's app groups on a personal website or a personal you tube account  (which runs ads) without permission from the creator? (Many times the creator is unknown as the videos are forwarded many times over.)  Thanks in advance.	No
1334	"I have worked for this company since 2009. In 2015 I left for 8 months and when they asked me to come back we negotiated terms. As part of this deal I was now a salaried employee and working mon-Thursday. All was well and fine so I thought. Two months ago I put in a ""time off request"" for 8 working days in late June. The request was accepted and signed by the owner who is my direct boss. And nothing more was said. A week after I got back my boss told me that because I was gone so long I had to ""make up"" days I missed. This bothered me because he never mentioned it before I left or before he signed and agreed. It was only after I was back and he ""realized"" how long I would be gone. That's his fault. So he said I had to make up the days I was gone. He said he would pay me for 40 hours but the rest was on me to make up. I was bothered by it but ok whatever I'll work a Friday or two that's fine.    But then I got an email sunday asking me to fill out a new time sheet for the time I was gone and submit a plan in writing to him to make up the days I missed. Also He wants me to go through all my time sheets since I came back and document any other days he approved for vacation and document those on time sheets and show what days I will make up as well.    Then he is telling me that he is going to give me different vacation allotment because I work 4 days a week (32 total vacation hours per year when everyone else gets 40 hours no matter what) because I am salaried.   So do I have any room to say to him that I am not going to make up time because he did not require me to until after the fact?"	No
1335	"So I wanted to dig in my back yard and I am well aware of the digging laws, so I wanted to save some work for the authorities so I detected the gas areas and spraypainted them.     I wanted to start digging for a wooden-pallet stage (foundation for eventually a covered-space), and I called the appropriate authorities that I saw on the [marker](https://i.imgur.com/MwWKtdK.jpg) (like the 811 numbers). After they came and saw I had everything spraypainted, they said everything was fine and left before they could give me a ticket (I researched digging tickets). She seemed pretty confused, so I am thinking she wasn't aware of what she was supposed to do. Plus, she wasn't in a uniform, and aren't those folks usually in a uniform?     I then called my town authorities and my phone company, but they said nothing was there that was registered on their records. They came and checked it out, but then directed me, yet again, to the 811 folks.    So I called 811 again, but they said they had, on file, a denied record for me to dig. What!?!?!?!?!? I literally saw the lady without a uniform leave my property after not knowing what to do (maybe she was a new member?). I just want to dig up and lay my foundation for my stage.    I called my town again and they chewed me out for ""harrassment"", saying that I needed to contact 811, before I could explain myself, they hung up.    I know it's against the law to dig without those tickets, but it's my property.....  what can I do?"	No
1336	Basically I moved into this apartment a year ago and was not informed of all the problems it had. There were bugs and loud neighbors and the building was pretty disgusting overall. I was desperate and just chose the first thing I found, not thinking it was that bad.   During the year, I had made several calls and emails to my landlord about the main two problems, but would contact him with questions all the time. Eventually he stopped responding to me when I would complain to him about problems. I had talked to the main contractor who works on the building, Will, and he told me to just contact him with problems because he reports directly to the landlord.   I had moved out on July 24th, and when I was contacting Will to check out the apartment, my landlord finally contacted me. He told me I needed to send a formal letter of intent to move out, but it does not state that anywhere in the lease. The lease just states that I had to give a 30 day notice to move out, which I gave to Will. Now my landlord sent me a letter saying he will not be refunding my security deposit at all solely based on the fact that I did not give a notice to move out, even though it was given to Will. Will was at the apartment building almost every day working on renovating other apartments, so it was much easier to get ahold of him.   I'm just wondering, is there any chance I can get my money back? It doesn't state anywhere in the lease either that I have to give my notice to the landlord directly and Will reports straight to him, so I feel like I'm not completely in the wrong. My mom is willing to fight and take this to a small court and wants to report him to an organization like the BBB (I'm not sure who I would reach out to for help in this case). It's only a $425 security deposit, but if it's worth the money to fight then my mom is okay with that.  Any advice helps, thanks!  [Copy of Lease](http://imgur.com/a/PGQCQ)	No
1337	My aunt is getting quite old and wants to set up a Living Trust and Will.  Both are quite straight forward as she wants to give everything to her daughter however she does have an estranged son that she no longer communicates with and wishes to ensure that he does not receive anything..  would LegalZoom be acceptable for this or would it be best to consult a lawyer.  also what would the expected cost be for a Living Trust and Will?	No
1338	"I live in an area where it is very difficult to find a place to live. So I had looked at a property where a few other tenants where living and that time. They asked me if I was interested and then asked if I was ""commited"" which I said yes (this was by text). I signed an application to their landlord. However they asked me to pay rent and a security deposit. But I said I would not pay until I was given a lease. I have recently found a different place and I sign the lease tomorrow. Am I liable for anything at this place I ""commited"" to. To give some perspective I looked at the property two weeks ago and still have not been given a lease. The plan was for me to move in Aug 1'st.  Thanks for any help that you can give, I have been stressing about this."	No
1339	I moved into an apartment with some damage to walls and doors, etc about a month ago. The device I used to document the damage broke, there are no back ups and I cannot recover them. I really don't want to get charged for it at the end of the lease (1 year). What should I do now?	No

1341	Morning!  I know this would be more appropriate under a financial subreddit, but I'm worried there will be some legal implications so I thought to ask here first.  Last night I went to check my credit score for the first time (19, only have a joint student loan w/ my dad and a credit card in my name, which I got 6 months ago) so I went to CreditKarma.  Perfectly fine score, but it appeared there were two loans under my name.  One was a joint student loan from Sallie Mae, which I knew about and receive emails from etc.  The other was a student loan taken out individually before my 18th birthday.  My dad has never used this bank (Cornerstone) and never took out a loan in the amount listed.  After some research, it appears that loans can't be given to minors individually in the US anyway, so I'm not even entirely sure how a bank allowed this to happen.  I also know I never received a check for thousands of dollars I apparently took out.  I know I need to call someone and let them know what's going on.  Who is it exactly that I call?  I assume not CreditKarma- maybe the bank?  Or do I need to find a lawyer and contact the police for some stolen identity case?  Sorry for all the questions, this is my first financial issue as an adult and I want to make sure I handle it properly.  Thank you in advance!	No
1342	In December of last year I discovered that my brewery's water supply was sharing a water meter with a business in a separate building on the same property. (Both are owned by the same landlord). I learned this when the other business shut off my water after receiving their water bill (the water meter is located in their building). After some furious calls to the landlord the water was turned back on and the landlord learned that it's a violation of water authority rules to have two buildings on the same meter.  The landlord agreed to remedy the situation as soon as we could pave blacktop as the install involved digging.  We'll it's now August and I'm still waiting and getting nothing but the run around.  Do I have any way to force his hand on this legally as he is in violation of county water authority rules?   Could I complete the work myself and then find remedy in small claims?  Any thoughts, suggestions, or ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers!	No
1343	"Ill try to make this short,  Found a bedbug (confirmed it is a bedbug). Told our apartment complex right when we found it (Friday 8/4). They are telling us a exterminator will come to make an ""inspection"" on Tuesday 8/8. And told us that we will be charged for the whole ordeal.  The charge I can fight on my own I know they are 100% in the wrong there, however do they have a legal obligation to react faster to the bedbugs? They are giving those bastards 4 extra days to party and feed off of us. Also if its only an ""Inspection"" they have more days to feed off us!  Couldnt find it with my google skills, anyone have any experience?  Thank you,"	No
1344	"Last month I signed for my first apartment by myself, which I moved into on July 1, and I never received a copy of the lease. This being my first time doing everything on my own, I was so worried about making beginner mistakes that I probably made more than just what I can identify now. All correspondence with the landlord has been done through the real estate agent who showed me the place. The agent is relatively new to the city and in a new office, so his explanation of not having a scanner yet to provide me a copy of the lease made sense to me and he said the landlord company would send me a copy once they signed. Of course, it wasn't until after the fact that I realized I could have simply taken photos with my phone, but I was too nervous to think straight.  Anyway, that was last month, every week since then I've been emailing the agent for any updates on the copy and he would respond that the company hadn't gotten back to him yet. The past two weeks I received no response to my weekly requests, so I had started assuming something's gone wrong. Earlier today I emailed the agent again, this time requesting the landlord company's address so I can mail the rent (the agent mailed the first checks - me, being an idiot, didn't think to ask where to). The agent finally got back to me with the address and casually added if I can come by later to sign another copy of the lease so I can have an original.  So now I'm concerned, I ask what happened to the original lease and why they don't have a copy they can send me. The agent replies that the company ""may have misplaced it or forgot to scan it"" but that the copy he's printing is exactly the same. I asked if I could just have the copy he printed for reference and that I'm willing to wait for the company to relocate the original. So far, that's the last message in the chain; it's already 11 PM here so I don't expect this to continue until tomorrow.  So what course of action can I take from here? Did I totally screw myself by not getting a copy at my first opportunity? Right now I'm giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, but does anyone sense anything more nefarious at hand?"	No
1345	My seventeen year old daughter made some poor decisions and ended up passed out in the back of a taxi last night with some friends who were apparently trying to get her back to one of their homes. At one point, it seems she need to vomit and the driver stopped the car. Somehow, the car door was opened and my daughter, who remembers nothing, ended up hitting her head on the ground and suffered a major concussion. At that point, instead of seeking medical attention, the driver simply put her back in the car and finished the route. We only found out about this later the next day.   Is there a cause of action here? If I find out the driver was responsible for opening the car door and causing my daughter's injury could she/he be found liable?	No
1346	"So I've been live in my girlfriend's apartment for more then half a year. I've bought a scooter and asked management to be put on the lease so I can have a parking spot. They told me that because she has a ""tax credit"" unit if I'm put on the lease we have to move to another, non-tax credit unit. But the problem is that they don't have another unit for us to move into. Never mind the scooter (i'll park it at friends house), can I keep living in the apartment without being on the lease and can I get in any potential problems because of that?  Thank you in advance."	No
1347	Roommate gave key to boyfriend w/o discussing it with me. I came home one day after being away and heard someone enter the apartment. Expecting it to be my roommate, it was her boyfriend and she was nowhere to be found. She refuses to return the key and I'm forced to live with the couple until I can find a replacement. He spends every night here. What are my options, please?   Lease has no duplicate key clause.   Thank you.	No
1348	"My problem isn't with the realtor, but with the background check company they use. This is in Minnesota and the company is called Rental History Reports. If you look them up online, it returns a lot of similar stories about false information or unfinished reports being delivered to potential landlords.   Myself and two others were attempting to rent a house for $1400. The minimum required income is $4200.  They got literally all of our incomes wrong. One person makes $2560 per month, they claimed $2200. Another makes $1400 per month and they only agreed with $500 of that being ""verifiable.""   What's worse is they told my potential landlord that I make $0 per month and have $0 to my name. Yet, they had no problem verifying my 780 credit score *shrug*  They initially wanted me to provide pay stubs, but I'm self-employed and don't have pay stubs. I gave them screenshots of my bank accounts showing a bank balance over $4,000 and 30 days of deposits and cash receipts showing $2100 of income over a 30 day period. One of their employees told me this would be ""more than sufficient.""   They never informed me that they were having issues confirming my income. They just seemingly gave up and thought it would be cool to tell my potential landlord that I make $0.  This income is new, within the past few months, so it is not verifiable via tax returns. I do not deposit my cash payments into my bank account, though I do keep record of them and provide receipts to all of my clients.  Short of having them call up all of my clients over the last month to personally verify every dollar they paid me, I can't imagine what else I can do.  The only other thing I can think of is that I did not report other sources of income that could substitute, I suppose. But I don't know how to account for it exactly: I have a trust account with approx $1 million and am allowed to draw literally any amount per month (I rarely draw anything from it). My parents can verify the account. Any way to report this in a way that would satisfy their ""3x monthly income"" requirement?  I'd just have my parents co-sign, but the landlord doesn't allow it.  What else can I do? Is there no legal recourse against a company basically telling my potential landlord that I'm a supposed degenerate making literally $0?! I am just mind blown that they would think a $0 income is accurate. Just, wow....   The landlord says he will give me one week to debate with the background check company and get them to approve my income."	No
1349	So to me it seems pretty cut and dry, but the company I used to rent from decided to charge me the remaining rent on the lease even though I let them know in person and in writing over a month before our planned move out date. The reason I needed to break my lease was that I had military orders and I was separating from the Armed Forces. Charging me past the move out date violated the SCRA and also Florida statues.  I know I'm in the right AND I have supporting documents (Orders, letter of intent to vacate, etc), but they're making me jump through hoops to not have my credit affected.   My main question is, after working for weeks to reason with them, can I be justified writing a formal demand to compensate me for having to deal with this for weeks? In addition to them striking my debt of course. Thanks!	No
1350	The lease has no provision covering the possibility of the property being sold.  Would any buyer be bound by the terms of my existing lease?  I've found conflicting opinions when I searched Google. Some say the lease is tied to the property, and the buyer is buying the lease as part of the property. Others say the buyer has a right to execute a new lease or evict us if they so choose.  The lease doesn't start until 9/1, and the property is currently on the market. I'm just trying to figure out if I should expect to get kicked out of this place.	No
1351	Hello. Pretty short question. I live an apartment complex in Vermont and the septic tank busted. Causing a sink hole of sewage in the back yard. We have been given no notice that they are going to do anything about it. We live by a river, and I am unsure if the sewage is seeping into the river.   I am unsure what I can do, so any info you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thanks!	No
1352	So in March, my girlfriend and I signed a one-year lease for an apartment in a small city in PA. Everything was going well, until around May, when our landlord request we start sending our rent to his property management company. Although they were not mentioned on the lease at all, we did what he asked because we figured it would be fine.   About three weeks ago, our ceiling started leaking. Water is coming in the side of the house and was dripping through our drop ceiling. Last Friday, one of the tiles caved in dropped a bunch of water on the floor. It's Monday, and the property management team came once and has been avoiding us since, maybe to come tomorrow, but i'm really starting to get worried. They also said that they just got this property, so they have been introduced into the equations since we signed our lease. Our landlord tells us there is nothing he can do and to call property management. Is it legal for him to do this when they were not mentioned on the lease? I really don't want to break another lease but I cannot live like this.  Thanks so much in advance.	No
1353	Hi everyone! Short and sweet: I’ve never gotten a speeding ticket before. I grew up in VA and I know the driving laws.  The minor violations I’ve incurred are:  Driving too closely (minor fender bender in early 2014) in VA  Red light ticket a few months ago in Illinois  I moved to Chicago recently and drove all the way to Virginia Beach in one day (not that big of a deal but context is important). When I reached Lexington, VA I got pulled over going 90 in a 70.  I had my cruise control on UNDER 80 almost my whole trip; I think I had taken it off due to the twisty nature of the road, I had to brake a lot. Anyway, the road was empty, I was just in the zone driving, and I guess I had pressed too hard down and was pulled over at 90, not realizing I never put my CC back on.  Anyways, I’m devastated. I don’t really know what to do. I know better than to go over 80 in VA (or anywhere, really), yet here we are.  Any advice is much appreciated.	No
1354	"[QLD, Australia]  I have pet rats, I know they're not everyone's favourite pet but I care about my pet rats very dearly (try imagine them how you would feel about your pet dog or cat). However I had to go to America for work related stuff and left my rats (2 female) in care of a person who I looked after their dog for 3 months+ when they were on holidays.  I was gone for about 3 weeks, I came back and instead of my rats being in their cage the person had put them in a plastic container with air holes in it. I asked why and they said it was because the rats developed lice- occasionally rats can get lice from things like bedding or saw dust, etc. Then after treatment they put them in the container to apparently limit the rats from potentially getting lice again.  However the container was moist from the rats spilling water and peeing in the container as rats do. Well lo and behold I put the rats back into their clean cage and didn't thing much about it because they didn't look sick. However I had the rats out in my living room for a run, one of them peed on a newspaper and there was a live maggot in the urine patch. I could not believe what happened. Then I picked both of them up at separate times and did the gross thing of ""checking them over"" and one had pus coming out of her urethra with a revolting and strong ammonia smell, while the one that had the maggot come out of her has an inflamed/gapping vag.  I have them both booked in for the vet tomorrow while I'm sincerely worried they're going to die, I know they're easily replacing animals but I don't want them to die and it's costly, also if there's no hope for them I'm going to have to get them put down because I don't want them to die slowly. Apparently they were left in moist plastic container for 2 and a half weeks which obviously caused like a thrush infection of horror on them. I consider this to be animal cruelty and don't know what to do.  I do have text messaging from the person telling me how long they put them in the container for."	No
1355	I have an apartment in south west Wisconsin. I've lived here for 5 years and been a very responsible tenant. I have two other roommates.   So our faucet would leak when used, but it was a small drip and we didn't notice it for a long time. The result of the leak was mold in the cabinet space below. That section will need to be replaced. I reported the leak and concern for mold. They fixed the leak and sprayed the mold with an assurance that it was taken care of, but the cabinets have not been replaced.   I'm about to move out next month and I'm concerned that they have put off the replacement until after we move out and charged me for the damages and I don't have renters insurance.   Is there anything I can do to get some assurance that I won't be effected by these damages?	No
1356	"I do not understand the legal logic in the following immigration situation in which I currently find myself in.  US Citizen with wife who is not US citizen, albeit married legally in USA over 5 years ago. We have 2 US citizen children, of very young age, currently living with wife in the foreign country. After being legally married in US, I moved to wife's country for a few years.  Wife wants to immigrate to US, so does husband (me), for the betterment of the child's education and livelihood. Husband then comes to USA to establish residence and attains a good job to prove an ability to provide for wife (as per regulations in the affidavit of support) .   Immigration services estimates 12 months before issuing a visa, while a Fiance visa will take 6 months (i.e. I go to foreign country, take a ""spouse"" and bring her back). All communications to the USCIS yield little in terms of additional information on the case. Also no way to expedite the case unless she is from an extreme situation, which she is not.   Can someone, please, explain the logic in this situation, or even better, tell me how I can see my family again."	No
1357	So this is a throw away account since I'll be giving away a bit about my location here. I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.   I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.   Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.  So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.	No
1358	I think some lawyer would benefited just to follow me around. Seriously. I have a series of bad luck despite of trying to be very positive. Just this week alone: 1. The president of a dumpster company trespasses my property. I complained to his worker previously but have no intention to pursue it. He took pictures and denied that his worker broke the driveway. He's going to call another expert into my property even after I said he's trespassing. I have the before and after drivrway pictures btw. His company worth 1 million and the damage only worth a few hundreds bucks. Lol.. 2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up. 3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out. 4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools..  5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it. I've dealt with many more.. IRS double charge mistake (1 year to resolve), real estate agent knowingly sold a property with many violations (didn't disclose mold, structural, etc and inspector was her brother), etc.  Disclosures: Not sue happy, PhD in science,  just wonder what the heck life at 1 am..	No
1359	I live in a typical modern subdivision neighborhood with 100-200 homes.  The neighborhood includes a large area of open space (~100+ acres) controlled by an HOA, of which a significant portion is forest.  Within these forested areas, a good portion of the trees (maybe 1/3) are Ash.  As many people who live in the Midwest and Northeast, the Emerald Ash Borer infestation is making its way East.  At the moment my county is one of 2 in PA that has yet to have a detected infestation, however no matter who I ask, they will eventually get here and will kill all of the Ash trees.  I have a few on my property that are large (50+ ft) and I like, so I've paid to have them treated.  The question I have is in regard to the Ash trees on HOA property.  My property is one of many that backs up to a forested area.  In addition, there are several homes that are right up against the forest, seemingly within range of one of these trees if/when it falls.  There are at least 3 Ash trees just off my property, on HOA property.  One is clearly leaning towards my property.  If/when this tree dies where does the liability lie?  If a tree on HOA property is dead and I send notification of a hazard, what is supposed to happen?  Any insight would be much appreciated.	No
1360	So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	No
1361	"Before we begin, here's a little bit of useful background about myself: I'm currently 17, on probation for a misdemeanor paraphernalia charge, and live in a small town in Pennsylvania.  On Monday, (7/10/2017) I was hanging out at my girlfriend's house, as I usually do. Around 12 PM, her friend messaged her and asked if we wanted to hangout after said friend got off of work at 8 PM. At about 8:30 PM, my girlfriend's friend picked us up at her house. We really don't have much to do in my small town, so we decided to drive around for a bit.   At approximately 9:15 PM, the friend that was driving wanted to meet up with her other friend at a local gas station. When we arrived, the girl we were meeting there (19 years old) asked us all if we wanted to just ride in her car, since the friend that originally picked us up, had a pretty unreliable beater. We agreed and got in. I sat in the backseat on the passenger side, while my girlfriend sat in the backseat on the drivers side.   Having nothing to do, we again drove around aimlessly for a few minutes before deciding to go up to a pretty well known hangout spot that overlooks the town. When we got to the spot, the driver pulled out a mason jar with about 8 grams in it (so she said). The driver and friend that was the passenger offered my girlfriend and myself to smoke with them. I declined because i get regularly drug tested due to probation. My girlfriend also declined out of respect for myself. We had no knowledge of it being inside the vehicle before this point.   They rolled up and smoked inside the car, trying to hotbox it (it worked very well). The two finish smoking and the driver spots headlights at the head of the path you drive to get to the spot. She freaks out, and begins to drive down the path towards where she saw the headlights. Take a guess who the lights belonged to? The police. The driver takes a left and makes it about 300 feet before being lit up.   The officer comes up to the window asking what we were doing up there. I (respectfully) asked the officer what we were being stopped for, he claimed ""suspicious vehicle on private property"". Here's the thing, there's no signs anywhere near where we were, or even in the area that claim private property. I've gone up there with friends many times and have never once have heard it was private land. Anyways, obviously the car smelled like a dispensary. The officer collected everyone's ID and went back to his car. 5 minutes later, another police vehicle pulls up. The arriving officer comes right up to the window and the first thing he says is ""Where's the weed?"". Everyone in the car refused knowing who's it was or where it was, trying to keep us all out of trouble.   He then asks us all to step out of the car, and we all comply. He asks me if he can pat me down and search my person. I agree because I had nothing on me or in my possession, he found nothing on me and then repeated the process with the rest of the people. He asked me directly if I knew where it was and I politely plead the 5th. After not getting an answer out of anyone, he begins to search the car and finds the jar underneath the driver's seat. No body was arrested, they had us all call our parents to take us home.  I've went down to my local courthouse today and filled out a statement with my girlfriend entailing exactly what I've said here.   Here are my questions. The driver and passenger are both pretty good friends and I have no doubt they've tried to pin it on myself or my girlfriend by now saying it was one of ours. Would the prosecutor side with myself and girlfriend or them, being it was in the other girls car?   Also, what can I expect? I messed up before and was caught, now I have nothing to do with it and I don't want anymore legal trouble being as i'm already on probation.  Thank you all so much for any advice you can give."	No

1363	"In May 2016 I signed a one year lease for a place. In late-February/early-March of 2017 my landlord asked me if I'd be renewing my lease, I respond with ""as of right now yes"". Come May 2017, there was no signing of a new lease for May 2017-2018. I was informed (or misinformed) that when a written year lease is up and a new lease for the next year isn't signed it goes to a month-to-month lease. On May 25, 2017, I informed my landlord via text message  that I will be moving out July 1 (i told her i needed to speak with her later via phone but she insisted i told her what was up now over text to i did). She said ""well i thought you said you wanted it for another year"". I explain the situation, she response with ""make sure the house is clean so i can show it to prospects ASAP"".  It's now mid-July so by the end of the month of was expecting my security deposit back (i left the house exactly how i got it, cleaned, vacuumed, mopped, etc). Today she told me ""Verbal agreement is binding. You verbally agreed to extend the contract for another year but you changed your mind and left. After you gave me your notice I went into action immediately: advertise and show to prospects. I finally got a tenant effective August 1, 2017 but I was able to make him pay for half of July. So, I have [half the amount of security deposit] for you.""  I have a record of our text conversations.   Did my lease go to month-to-month or stay good for another full 1yr term? Am I entitled to my full security deposit back or does she have legal right to keep half for the half month rent of July?  thank you"	No
1364	"Hello,  I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop.   Reference:  ""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic stop for another violation.   Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement. Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""  From the Arizona state legislature.  The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.  The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.  I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt.   I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this.   Thanks"	No
1365	Background:   3 other friends and I have signed our first lease at a public university. Due to the school year not having started yet, we have not yet moved in.  Recently, the landlord sent us an email asking us if it would be OK to move us one floor up to a unit with the same floor plan. After asking why, it was explained they want to do some work to the apartment we signed for and that it would be better for us if we weren't there.    Here's the dilemma.  Since we've signed the lease, the advertised price of the units has gone down.  What is your guy's advice/opinion? Is the landlords request shady? Would it be possible to negotiate the lower price since we would have to amend the current lease?  Thanks in advance.	No
1366	I sold my first ever car with a broken transmission to some guy who claimed to own a scrap yard and told me he was going to scrap it. This appears to have never happened and now the car I haven't seen in 2+ years has been impounded by the city of Houston. It says I am the REGISTERED owner and also says there is a registered lien holder as well. I do not want to be on the hook for a $20 daily storage fee and the tow.

1367	My roommate hasn't paid rent in 3 months. I live in Arizona. He has had 2 other people illegally living in his apartment, along with several drugs being done in his room. I want to go the leasing office and tell them about this issue, but I'm afraid it will backfire on me, and I'll get an eviction on my record which I obviously do not want. Would it be easier to break the lease (for $3000), and sue him for the total $5000 he owes me, or just tell the office and risk it? Or do I have any other options? Can anyone help, or direct me to an Arizona lawyer who can, that won't charge me an absurd amount of money? Thanks in advance.	No
1368	Hello all!  My boyfriend and I have been struggling with frustration for a while. A few months back, our next door neighboor hired a man to build a fence dividing our backyards. Our front yards, as seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/DKREo), have a joint driveway (with a discoloration between the two sides so you can kind of see where the division is). As he was almost finished building,  my boyfriend pulled out our surveyors certificate of our land lot and we were able to determine that they were building the fence **three feet** in on our property and so we asked them to move it. They complied, and the man rebuilt the fence - only to still have built it about a **foot** in on our property. The fence has been up for about a month now. We've been struggling with how to bring this up (again) and were curious what options we had if, once we do confront him, he says no. We don't exactly get along with our neighbor and he does not seem to be the accommodating (or nice, friendly, happy) type.	No
1369	"I posted here awhile back about my new roommate acting sketchy. Long story short I'm moving out because it's confirmed she's trying to make me pay more in bills. She wants me to be out by August 5th which we agreed on, I prorated the August 1-5th rent which will be $169.   Now the hard part that comes in are the bills. She wanted me to pay her TV bill essentially, also it was last months bill for the previous roommate but she said people have always paid the previous tenants bill when they moved in. Smells like BS, and it definitely is. So she wants me to pay this huge portion of the bill that isn't internet, it's TV and I do not own a TV or cable box in my room. She argued with me that I could've put one in there and that it's my fault but I brought up her OWN contract that she is blatantly going against. On top of that the contract states 50% gas, electric and ""internet time Warner"". Now that's a play on words, she said that the internet is included in the time Warner bill but it has its own price. I'm simply not going to pay her TV, and the contract is specifically saying Internet, but that is one of those either or scenarios due to the wording. I just feel since the contract literally says internet time Warner, and not just ""time Warner"" that I should be paying for...the internet. I included the pics for you guys to see for yourself.   She keeps bringing up that she has an attorney she's speaking with about her rights, and how we have texts that are saying I want a TV (I checked our texts, nothing is along the lines of that except her saying the previous roommate is taking his TV back) when I really don't watch TV since I'm never home anyway. Her entire contract is going against what she's saying except that small play on words with the internet.  How do I go about doing the math for July 1- August 5th utility bills? I am not including the $95 and anything TV related. Just gas, internet and electricity. Prorating rent is one thing, but this is different. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.   http://imgur.com/a/0LVbv http://imgur.com/a/6R5fP http://imgur.com/a/09XGB"	No
1370	I moved in to a rental home several days ago which I found through a property management company. This morning I noticed a small white camera in the corner of my dining room. It appears to be motion activated, as a red light will illuminate whenever I walk by. I'm not sure if this camera belongs to the owner of the property, or if it belonged to the previous tenants who just decided to leave it. Further, I am not sure if the camera is capable of transmitting audio and video (I had private Wifi set up when I moved in, and the camera could require Wifi for transmission). Nonetheless this is an uncomfortable situation and I am not sure how to proceed. I am considering using this as leverage to have the owner make repairs in the home, as there are several things that are not up to move-in condition. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
1371	I have moved out of an apartment recently, my official final day being today.   Over the past few days I have been removing all of my stuff from the apartment, and went back earlier thisafternoon to collect the remainder of my things.   Upon entry I find that the apartments maintainable men have come in, and check the status of the apartment, as well as they have stolen a variety of my personal items and tools.  What do i need to do to take action against the complex? They have already claimed to have no information about anything being removed, and don't have any explanation why the maintainance men were in the unit, without my permission, before the official conclusion of my lease.

1372	"My father was insured under Medicare and was diagnosed with diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis by his ""primary physician"" (which is basically a group of nurse practitioners) back in August-October 2016. They took x-rays and claimed that the mass in his right lung was due to his lung slowly hardening from pulmonary fibrosis. My father's condition grew worse over the next couple months and my mother requested for him to be admitted to the ER for further examination. They denied my father this opportunity because they said his condition ""wasn't severe enough."" They led my father to believe that his drastic weight loss was from diabetes and that his breathing issues derived from pulmonary fibrosis.  On May 3rd, 2017 he was admitted to the ER because he had trouble breathing. They took a biopsy and determined that he had Stage 4 Lung Cancer. On June 2nd, he passed away.  What can I do? What documents will I need to defend my case?"	No
1373	"Throwaway for this, just so like, my bank doesn't see it or something.  I got a mortgage and moved in to my house recently. As I was doing the closing papers my lawyer said to me ""I'll assume you already filled out banking paper work as I don't have any"", I recalled signing two sheets of paper and said ""yeah"". She continued the process and checked the account and my money was there for the mortgage.  Queue later that day, I realized when she said paperwork she said a whole stack of paper work, and I had only signed two sheets. I've only signed a sheet that allows them to do a credo check, and a sheet that waves my life insurance through the bank, as I'm already insured.  I haven't signed a contract or any terms for the mortgage, but the sale is closed. What does this mean for me?"	No
1374	Here's the situation: I'm an engineer. I've been working at my present company since May 2014. My wife and I are moving from Canada (Alberta) to England in August. My manager, who is a close friend of mine and knows we're moving, accidentally let it slip to my director yesterday that I was going to be leaving the company. My director called me today and asked me about it, so not wanting to lie, I told him that I would be leaving soon, but made it clear that I would be available to work until August 11th which is a week before the move. 5 minutes later he emailed me and he is now asking for me to submit my 2 weeks written notice by the end of the week, in effect shorting me of 3 weeks of work (and thousands of dollars in pay.) Do I have any options or am I screwed?	No
1375	"A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.  State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.  The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.  Now this is where it gets really shady. Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.  So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!"	No
1376	This is a long story, but I will try to make it short.  I bought a house in June, so I wanted to move out of my apartment. However, my lease contract did not have an early termination fee (I found out that Texas laws are terrible for renters).  So I decided to try subleasing my apartment, announcing it on craigslist. I was offering good incentives to whoever decided to move in, hoping to find someone as soon as possible.  Apparently, the only legal way to sublease the apartment was to remain in the contract and add the new renter as a roommate.  l felt safe since I knew that the apartments always do a background check before accepting someone.  Several people asked about the apartment, but the one that finally accepted my offer was a woman named Ivy Lee Cruz. Some things on her profile were weird, but in the end, she passed the background check and things looked ok.  On July, I got a call from the apartments. They told me that Ivy had rented the apartment to two other guys and that she did not live there anymore (I visited her before and I am sure she was living there in June). She was not answering her phone and she had not paid July's rent. At that point, I tried contacting her at her job and they told me that she never worked there.  I had to pay for the rent, late fees, insurance, etc. The guys that were renting the apartment from her were asked to move out immediately and they also lost a lot of money (from rent and deposit).  The worst part is that the apartment complex is not giving me any information to help me locate her or even sue her and they won't take any action since I am paying the rent. They also say that I cannot search for another person to rent the apartment since I would need her signature! So my only option is to pay a reletting fee and the monthly rent until the apartment is rented.  Do you have any idea about how to proceed in this case? How can I get the apartments to help me? Are they partially responsible since they did the background check and approved her?  I am planning to go to small court to sue her and see how that goes. But if you have more ideas I would really appreciate them.	No
1377	The floor is quite thin. It sucks that he can hear me when I even just walk to the bathroom. Should I charge him to buy me a carpet in order to alleviate the phone dropping? Should I buy a carpet? Or is it my responsibility to avoid dropping my phone if it slips out of my hand sometimes.	No
1378	Hi Legal Advice!  We're considering options against our landlord and want some opinions before we speak with a lawyer.  We first reported bedbugs and mold on 5/15. Maintenance declined to treat the mold until the bedbug issue had been resolved.  Our landlord first sent pest control to our unit on 6/2. We received a note from the pest control company stated that the unit had been sprayed.   On 6/9, our landlord sent us a note threatening to evict us because we had not been properly prepared and the pest control company could not spray the until. We immediately reached out to corporate, informing them of the note we received from pest control. We did not receive a reply.  We then reach last week, when we are informed that the pest control company did not find any bedbugs the first three times they came out to treat the unit, however, they did find bedbugs on the fourth visit (so clearly we had bedbugs the entire time).  This is primarily relevant because they still have yet to treat the mold and Ohio code states that landlords are required to address maintenance emails in a reasonable time frame, at most 30 days. We were okay waiting for the mold to be treated if the maintenance men were trying to avoid the bedbugs, but if the landlord claimed that there were no bedbugs, the mold should have been treated immediately.  We are moving in a week, so typical solutions (escrow, etc.) are not available to us. We are very seriously considering suing our landlord, and know that we have a strong argument concerning the mold. However, we are unsure about a few things:  * Is this even something we can pursue? Legally, they've violated Ohio code, but as we can't go through the typical process, I'm not sure if that's something we're allowed to do.  * How likely would we be to able to argue that waiting two weeks before treating bedbugs falls outside of acceptable treatment? * Also, would we be able to claim negligence (or something similar) because we repeatedly told them that we still had bedbugs as the pest control company was telling them that we didn't? Do they have a responsibility to insure that the pest control company is doing a thorough job?  I'm trying to stick to the highlights, so hopefully this makes sense. I'm cutting out a lot of the communication between us, our landlord, and the pest control company.   Any guidance would be appreciated.  Thanks!	No
1379	New York STATE. So I purchased a vehicle on may 2, the temporary tags expired on the 31st. I called the dealer and notified him that the temp registration had expired and he said that he would extend the date in his computer, I spoke with him last week about not recieving any registration from the dmv still and he said that he would extend it again until we know whats going on. Well today I got pulled over and given a ticket for expired registration that expired on the original date of may 31st. I called the dealer and he said to email him the ticket and that he would get it taken care of. Not sure what I am supposed to do in this situation, is this something the dealer can take care of or am I going to be forced to go to court for this?	No
1380	"I recently purchased a home with my fiancee, and we moved out of the apartment we were living in after about a year give or take a month.     This past Friday(7/28/17), we received a collection notice in the mail for damages to the apartment. It stated we had 30 days to respond with a written request from the posted date(7/21/17) or the charges would be considered accepted. The charges are as follows:  * Cleaning Fees - 275 * Removed Stickers from walls - 60 * Repair Walls in living room and dining room - 390 * Repair walls upstairs - 350 * Carpet Cleaning	- 160 * Repair walls in bedroom - 150 * Repair walls in entry &amp; leading upstairs - 110      Total Damages:					1385.00      Credit for Security Deposit:	-250      Total Paid by Debtor:			0.00      Total Amount Due:				1135.00  Now, this came as quite a shock to us. We didn't expect much back on the deposit, there was an area where the cat tore up part of the door frame and we expected a fee for leaving the decorative stickers on the walls(we moved all of our stuff out an realized we couldn't reach the top ones). We, however, were not expecting this kind of bill.  The only ""damage"" left in the walls were holes from screws were we hung up picture frames. They told us when we moved in that this would be considered ""normal wear and tear"", or however they phrased it, and it would not be counted against us when we move out. Hell, there were still screws in the walls from the last family that lived there.  What I'm worried about here is that they are trying to overcharge us. They did several shady things while we lived there. Like charging us $7 for a missing 9-volt battery, that wasn't missing, they replaced during an inspection, that they did not do. They did not inform us of this charge, then gave us a bill for the 9-volt, and a late fee for not paying them.  Basically, are we in the wrong here? We're not sure how to respond to this notice since we don't have the funds to just ship out to these people that we feel are trying to rob us."	No

1382	"Hello  I am a college student, and this is my first ticket.  I hit somebody's back corner and then I fell into a ditch, totaling my vehicle.  The other driver only had corner damage on his car.  Nobody was injured.  I received a traffic ticket for failing to stop for assured distance.  I had the cops come to the scene to simply prove that the other driver was not at fault.  I was surprised that I received a ticket.  Later, I learned that calling the cops is not necessary, as long as information is exchanged.  The other driver was not jumping to call the police right away.  I regret involving the police.  I feel that I screwed myself over, beyond what was necessary.  I feel that totaling my car and denting the other guy's car does not call for a citation, especially considering the other guy did not offer to call the police.  I have a pre-trial soon.  I have to talk to a prosecutor and make a deal.  I would ideally like to drop the whole case, as my father's insurance is taking care of vehicle damage.  I am educating myself about courts.  I learned that the prosecutors want to spend more time prosecuting midemeanors/felonies and other serious issues.  They just want to get petty tickets out of the way.  Would it benefit me to ask for my case to be dismissed, and if he doesn't budge, say ""I want to learn more about the court process, so I am going to have trials regarding my ticket, so I can explore all of my options.  I have time because I am out of school for the summer.""  Would this make the prosecutor want to back off and not want to deal with me, especially because I am young.  I have had my liscense for about a year.  I know it costs a lot of money to run the courts.  I recognize that it's assumed that people who hit cars from behind are at fault, but the reality is, traffic court is designed to suck money from people.  The other driver wasn't upset when I talked to him.  I just want the insurance to fix the other guy's car, and move on with my life."	No
1383	"Hi all!!!  Just got back from a family camping trip, gone from Friday, until Monday. I parked the rented rented camper in my mother in laws parking lot so she could clean it out.   She called her landlord to ask if it was okay to park it there overnight, so she could clean in the morning, landlord said ""no problem, but just to let you know I had to enter your unit as I knew you were away for the weekend, and during my daily walk around, I had noticed water dripping from you second story balcony""  My MIL enquirers as to what time this was at, and the LL responded "" about 11 am, I just wanted to make sure the toilet wasn't over filling, or the fridge crapped out""   So at the time, no problem. I explained to my MIL the landlord is allowed access during an emergency situation.    Here is our problems.   We left the apartment at 10:30am, and the last thing my MIL did was water her plants on the patio, and refill those ""as-seen-on-tv"" self watering glass bulbs.   When she got back into her apartment, it was very apparent that the refrigerator/freezer, hall closets, and bedroom wardrobe had been rifled through, and the patio door was left unlocked.   I had said that this was not part of a normal entry, as well that there is a six inch curb between the patio and the floor of the living space. So if the toilet overflowed, or fridge crapped out, it would have to crest the six inch curb prior to leaking out onto the balcony, and that there would be a deluge of water pouring out from under the front door before it would even be noticed.    My MIL has a medicinal marijuana license, and keeps her smokables, and edibles in the freezer, and they were tampered with. So now, the LL is knowledgeable about my MIL not so proud of secret, and where they are  Nothing seemed to be missing, though the computer was powered on.   My concerns are that this has happened in the past, though my MIL has never noticed, chalked it up to forgetfulness,as well as no one notified her as to the fact they were going in, or her emergency contacts (her best friend lives in an adjacent building), or attempted to contact before, during, or, after until 3 days later.   I've told her to purchase a door alarm with a passcode that won't shut off until disabled, destroyed, or out of batteries. And to change her lock and to give a false key to the LL  and to wait for a call saying the key doesn't work.      What are our options?    BC Canada.    Thank you friends."	No
1384	TL;DR: Is the landlord responsible for a high water bill if the bill is due to broken lawn sprinklers on common property in an apartment building?  I live in a multi-unit property and due the sprinklers being broken we have an excessive water bill. All units are being charged almost 500% of our typical water bill (the bill is usually divided equally among the tenants of the building).  The lease explicitly describes that in the event a high water bill is issued, we must pay in the same timely manner we normally would. But, it describes examples such as leaky faucets within a tenant's property. The sprinklers are are apart of the common exterior property and there are no references in the lease that we have a responsibility to maintain that property (just not actively damage it).  I'm hoping to find a statute in Colorado or something that makes explicit that, since it is not written in the lease, an excessive utility bill due to something occurring in common spaces of the building is the responsibility of the landlord. Any help is appreciated!	No
1385	I have had to do some travelling in Texas for business and I had went through some tolls this year and last. I received some letters stating I needed to pay my tolls and meant to do it but unfortunately got busy and forgot. I recently got a letter saying that the toll bill went to a law firm for collections and if I didn't pay they would send it to court. Some of these tolls are for like .50 cents but they tacked on $35 dollar fees.  I wanted to try and call the law firm but every time I call any of their numbers I'm on hold for half an hour and then it goes to a full voicemail box. I feel like this is part of their strategy to get you to pay to full bill.  What are my options? I'm willing to pay the bill and be more responsible with my toll bills in the future but that would really suck in the short term. Ideally I'd like to at least pay on it and work out terms with them. I mean I can't even get a hold of anyone to verify that my account will be cleared. Has anyone else dealt with something similar?	No

1387	**Basic premise:** My husband and I are talking about co-owning a house with his parents(my in-laws). I'm concerned about how to ensure my financial security if something happens to my husband/MIL, ect. We have 4 kids.   **Pertinent info:**  - This is in California. - The house belonged to my husbands grandmother who recently passed away. It was willed to my MIL and her 3 siblings equally. Everyone *says* they would like to see us living there because we have a large family and it's a large house.  - We will be buying out 2 parts of the house while my MIL will own her part and buy out the 4th.  - MIL says that her half of the house will be willed to us when she dies.  - MIL is married, but insists that all decisions are hers to make regarding the house since she was the one that inherited it. Is this true? I thought when you were married there was automatically co-ownership of assets.  - I am a SAHM and will stay that way unless there is an unforseen need to go back to work. (Please don't start up about how SAHM's don't work, can't work, are selfish, ect. I'm not even going to defend what I do all day.)  - My husband and I would take full responsibility for the house and all that happens there, but MIL's name would be on the title.  - We have a good relationship with MIL. No reason to think she is lying about what she is planning to do, or think that she has anything other than good intentions. I just don't quite trust FIL to have the same values, or for MIL to care the same way if something were to happen to my husband, her son and I were to remarry.   **The concern:**  What happens if MIL dies and FIL decides that he would like the money for the house? Obviously we could just say that we'll give him the fair amount for it, but is there a way to ensure that it will be willed instead of having to be bought (since that is the promise now).  What happens if my husband dies, and I remarry? Is there a way that I can ensure that we get to continue to live in the house and can eventually will it to my own children? I have concerns that despite MIL saying that we don't have anything to worry about, if something DOES happen, I may be left high and dry. I don't care so much about any future hypothetical husband getting anything, but I don't want to basically be kicked out of the house that we mean to raise our kids in.   Are there other things I should be aware of?   I'm afraid I am coming across as super entitled, but while I am very grateful for the opportunity to live in a much larger house than we can afford, I really just want to make sure my future is as secure as it can be. If I'm opening myself up to being screwed in the future because of co-owning, I'd much rather invest in something smaller that we can afford on our own.	No
1388	To give a little additional background, my roommates and I moved out of a house we were renting in TN on June 30th.  We attempted to contact them regarding the deposit on July 18th but received no reply.  We followed up with them two days ago, and last night we received a word document laying out approximately 20 different damages and associated costs.  My understanding is that it has been more than 30 days since the end of our lease, and our landlord failed to notify us of an inspection, or provide advance notice of their intent to withhold the deposit.  Additionally, the list of damages and associated costs that was offered is fairly ridiculous ($10 for changing a light bulb, $250 to unclog a drain, etc.)  At this stage, I basically responded saying that they failed to meet their obligations to return the deposit or report damages in that 30 day window.  They have thus far failed to respond, but I was hoping for some additional insight into where I stand.  Any advice would be much appreciated!	No

1391	I wanted to get some quick advice on an issue I have regarding my landlord and property company. I signed a lease in Feb 2015 for a year and went month to month. I signed with a property management company but the landlord's name is still on the lease. Fast forward to last month during move out. I paid the full months rent but moved out June 16. I relinquished keys to the owner but still kept a key since I was still responsible for the property up until June 30. The property management company conducted the walk through and the owner was there also. I cleaned the house very thoroughly but there were still some wear and tear (nothing major) that needed to be handled. I asked the owner that since 1. I found her a renter, 2. I cleaned the house extremely well and 3. I paid the full months rent, if she would cut me a break on the deposit or at least pay me back the half month rent I would be out. She said she would get back to me but never did. I followed up a few days before June 30 and she responded with a laundry list of items that were previously discussed (carpet cleaning etc.) that she just went ahead and completed and would charge my deposit. Since my contract with the property management company was not due until June 30, I called them and they said since I relinquished the keys to the owner, they could not help me. I am still in contract with the property management company so everything she completed up until June 30 should go under my contract, correct? Since I believed I was getting screwed, I asked for another inspection but they denied it. I wanted to show them all the issues that were fixed. Since I was responsible for any damages up until June 30, why am I not responsible for any touch ups and improvements? Just received a check in the mail for $50 for my deposit fee ($1,150). I do not believe this to be fair since I paid a full months rent. If I relinquished control to the owner on June 16 then she would owe me 1/2 month rent that I paid, correct? If not, then those improvements that she conducted were still under my contract and I should get the entirety of my deposit back.  Long story short, I want to know if I have a case here regarding my deposit or 1/2 month rent. Both landlord and property management company have become extremely hostile towards me regarding this and I wanted to reach out and see if there is anything I can do to move forward with a legal case/small claims court (possibly). I am not sure. As previously stated, this in Las Vegas, Nevada.	No
1392	I am currently staying in an apartment complex which operates strangely as it is on a college campus. Each of 3 rooms is rented to a tenant, with a shared common space. Roommates can be selected, but mine was randomly assigned (1 room vacant.) I have no agreement with my roommate, we each pay rent to the landlord and neither of us is liable for the other not paying rent.    I am changing rooms and starting a new lease. I was given a 48 hour window to move all my belongings from my old unit to my new unit. 30 minutes before I could go pick up my new keys the front desk called me and informed me that I would have to vacate the room for 5+ hours because my nasty roommate had fleas and the orkin man was here. I was given no prior notice.    I live in the state of idaho and checked the laws  page 11 differs right of entry to the lease agreement from what I understand: http://www.ag.idaho.gov/publications/consumer/LandlordTenant.pdf    Here's what the lease agreement says on the matter:   Resident hereby agrees that Landlord, subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, can enter the Premises (a) by passkey or otherwise at all **reasonable and necessary** times for inspection, maintenance, housekeeping, property management, or for any other purpose reasonably connected with Landlord's interest in the Premises and to perform any work or other act necessary in such connection;  My question becomes is it reasonable for them to enter and deny my ability to enter for 5+ hours during my 48 hour moving period. There is also a question of necessity as the orkin man was here 2 weeks ago for the same reason and my roommate confirmed with the orkin man/front desk that the problem was already taken care of.	No
1393	My friend is in the process of getting a divorce. My friend moved back home in the mean time.   Her ex lives in Florida. She lives in NYC. He has been opening credit cards in her name and so far has spent more than $25,000 under her name. The ex has stopped all communication with her.   What are the next steps.   Thank you.	No
1394	"So pretty much I've been soliciting spells and rituals on apps like whisper. I have them pay me over paypal, and send them instructions for the ritual. I never promise health benefits or weight loss. I've sold two so far. A love spell and ""spiritual cleansing"". Both at 20 a spell. Can I be sued for selling a phony spell?  Is there anything I can add like a disclaimer or something to prevent someone from trying to sue me?"	No
1395	This happened several years ago, when I was about 13 years old.   I verbally threatened to kill a classmate. I was just a dumb 13 year old, and no reasonable person should have taken me seriously.  My school principal told me that I would get an 80 day suspension, but yet she never contacted my parents. And I never told my parents because I didnt want them to know.  Then, for the next 2 weeks, monday to Friday I was instructed to sit in an uncomfortable wooden chair and do nothing at all for the whole day every day. This is 9 am to 3 pm, sitting in a chair doing nothing but staring at a wall for 10 days. (2 weeks). Nobody to talk to and nothing to do but look at the wall.  This is 60 hours of isolation. I felt like a prisoner in those isolation things.   Then abruptly, she told me that my punishment is done. I never received any paperwork or documentation of anything at all. I found her reaction incredibly harsh.  Was I morally abused?  Is there any legal action that should have been taken at the time? Is there any legal action that can be taken now, year later?	No
1396	"So my lease clearly states that management is responsible for any pest control and extermination services. They fired their exterminator of 10+ years recently, and still owe him $600 He gave me his contact card when I moved in and they were using him, so I spoke with him about the situation.   Apparently they have their handyman (who's part of management but isn't a true ""handyman""), who is going around spraying apartments for their pest control. The old exterminator explained to me that 1. This is illegal since he doesn't have the proper credentials to qualify as an exterminator (thus breaching the lease contract), and 2. He doesn't have access to anything beyond what I do and have been using.   I'm only here for another month and I know this is grounds to immediately break the lease, but I'd rather not right now since I'm nearing the end of my summer semester in grad school (working 45 hrs + thesis work + school is too much with moving).  But guys... the roaches are SO BAD RIGHT NOW. Literally dozens were coming out if the outlets, cabinets, and walls... my boyfriend and I were up until 4 AM cleaning and trying to kill all of them. They're all over our food and in our fridge and freezer. Half the time they end up getting frozen inside of our ice cubes 😷 My bf who was raised in South Florida said he's NEVER EVER seen an infestation so bad....   Sorry for all of the text, but I guess I'm just at a loss of what to do... They aren't fulfilling their end of the lease contract and they already have this and next month's rent since I had to pay last month's rent when I moved in (so I can't withhold any future payments). Anyone have any experience with this? What do I dooo?? Haaaalp meeee.  P.S. I do the dishes 2-4 times a day and am impeccably clean, so cleanliness clearly isn't the cause of this."	No
1397	Here are the questions I have so far:  1. I am in a field that has mandatory overtime i.e. if someone does not show up for a shift, the previous shift has to work the next shift and possibly the one after that in emergency situations. How would that work if the strike started during or at the end of my shift?  I could not get a straight answer on this from Googling, and I believe it's illegal for me to not stay if the next person does not show up.  2. I understand that the union may fine me for working during a strike. Would that apply if it was due to mandatory overtime?  3. Is there anything else I should know about strikes in healthcare or in general?	No
1398	New York's Penal Law 265.05 state that  It shall be unlawful for any person under the age of sixteen to possess any air-gun, spring-gun or other instrument or weapon in which the propelling force is a spring or air, or any gun or any instrument or weapon in or upon which any loaded or blank cartridges may be used, or any loaded or blank cartridges or ammunition therefor, or any dangerous knife;  provided that the possession of rifle or shotgun or ammunition therefor by the holder of a hunting license or permit issued pursuant to article eleven of the environmental conservation law and used in accordance with said law shall not be governed by this section.  A person who violates the provisions of this section shall be adjudged a juvenile delinquent.  I need someone to help me find a loophole so I can be allowed to use air soft guns to play air soft	No
1399	"About a month ago, my brother was arrested for stalking and peeping.  Today, he received a letter notifying him that the police department has a warrant for his arrest for ""entering without permission"", and he must contact the court to see what he needs to do.  The letter explicitly states that this is separate from the charges from a month ago.  Isn't it a bit odd that this was not included in the arrest from a month ago?"	No
1400	The other night I was pulled over by a state trooper in Wisconsin and clocked doing 26mph over.  I did some reading and saw that Wisconsin was one of the few states that did not agree to the DLC and thus is not required to share information of driving records with other states.    I'm wondering if this is likely to appear on my Indiana records and increase insurace premiums/add points to my Indiana license.  If the points don't transfer I'll probably just pay the fine and be done with it, however if the points will likely transfer, I might pursue a safe driving course or other options for getting the ticket reduced/dismissed.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
1401	Hi Everyone,  I'm looking for some advice because I am a first time home buyer and don't fully understand if I have any chance getting some help from the seller. We purchased a home six months ago and have made many repairs and upgrades based on the feedback from the home inspection. However, the home inspection did not uncover a few major issues.   Pool- large in ground pool in the back yard. We were unable to get the pool inspected before closing because it was covered for winter. We found out that the pool was not properly winterized when we attempted to open it and had to pay about $1500 for a new motor and pump. We were able to use the pool for a month before we started leaking water. Cost of new liner and new inground stairs lowest quote we received was $6250.   Roof- leaking from around a sewer gas outlet pipe caused wood rot in a section of the roof. From the inside of the attic we can see shingles in the area. This wasn't caught on the home inspection because the damage was behind a plastic sheet vent stapled to the inside of the roof. The skylight is also leaking due to flashing issues. Quoted estimate for repair $2600.   As I mentioned, these were not caught during the home inspection and the seller did not mention them on the seller disclosure. The seller had not been living in the house for the past 8 years; rented it to a family member.   Is there any possibility that we can work with the seller to help with these repairs or are we on our own? I was thinking about sending them an email explaining this but I am hesitant that I could say something that could ruin our chances in court (if that's even an option).  Thank you in advance!	No
1402	Location: GA, Cobb County  I have been living in the same unit for two years, and I renewed for a third year. Previously when I renewed for my unit they allowed me to stay in since I had renewed for the same unit. However I signed the renewal and now they're saying I have to move out and move into a different unit despite signing for the same apartment. This is a student housing situation privately managed, not owned by the university. I'm unsure as to what to do, and they said I could stay in the same unit I'm currently in, I'm going down to talk to the leasing office.  Before hand, when I signed the renewal they said it was the exact same lease and nothing had changed besides a slight rent increase. I took them for their word after reading over the lease, nothing had changed and it was the same. They told me nothing had changed, and I being on friendly terms with the rental office agreed to such terms. I'm just confused and will get back to you guys later when I broach the issue tomorrow.	No
1403	This is a very very long story over the course of 5 years, but to begin with I'll just start with the most basic info to see if I have any chance of recourse. I live in a approximately 40 unit apartment building in Southern California.   Live in manager #1 was fired for sexually harassing tenants including my fiance Live in building manager #2 was fired refused to leave the building, defaced the building and his apartment and generally terrorized everyone living here.  Live in building managers (a couple) #3 were fired almost immediately, refused to leave, had to be evicted, severed all the internet cables, vandalized washing machines, vandalized their apartment and stole.  Since managers #3 left there haven't been any changes made. The locks weren't changed, the security cameras don't actually work, and zero effort was made to protect tenants from the extremely hostile managers #3.  I awoke this morning to someone trying to come through my window using a ladder managers #3 left in the alley. I am extremely distraught and don't feel remotely safe in my own apartment. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the basics.   The big kicker is that it's a rent controlled apartment and the landlord would be more than happy for anyone in the building to leave since rents have gone up substantially in the area. Especially those of us who have been here a while.	No
1404	So I bought my house around 5 years ago and when I bought it, it came with a water softener.  Unknown to me, the softener was a rental.  Fast forward 5 years, the previous owner of the house has now passed away and the estate has noticed that she had been paying for the rental for the last 5 years, which came to around $1500.  My real estate agent contacted me and told me that the estate would probably be contacting me, which they did through a letter.  In the letter they didn't ask for the $1500 but they did ask me to contact the rental company to assume the rental.   I contacted the rental company and they wanted me to assume control of the contact, which I have never seen. I obviously would rather not since after talking to them, paying for this rental is $25/month and the agreement goes on for another 10 years or so.  I'll end up paying $3000 myself on top of the $1500 that the estate already paid for a water softener that's worth $2000.  Buying it out is going to cost me $800 and it's already a 7 year old unit.    I found a contract from the same company that that has this verbiage about transferring the agreement, although I have no idea if it is the same as the contract that was actually signed by the previous owner. &gt; Transferring This Agreement: If you are the Owner and you sell or otherwise transfer the Premises, you are required to inform the transferee, at or before the effective date of the sale or transfer, of the existence of this Agreement and the rental Equipment installed in the Premises. We will permit the purchaser to assume your rights and obligations under this Agreement, effective from the date of sale, or other transfer, provided that (i) you or your representative notify the transferee in the sale or transfer agreement that the Equipment is rented and is subject to this Agreement, (ii) you or your representative advise us in advance of the transferee’s name and the intended date of sale or other transfer, (iii) you or your representative advise us in advance of the address and telephone number where you can be contacted after the date of sale or transfer, (iv) the transferee agrees to assume your obligations, and (v) you have paid us all amounts owing under this Agreement. Unless and until these conditions are satisfied, or unless we otherwise waive any or all of these conditions, which we are under no obligation to do, you will remain responsible (individually or jointly and severally with the Lessee, as applicable) for the Equipment rental and your obligations under this Agreement, including making all rental payments. You hereby authorize us to respond to information requests relating to your account made by or on behalf of the transferee. We may (but are not required to) accept performance of your obligations (including payment obligations) from other parties (such as tenants).  My houses purchase agreement states that I would assume control of any rentals but neither real estate agent or lawyer seemed to have followed up on this or made the transfer.  My real estate agent is pretty adamant that this is a rent-to-own and not a rental and not explicitly stated in the purchase agreement.     So, I'm not too sure what to do.  Try to push this back on the estate and tell them they didn't follow through with the agreement?  Bite the bullet and assume the rental until I can get out of it?  Some other option?  If anybody has any thoughts, I'd greatly appreciate it.	No
1405	(Texas) We are looking into buying 10 acres in Texas. Access to this land is via a dirt road off the county road. There are several other properties that can only access county road via this dirt road. Our potential property right now as an agriculture exemption (not sure if that matters). The other properties have both ag and homestead exemption as they have homes on them. We plan on building a home on this property in the future. There are some deed restrictions but the road isn’t mentioned in them.  These properties and deeds were created in the mid-80s and most of them have only had one owner. The plots were all subdivided from a large 300 property. The original owner owns the dirt road and the land on either side of the road up to the fence line of the lots.  My concern is there is no defined easement or access to dirt-road (and subsequent access to highway/county road) defined in the deed restrictions. Seller claims this hasn’t been a problem for them or any of the neighbors (who also depend on the dirt road) to access county road.  I have a couple of questions: 1. Is an easement defined in deed restrictions required in order for us to maintain access to county road in perpetuity? 2. Is there something like implied access to dirt road based on prior history of usage? 3. Should I be worried about the owner of the dirt-road for some reason denying us access to our potential property?   Not sure if it matters but there is no other access to any of the other properties save for this dirt road. All access, including emergency services need to drive on dirt road to access the other (landlocked) properties.  Thanks!	No
1406	Hello. Our Landlord is attempting to give us 60 days notice to vacate when we are only 2 months into a 12 month lease. We know that by law they cannot do this. The landlord seems to have figured this out as well because they have sent us a series of emails where they go back and forth between saying they are applying to the Board to have us evicted to then begging us to leave so they can move back. Should we file a T2 against her for interfering with Tenant Rights?  Is there any order we can get from the Police that can tell them to stop harassing us and contacting us or showing up for reasons other than necessary as a Landlord/Property owner? Or are we screwed because they are the owner? Thanks!	No
1407	Over the weekend I was having a discussion with friends and they turned me on to the California Overtime Exemption laws. I work in the IT field, and according to [one site I found](http://ckslaw.com/it-and-computer-technology-workers/) it appears I'm paid significantly below the Overtime Exemption threshold, but am salaried and not provided overtime pay.  The main hangup I have is that if I check the [actual wage order](http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/WageOrders2006/iwcarticle4.html), it breaks down the salary cutoff as 2 times the state minimum wage, so I'm not sure where that number in the first site comes from.  I've never had any experience with legal matters like this and am not really sure what to do with this information. Any advice is greatly appreciated!	No
1408	I had a monthly parking service with Impark and I no longer needed to use their parking lot after April. I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.   I didn't deal with it right away because I had to go on vacation 1.5 months. Now that I'm back, I see that they have added on even more additional charges. On top of the $93.25, they also added on $50 (rejected payment charge) + $30 (late admin fee)+ $1.5 (tax) for the months of June and July. Now they say that I owe them $174.75 or my debt will be collected by a collection agency and will affect my credit.    I find it absurd that I have to pay $174.75 when I haven't parked in their parking lot since I cancelled at the end of April. Is there any way I can dispute this or will I have to pay them the money?	No
1409	I was arrested for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, but I was caught with both plant matter and concentrate (dismeanor amounts), along with 3 pieces of paraphernalia (3 packs of rolling papers). As a result, I had multiple charges for these different items. Is it likely that the judge will drop the redundant charges or will I face harsher consequences for these different illegal items?	No
1410	So I was extremely stupid and sped in Virginia on I-95 on my way home from North Carolina. I had my cruise control set for 78MPH and didn't realize that the speed limit changed to 55MPH so I messed up big time. Luckily, the officer wrote the ticket as a general speeding ticket rather than wreckless driving, which he said it technically was. I don't know if I should attempt to go to court for it to reduce the speed or not bother because the cop already did me a favor. I am fine with paying the fine as this is a totally legitimate ticket, but I just want to know my best plan of action. This is my first ever ticket	No
1411	Aside from our bills being higher, ive woken up to an attempted break in, and what i thought was a break in but turned out to be roommates who had forgotten their key. Essentially, none of the windows in the house lock, so they dont seal correctly either. This raises our bills as heating/cooling costs are affected, but I also feel uneasy knowing someone can just slide in through any window on our first floor and rob us or worse.   Are we out of luck or is this something they should take care of? Alternatively, if anyone has any non legal advice for securing windows (i dont mean illegal suggestions, i mean ways of securing windows. Please dont provide any illegal suggestions) or product suggestions to help, please let me know.	No
1412	Long story but this is the short version. My miniture dachshund bit a neighbour. At first they gave us a 14 day eviction. I protested that 14 days was not enough time so they extended it to a month. Now my property manager is saying that we can stay until the end of our lease (which ends November 31). This is now not an eviction but a request. I have never been late with my rent. What would happen if I just keep on paying my rent and dont move?  Eapecially if my dog hasn't bitten anyone during the next 4 months. Would they have grounds to evict still? I live in Alberta Canada.	No
1413	"Hi legaladvice. So, I have recently (2 days ago) moved into a place that seems more and more illegal every time I talk to the guy who I'm renting from. I'll briefly explain the situation. I received notice from my previous landlord that they no longer wanted cats in the house. Because we were unwilling to get rid of the cats, we were forced to find a new place. I looked at a few places but found a guy with a good-sized basement he was willing to rent out for $700/month. I asked about cats and he said they were fine to have and would be free to roam the house. The next time we talked, he said he talked to the landlady and she didn't want cats at all, but would allow them in the garage. He showed me the garage, assuming that was the only space I would have and did not make that clear to me. The next time we talked about a week later, he told me we were only going to get the garage, but now it's ""good news"" and we have a room to stay in because one of the other roommates was moving out. I thought okay, whatever. as long we we have a room to stay in besides the garage. We got to the place 2 days ago to find out that 1) the room is not vacated and we will be forced to stay in the den adjacent to the now occupied basement and the garage we were promised that is now full of other peoples's stuff. In addition to this, there is no hot water or internet at the house, which was not disclosed beforehand. I also asked the man I'm renting from for a key to the house. He told me ""oh we lost it lol been too lazy to get a new one"". Am I about to squat in a house for a month? What should I do? Do I have any legal recourse whatsoever? Thank you.  Tl;dr guy promises basement with free range cats, then steps down to cats in garage and basement, then tells us no basement only garage, then we are promised a room, then we arrive and the room is unavailable and while all of our stuff has been unpacked, come to find out that there is no hot water or internet at the place and they ""lost the key""."	No
1414	Sorry if doesn't make sense. I'm 16 and my dad is quite old, past 70. He is leaving everything to me in his will, but I don't get it until age 25 which is fine. His brother (my uncle) is my trustee and he recently told my dad he is investing the money until I'm 25. My dad said no, it's my kid's (me) money, they get to decide. My uncle says it's not until I'm 25 and that he can invest the money if he wants and that it's too late to make changes to the will now. This was all in an email I wasn't supposed to be reading but I am just wondering is investing the money a good idea or is this bad... again sorry if this is confusing, I don't know much about this stuff, and would just like to know if my dad and I should talk about it?	No
1415	Hello community. I live in NY, Queens. The woman I rent from is so cheap that she and her son are trying to evict me for 9 months now, so that they can take advantage of the crazy rising prices in my neighborhood. They gave me a rent stabilized lease and now they claim that the building is not rent stabilized, while they forced me into month-to-month tenancy by refusing to renew my lease twice (that is, they asked for a raise twice already). First they tried to scare me for months (cutting my internet cable outside my window at 2 am, while the son is the only person who has this access, cursing by the mother, turning off my heat in December), so I took them to court first for harassment. They tried to do it the legal way after this, so I closed the harassment case to focus my resources on the eviction case after they served me with a 30-days notice back in December. My lawyer managed to get the case dismissed twice already because they can't even hire and pay a proper lawyer, this meaning that he always messed up with the correct paperwork and documentation. Now they are trying for a third time and I'm determined to report them to IRS because they are declaring 4 units while they receive income from 8. They never gave me a receipt, but I pay with check every single time, so I have proof of payment. I don't want to damage them but obviously they want to cause me damage, so I'm seriously thinking of doing this. My question is, can they be in Housing Court trying to evict me if and while the IRS investigates them?  Thank you for reading this, I'd appreciate any insight and information you have to share!	No
1416	I am with T-mobile. I live in Texas.  I signed up with a promo with them in Feb. that I would get 2 lines plus a free line for $110/mo flat. This saved me a lot of money from my original plan, so I thought I would add my roommate (also with t-mobile) to our plan to share the savings. They told me that the free line was usually for new lines, but made an exception for us. (Otherwise, we would have to pay $20/mo additional for line forwarding).  It is now July and since they have been charging me $180/mo for services. I have been double charged in here as well. I have gotten this refunded twice from them. Today I called to get my third refund and was told that I never qualified (because roommate's previous line was with them) and that they would not honor it (by a second-tier manager).  I cannot afford other service providers, so switching is out. I really feel like this is terrible business practice and that T-mobile lied to me about my prices. If I didn't qualify I should have been told that before they switched my lines over. I don't think there is anything I can do legally(?), but any advice on how to get them to honor my original pricing?	No
1417	Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	No
1418	I am starting a business with my friend who currently is renting a place. He already mentioned to the owner that he will start-up a business at the place and the owner was hesitant at first but then agreed after.  Now they have a contract of lease.  Here comes my problem. I am the one who will be managing the business and It'll be registered to my name as the sole proprietor. I need a contract of lease to get my necessary permit. I did some research and I found out that I could be a sublet or sublessee.  However in the Article 17 of the contract states:  17. ASSIGNMENT OF LEASE: The LESSEE will not use or occupy the Leased Premises for any other purpose that are herein provided for and will not assign or transfer this lease or sublet any part of the premises to any other person, firm or corporation without the prior written notice of the LESSOR.  As stated we need to have a written notice of the lessor so I could be a sublet. Now it's kinda hard to talk to the lessor and he seems a bit lazy on creating such documents so he might not agree. So what I'll do is I will create the written notice for him allowing me to be a sublet so that it will not create hassle on him since he will just sign.  Btw the business I am starting is an Internet Cafe if that's relevant.  Thank you!!	No
1419	My friend recently got into a little legal trouble when he was drunk. He is required to take Random Enhanced BA (breath analysis) testing. His question was if there is a difference in the substances they test for in a regular BA test, and if there is a possibility that he would be randomly tested for something else. He wants to avoid further legal trouble so if anyone has any further information on the matter, it would be greatly appreciated.	No
1420	"I live in student housing. The air conditioning hasn't been working in my apartment all summer. My roommates and I have tried multiple times to get things fixed. Sometimes maintenance comes and does nothing, other times they come and ""fix"" the issue for a couple hours and then the A/C stops working again. It is currently 84 degrees in my apartment. I'm wondering what I can do legally to attempt to get a refund on my rent for this month. Thankfully it is the last month of my lease, but I don't feel that it's fair for me to have to pay rent when it's literally hotter inside my apartment than it is outside. What should I do to try and get a refund?"	No
1421	The title pretty much sums up my situation. Around two years ago I was notified that I had failed a urinalysis for d-amphetamine (adderall) and that, after 10 years of service, I was going to be processed for an administrative discharge, essentially firing me from my job without judicial proceedings and removing all benefits that I had earned.  I was obviously in shock and, after speaking to my wife, hired a private attorney in addition to my military appointed JAG lawyer. He had an interesting proposal. He intended to have my urine specimen sent to a lab on the east coast for DNA testing. The results came back a few weeks later and the lab had successfully obtained a DNA profile which did not match mine. I was elated, and thought everything was in the past.   My command pulled all proceedings and told my attorney they were going to commence an internal investigation as to what may have happened. They fired the Marine in charge of the urinalysis collecting program.   About one year after all of this I received a call to report to my Battalion Sergeant Major. I had no idea why, and when I got to his office quickly found out that they were proceeding with the discharge anyway. They wouldn't tell me why. And now here I am, jobless and with a wife and 12 month old son, with no insurance or solid source of income.   My question is this: Obviously, I still have all documentation showing the DNA results. Is there any recourse I could take? Would it be advisable to go to the media? Should I contact congressman? I am at a loss here. I apologized for the rambling and very much appreciate anyone that had some solid advice.	No
1422	My landlord, Ben Leeds, refused my August rent check on the first because of a 'violation'. They are now demanding the check be made out as a certified check (CC or Money Order), and it must now include a $75 late fee. My first thought is 'is this legal?'  Here's the context: I have been living in an apartment complex since 9/14. Ben Leeds took ownership of the building in the spring of 2017 (March or April) and had us sign a new lease. We have documents stating that they will send us a copy. We have not yet received a copy at this time.   On 7/25 we received a notice that a vehicle parked in our space is in violation of their policy (the car was a gift to us from a friend, but we had not yet gotten the title transferred. It had been in the space since prior to Leeds taking the property). The notice stated we had 3 days to become compliant before Leeds would take action.  That evening I sent an email to our manager asking for an extension on the deadline, as I thought it would take longer than 3 days to become compliant.   5 days later, on 8/1, I received an email back saying this request was denied. They would be inspecting on 8/7 and would take necessary action if found not in compliance.   Later that same day, I saw they had returned the rent check. When asked, the manager said she was instructed not to take it. When asked why, she indicated it had something to do with the violation, and that they would be demanding the late fee once the check finally could be submitted.   The car was subsequently towed and no longer occupies the space.   I waited until today (8/8) before reaching out to the manager. I did not get word on the verdict of the inspection. She responded that she saw the car was removed and asked when I'd be submitting the rent check, to include the $75. I informed her it would have to wait until I returned from work tomorrow.   So first, can a landlord even do this? Refuse a rent check then demand a late fee? Second, if so, does the manager (or 'upper management' who apparently responsible in denying the request for an extension) have a duty to communicate their decision in a timely manner?  Third, does the fact that they have not sent us a copy of our lease make any difference here? Ultimately, do I have any recourse?	No
1423	Basically everything is covered in the title. He is at least 2-3 weeks late on rent payments (sometimes even longer), usually causing me to put his bills on my credit card and making me lose additional money to interest. Can I legally evict him or am I stuck?	No
1424	Just like it says in the title, I'm paid $27,040 salary plus a tiered commission based on my sales. My employer claims he doesnt have to pay OT and expects me to work late to meet with clients and also has me work 8 hours overtime every other week for marketing events outside of work.   Obviously its time to find a new job but my question is, is he correct? I can't find anything concrete through google.	No
1425	I recently signed a contract with Jukin Media granting them the rights to license my video to other media outlets. I was offered $200 up front for signing and 70% of all revenue made from the video.      I didn't research the company as much as I should, and now I'm wanting out. I have not filled out any personal info that would allow them to pay me, so as far as the contract states, they can't use the video. The contract said this about terminations:      &gt;T4. Termination. Licensor may seek to terminate this Agreement at any time; however, this Agreement shall only be terminable upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of which may be granted or denied in Jukin’s sole discretion. No termination shall impact any prior license of the Images by Jukin prior to termination, which shall continue in full effect under the terms of this Agreement.      Since I cannot be paid and they cannot use the video because of that, I don't see why they would want to deny the termination request, since the video would seemingly be in limbo.      But I was wanting to ask about the wording of that excerpt. Does it imply that if the contract is terminated, they will still retain rights to use the video, despite the fact that the contract associated with it was cancelled?	No
1426	My grammar is terrible so I apologize in advance.   So i just recently left my job because of many reasons. The other people there and myself have always notice that sometimes our checks have been a little off. Some times they seem short. So far it has not been more then comments and that is it.   Today i got my check and it looked weird, i looked at all the itemized info like any check, and the numbers looked off. So i went through with a calculator and when i took the gross pay-net pay, then i take that difference and subtract all of the things being taken out: taxes, etc. And there is still an amount left over.... but there is no place for it on the itemized section. I looked back on my other checks and same thing, all different amounts, anywhere  from $20- $80  I called a girl that quit right after me. She looked hers over, and the same thing. Some of hers didnt even have the itemized section of what was taken out.   Am i crazy or is this weird.	No
1427	My fiance's mother is willing to sell is her house for what she owes on it. It'd be a great opportunity to have instant equity for remodeling. We would be first time home buyers.  What is the best way to go about this? I've seen several ways online but not sure what the best way is. I've seen situations where we could buy the home for $100k but pay property taxes on the homes value (350k). The numbers are made up but kind of similar.   Any advice would be great!	No
1428	Hello r/legaladvice and the Reddit community as  whole. First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.  Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al’s devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.   Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?   What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?   Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?   Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.   If there's any questions I can ask or information you guys need please let me know and I'll ask Al. This is so early on he's still dealing with the emotional blow. Btw I did ask permission to ask for help on his behalf so long as it was anonymously.	No
1429	Just so you know I live in Texas.   This apartment complex that I rent has become the biggest mistake of my life! When we moved in a year ago we went two months in Texas heat without A/C. (I had to stay to finish one class to graduate with my music degree.) The A/C has been a huge battle. It never works great. My apartment is constantly above 80 and my electric bill for a 700,sqft apartment is over 120 a month! This poses a health risk as my asthma meds can not be stored above 77 degrees.   Now on to other things. I have lived next to drug dealers for the past several months. I have filed police reports and they have been busted yet they are still allowed to live here. They have thrown large parties which are noisy and they often have way too many people out on the balcony which is dangerous!  My neighbours are so ghetto. The leave trash bags out for days. There are roaches outside. There is spoiled and rotten. Food. In the past my dogs have eaten spoiled food, and silly strong when I took them out at night. This happened three times and has resulted in 1000 dollars in vet bills. (I have a rescue dog that was stray all it's life so she will eat tree bark if you let her)   Now my two good neighbours have recently moved out. These people keep lighting firecrackers in and around their apartment! I don't want my apartment to burn down due to their dumb ass.   In total there have been 6 police reports on this property from me alone. There are no working security lights. Now that my good neighbours are gone, these guys know it's me who complained to management about the firecrackers, drugs and partying.   I don't feel strongly about guns but living in this complex has made me feel so frightened for my wife that I keep a pistol loaded. I got a pitbull mix just for home defense.    I am so frustrated. I typed up a very detailed legal report about why I'm breaking the lease. I have many emails that I have sent, vet bills, and emails with a police officer about the drug dealers.   What do I do? This is the only place that I really feel safe posting this. I am going to protect my wife and dogs no matter the cost.   Sorry for poor wording and grammar. I spent all my energy typing up a 1100 word legal report and scanning emails and vet bills.   TL;DR: I live next to ghetto unthoughtful drug dealers and neighbours. They trash up the place and dog park. My dogs have gotten sick which cost money. Dumbasses light firecrackers in their apartment. The people most likely know that I've gone to the police about the drug and parties. I need to break this lease to keep my family safe. My A/C can't get below 80 from 12-6pm. This destroys the quality of my 450 buck asthma inhalers.	No
1430	I went to look at an apartment recently and decided I liked it. I filled out the application and paid the $45 fee, and gave them a check for the deposit, $400. They approved me and scheduled me to come in and sign the lease next week. I later decided I would rather buy a condo or townhome instead after talking to my parents and friends, and called to cancel the appointment. They told me that because I had been scheduled to sign the lease, if I didn't sign, it would be forefit.   When I get home tonight I am going to call my bank and put a hold on my check, does anyone know if this is legal or what recourse I have?	No
1431	"I'm not sure if I should list the country I'm in. I'm Canadian but live in Asia.   A couple of years ago an admin woman who handled work permit stuff for a company that employed me screwed me over and I ended up overstaying in the country by four months. My travel visa expired but my work permit was still valid which created a big gap between the two. It's a long story, but she was a shady douchebag and ended up holding my passport hostage and extorted the company to get it fixed. We couldn't call the police because if her connections ran higher than mine I could have been deported on the spot. In the time that she was doing all of this I networked my way up to the right people and took care of her (legally) once things blew over.   So at the time my options were ""find a way to fix it"" or get blacklisted from the country for five+ years. I ended up paying her off to ""fix it"" since it was my only realistic option, and I could deal with her after. What I didn't know was that the additional four month waiting period was so that immigration officials from this country could strategically sneak my passport into two other countries (Hong Kong and Macau) to get stamped (backdated) and returned, which would line the dates back up with my work permit. When it was returned to me I was told to say that I was in those countries on holiday to explain the gap.   At the time, while I was pissed off about the whole situation, I was just glad to get out of it. I haven't really thought about it since. I haven't been back to Canada or the US in 6-7 years, however a family member is getting married next year and I will have to go to that, and since I'll be on that side of the pond I'll probably have to go to the US later for work. I'm just worried that when I go through immigration I might get flagged since everything is digital now. On every trip I've made since this incident, I've had to use the finger print scanners at the airport and obviously with the stamps in question, I wasn't there, so no finger prints would show up.   So my question is, is it likely that this will be a problem going through immigration in Canada or the US? Do they track stamps and finger prints thoroughly? I considered applying for a new passport but my old one was stolen and this replacement one doesn't expire for another two years. I'm assuming I can't just stroll in and get another one?   I truly apologize if none of this makes sense. I live in an insane country. I will be speaking to a lawyer about this soon but figured it couldn't hurt to ask here in the meantime."	No
1432	"Okay, so my mom passed away in the state of Texas back in 2009. One year before the, she and her husband at the time took out a home equity line of credit. He co-signed. Then she died. There was no probated will upon her death. As I understood it, the house and property goes to her husband at the time of death. I was in the military and have NEVER had any financial or legal ties or obligation to the house. Anyway, he stopped paying on the loan last year. Back in December, the attorney representing the bank calls me and asks if I have talked to my former step-father (who co-signed on the loan). I explained that he and I haven't been on speaking terms since my mom's death due to personal reasons. Then about two weeks ago, I get written notice in the mail that they are trying to  pursue judgment against my deceased mother, her husband, and ""any heirs..."". I immediately called the attorney representing the bank (plaintiff) and left a vocie mail explaining that I have never have any financial or legal ties to that property and that I have not been able to reach my former step-father. Today, I get written notice that now I personally and being sued for the property....  Mind you, I haven't lived in the state of Texas in 14 years. I have NEVER had any ties to my mom's house. But now they are suing ME for it?!?   I'm a full time college student here in California. I have ZERO means to defend myself financially. I can't afford to hire a defense attorney. I called and left another voicemail for the prosecuting attorney explaining yet again that I have no ties to the property. I requested that they call me back ASAP to straighten this out.  I don't get why I am being sued for 35k for a property that is never and was never my responsibility."	No
1433	I live in Washington state.  About 4 years ago, the ex and I decided to replace the house on the property as it was in serious disrepair (had been a rental before we owned it and the ex refused to do work on it and I didn't know how, so it was in bad shape at this point).  I suggested we consider a manufactured home, we looked at what was for sale and bought one that the state inspector said was a nice one when he gave it the once-over for the occupancy certificate.  I bought 1800 square feet of well-insulated, well-built housing for $25K, and I believe I got a very good deal.   Two years later the marriage ended.  In trying to figure out how to refinance the mortgage (which has subsequently been paid off) I discovered reverse mortgages.  This looked like a good way to obtain the money to continue my education, pay bills, etc. after the money from the divorce ran out.  AFAIK, in WA all reverse mortgage lenders/underwriters are FHA approved, meaning they are required to follow the rules that the FHA (and by extension, its parent agency HUD) makes.  Nothing gave me any reason to believe I would be refused a reverse mortgage.    However, one of those rules (24 CFR 203.43f(d)iii) is that if, in the past, if someone ever moved their manufactured home from its first placement, no mortgage will be insured.  When I said to the lender in passing that I'd gotten a good deal on the house and moved it to my property, she said 'HUD/FHA has a rule that if you moved your house you can't get a mortgage.  Since I have prior professional experience with manufactured home movement, I know from that and research into this that the regulation has no basis in law, and in fact violates federal law in that it imposes a penalty without prior notice and is retroactive without prior authorization from Congress.    When I was refused, however, there was no contract signed as yet.  The process is that you go to the lender, find out how much you can get (theoretically), get counseled (and I've owned several pieces of real estate so a lot of this is I already know) and then go back to the lender to start the process of getting the house appraised, etc., etc.  Appraisers are required to report on whether or not a house has been moved, so the visual evidence, or an appraiser searching the tax roll, will give that fact away, so before I've 'signed anything', I've been refused a mortgage.  Note that in Yesler Terrace Community v. Cisneros, the Ninth Circuit said that the third-party implementation of HUD/FHA rules, even if it did not immediately apply to the plaintiffs, did not deny them standing.  How can I prove injury-in-fact when I haven't even got the chance to sign anything?  Would a formal letter of refusal from the lender citing the federal regulation do it?	No
1434	"My girlfriend and I just received a voicemail from our apartment complex saying that we had to take down our [CA Pride Flag](https://smile.amazon.com/California-Pride-Flag-Rainbow-Banner/dp/B002OSQEUG/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8) because it's not on a flag pole (we saw a neighbor hang their USMC flag against their porch wall vertically, so we did the same with our flag.) and that it needs to be ""displaying colors properly.""  Our lease says nothing specific about flags, but it does say, about patios and balconies, ""any item not specifically mentioned here must be approved in advance by the community manager. Any item that has not been approved in advanced will be required to be removed immediately."" We didn't get permission, we assumed because we saw the other flags we could do the same. We can fly it on a pole, but we're worried about ""displaying proper colors."" What rights do we have to fly this version of the California flag?"	No
1435	Hello sub,  My landlord is pretty good.  We have a one year lease on a house, which included a full months rent ($2000) security deposit and a yard deposit for $500.  We completed a walk through and noted many deficiencies and repairs, and have taken photos.  Our landlord was great and made notes of these issues, and have fixed some of them.  We never signed any documentation for the move-in.  My legal question is, can the landlord hold us responsible for any damages they find?    We're ideal tenants and looking after the house and yard, but I'm worried about our landlord abusing the move-out process.  Any advice would be sweet!  Thanks,	No
1436	(Throwaway for obvious reasons) I wor for a small business outside of Philly in PA, USA. My boss has an unsecured computer that both employees and customers are left alone with on a regular basis. He has never given us any instruction on what we can and cannot access on said computer. I was dicking around and I found that they keep massive caches of customer and employee information on the computer, with no password protection or anything. I found email lists with names and emails of all the customers; vet records for the dogs (it's a doggy daycare); email and phone number lists for all current and former employees, and a copy of each current employee's w-2, which list our social security numbers.   Can I pursue legal actions? And if so, what will probably happen?  They also have old texts and Facebook posts from employees screenshotted on the computer, but that seems like less of a legal issue and more of an ethical one.	No
1437	I accidentally ruined some vinyl siding and I allowed them to come look for an estimate, my lease agreement ran out a while ago and they're trying to charge me $220 for the damage.  I live in Connecticut and am looking for advice on the matter.  The contractor was let in while I was at work, and he did a crap job, not even the same color/texture.	No
1438	"I have lived at my apartment since last August, with the lease expiring at the end of July. Once they started taking renewals, maybe around November, they really pushed on the theme of not moving. They posted fliers on everyone's door saying something like ""Avoid the cost of moving. Renew today!"" showing the costs of moving trucks, security deposits, etc. added up. Also, on their website, it encourages people to renew and says sign your lease to stay in your apartment for another year. Under the impression that I could avoid moving, I renewed my lease around early June.  Fast-forward to today, I get a call from the leasing office informing me that I will be force-transferred, so that they can consolidate units and turn my apartment. Their reasoning for doing this was that I was the only person in my four bedroom apartment to renew my lease. They want to move me to a different unit within the complex. I will get two weeks to clean my current unit and move my new stuff into my new assigned unit.  In the lease, it states that the apartment reserves the right to change my unit at anytime. However, the apartment had led me to believe that I would not have to move through the fliers and language on the website that I mentioned above. Are they allowed to make me move units, in congruence with the lease, even though they did many promotions which implied renewal would guarantee retention of the unit?"	No
1439	Lease is up at the end of the month and one roommate wants to kick me and my other roommate out. Her boyfriend has been living here for a year without being on the lease AND she has a dog which on the lease is a no-no. My roommate and I have not done anything to break the lease. Landlords are very old and don't want to deal with the drama of girls who can't get along so they are no help and seem to want to take her side since she probably lied to them and manipulated the situation. We are in a real bind and we don't know what to do. I believe it isn't fair for any of us to stay. Can anyone help me with some legal advice?????? Help!	No
1440	Hello - I was wondering what would be best to do in this situation. Some guy crashes into my girlfriend's car in front of our house in the middle of the night. A neighbor ended up getting the license plate number. Girlfriend only has liability insurance and her insurance company just told her they can't/won't do anything. The person left a note but ins't answering phone calls. We have his name, phone number, place of work (hopefully), and license plate number. Should we confront him at his work? or would that hurt our case. Should we file a police report or give him more time? Thanks for the help!	No
1441	I sublet my room under the table without the consent of my apt complex. I know that's where I went wrong so let's move past that. The original lease is up now so we are all moved out. Anyways the rent of $500 was to be paid to me in cash in the first week of the month. He bailed without paying the last month and I want to know if I have any options. We have a verbal contract for this agreement month to month and since it was $500 I'm of the understanding that's a valid verbal contract.    Can I take this guy to small claims? Any help would be appreciated.	No
1442	Recently, a NY friend of mine lost his license and has to pay a huge fine due to driving without car insurance. However, during the time the DMV claims he did not have car insurance, he, in fact, did. He can't drive down to anywhere because of that, which makes it harder to take care of any of that. What should he do?	No
1443	I hope this is the right sub, if not apologies and please advice otherwise.  I just moved in to this complex on July, 14th.  As the title says, my apartment has been out of power for the entire complex, 23 floors.  It started July 20, 2017 at approximately 4:00 pm. Per management, the outage is due to a transformer exploding in the basement resulting in flooding and damage the gearbox. No details given will it will be restored and management is not easily accessible.  July 21, 2017, Outage continued.  Tenants have been told eight different times when the power would be restored, two of which have been in writing and posted throughout the complex, other times mentioned have been verbal via management. Signage posted also asks tenants to stay elsewhere.  I stayed with a friend for the night.  July 22, 2017, Outage continued.  I returned about 7:00am to the complex and the power is still off, as I'm typing this. Management is not on the property and the last update is signage noting the details of what happened and giving a time frame of restored power at 6:00pm on the 21st. The last update on their Facebook page was at 10:10pm noting the same at the signage.   Also to note, this is in the South where average temp is running 85-95 degrees.   My question, what can I do at this point, if anything? I just signed my lease on July 14th is there any circumstance where this would be grounds to terminate it and move elsewhere? I'm trying to be level headed about this but I'm going into my first year of teaching. Patience and understanding is running on fumes for me at this point.  I've documented everything and taken pictures of the signage. Is there anything else I should do?   Thank you and I appreciate the time.	No
1444	My deceased grandmother died in 2009 and she left me money in her will. My aunt is the executor of the will but won't pay it out, and I'm legally an adult now so what options do I have in claiming this? Also the will dictates that there is cash money in my name but my aunt says that the money was put into a 529 college plan for me.   What should I do?	No
1445	So my mom's boyfriend pays $200 a month to live in our home that is in my mom's name. It's been that way for over 12 years. Recently she decided it was best to break up with him. He then had a mental breakdown and won't leave her alone. We went to the court to get legal eviction papers stating that he has 30 days to be out with all of his posessions. He's a little bit scary and unstable. He tried two days ago to commit suicide in our garage and we involved the police. He lied to the police about being suicidal and they could do nothing. He's threatened to kill himself at her work place as well. Is there anything we need to know about PPOs when he's out? What happens if he refuses to leave or returns often?	No
1446	Hello,  My wife and I are looking to buy a house to use as a short term rental property in Rochester MN. Is anyone familiar with Minnesota laws as far as injury due to accidents of a guest? From what I understand this doesn't fall under homeowners insurance.  We would be advertising locally, on Airbnb, VRBO, and Homeaway. Does it make sense to start an LLC or does this change the tax status of the property? Sorry if none of this is very focused, I am trying to find a good resource to learn how to do this. If anyone on here happens to know a real estate attorney in Rochester they would recommend, we would appreciate it!   All the best	No
1447	Posting from Virginia, residing in Norfolk. I got a reckless driving ticket in Lexington/Rockbridge where I went to court and was found guilty and got my license suspended for 3 months. This was on 6/28. I went to the DMV today (7/18) in Norfolk to apply for an ID card since after my court date they took my physical ID and I needed something to show when asked for ID. I go up to the window and I'm told my license isn't suspended and that there aren't any unusual notes or anything. I ask for my point balance, and the points from the ticket were not added either. At this point, the DMV attendant asked if I still wanted an ID card or just a license replacement card since I can't have both. I went ahead and just asked for the replacement license.   My question is, is this some sort of glitch? Is it possible that the system has not updated yet? It has already been 20 days so I feel like it would have been updated by now. Also, I'm not sure if I want to report this or call the court. I don't know what the procedure is if they did in fact in error did not apply the points/suspend my license. Would they just notice the error and go ahead and apply it, or would their error go in my favor?	No
1448	Hi. I went to Miami with a girl, and had her sign an electronic contract that we were splitting all costs. Total came to $507 for the trip. This included festival tickets, rental car, gasoline, lodging, and parking fees. I paid for all pre-trip because I get good deals on things if I do. I have texts also backing up that we agreed to split them all.   She gave me $55 before we left for Miami. When we got back, she said she was moving to Tennessee (lie, found out where she works in our local mall) and would pay me gradually as she was settled. She's sent me $65 over the course of two months, and an $50 Amazon gift card.   She blocked my number and all my social media accounts, so I contacted her boyfriend. He said he would pay me back the $, but he wants to see my messages with her from Feb - July. I have all of the messages, I never deleted them. But we were actually friends and some of them are about her selling nudes online for $ and him cheating on her. I would rather do this a legal route through small claims court, but how much is it just to file a claim? How much stress is it?	No
1449	"Personally, I'm more leaning towards the mechanic (my friend) being at fault for failing to follow safety precautions.  When someone hands you a Rifle, the first thing you do is check if it is loaded, even if you literally just witnessed that person emptying the Rifle right in front of you.  In the same way I feel like a car mechanic should do the same and follow basic safety precaution, like checking if the car is indeed in park before starting.    But then, I'm not sure how stupid another human being has to be to hand someone a loaded Rifle and tell them ""Oh it's not loaded""... aka 'Let's leave my car in Drive, turn off ignition and invite a car mechanic to do repairs on your car'.  I feel like the Customer does have some liability in this case, but I'm not a lawyer.    Also, I believe it was an older car that made it possible for this stupidity to happen.  I'm not a car expert but I'm pretty sure you have to step on the brakes before ignition on modern cars?  At least that's the way I learned in Driver's Ed when I was 16.  Always step on brakes before starting.    No one got hurt, the repair amount is really small, I think about $500 bucks for minor bumper damage.    But I'm wondering ultimately who is at fault considering the possibility that someone could have actually died from this.    I should probably post this in /r/Justrolledintotheshop/ or /r/mechanics and ask them as I'm sure the mechanics on there have plenty of prior cases similar to this.  Take care out there guys, there are many idiots out there that could kill you.  Anytime, anywhere."	No
1450	Hello,  I'm curious about the legality of this. This is a company that I contract with, but am not an official employee of. Are these extensive restrictions legal?

1451	I'm applying to take intermittent FMLA to care for a family member with Parkinson's, who needs mainly to have me keep an eye on him to make sure he's eating and in case he falls and hurts himself. I requested to work from home but my employer refused and said FMLA was suitable for my needs. It's much less useful to me than WFH would be because I'll have to miss work and because, since I don't know when or if he'll need help back onto his feet or in case he hurts himself, I'll probably end up taking a few days off every week 'just in case' and play the odds.  We bid for shifts periodically based on performance, and if I miss much work I'm not going to be as able to compete for my current, desired shift. I'm worried I'll get pushed into a shift that's not what I want and that, for days I'm in the office, will actually make me even less able to care for him on those days.   Can they do that? What would be my recourse if they did?	No
1452	My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	No
1453	Hey guys, so recently my landlord told my roommate that they haven't received the last 3 months of rent even though we definitely have paid it. We even have the last two months money order stubs that have the rent number on them. They told him that they can't find any payment for us. I know it's stupid but we also haven't renewed the lease which was about 3 months ago.	No
1454	My two roommates and I signed a lease for an apartment. I am leaving due to living disagreements. The lease manager said all we have to do is sign a roommate release form. My question is, after signing a roommate release am I required to vacate immediately or do I have time to move out?  I told my roommates I want to move out August 31st but they want me to sign a roommate release now. I don't want to get kicked out before I'm ready to move into my new place. Should I wait til I have moved out to sign?	No
1455	"I have a boss that intentionally leaves me out of important meetings and assignments (he makes me do all the work, but never includes me in emails or meetings); so I dont get any recognition or limelight in the corporation. To list a few examples:  He has NEVER invited me to a meeting with the head of our dept, when my peers in other depts, all do.  My boss has also said that in order for me to get promoted, I need face time with the head of the dept.  Because he has a 20+ year relationship with this executive, he doesnt want anyone else getting the attention.    My boss has several others that work for him that manage other groups.  When we had target setting meetings with heads of each dept, I asked if I could attend and he said no one on his team would attend other than him (in other words, he would represent all of us in all meetings) - later I found out, the others did in fact attend the meetings.  Have proof of this in email.    There was a company open call for nominees to participate in a task force - my boss sent an email to his team asking if any of us were interested.  I said i was, and he later verbally told me I couldn't because I was looking to change depts.  Which makes ZERO sense, and he is just fishing for excuses.  This task force would be me in touch with major players in the organization and I feel like he doesnt want that.    He has made comments like: ""why is XYZ off today? they want to have a life outside of work?""....""we are glad XYZ left the company, b/c he always had family and kids issues and never worked late""  He has taken his (personal/home related) anger out on me...when I called him out on it, he said he wasn't aware he brought his personal life at work when it was utterly OBVIOUS.  He never agrees with my thoughts in meetings with others; uses sarcasm or interrupts me almost always, when others at the meeting agree with my opinions or thoughts.  Any advice would be highly appreciated.  This man has caused me serious stress. I have frequent heart palpitations resulting in appointments with a cardiologist.  I had huge nodules on my throat that ended up being benign, however doctor says they are caused by stress.  I experienced a bout of serious migraines which  led me to get a brain scan.  I'm at my dream job, but I cant handle this anymore.  Please help."	No
1456	Back in March 2017 I got a note on my door from the apartment complex asking that I vacate the premises no later than June 30th. I was a bit let down but this was expected as they were going from apartment to apartment renovating. I was on a month to month lease so I thought it was pretty nice they gave me about 100 days notice.     I move out of that apartment and into a new apartment on June 24th. Over the next few days I clean clean clean my old apartment. On a June 29th I have it inspected by the apartment manager who approves it and says I'm good. The next day June 30th I drop by and give them all the keys and ask about my security deposit ($300). They assure me the security deposit should arrive within 45-60 days and I should be fine.    Fast forward to yesterday (July 22) I get a letter in the mail from my old apartment, thinking this was my security deposit I eagerly open it to discover they're taking away my security deposit and say I owe the rest of rent for July because it has me being moved out on July 7th for some reason. This infuriates me so I go to the apartment and ask questions, unfortunately the 2 apartment managers are out until tomorrow (July 24).    Hopefully this was just a mistake but if I was given a note on my door by my apartment complex that I had to move by June 30th, I don't have to give a 30 day notice that I'm moving am I? I live in Kentucky.  TL;DR My old apartment told me to vacate by June 30th which I did. Now they're holding my security deposit and saying I owe them more for July rent likely because I didn't give a 30 day notice. Is this legal? I've never missed a payment and the apartment was spotless when I left it.	No
1457	Basically we all had a student flat over the year. Towards the second half of a year one of our flatmates were starting to struggle towards rent and fell behind about £600+. In response to this our landlord has taken our deposits (held with a 3rd party) until it's paid however from speaking to him over facebook, it seems clear that paying off his debt is not a priority for him and that we will most likely not be seeing our deposit money.  I was wondering if there is any grounds for a small claims court over our deposit (if we don't get our deposit back)back because of this person (our landlord has confirmed this to us) refusing to pay off his remaining debt.	No
1458	Our toilet has been not flushing, stuff floating up the pipes, bad flow since start of April when we moved in. The maintenance has been around 7 times , and last month they finally brought in a plumber to diagnose and he cleared some wax bloackage. Still wasn't working so on their 8th visit, it was replaced with a new toilet today. Is there anything we can do to claim for all the extra water used for flushing 2-4 times just to get toilet paper down, and not having a basic feature work properly? Or are we compensated with the replacement?	No
1459	Hi r/legaladvice! Apologies if there is an obvious answer for this, I couldn't seem to find anything concrete on the google. Also, I'm fully aware that I'm a dumbass for not reading the fine print when I signed my mortgage papers. Huge lesson learned, will not happen again, pls do not lecture me. Anyways....   Last year I purchased the condo I currently live in for $290k. My dad co-signed the loan and put down $30k, I put down $10k and pay the $1200 mortgage payment every month. My dad and I had a pretty nasty falling out and I don't think there will be a reconciliation. He's making empty (typical) threats about suing me for his money back and kicking me out of my home, so I'd like to remove myself from this situation.    What are my options here? If we sell the condo, am I entitled to half, or just the money I put into it? If my dad were to buy me out, would I be entitled to all of the money I put into it?	No
1460	My father has been involved in a biking accident a few months back. Luckily, he didn't sustain serious injuries, and only had (substantial) damage to his (racing) bike. The other person involved in the crash was a woman who sustained heavy injuries (fractured skull, and cannot recall the accident) and spent 2 days in the hospital. She is now holding my father accountable for the accident, and we are wondering how to respond, as we firmly believe he was not the one at fault.   He (and his friend) describe the situation as follows:  The two of them were heading home after a long tour on their racing bike, and cycling up a hill in the town center. My father is on the left, nearer to the middle of the road, and they approach the cross road where the accident happens. At the side of the road, the view is blocked by a large white van, as there are parking spaces right up to the cross road. BEFORE they reach the cross road, and can see past the van, a woman aproaches from the right, first hits my father's friend (lightly, causing him to fall) and then has a full on collission with my father, causing my father to fly headfirst over his bike, while she falls backwards. My father was protected by his helmet, which has broken in multiple places, she, sadly, has no such protection. Both of them are lying on the ground next to the van, a good distance before the cross roads, on their side of the road. The woman claims that as she was approaching from the right side of the cross roads (Dutch traffic law) she had right of way, and my father is liable. My father says they were not at the crossing yet, hadn't been able to see her because of the van and she 'cut corners', and so she is in fact at fault. Police arrived only after they had already left for the hospital, took their statements, and decided the aftermath was left for the insurance companies to decide. So there is no proper   Today, he received a formal letter, to inform him she will hold him accountable and informed her insurance of this. Now, as we are insured this doesn't really matter, not even affecting his deductible (?word?), but he does resent being blamed for something he feels he is not responsible for. Or at least, not solely, as his friend was also part of the incident. Aside from that, he also has significant damage to his biking equipment (upward of 200 euros) and though nothing compared to her ordeal, it's no small ammount.  He is planning to put this all into a proper letter in reply, and has had contact with his own insurance about what is going on, but I am wondering if you people have any advice how to proceed?  Thanks in advance!	No
1461	Pretty much what the title says. I heard from someone else who lives on the property that the office is having every apartment searched and they will be given a notice the night before. Last night I saw a police car and a K-9 unit in the parking lot. Is this legal?	No
1462	Note: Actually, I rent by the week, so I'll only have to give 7 days notice according to FL law. Also fyi, it's a verbal agreement only.  Is it a problem I've already given him 3 days notice failure to pay?  He didn't cough up the money.  But I'm ok with just giving him a new 7 days notice to leave if that will make it tougher for him to challenge the eviction.  I really want him out, gone, out of my life forever.  I don't want to go to court, or if I do, then don't want to have to prove he owes me money, etc.    But one concern I have is suppose he attempts to sue me for something related to the tenancy.  If that happens, will I still be able to counter-sue for the unpaid rent?  Or will me going the 7 day termination-of-lease notice hurt me in that regard?	No
1463	Hi everyone,   Me and other tenants digitally signed a lease at the owner's insistence while we were out of state.  He never provided a copy of it with his signature. We need a copy as we are currently seeking a lawyer to help us with understanding if he is in breach of contract regarding something else, but we need the fully executable lease for the lawyer's help.   Questions: Is the landlord required to provide tenants with a copy of the lease with landlord's signature?  If the landlord is refusing to provide, what options do we as tenants have?Would a lawyer actually help us to receive a copy?  Thanks. Have learned a lot from all the mistakes we made during this current lease term.	No
1464	"Moved in to a new place April 1st that I will not be returning to until September 1st. I have been transfering my share of the rent to one of their accounts yet I realized that every single month they pay the rent like a week late and every time I tell them to pay it on the first its all ""Dude chill"" and ""The landlord is cool with it"" even though when I met him he was some passive old dude, who I feel is just taking it late to avoid confrontation but could screw us.   If we do get charged a late fee or even get served an eviction for late rent, is there any steps I can take to cover myself since I was always transferring money to them a day before it was due? All our names are on the lease.  Or am I overreacting to this situation"	No
1465	I came in here recently asking assistance with my neighbor's long-term visitor and am back again with another question.   Basically, my neighbor and I share a house like a duplex, with a shared backyard and driveway. He has a friend staying with him but insists he does not live there but just comes over often. The landlord believes him, so.. whatever.   I set up a camera pointing toward the area I most frequent because I do not feel safe with this guy around and what I discovered is that when my neighbor leaves for work every day, his friend goes into the backyard and literally sits there THE WHOLE DAY.   I suspected he hung out in the back yard a lot, which is why I do not allow my children to play in the yard without myself or another adult I trust, out there with him, but I did not realize he sat out there all day. I thought he made frequent trips into the backyard to smoke or whatever, but it looks like he is just sitting there all day.   So, as a person who does not reside in the home, does he get to have access to my backyard while his friend is gone at work?	No
1466	"Hi, Reddit. Halp.  Location: Illinois, Cook County  TLDR; Am I crazy? Can we get these college kids to move TF out? Sleep would be nice. Lack of ***holes would be nice. I've already reported to the leasing office but progress is moving so slow. But if I move out, how can I make sure they turn-around our apartment for rental in a timely manner?  Basically, my upstairs neighbors have been partial to what's called 'excessive noise' in our lease contract. This has been going on since mid-April. So about 3 months. Man, I gave them time and benefit of the doubt. The noise/offenses can include, but not limited to, the following at night (from the hours of 9PM to sometimes 2AM):  Parties Dog Howling Stomping Loud music, high bass level Audible offensive dialogue Maximum volume television Cigarette butts on our patio Yelling/shouting A dozen people invited Vacuuming above bedroom at night Their guests making out at the apt entrance  In May, I started to note this to the leasing manager. It has now escalated to the regional manager of the property and apparently they are in contact with their attorney and asking me to keep a noise log (which I have been, in detail).   Apparently, yesterday, the leasing office talked to the noise offenders. The leasing office is now conducting a phone inquiry to the other guests of the unit if they can confirm the noise. And just ""call the police"" if I hear anything else. Now, what am I to do if the neighbors above the noisemakers also like to have loud, night parties and the neighbors to the right of them have ""thought about knocking on [their] door a couple of times, but man, [he'd just] like to join in""? I feel like the other tenants in the unit are just to cowardly to say anything more.   I have expressed to the leasing office that I just want to move out. It's been 3 months with the nightly noise any time of the week. They said there is an option of moving out say, today. I would hand over the keys, but I would still be responsible for paying rent until the unit is ready to be rented out to somewhere else. From what I gather, there is a long wait for a 1 bedroom apt (which I have), and once it's ready for rent, it will go quick. Then I would be released of all liability from the lease. How can I make sure they don't laze on turning the unit around to rent to someone else? Is there a legal way to make them adhere to a schedule?  Sorry for the frazzled post. Lack of sleep, yah?"	No
1467	"I live in New York (upstate) with my partner.  He got a one year lease for an apartment and I was on it as someone staying there, not as the lessee or sublessee. (kinda stupid, I know, but I'm not letting it happen again lol) Our landlady died in February, and shortly thereafter a man moved in with his sisters.  The local PD posted on Facebook that sister 1 is a level three sex offender.  She didn't disclose it on any forms and the new landlord had no idea, which I'm pretty sure isn't legal on her part.  All three siblings are addicted to cocaine and heroin, and they constantly brought their dealer into their apartment which was above mine.  I hated it, but it didn't seem like a problem to me because it was quiet and contained.  However, it quickly went downhill, and I've had to call the police on them 7 separate times now - threatening each other with knives, pushing people down the stairs, throwing a TV out of their third story window and onto my neighbor's car, etc - and I repeatedly tried telling the new landlord that the new tenants made it unlivable, but he told me his ""hands are tied.""  The lease did have a clause saying we have the right to peaceably and quietly enjoy the rented property, and my brief chat with an attorney about this led me to believe that because I couldn't live there SAFELY (neighbors banged on my door in the middle of the night, tried opening my windows from the outside, one tried kicking down the door), let alone quietly, we weren't obligated to pay rent until the landlord sorted everything out.  We made numerous attempts to tell the landlord about the situation and he always acted like he couldn't do anything.  We continued living there until we moved out shortly thereafter, and didn't pay rent for the last two months (our lease ends this month.)   Everything seemed to have blown over when just recently, the building's trustee started calling me and requesting to talk to me about my ""intentions"" without ever calling my SO, who actually signed the lease.  I never answered because I've heard horror stories about her from other tenants, until today when I finally decided to answer and get it over with.  I asked why she didn't call the person who's actually on the lease and she told me to ""mind my own business,"" then called me an ""ignorant child"" when I explained what the attorney had told me.  She then screamed a little bit and told me her attorney will be in contact with me shortly. Who's in the right?  Where do I go from here? Tl;dr: crackheads made the apartment unlivable so I didn't pay rent and moved out, now the trustee is threatening legal action for the rent.  How badly did we fuck up?"	No

1469	I bought my first house mid-March of this year in mid-March.  Last week, I went down to my basement to grab something and it was flooded... The ceiling was bowed in and soggy, holding water. I shut off the water to my house and called a plumber, who called a restoration company. I filed with my insurance company and they sent someone out to inspect the damages. Basically an outdoor faucet/pipe froze in the winter (before I moved in) and cracked, which was causing a leak. It destroyed all of the carpet in the basement, and the ceiling is cut out where the water was being held in.   My insurance company informed me that this should be the responsibility of the previous owners to file with their insurance, since it obviously didn't freeze mid-March after I moved in. I contacted their real estate agent who in turn contacted them, and they basically said no.  I let my insurance company know, to which they said that's not really legal and to pursue it to at least to get my deductible covered.   So my advice is how to go about this, where to go, or if it's even worth pursuing. My insurance deductible is $1500 and in total I'm out about $2200 to the plumber and to things that weren't covered by insurance.   Thanks in advance!	No
1470	Melbourne Aus.  Hello,  Needing a bit of advice and I'm wondering what I'm looking at.  My apartment flooded due to the pipe of the washing machine coming off the tap.  I was out at the time (gone maybe 10 minutes tops), so there was quite a bit of water when I got back.   The water leaked out into the common area and damaged the carpet. It's since leaked through from the common area and caused the ceiling of a store below to collapse. I've not seen the damage, just heard form the tenants there.   I contacted my renters' insurance, but have been informed that my policy only covers what's inside my apartment and doesn't apply to the common areas/other people's apartments, which does seem to be the case reading over my contract.   I'm wondering, is this usually something that I'm going to have to pay for out of pocket, or is it something that will be covered by the body corporates' insurance and I'm mostly in the clear? Or is it an instance where the the insurance will cover it, but will want to recover money form me?  Someone suggested to me that all I'd need to pay is the excess for the insurance, but they are not associated with the body corporate, so I'm hesitant to take there word at it.  I'm not trying to shirk responsibility here, just trying to get an idea about what I'm looking at and plain accordingly.  Any advice/insights would be greatly appreciated.	No
1471	This is really long. I'm trying to figure out what to do to my GF to take care of all the crazy stuff she's put me through.   A few weeks ago, my GF and I got into a fight because I've been seeing someone else on the side (we're poly, she sometimes has other guys too). She didn't like that we weren't using protection. It got pretty heated and I stormed out and stayed with the other girl for a day.   So then I went back to my GF's apartment. We didn't talk for a week, and then she started to loosen up again and things more or less got back to normal.   But then she looks at my phone without my permission, which was password protected, and finds out I'm still seeing the other girl during the day (I work nights or mornings usually). I told her when I gave her my password that it was only for emergencies. She gets pissed, again, for no reason, and says that I can't see the other girl unless we use protection. I try to explain to her that it doesn't feel as good that way, and the other girl's told me she's clean, so to just relax. But she just gets crazier and is screaming at me, and I guess I scream at her a little.   So, long story short, I get so mad I feel like I'm seeing red and I smash a glass lamp on the floor. Well, I didn't realize where it was going as I threw it, but the lamp breaks right by my GF's foot and shatters. She has to go to the hospital for stitches, but she promises me she'll tell the doctors it was just an accident, which it was.   She comes back when I'm not home, and she's pissed and she accuses me of being with the other girl, which I wasn't. I was at work, like always at that time, but I had gone to see the other girl that night while my GF was at the hospital. She tells me she's gonna lock me out.   I start to freak out and head home early, and my key still works, so I go in. She starts screaming at me, and I try to keep my cool, but I start screaming back at her eventually because she won't listen and is being totally unreasonable. She tells me that she's kicking me out. Then she tries to go to the bedroom (because it has a lockable door), but I'm still talking, so I grab her arm so she won't leave. She starts screaming to let her go.   Well, I guess one of the neighbors overheard the screaming (we live in an apartment building) and called the cops, because while she's yelling at me and I'm trying to talk to her, the police knock on the door. They forced me to leave. They said I was trespassing, but I said I lived there. Now I'm staying with the other girl for now, and my GF has said I can't come back and the police said I shouldn't go back.   So, what I want to know, is can I make my GF let me back into our apartment? I've lived there for a year and paid some of the rent, even though she's the only one on the lease and lived there before we met. I've read that if you live at a place long enough that makes you a resident and you can live there. Would I need to sue her? Was it legal to look at my phone? What about the police stuff? Could she tell the cops I smashed a glass lamp on her foot even though it was an accident which she already admitted to the doctors? Should I tell the police about her screaming, since that was pretty unreasonable and abusive of her? What about my stuff she has? Am I aloud to go to the apartment and use it? She has my TV right now, and it's a pretty awesome TV that cost a lot of money, and I want to use it.   I live in Maryland, if it matters.	No
1472	In 2013 my boyfriend  was working at a gas station. They were short handed and he was the only one working in the store and it was quite busy. He wasn't paying close enough attention to an ID and ended up selling cigarettes to a minor that was a few months from being of legal age in a sting. Obviously we expected a ticket and probably for him to lose his job which did happen but he also ended up being charged with a misdemeanor and the charge was endangering a minor. His lawyer told him that basically he can never get this expunged and its been hindering his search for better paying jobs. He only has a job right now because he knew someone in the company and they let him explain the charge.

1473	"I live in a house with a few other people. Up until this month, everyone has been paying the one tenant (hereby called Tenant A) who was on the lease. These payments also include our last-month rents that we paid when we moved in.  As of this month (July), I and the other tenants are on the lease. Tenant A, who was previously the only tenant on the lease, is off the lease this month (July), but is living here until July 31st. When we asked Tenant A for our last month rents, he essentially told us to go pound sand, as they say.  There is no documentation for anything (lesson learned!). All transactions have been paid in cash.  I'm pretty sure this is a huge longshot, and that I am up ""shit creek,"" as they say. But is there anything we can do to get our last-month rent payments back? I don't know if what Tenant A did is even illegal. There is no documentation but there is the word of all the current leased tenants.  Some side questions:  (1) Tenant A's motivations are that we owe him for the security deposit he paid when he got on the lease. I'm under the impression that the deposit is between Tenant A and the landlord? and that moving-in tenants do not owe deposit money to moving-out tenants. With the state of the house, Tenant A would not be able to get the deposit back from the landlord.  (2) Tenant A, upon notifying me that I wouldn't get my last-month back, also threatened to call the landlord and say a bunch of things to make sure I get kicked out of the house. I'm not even sure what to do about that, legally or personally.  Thanks, PoorDecisionMaker69"	No
1474	I work 80-110 hours a week. I have 80 of available PTO that must be used within the next two months. I have requested single days off and up to 3 days off for PTO vacation days and every single time they say I can't for one reason or another.  They say if I don't use the PTO it will just be unused and wont roll over. They also won't pay for what I don't use. Over the course of the last 10 months off I have put in 14 requests and all have been denied. So what is the point of me getting PTO if I am not allowed to ever take it and I lose it since they won't allow me the time off?	No
1475	They spliced into the power line below the meter to grow pot which they were busted for. We've never been contacted by the police. They drilled a hole into our basement wall to run it into the house. Should I contact the power company or someone else? Will I be held liable since I'm the owner?	No
1476	Finished up my lease on an apartment with 3 other guys on the first of July and received the itemized list of charges against the security deposit. Some of the charges on it were $150 for labor in replacing a fist sized hole in the wall, 150 for parts and 225 for labor in replacing a broken door jam which I had already bought a door jam to be installed, and some other things. As of right now he said that he was being a nice guy and not charging the cleaning fee, which he priced at 400 and pretty much said that if we complained about the pricing he would apply that fee.   What I'm wondering is if there is some standard for pricing that a landlord can charge and if they are able to tack on more money after sending the itemized list because $150 to replace $10 of drywall and to paint that area seems absurd. Anything helps, thanks	No
1477	"My house has been in foreclosure. Knowing that we would be forced to move out at some point, my family and I moved in with relatives a few blocks away.    Knowing that we would have to be notified and given some time before we were evicted, we kept a lot of stuff at the house. Some of it was large stuff like furniture that we didn't have room for and didn't want to pay storage for, and some of it was antiques, books, or other stuff that I had accumulated that I would sell from time-to-time.   I go to the house once a week to collect the mail and occasionally go inside to grab some stuff. I showed up today and there was a dumpster filled with my stuff and a crew working inside. The locks had been changed.    I was definitely not served with any notice to vacate or anything like that. I called the police to file a report. They came to the house and told me there was nothing they could do, that I should have known this would happen since I knew I was in foreclosure, that it was my word against theirs (though there was no one claiming that they were right to evict me, and I showed them mail with my name and the address of the house in question), and that I should call an attorney or the Sheriff's office.   The construction crew put me in touch with the ""new owner"" (quotations because I only have his word, as I haven't been served with anything), who said that he thought the property had been vacated because he had been inside a bunch of times and hadn't seen beds, though it was full of other stuff, and because I wasn't taking good care of the lawn and the inside needed a bunch of repairs. He admitted that he hadn't made any attempt to reach me, by phone or mail, even though the neighbors on either side and across the street all know me, have my number, and know where I'm living. He definitely didn't use the sheriff's office.  This all happened in the last few hours. I haven't had any luck getting an attorney yet. I took some pictures of the full dumpster, but I have no way of making a full inventory. Is there something else I should be doing? Is it true that I shouldn't be filing a police report?   Thank you for any help."	No
1478	"My SO (we are in the UK) crochets amigurumi plushies, and sells them on etsy, as a side hobby (by no means does she really EARN from it per se).  One of her listings on etsy is a pattern for an animal amigurumi, which she posted in the last month. Today she received an email from another etsy seller (from Canada) telling her to take it down as she is infringing on her copyright, as she also has a pattern for the same animal on etsy, and has done since 2016.  the seller notes that she can tell the patterns are not identical, as the stitches are clearly different (at least from a crocheters perspective), but cites that the finished amigurumi is still very similar in appearance, and thus this is where her copyright has been infringed.  is this a thing?  this woman literally says ""Copyright laws protect the appearance of an amigurumi design, even if the actual pattern isn't identical"".  i know my SO didn't copy her pattern, or even use images of her amigurumi for the inspiration. it is purely coincidental. this isn't the first pattern she's made by herself."

1480	My girlfriend and I live together and share a lease in an apartment. I believe I am the primary signature on the lease.   A few days ago my girlfriend and I were arguing, an argument which continued as we entered the bedroom. We were both in bed and I was facing away from her in an attempt to fall asleep, the lights were off and I was trying to end the conflict. The argument was continuing, and I wasn't helping things by telling her to shut up. She eventually started hitting me, which unfortunately has happened before and I told her don't hit me. She hit me again and I turned around in the dark and struck her back, in the chest.   Her immediate response was too cry out and jump from bed, saying she was calling the cops. It all happened very quickly. I got out of bed and got dressed, and waited for the police who arrived extremely quickly. I was fairly shocked at the speed of all this. The police questioned me, and I cooperated fully, explaining to them what I am typing to you now.   At the time I was in a daze. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. I struck my girlfriend out of frustration of her always hitting me. At the time I just wanted her to realize it wasn't fair what she was doing. I know there's no such thing as an excuse especially not in this situation.   Anyways the police cuffed me and took me to jail which I cooperated fully with. I am now being charged with assault. As a stipulation to being released, I was asked to sign a notice to appear, and to agree to fully cut off contact with my (now former) girlfriend. Finally I am not to return to my apartment, where I live and keep all my possessions.   I understand from the information that the police have given me that my ex girlfriend is leaving the apartment. She has a new place to live in the start of August. This means she will be able to start out again on her own, which I am fine with. I really do wish her the best and I look at this incident with sadness and regret.   But now I am under police order to not return to my apartment. Even in a week, once my ex moves out, I am apparently still not to return.   I need advice for, once my apartment has been vacated by my ex, how to regain access to my life and apartment.   I have a court date but it isn't until the 22nd of August. I am staying at a friend's but this whole debacle is weighing heavily on my conscience. I am almost positive that there are no injuries involved. I really hope now that my girlfriend still has compassion for me which I assume she does. I realize my mistake, especially during the moment when I justified my actions as self defense.   But now I am on charges without access to my apartment. Is there something I can do? I plan to, if the charges are not dropped before the 22nd, to lawyer up. I just need some advice about my position.   I am not going to contact my girlfriend because it's part of my release agreement. I just need to get my life back as soon as possible.   Please help!	No

1482	"Hi everyone.  I live in Massachusetts. I moved into this apartment complex in 2015 right when it was built. I was one of the first people to move into my building. The apartment management has been pretty flukey and not great since the start, but I've always brushed it off since my apartment is gorgeous, the complex offers nice amenities, and my utilities are consistently unbelievably cheap.   My lease ended on June 30th. On June 28th, the complex announced that they had been sold to a new management company. I made sure to email the new management, CCing the old management, to let them know that my lease was ending. I am on an affordable unit plan since I was working as an intern when I first moved there... I have since gotten a full time job with great pay but still fall under the ""current tenant income limit"" which is 140% of the new tenant cutoff. I explained that I had all of my paperwork for the income verification ready to drop off and that I was prepared to sign my lease at their earliest convenience.   After verifying all of my paperwork, they provided me with an online lease on June 29th. I noticed several errors in the lease, but was afraid to wait to sign it since I was already on my final day of my last lease. This happened last year as well, but I was close with the leasing office manager and ended up signing the lease and following it up with a comprehensive email to him regarding any and all corrections. This year, I did the same. I signed the lease, saved a copy of the lease to my computer (pre-signing... I do not have a copy of the signed lease, I'll explain why in a bit) and then emailed them a list of corrections and questions.  I received an email on July 1st that read ""Please stop by office at your earliest convenience. Our apologies, but there is a good chance we will have to have you re-sign the lease due to the change in management. I'm here today until 4:00 and here on Monday from 10-3. Thank you!""   I stopped by the leasing office that day around 2 and was told, ""Oh, the lease isn't ready yet. We will contact you when it is."" I emailed them again on July 5th to say, ""Just checking in since I stopped by on Saturday around 2pm and was told that the lease was not ready yet. Do you know when it will be ready for me to re-sign? Also, when will residents regain access to the web portal?""  Now, I should note that everything at my apartment is done via the web portal. After I was told that I would likely need to resign my lease, I tried to sign in to the web portal to try and obtain a copy of the signed lease but found that they had shut it down while they transitioned to a new host. This is why I do not have a copy of the signed lease.   They responded with ""We will have this out to you as soon as possible! And the resident portal will be back up for 8/1 to be able to pay rent online. Thank you for your patience while we make this transition!""   This past Monday, July 10th, I stopped at the leasing office to pick up a package. The woman in the office again reassured me that my lease would be ready to sign soon and that I am ""still within [my] lease"" so I shouldn't be worried. However, if they are in fact considering the lease I signed on June 29th to be null and void, I am not within my lease.   Should I be worried? Is there a chance that I will somehow be screwed over in this process?"	No

This is what I originally posted there:  *My son (PA resident) was issued a ""Reckless Driving"" ticket in Virginia this past Saturday. He was driving with 2 friends to Myrtle Beach and they were taking turns driving. He got behind the wheel just after D.C. and was driving for 10-15 minutes before he was pulled over on I-95. He claims to have been ""keeping with the flow of traffic"" at the time and that everyone was driving the same speed. Here is what I know:  He was clocked (Radar) doing 85 in a 70 zone. He was in the right hand lane when pulled over. Said that the ticket was for ""Reckless Driving"" and not just a regular Speeding Ticket  He doesn't deny that he was going that speed but was just going the flow of traffic. His biggest concern is points on his license, and increased insurance costs. He's 18. He's not trying to beat the ticket or get out of paying a fine, just trying to avoid points.

1485	I’m living in university housing over the summer (3 months). I was hoping to save some money by sharing a bedroom. This is the description available for the general category of bedroom I chose:  “Double Occupancy (shared) bedroom … configurations vary and include two-person studios, one-bedroom apartment for two interns, and two-bedroom apartments for four interns”  Now, instead of getting a shared / double occupancy bedroom, my roommate got a small bedroom big enough for one person and I got a bed / dresser in the living room. It’s pretty big, so no complaints there, but I have literally no privacy and the only thing separating my bed from the kitchen (and kitchen lights!) is a half wall. So basically my roommate has to walk through my “bedroom” to go to the kitchen, go to the bathroom, or exit the room. And when she has people over (and turns on the lights!) I am left in a somewhat awkward position of having to leave the apartment if I don’t want to join.  I have been snooping around for legal info and I did find this definition according to the Mass Dept. of Environmental Protection for use with listing bedrooms for septic purposes: “Bedroom - A room providing privacy, intended primarily for sleeping and consisting of all of the following: (a)   floor space of no less than 70 square feet; (b)   for new construction, a ceiling height of no less than seven feet three inches;   (c)   for existing houses and for mobile homes, a ceiling height of no less than seven feet zero inches; (d)   an electrical service and ventilation; and (e)   at least one window. Living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, halls, bathrooms, unfinished cellars and unheated storage areas over garages are not considered bedrooms.” The major concerns are “a room providing privacy” and “living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens… are not considered bedrooms”. My bedroom is also a living room and kitchen..  Do I have anything to go on here, especially if it’s a document from the dep of environmental protection? If so what do I even do? Honestly I’d be fine just getting a discount or something but I’m not sure how to go about approaching this.	No

1487	"I am writing on behalf of a close friend. Her husband passed away rather dramatically and unexpectedly and she was forced to sell her old home and move into a new one. The company responsible for building this home we'll call Homes Inc. Where we live in Florida it rains a lot. Apparently when they put down the concrete foundation or the ""slab"" as they call it, they didn't allow it enough time to dry before they started putting the flooring in. Not long after she moved in, floor boards literally started to come apart as they became warped by water from underneath and the glue came undone. She spoke to Homes Inc. and they offered her $2,000 dollars for repairs to the floor in the areas where the leaks had happened. Keep in mind, this is still just a few months after her husband passed away and her whole world got turned upside down. She does not have experience with this sort of thing as her husband was the one to handle this kind of business. So she signed the very long paper and accepted the money. This money was not intended for any repairs to the concrete slab, it only paid to replace the damaged floor boards. What she failed to realize at the time was the true intent of this payoff. The document stated that Homes Inc. was exonerated from any blame for any future damage coming from this problem. It also said she was not allowed to speak to anyone about this or they could sue her. Now it's been months and she still gets leaks all over the house, in her bedroom, in her office, in the living room, in the kitchen. It's far and above a $1,700 job to repair and she feels terrible and trapped. She feels like she was completely deceived since they told her that the areas would dry out over time, yet this has clearly not been the case. She doesn't know what to do and quite frankly neither do I. I know hardly anything about the legality of all this, but I know the fact that she signed that document isn't a good sign.  Does she have any chance at legal action against Homes Inc. for repairs to her home? Who or what kind of lawyer would she need to speak to? I've heard of certain legal scenarios where the lawyers work for a share of the winnings. She doesn't have the money for a long and lengthy legal dispute, but could this be an option for her?"	No

They are telling me that there is an automatic stay, but I'm not sure how that all works out, and they currently aren't here. I don't want a sheriff showing up and tossing me out. Is this a legitimate thing, or should I be worrying about it a bit more than I am? TIA!	No
1489	This is in upstate NY, not NYC.  I lived in an apartment with my mom and stepdad, so they were the ones the rental agreement was with, not me (I was a minor when we moved there). I'm just curious as to what their options are at this point.  We moved there in August 2008. It was an upper/lower property, with us living in the lower and the landlords living in the upper, so there was no building management or anything like that. It was a pretty casual agreement between my parents and the landlords. My parents signed a year lease, and then after the first year, the landlords switched to a month to month lease. No new lease was written up when they made that switch and my parents have unfortunately lost their copy of the original lease.   On July 3, the landlord handed my stepdad a typed up letter that was dated for July 1, telling us we needed to be gone by August 1 because he needed the apartment for an elderly family member that could no longer live alone. My stepdad pointed out that this was not 30 days notice. They then taped a hand written letter to our door the next day reiterating that we needed to be out by August 1, and that they will give us our security deposit ($600) back at the final walk through on August 1 if there are no damages.  We found a place and moved out about a week ago on Sunday July 23. On Sunday July 30, my stepdad went and got our last things, a washer and dryer. He noticed that the landlord had already ripped up the carpeting in our old apartment. We had left the apartment unlocked because the landlord asked us to so he could look around. My stepdad did not have the keys on him on Sunday to hand back to the landlord, and the landlord told him to just leave them in the mailbox when he could. The landlord would not speak about the security deposit or final walk through at all with my stepdad.  We believe he has no intentions of giving us our security deposit back or doing a final walk through like what his note said he would. We think this because he has not mentioned it, does not want to meet in person at all, and doesn't know our new address to send the security deposit to. There was definitely some damage to the carpets, which includes burn marks and stains. But given the fact that we lived there nine years, and the carpeting was not new when we moved in, they would have needed to replace it anyway. Could they realistically use our security deposit to replace carpeting that's likely over 10 years old? They also need to repaint because they haven't done that while we lived there, could they use the deposit for that as well? Other than the carpeting and paint, some other damage would include a cheap old cupboard door that fell off (we kept it so the landlord could reattach it) and a discoloration on the floor where our fridge was sitting.  My mother would like to consult legal services if they do not plan on giving us the security deposit back on the August 1. Would she be wasting her time due to the damages left in the apartment, or would those damages be considered normal wear and tear after nine years? Also, were the landlords legally required to give us 30 days notice? If so, would there be anything we could do at this point about the fact they gave us notice on July 3rd, even though they dated it July 1? Should my mom go through with her plan to consult legal services, or let it go? If she does go through with it, what could she expect? Thanks.	No

1491	Last Friday all tenants received a notice on the door that the only payment option (aside from checks which they take a week to process) was removed. Now I either directly pay with my bank (Takes 3 business days to process. $2.95 fee. If system fails to recognize the 0s in front of account number, you're charged extra $40), pay with debit/credit card (which is $2.95 fee on top of 3.5% of rent),  pay with cash at PayLease locations ($4 fee), pay with money order (varies but averages around $2), or pay with check (no fee but takes a week to process. Check can be lost).  I would just swallow the cost and do bank payments except for the following issues:             1. It takes 3 business days or longer to show it went through correctly             2. The first time I paid with my bank, they rejected the payment because I put numbers in wrong. I put the 0s in front of the account number (my bank documents and the ID card both show the 0s and the websites guide on finding account numbers on checks showed 0s), and the payment was rejected and I had to pay a $40 payment rejection fee. I'm nervous putting my account info down and getting that fee again              3. It used to be a $250 non refundable pet fee and then they changed it where it's a $250 non refundable pet fee and a $50 pet rent. In our are pet rent is max $30 and it's either non refundable pet fee OR pet rent OR pet rent + refundable pet fee. It doesn't feel right giving them more money.  When I signed the lease, I had a safe option to pay without incurring fees that guaranteed it applied to the account immediately. Now I don't. What options do I have? Are there laws against this or anything that can help me here?     Tenants had a week notice before rent is due again.   I live in Arkansas.	No
1492	Hello,  I have been renting an apartment through a property management company since April 2016. When I signed my lease I was told I needed renter's insurance and had the option to secure it through a third party or be billed by the property management company monthly for it. I elected to pay the company for the renter's insurance to simplify my bills.  Two days ago I experienced a fire at my apartment caused by an electric barbeque. Whether this barbeque was allowed or not is the matter of another post but I have evidence to support it being allowed. I discovered later, after speaking with the insurance and property management companies, that I do not have a policy with them and that they don't even provide renter's insurance, just liability insurance.  So I feel as if I was extremely misled and was given the impression of paying for a renter’s insurance policy but was not provided with such. The evidence I have for being misled is the strange wording of the renter’s liability addendum to my lease and a monthly utility bill with an itemized charge of $15 for “Rent Ins”.   So my question is this: do I have any legal grounds to go after the property management company for the loss of my property due to the fire if it is determined that none of it is covered? I am sorry if I did not provide enough detail but wanted to be concise and avoid rambling. Please let me know what you need from me and I appreciate your help and use of your time. Thank You	No

1495	"Located in North Dakota.   PICTURES OF DAMAGE ARE LINKED AT BOTTOM OF POST  I posted in this subreddit a few weeks ago. Long story short, I own a twinhome. My neighbors are renters. One of my neighbors moved their sump pump hose right outside my basement window, and it proceeded to come into my basement destroying my carpet and padding.   It was suggested in here to file an insurance claim, which I did.   First I filed with my own insurance company, and they said they wouldn't cover it as they would consider it to be ""flood damage"" and I don't have flood coverage. They suggested to file a claim through the other homeowners policy policy, and it may fall under their liability coverage.   So that's what I did. His insurance company sent out an adjustor, inspected the damage, and did his thing. A week later, I got a call from the insurance company saying they wouldn't cover it, since it wasn't their insured (the actual homeowner) that caused the damage, but rather the person renting the home from him. I asked if the homeowner has any liability for his renters actions, and the insurance company said no, not at all.   So now I'm in my present situation.  I paid 2300 dollars for carpet and padding, which is going to be installed on Tuesday. Admittedly, this carpet is nicer than the carpet I had to take out (5 dollars a Sq foot as opposed approx 3 dollars a Sq foot for the original).   I know my neighbor isn't going to want to pay for the damages they caused, as that is the nature of negligent neighbors. So I'm guessing my ultimate course of action will be to take them to small claims court. I'm only really armed with pictures of the damage as well as pictures of where my neighbor left his sump pump hose. Is this enough to get a judgment in my favor? I've never gone to court for anything, so any opinions are appreciated.    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-FrQKc4fy6qVEFxemdpblNBN2c?usp=sharing"	No
1496	On March 26, 2017, my girlfriend's sister moved out of an apartment in Manassas, VA. She had many issues with the apartment and was relieved to move out after two years. She checked her mail on the 26th, the day that she was supposed to give them back the keys, and found that a walkthrough she was never told about in any other capacity was scheduled for later that week. If she hadn't checked the mail,  she would have had no idea they needed or scheduled a walkthrough. Based on all the problems she had while living there, it seems the apartment complex had a habit of sending items after the fact. Unfortunately, the day the walkthrough was scheduled something came up at work and she decided to just rely on the pictures and videos she took after cleaning the apartment before she turned the keys in.   When she moved in two years prior, she had originally paid $1175.00 for the security deposit. The complex decided to keep $93.96 for rent and $135.00 for the carpet cleaning. She was fine with these charges because she knew about them both ahead of time. They also charged her for cleaning the oven and microwave, which she admitted she forgot to clean when moving out. However, they also charged for things she disagreed with, $3.71 for an ice tray her refrigerator never had and $9.78 for a ceiling cover being gone; she distinctly remembers having no issues with any ceiling panels. It was also part of her lease that she patch the holes before she moved out, which she did, and even sanded them down for the apartment. They ended up charging her $26.10 for the walls finish sanding. Finally, she was charged $197.20 for her bedroom and bathroom smelling like smoke. They claimed the $197.20 was for the sealer paint on the walls. Her boyfriend had smoked, but not in the apartment, and it was in the designated areas that the apartment provided. She had planned to fight some of these items but she had to travel for work and lost track of time. She ended up just depositing the remaining $641.05 of the security deposit check they mailed her. Really she was so relieved to finally cut ties with the apartment complex after having so many problems with them during the couple years she lived there. She estimates she received the security deposit check around April 8.  When she got her mail last week, she was surprised to find a letter from the corporation who owned the complex, requesting even more money back from the security deposit. As far as we're aware, we don't think she needs to cover these additional security deposit requests, since they returned the security deposit and the request exceeded the 45 day period. The letter they sent is dated for June 27th, but somehow, even though she didn't move very far from her old place, she received it at the end of July. This time the apartment was asking for $1846.20 by Friday, July, 28th or otherwise they threatened to turn information over to their attorney. They said they needed the money because they still haven't rented the apartment out to new tenants. They said that potential renters are saying that the apartment smells like smoke so no one wants to live there. From their request for money, it looks like they are just recharging her for the items she already paid for. Based on what we could find in Virginia law, it seems like it's too late for them to be requesting additional money. She also tells me no one ever smoked anything inside the apartment, just outside. Also, she's afraid if she pays them anything now, they're just going to keep coming back for more money in a couple months. Does the apartment complex have any rights to ask for this money after they've mailed the security deposit back and months after she's moved out? Although it appears they're asking for  payments to items she's already paid for, is it possible they could get a collection agency to go after her and/or ding her credit? We appreciate any advice you have for this situation.  Also, when trying to research her rights, she read a few times that she should have gained interest on her security deposit since she lived there more than 13 months. Is this true? Although we both don't think it's worth hiring a lawyer for this amount of money, it'd be nice to counter their letter with something they've done wrong.	No
1497	"My friend [F25] was out drinking at bar with a few friends and acquaintances over this past weekend. She drove home very drunk and one of her ""friends"" followed her home and raped her in her apartment.    I want my friend to go to the police and file a report against this scum bag so he doesn't find another drunk victim to rape, because I just don't think this was his first time. She doesn't want to go to the police because she drove home drunk and is afraid of the consequences. Can she get charged with a DUI or a misdemeanor if she admits that she drove home drunk without any incidents? If we find out that it's unlikely, then I think she'll agree to file a report of rape against this guy. Once that question is mostly answered, we need to find out if there's enough ""evidence"" of the rape to actually do anything. She's really worried that it'll just be her word against his.   Thank you for any help/advice on this issue. It's such a sensitive situation and she nor I knew where to turn to for help."	No
1498	I had a minor flood from my upstairs bathroom which caused my downstairs roof to collapse causing water damage. We contacted a restoration company to potentially mitigate damage and or prevent further damage. They brought in de humidifiers to remove water. No damage was done to our floor from the leak. This morning we noticed that their equipment was leaking all night on to our floors, after cleaning the water we noticed our flooring had warped from this sitting water. We contacted the gentlemen and advised him that his machine leaked all over our floor and he blamed us. Stating that it is our fault since we have dogs in that area and little children that go thru there and a carpet that we set down near it (he did not advise us that the dogs might present a problem and he did not advise that the hose running a long the length of our home should not be touched what so ever and therefore limited foot traffic should occur in that area) he would like to file a claim against my insurance company to fix the flooring. I have not yet paid him. Should I allow him to file the claim on my insurance. I am unsure if this is my fault or his and if there are legal ramifications, or if I should just let him file a claim. Would just like some guidance.	No
1499	currently in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, I'm working on getting out (all without his knowledge) I'm just trying to tie up loose ends. A few months ago I fell asleep in one of the recliners in our living room and when I woke up he had his phone out and showed me ALOT of pictures he took of me with his penis out and on my face in various different places. near and almost in my mouth from what I can remember. he only showed them to me that one time then refused to delete them when I begged him to. be he wouldn't even show them to me again when I asked. he laughed and thought it was funny and never showed them to me again. I feel so violated. what can I do? press charges? ensure somehow they get deleted??	No
1500	Hi legaladvice,   I'm scheduled to move from my current apartment to a differ unit in September within the same building. I signed a 12 month lease about a week ago for the apartment. I wasn't able to see the unit at the time because it was still occupied. I had the chance to check it out today and it turns out it's an ADA modified unit that's significantly different from my current apartment (e.g. much less storage space, lower counters, appliances lowered / on the counters, etc). I wasn't informed of this and the floor plan is also different than what I was led to believe. My current unit has been leased by another tenant who plans to move in shortly after I move out. The building is willing to let me relocate to another non-ADA unit at 'market rate' which for the units available is significantly more money than the rate for the future unit. The available units are larger and all of the floor plans are slightly different so I can't really do any 1:1 comparisons here.   Question: Do I have any rights to entirely void the lease due to this omission, any rights to retain my current apartment, or rights to any sort of discount or other concession? I'm thinking I'm actually pretty fortunate they're willing to let me transfer despite the signed lease; but it's really going to hurt my budget, and I'm really not interested in the modified unit. Do I have any leverage here at all?	No
1501	I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this	No
1502	So about a year ago I, at the time, a 22 year old Texas resident was in oklahoma and recieved a speeding ticket.  I only paid about half of it, which of course I knew would turn into a warrant but I rarely go to Oklahoma so i don't care.  I have since moved to Colorado. Which brings us to thursday, I get a message from a private debt collection agency on behalf of this Oklahoma county with a lady telling me I have a warrant, which I already knew about.  I was just surprised it soundes like a collections agency, so I called them back and spoke to the lady who left me her extension.  When i state who I am and why Im calling she chuckled and said, oh yes Ive talked to your mother.  Excuse me what? Im 23. I go off on the lady and eventually hang up because she said she was not part of a police department. I then called my mother.  My mom claims the debt collector had called both hers and my dads cell phone looking for me and I assume telling them of my warrant ( which they already knew about.)   So my question is this, is it legal for debt collectors to call my parents about a debt not belonging to them? Also is it even legal for police to send info about warrants or debts to private debt collectors? Can I get arrested in colorado or Texas if im in the state, and lastly, is it legal for the said private debt collector to give out information about my warrent to others?  This is why I stay out of Oklahoma.	No
1503	Obligatory, for a friend.  Okay, so my friend is leasing an apartment with two other friends. After a ton of arguments she has decided to move out and find someone to sublet the apartment for the rest of the 6 month lease. Both of the other roomates agreed, she found someone willing to step forward, and is about two weeks from that happening. Suddenly today one of the roomates says she is taking her room, the one which the new party has agreed to rent. It has its own bathroom, walk in closet, etc where the other two rooms do not.   It's gotten to the point where she says she will be waiting to move her stuff the minute that my friend moves hers out. Will break a lock if she installs one, etc. We are also worried that the new party will back out because this roommate is a psycho. What can she do?	No
1504	http://imgur.com/0oWgPJX  I just learned about these landlords. Apparently they have cameras on the outside of the house...and in common spaces inside (said to be turned off). Landlords also enter the house whenever they want. They left this letter tonight while I was visiting.   We're in Oregon. I had a girlfriend who had to deal with this same thing in college. But, the school had a laser that took care of that. I don't know who to contact now. Can anyone help get us started?	No
1505	"My ex who I have been friends with is dating someone new. She tried to befriend me a year ago and I was nice to her. She gave me a bunch of clothes she didn't want and then much later asked for them back but since they were mine I gave them away. She's now saying I stole from her.   My ex gave me 1600 dollars a year ago when my family had a huge rough patch and he and I have no contract of this and he knows I'll pay him back as I earn it but now the new girlfriend is stating she can get me for 1600 dollars.  She's been sending me messages for a year and I've repeatedly asked her to stop and she doesn't. Sometimes I would respond but when I realized she was harassing me I told her to stop and asked my Ex to ask her to quit.   Two days ago I asked my ex a question through text and he ignored me and then I got a text from the girlfriend threatening me. I texted my ex very angrily stating I can't believe he would let someone else talk for him instead of just answering me. It was a low point of very angry texts but not threats. The next day he responds to me like nothing happened.   Now the new girlfriend is rep steely threatening me with her aunt who is a lawyer stating she has ""stuff I stole from her"" and my exes 1600 dollars I owe plus emotional damages that she could put against me. I've been in tears all day wondering if I'm going to end up in jail or with charges. I don't have records of all the harassing messages she sent over the last year because I gave a new phone so it seems like their case could be in their favor since I can't prove how she was harassing me. I have no idea what to do. My family says to ignore her and that she has nothing against me. Please help."	No
1506	I'm working with a company on an eCommerce site as general help (customer service, manufacturer communication, photos, etc.).   It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out.   Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor.   The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily.   I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.  Any resources or thoughts are greatly helpful!   States involved include CO and DC.	No
1507	I (LL) signed a tenant on 6/29 for a move in of 7/21. However, my partner and I are no longer able to move in at the location (her dad's) we were supposed to be going to because of some personal issues going on with the family that happened rather abruptly.  Is this allowed? Am I liable for anything? I feel awful for having to do it, but I am in a tight spot here. Any help is super appreciated!	No
1508	In early May, I got a speeding ticket in Magnolia, Texas. According to the ticket, I'm entitled to the evidence against me. I also could not make my assigned court date due to work conflicts. I sent the Municipal court a letter requesting evidence and a court date conflict. Never heard back. Court says letter never arrived, and now my ticket is in 'default' cause I didn't showed up for my date.      I sent a second letter, certified, via USPS. Tracking number says it made it the Magnolia post office, but after being 'out for delivery' for ten days, the post office opens an investigation. They tell me that because of the huge volume of mail going to the court, not all of it gets scanned.  A clerk at the court cannot locate the letter. They tell me to get a DVD of my ticketing incident, I have to submit a written claim in order for them to send me the form to request the evidence. They cannot accept the request over the phone.       I call a lawyer for help at the end of June. He tells me I may have a warrant out for my arrest now, and that my fines may have gone up. Offers to call the court on my behalf to see what's going on, and to see if they'll accept a fax instead. Is unable to get a hold of them for three days. Oh, and he keeps forgetting to call me back.  I've given up on him.      I sent a third letter via UPS earlier in July, which *was* filed as delivered. I've been calling the Court three-four times a day for four days now, and I cannot get anyone on the phone to confirm they actually have it.       It's now been two months since my ticket. I'm going insane, and I don't know what to do. I haven't received any mail from the Court. I feel the ticket was predatory, and I don't want to spend $250 for allegedly going 51 miles per hour from a stopped position in less than one mile of travel time. I don't live in Texas, which makes my options limited.      Can I file a complaint against the court? Because this is a fairly rural area, ticket lawyers are really hard to find.	No
1509	I'll try and stick to the facts of the situation in an effort to maximize efficiency.  Location: New Jersey   Issue: Due to an assortment of issues I need to kick out my roommate.  Lease (who is on it): My wife and myself (my roommate is not)  Duration of Stay: 4 months  Questions I Need Answered:  If we ask him to leave is a written 30 day notice required?  What legal options do I have as far as enforcing him to move out?  Other Info: We've given him money which he's blown, a room that he's made look like a dump, and a job which he's lost. I get nothing but excuses when it comes to the things that matter such as looking for work. He refuses to assist with house upkeep on any meaningful level and he never showers which is just, from a sensory perspective is just awful.  Please help.	No
1510	Sis and bf forced entry and choked me and slammed me down traumatizing a back muscle. I went to ER, given Vicodin. The house is in sisters name-The home was placed in her trust bc i have student loan in default, the home is supposed to be transferred to me. I did not make a police report.	No

1512	I have severe depression and anxiety and it was causing my performance to drop and they reached out to me about it. At this time I disclosed my mental illnesses to HR to get it documented. After this I was singled out and threatened on a weekly basis that they were going to fire me for not meeting stats for 3-4 months. This put a lot of stress  and anxiety on me causing my depression to get worse and worse which in turn caused my performance to worsen. I then reached out to the employee assistance program to set up sessions to get medication for my depression due to how bad it was getting due to them. Mind you that a good majority of employee's were doing around the same as me and some even worse that were not being treated this way or even being spoken to about it. They continued to push me and have gotten so bad that I can barely function. I have a session set up to see someone about getting back on medication which i fully disclosed to them that i was seeking help at which point they fired me for performance and tried to pay me to sign a contract giving up any rights to legal action. I feel I was discriminated against and harassed due to my mental illnesses to the point of breaking me and then they fired me. I'm trying to find out if I can fight this.	No
1513	Hello,  The company I am having issues with are holding my account that I have them under certain restrictions (one of which is quite serious, money related) due to a claim of theirs to which I do not agree. They want to video interview me over the internet. Not sure why they wanted to do that but there is no such thing explicitly written in their ToS. I find this rather intrusive regarding my privacy, not to mention unprofessional and quite barbaric. And no, there have been no reports of any sort of fraudulent activity on my account that I know of, my track of record is excellent there, and they have already verified my account about 8 years ago. The company is based in California, USA, I am based in the EU, Romania.  Are there any USA / EU / international laws protecting my privacy over the internet that I could enforce upon them ? Do I stand a fair chance of winning such a lawsuit ?  Thank you	No
1514	For background information, my friend and i are both 17 going to be 18 soon.  To start the story off my friend and i were smoking a blunt on the side of the road when a cop pulled up behind us and walked to the door. After making eye contact with the officer he opened my door (drivers side) and asked us to get out and put us against the wall. After that we were patted down and put into the cop car. About 2 more cop cars came and they started searching my vehicle where they found about 2 grams of weed. When suddenly the officer pulled out 3/4ths of an Ecstasy pill and asked me to identify what it was. We were eventually taken to the local station where they filled out the paperwork and than after about 6 hours transported to downtown. my friend and i were both charged with the marijuana but i was charged with controlled substance on top of that. This is my first offense of any kind. But, on the police report they stated that when the police were patting us down they found weed on us which isn't true. The only thing on me was my wallet and my friend had nothing on him at all. They also stated that we were going door to door selling weed, that they found the X pill in a pill bottle with my name on it which also is not true. There was a pill bottle with my name on it but it had marijuana in it. they also stated that when we went to the local station we were being questioned by detectives the whole time but in reality we were put into singular cells and chained up the entirety of the time there. if i'm being completely honest i really am unsure of what's gong to happen. Is my life over? Is it even possible for me to have an ending that will be relatively okay? Also, I'm enrolled in an EMT program for this upcoming senior year and we have to do a background check and i suppose that's over for me? i appreciate whatever advice you can give.	No
1515	Okay, so I was born a dual citizen of Taiwan and the US. I live in the US, but has come back to Taiwan for the summer.   On the morning of the flight, I realized my US passport has expired for many days, and the lady at the checkout counter told me to use my Taiwanese passport at customs. (Usually, I used US passport at US customs and the Taiwanese passport at Taiwanese customs) I've renewed my US passport in Taiwan, but the issue is that I don't know whether to use my US or Taiwanese passport when I return to the US.   If I use my American passport, would TSA question me for not having a record for leaving the US? On the other hand, if I use my Taiwanese passport and apply for a visa, would the process be complicated by the fact that I already hold an American passport?  Thanks.	No
1516	hello everyone,  My boss co-signed me a car 5 years ago. Its all paid off and I would like to sell it now. The title has both my name and co-signer's name.  I took it to carmax today and they told me that the title needs to have only my name.  My question is how can I remove co-signer's name from my car title? I can't get hold of my old boss.	No
1517	At the beginning of July, I had bought a money order to pay my rent to my landlord. His office was closed for a small vacation and he was due back the next day, so I filled it out, put it in an envelope and dropped through the drop slot at his office. It landed about five feet from the door. This was on July 3rd.  July 7th - he messages me about missing a rent payment. I get up with the money order vendor and it was cashed on the evening of the third. They won't tell me where or who; I have to pay for an expedited scan of the endorsement.   July 8th - I contact local police to file a report and am told that nothing is able to be done until we learn whether or not this was a mistake on my LLs realty office or it was stolen.  July 10th - I receive a scan via email of the front and back of the money order. LLs name is scribbled out and another name is written above it. LL has no idea who that is, but i recognize the name from around town. I file a police report again and give info on who I am pretty sure this person was.  No info is included on where cashed the order; am told I can receive that info via mail appx. 2 weeks later.  July 21 - I receive the letter and am told it was cashed at a bank one town over in Ohio. I go over there and they say it was done via their ATM and they have no idea why it was approved as those are apparently approve at an office whenever someone wants to cash via ATM. They tell me there is nothing they can do more than just confirming it was cashed at that ATM.  July 22nd - Went to local PD and gave info on where it was cashed.   That's all that I've done so far. My landlord is not wanting to file a report themselves unless it's required to get the rent payment back. He is obviously wanting the missed payment and I simply can't just give him another payment. What are my options in terms of recouping my money?   At this point, do I just wait until local police get back to me? Is the bank liable for cashing the forged money order? Since it's been cashed, I assume moneygram is going to say no on a refund. Do I just wait at this point?  Thank you all for taking the time to read this.	No
1518	I have these neighbors who have 6 dogs and 4 cats. Over double the legal limit for both animals and every time I go over and when I'm at my house I can see and hear them being beaten and abused.

1519	Yesterday, I was given an application to rent from an apartment complex, I disclosed that I was building my credit and that I had none. I filled out the application and turned it in, they gave me a signed lease which I signed as well. The lease has no mention of at-will termination of contract on either side, or demanding of a cosigner in place of a non-credit holding tenant. Today I was called and told I needed a cosigner and that my apartment wasn't secured until I had one. Do I really need the cosigner?	No
1520	I am a 16 year old living in Virginia.  My boss has me working 12 hour shifts with no breaks. I've asked for breaks multiple times, but he won't give me one. What do?	No
1521	I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back. Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this. After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time. By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything. I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts. Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?	No
1522	"One of the stones of an expensive necklace I purchased fell out and broke.  This stone is unique to the manufacturer (because of its cut, I don't think I'll find it anywhere else).  I found the necklace still for sale on the brand's company website.   Ideally, I would purchase a replacement stone from them at a fair price.  In communication with their customer service team, they said ""normally we offer a one year warranty, however since the purchase was made over a year ago, we can't replace it. Also, we are not able to make repairs.""  Also they claim not to have any replacement stones.  I'm just looking to purchase a replacement stone so I don't have to purchase a whole new necklace.  Are there any consumer protection laws applicable?  Company HQ is in TX, I am in GA."	No
1523	Tomorrow I have a court date for a petty larceny charge. I've already been arraigned and this will be My second court date. My lawyer called me up this morning and told me he won't be able to be there tomorrow, and to show up and ask for an adjournment and he said the judge will have no issue granting this.  Is there anything I should worry about regarding this?	No
1524	"Hi guys. I don't know what the format is here so I'm just going to go. Also not sure how detailed I should/shouldn't be, so ask for more detail as needed. GA resident, flew to VA for interview.      I was able to make contact with the VA company through a GA recruiter, so GA recruiter handled all the communication. VA company asked for me to make the flight reservation, which I was uncomfortable with because I am accustomed to the company making the reservation. So I asked the GA recruiter to do it for me on their dime, and they agreed.      When I got to the airport, *excuses here*, I missed the flight. I called up the GA recruiter and asked how best to proceed. He told me he would reach out to VA company and call me back. He called back and said they are fine to do the interview later that day or the next day, and that I should book the next flight I can. I specifically asked whether the flight change fee would be reimbursed, and discussed the specific amount it would be with GA recruiter. GA recruiter spoke with the hiring manager and then GA recruiter explicitly told me on the phone that the VA company would reimburse this amount. After this conversation, I booked the flight change, took the flight, rented a car and hotel, and had the interview the next morning.      I submitted my expense reimbursement request with the flight, car rental, hotel, and taxis to and from the airport. A full month later, I received a check from the VA company, reimbursing the car rental, hotel, and taxis. The flight change fee, which was over half the total reimbursement, was not reimbursed.      I called the GA recruiter, and sent subsequent emails because he was picking up on what was going on and not answering calls anymore, and asked what had happened. GA recruiter told me that an ""HR guy"" at VA company had ""put his foot down"" on the flight change expense, and it would not be reimbursed. To my knowledge, GA recruiter has been reimbursed for the flight they booked.      So I figure I have a couple of avenues. One, there's promissory estoppel re: detrimental reliance on GA recruiter's advice. Two, there's some kind of convoluted argument for detrimental reliance on the hiring manager (although I think that would work better for GA recruiter to use on VA company, and GA recruiter is not interested in suing a client, especially on my behalf), even if he didn't have the authority to make that decision. Three, there may be laws around interview reimbursement I haven't really looked into in VA.      I have already reached out to GA recruiter and been told to go pound sand, so any further communication there will likely need to be all lawyered up. I'm not flush with cash, but I am willing to fight this precisely for that reason.      So, uh, advice?"	No
1525	Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if any more information is needed.  Thanks in advance!	No
1526	Sorry about formatting, on mobile.   Was running my in unit AC when I noticed that smoke was starting to billow out of it. I touched the sides of the unit and it was scalding hot. When I opened the unit I found Styrofoam pieces inside of the unit taped on by maintenance to jam the large fan. This jamming is what lead to the fire hazard.  Upon unjamming the fan and turning it back on, the unit would shake uncontollably, becoming a further hazard.  I have photos of the inside of the unit and the Styrofoam bits that were placed inside of it.    Do I have any legal grounds here because if I was not in the apartment it surely would have escalated to a fire.  I am located in Centre county Pennsylvania.	No
1527	So my parents own a house in California next to a long term neighbor, Joe. Joe is building/digging some stupidly expensive underground thing (wine cellar I think). He got permits and everything and it was going fine until a few days ago...he hit a sewer line. One no one knew existed (both my parents and Joe have owned the properties for ~25 years, so this was a huge amd kind of baffling surprise).   Turns out it's our sewer line, and neither of the families knew it existed. The confusion occurred in part because apparently our house has two sewer lines. I'm not clear if this line was connected to anything or just stopped off.  So obviously this needs to be fixed. Is there law we should look at on who pays? On one hand, Joe broke the sewer line, which was perfectly fine (and maybe the workers weren't being careful enough, though I doubt anyone could have anticipated this). On the other hand, we've apparently been 'using' his land without an easement for God knows how long. And the delay the sewage break has caused is costing Joe money. Luckily, we think the fix will allow the line to not go on Joe's property any more.   Joe's suggested a 50-50 split, and we're leaning towards going with that (even though the cost is going to hurt us much more than it hurts him). This is partially because we've been neighbors for so long and have a good relationship. (I also think a court battle would be expensive and unlikely to be worth it.) Plus, we both live in flag lots and I think technically Joe owns the shared driveway that connects us to the road. (Don't worry, no one is landlocked...yet...)  So while I'm pretty sure we'll split it 50-50 (or maybe counter-offer a 60-40 split), I'm interested in the legal aspects, and I thought legaladvice would appreciate the situation.	No
1528	"In Arizona if it matters.  My wife was offered a nice job that ran a credit check, they found an eviction judgement from five years ago we thought we had paid off. There is apparently still 600 left on it. This in itself isn't a big deal as they said that satisfying the public record would allow her to move forward in the employment process.  I've spent all day trying to track down WHO to pay as before we paid the apartment complex directly ( we have proof ). They referred me the court with the docket, fair enough. They in turn referred me to the law firm that handled the case, ok sure. Gave them a call, they in turn referred me back to the complex. Dead end. The complex then referred me to their collection agency who has no record of the collection. I've officially hit a dead end. Where do I go from here? I want to pay this and have it ""satisfied"" we my wife can get this job but everyone is referring me to someone else in an endless cycle. My first step tomorrow is to go to the court and lay out what happened today, but I'm wondering if anyone had additional insight."	No
1529	"My boyfriend and I have rented an apartment for the past year, and it's been a terrible experience.   To name a few issues to establish a feeling of our stay: we've made multiple noise complaints because the neighbors downstairs have family parties that have very loud music playing with all their doors and windows open that last until late hours of the night. Management told us no one else complains and that it used to be worse, so basically deal with it. Those same neighbors have confronted us multiple times and even left a note taped to our patio that they are calling the cops because they believe we throw trash onto their balcony. We never did. We don't even use our balcony. Management then told us she's diabetic or something and gets moody so ignore it.   The whole place is also horribly infested with cockroaches and nothing we did ever helped.   We did not get along with the maintenance people because they entered our patio without telling us a few times to do some work on the lights and also threw away a box I had up there when they did work on the lights. Once I caught one of them I caught looking into our bathroom window when I was home alone (no proof they were just working on the wall. Just creepy because I looked up, made eye contact and he suddenly left). We weren't friendly after that but not malicious either.   Also the landlord was always incredibly nosy and once entered our apartment without prior notice while we were in the bedroom doing things. When confronted she said she put the wrong paper under our door and just had to come in and get it. However she was in there for at least three minutes. I believe it could be longer because we didn't hear the door open. We heard our things being moved around. We were freaked out and didn't come out until she left.   Also the building is very old, so they're always under construction. When a yearly inspection was done, we were instructed not to talk about any issues to the people coming out to evaluate. The water is frequently turned off. The whole building is shifting, and our walls developed cracks while we lived there too. We didn't expect much. It's a bad area and cheaper than most places we could get into. We needed to move quickly and settled.   So here's where I need advice. Yesterday my boyfriend and I were moving furniture. We moved a few items (couches and futon) by the dumpster because we didn't need them. We have seen other tenants do this previously, but obviously just because everyone else is doing it doesn't make it right. A maintenance worker approached us as we were nearly finished saying to dump it up front, which yes is illegal. We said okay. We loaded some stuff onto our truck. We put the cushions and smaller item into the dumpster, which filled it up. The other things we would move later because we needed a break. So as we're leaving, another guy comes up and tells us again. We say ""yeah later we will; we were informed."" We leave to go drop our stuff off.   As we're coming back, we get a long email. It says that we were being fined for an hour of labor because they the maintenance guys moved the stuff back to the patio, for a fee to get the bulky items removed, and for a broken step to be repaired. Now this step was actually cracked before we got there. I have no photo evidence of that. It partially broke off as I was walking down WITHOUT furniture. I slipped a bit, but I have no injuries besides a preexisting injury hurting a little more than usual. However it doesn't look like I was hurt like no bruises or scratches. I took a photo where you can see it had been previously repaired because the part that didn't break off has a cemented over crack. Another lady is actually the person that broke the rest off and kicked the pieces down. However when we called the landlord, she said it was our fault because we hadn't used a dolly to carry couches down the stairs. Not sure how we would do that but okay. She said she had photo evidence of the items near and in the dumpster and that it obviously looked like we had dropped furniture on the step causing it to break. She said we only conveniently mentioned it broke before we carried furniture down it after being accused. It looks like a huge he said she said though because their story seems likely even though it didn't happen like that.   I went back today and all that was carried back up to the patio was cushions and the futon, not even everything. We arranged for bulky item pick up on Thursday. I also read over our lease and there's a clause that states we have to follow all rules they make and another saying if either party sues we have to pay up to $500 for their attorney fees.  So basically should I sue over it or suck it up and pay the fees? Because I understand that I probably can be charged for putting the furniture in the back even though I didn't really know. It still was our bad putting it back there. At the same time though we didn't break the step. The landlord is refusing to work with us, and since we already have a bad relationship with them, I don't think they will work with is. She hung up on us saying we were being uncivil for saying we're going to consult with a lawyer and that we didn't break anything and would have removed the items. Also if we sue we have to pay for their fees. This is a horrible situation and I still don't know the cost. We haven't even had a pre-move out inspection yet. I think they're going to try to screw us as much as they can. Do I have options?   If anything is unclear I can answer more in the comments. I have the emails of noise complaints, but most of the follow ups from management were verbal. I have a photo of the stairs partially broken. I have a photo of them repairing the stairs. I have a photo of half our items on the balcony."	No
1530	10 years ago I traveled to a far away state I didn't live in and was caught with a small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia. Of course the court date for the charge was months after I was caught, and by that time I had already returned to my home state. I was also very poor at the time and could afford neither a lawyer, court fees and fines, or the money it would have cost to travel back to the state. Over the years I had forgotten about it, but now I have remembered and I am wondering what will happen if I hire a lawyer to deal with the charges. Lets say I hire a lawyer and go to court to deal with the charge. When they convict me, how will that conviction look on my record? Will it show up as a conviction in 2017? How will this impact background checks for jobs? I know most checks only look to see convictions that have have occurred in the past 5/7/10/etc years. Will the fact that I waited this long to deal with it make it look like a crime that was recently committed, and hurt my chances to pass background checks? I have had background checks done since I was originally charged with possession, and had the warrant issued against me, but these never showed up on any of the checks.	No
1531	In December I bought a new house in a new neighborhood.  I received a copy of the CC&amp;Rs that made no mention of restrictions to street parking (in front of your house).  Yesterday, everyone received an email with an updated CC&amp;R document that among other things added the following restrictions...  &gt; Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall park and store Vehicles owned or in use  by such Lot Owner, tenant or occupant, either in the driveway or garage  appurtenant to the Lot owned and/or occupied by them.   &gt;Guests, invitees and licensees of any Int Owner, tenant or occupant shall likewise  park Vehicles in the driveway or garage appurtenant to such Lot Owner, tenant or  occupant's Lot.   &gt;Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall submit written request to  the ACC for permissible street parking to accommodate guests no less than  seventy-two (72) hours prior to any planned event, and as soon as reasonably  possible for unplanned events such as funeral visitation for example.   &gt;Any vehicle observed in violation of any part of these Rules and Regulations  whether continuously or within twenty-four (24) hours of the first observed  violation, shall be considered a continuation of the previous violation and thus, be  subject to the Enforcement provisions herein.  I wasn't aware that changes to the CC&amp;Rs could be made without a vote, but apparently the neighborhood hasn't been turned over to the HOA, and the developer can change them on whim until such time.  My three questions are, can the developer really change the CC&amp;Rs at will until the development is turned over to the HOA?  Can the HOA enforce parking rules on city owned streets?  What recourse do I have as a homeowner if I receive a fine from the HOA?  Thanks in advance for any feedback or advice.	No
1532	My fiance and I decided to move in together as her lease had expired and she had moved to a month to month. We met with her landlady (who until recently had previously lived upstairs) and signed a new 9 month lease (07/05/17). She made some revisions in pen and told us she would scan it and e-mail us a copy. The next day we were having an issue with the new upstairs neighbor and had to talk to them about space and noise. We messaged the landlady to let her know what happened on (07/08/17) and she told us we could talk about it on 07/13/17. Instead she stopped by the house when I was not home and served my finance with a 20 day end of rental notice. (which in Washington is all they need to end a month to month.) I asked her what happened to our lease and she said because we were unhappy she voided it and no longer wants us to rent there. Neither myself or my finance agreed to voiding the lease but she says she did and that her lawyer destroyed it. I am scrambling to put finances together so that we have a place moving forward, but this whole this is putting my finance and her 2 kids in immediate jeopardy. What should I do here?	No
1533	I have a roommate that is not on the lease and has caused damage in the room. I walked into his room the yesterday to take photos because he should be vacating by the 31st of July. I found a large hole in the bathroom and some other minor damage. I took photos and sent them to him asking if he can pay for the damages before leaving. He said he called the cops because my photo proves I was breaking and entering and he will have me arrested if I press for him to pay for damages. He also claims the cops told him he has the right to arrest me and have filed a report if he chooses to press charges.   There is no written agreement that he is part of the lease, and the apartment is solely in my name. I only went in to take photographs. My career is in serious risk if I am arrested for breaking and entering, and I need to know if he is bluffing or serious.  I have agreed to back off since he is essentially blackmailing me because he knows I have a lot to lose if I am arrested.   Thank you for your time and consideration.	No
1534	"I recently moved into a new apartment complex in a Houston, TX.   After touring the building with the leasing agent my gf and I asked every single question we could think of including several specific, easy to understand questions about the freight train lines that run close to the property.   I asked if there was a schedule the trains operated on, when the peak traffic hours were, and, most importantly, if the trains used the tracks and blew their extremely loud horns at night. The agent told me several times that train traffic was limited to, ""one or two in the morning and in the evening"". She assured me I would be able to get a peaceful nights rest. I thought I had done my due diligence. I was happy to be adulting.    I needed a place quickly so I reserved a unit and signed a lease a few weeks later.   Move in day rolls around and we get everything unpacked and put away like pros in less than 8 hours. During that time there had been a few trains (maybe 3 or 4) that had gone by and sounded their horns. It startled us at first but we were ok with it because we would be at work for a majority of the day.  That first night and every night since has been hell. We quickly discovered that the most active traffic hours for the train lines are from 1-6 in the morning. The trains blast their horns according to the Train Horn Rule: locomotive engineers must begin to sound train horns at least 15 seconds, and no more than 20 seconds, in advance of all public grade crossings. What was a loud but acceptable noise during the day turned into an impossibly loud blast of sound that has woken us up every single time a train goes by. One night I counted 15 trains between 1 and 6 am.   Is there anything I can do to get out of here? I spoke with the property manager the morning after moving in and she basically told me the agent I dealt with would never have said anything like that and I would be responsible for the full term of the lease were I to move out. I wouldn't have signed the lease had she truthfully disclosed the information I requested of her.   It's been about a week and a half since I moved in and I have been trying to get used to it. I'm a heavy sleeper and have lived near noisy things before. Believe me when I tell you the decibel level in my unit must be north of 85-90 each time these trains blow their horns. I haven't gotten any sleep since I've been here.   This is my first apartment out of college and I work close to 70 hours a week. I need a place where I can sleep. Any thoughts would be appreciated."

1535	Hello everyone,  I am a real estate agent. When I first began my career, I was quite naive and I signed a non-compete agreement because the firm claimed they had a number of trade secrets, incredible training, etc.   After receiving my first paychecks, I was quite disappointed, and I left for a different brokerage. My old firm's lawyer has now sent me a letter saying that I must stop or they will pursue legal action against me.   The non compete says that I cannot work for or operate within 25 miles of any of their offices. They have 4 office across the Detroit Metro region. The term is 2 years.  I know I knew what I was signing, but I had no idea it could hinder my career in this manner. A real estate agent's career depends on their sphere of influence and all of my SOi live around me. A 25 mile non compete puts me out of business for 2 years. I have to drive at least an hour and half to get to a firm outside this region. Furthermore, after interviewing with a number of firms, I have found that there really aren't any trade secrets in Real Estate. And many other firms have more robust training regimes with better splits, and every single one of them did not require a such a noncompete to be signed.   I called my state real estate legal hotline and the lawyer had no idea what to do because he had never hear of non compete agreements in our industry. Ditto with the executive officer of my board. They had never heard of such a thing in my field.   I am not sure what to do.   I can send a copy of that agreement and the letter they send me on request.	No
1536	I am looking to leave (flee, rather) my current employer and one of the opportunities I am presented is the same position with a competitor that is opening a new location.  Back in 2011, contingency of continued employment was a non-compete agreement of 1 year and I am uncertain of the scope of the 'area of coverage'.  This is specialty retail, so I'm not sure what could be considered 'protected information or practices' I could be taking with me. But clientele of this specialty visit most locations and I cannot imagine this not somehow getting back to my current boss if I were to leave and go to this competitor.  I doubt any action would be taken, but I do have a higher-than-most profile in this industry.  Kicker is, I am leaving because of a hostile work environment stemming from and sourced by the top of the food chain.  Berating, misplaced aggression, verbal abuse, swearing, I have documentation of instances that I could probably file a case and win with, but I'm not looking to sink a small business, just to keep myself from garnering a worsening mental state.  TLDR: If I am attacked over a non-compete, is a retort/defense of a hostile working environment forcing me to leave an acceptable legal defense?	No
1537	"Hi everyone. My 3 roommates and I sublet 2 rooms in an NYC apartment. Our ""landlord""/roommate agreed to renew our lease until the end of the year. We do not have this documented, only in a Facebook message. Our current lease ends on August 20th. On Monday, while he is in Russia, he sent us a Facebook message basically saying he may not renew his lease at this apartment and we may all have to move out by the end of the month. He did not give a reason other than that he is involved in court case currently and depending on how that goes he will either move or stay. We then came to find out he was or is being sued by the official landlord of the apartment. We aren't sure, though, if that is the case he is currently involved in. Our rent was due yesterday and we did not pay it. We didn't pay it because we need money to put towards our new apartment and he has a significant security deposit from the three of us. Also, he revealed he put our security deposit directly into his PERSONAL bank account, not into a separate one, which is what the law calls for I believe. He is now insisting we pay our rent saying he can't take it from the security deposit. We are not sure what to do about this situation or what our options are. He is still in Russia and should return by the 10th to appear in court. Thanks for any advice you can offer."	No
1538	Back story: My father-in-law has been trying to sell a rental property for quite a while, and is renting in the meantime. The house was fully renovated in 2014.  New tenants (as of 7/1/17) claim that there is lead paint chipping on one of the entryway doors. My father-in-law disputes this and has even had the home inspected by a reputable company. Both the inspector and his supervisor have confirmed that there is no danger of lead paint in the home. However, the tenants dispute their findings, citing a family member's observations as a reference.  Is my father-in-law obligated to rectify this in any way, given that he has already had the home inspected?  My father-in-law is elderly and in poor health, and I am concerned these tenants are trying to gain something from this.	No
1539	Hi there,  I'm going to be moving in with my SO, into a house that he owns, and I will be paying him rent. We live in Ontario. What are the laws like regarding cohabitation and how would things work if we get married? Does the money I put in for rent give me some sort of equity in the house? Also is there any kind of standard document that we could use for a rental agreement? Do we need to have a lawyer look over anything? Thanks in advance :)     Apologies if this has been posted before (please link if so) but searching on mobile is a nightmare!	No
1540	"So the 3 unit building I live in was sold, with my existing lease being transferred to the new owner. However, the new LL is looking to renovate the 3 apartments and turn them into top dollar apartments/condos.   The new LL has contacted me to discuss a buyout of my lease. I'm not necessarily happy about the prospects of moving as I love my location and have spent years here, and it's close to work.  All that being said, I don't want to live in a building with 2 apartments above me being gutted and redone, as we are the last tenants remaining in the building. If we could come to an agreement and both sides come away winners, I would be willing to make a deal.   I guess my question for you guys is what is the ""standard"" buyout in a situation like this? I know there is no ""standard"", but I'm looking to at least go into discussions with a ballpark figure and some type of explanation as to how I came up with that figure.  I have just over 24 months remaining on my lease. I live in a 3 Bdrm an expensive part of Boston. Avg 3 Bdrm is around 2800.  Any advice or past experience is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

1541	Hi! I have a quick tenant landlord issue. I currently live in Boston. A few weeks ago I agreed to move in with a new roommate. Her old roommate is moving out and she will be renewing the lease with me.   Today I found out that the broker is charging us $1000 for the new lease. I really don't want to pay the brokers fee. I selected this apartment because I wouldn't need to pay a broker.    Is this common for a broker to charge for a renewal? If so do I have any options to get out of it?   Thanks!	No
1542	Location: Tippecanoe County, Indiana (West Lafayette, zip code 47906)  Hello fellow Redditers,  I am having an issue with a girl I subleased my apartment to. It is an unofficial sublease and management does not know about it. There is a clause in the lease stating unofficial subleases are not allowed.  Basically what is happening is my tenant is 2 weeks late on rent and is avoiding any questions about it. I paid rent to my landlord, but have not been reimbursed for it. She is also ignoring my calls and texts, or says she is at work and cannot take my calls. She also lacks the common courtesy to return my calls once she gets off work. I have no idea what to do in this situation.    Additionally, the lease ends on August 2nd 2017 and if she is not moved out and has the keys turned in to the management, there is a $250 a day holdover charge. What options do I have to fix this situation?   There are agreements that have been made over text that I have a record of. However, I need advice on how to handle this predicament currently, and possibly legally in the future.  Thank you for your advice!	No
1543	"I recently moved to Cleveland for 6 months for a training stint with my company. Since my company was paying for my apartment, I had to find a furnished place that included all utilities, cable and internet.   I found a place that had everything I needed and had my company sign the lease. When I moved in I noticed the wifi was very slow. When I brought it up with the landlord, he said it goes up and down because my wifi comes through a booster that relays the wifi from the main house (I'm in an apartment above the garage). A couple weeks later I contacted him again because the internet was still always slow. He then said it was an issue with the ISP's infrastructure and they were paying for best package available so there's nothing they can do.  ""High speed internet"" is specifically listed as something to be provided by the landlord in my lease. The FCC defines high speed internet as 25Mbps and above. When I run speed tests I average 2-3Mbps, never higher than 5Mbps and often below 1Mbps. I don't need 25Mbps but what I'm getting is nowhere near what's expected.  I know this is a ""first world problem"" which is why I'm hesitant to escalate it with him, but it's frustrating not being able to watch netflix, FaceTime my family or watch YouTube without waiting forever for it to load. Even normal webpages takes  much longer than usual to load. It may not be water, heat or electricity, but I think reliable fast internet is fair expectation nowadays, especially when it's agreed upon in the lease.  What are my options?"	No
1544	A while back i had a leak in my slab floor that i had repaired by a plumber that went fairly well. submitted claims to my insurance and home warranty and everything was fine. soon after (2-3 weeks) the leak occurred again and i had the same plumber out to fix it. they never mentioned a bill and never gave me an estimate so i assumed it was part of the same repair. (the new leak was on the same pipe but further down , and within the area they drilled open in the slab) Unfortunately since i didn't know i was going to be charged for this like it was an entirely new problem i didnt let my home warranty company know so they claim it won't be covered.  I offered to pay the plumbers the bill minus what home warrenty would have covered but they didn't go for it. ($1500-$400 for $1100). they're threatening to sue for the bill plus legal fees. am i in the wrong here? Am i even required to pay whatever bill they give me if i'm never given an estimate or anything?  thanks for any advice you can give me.	No
1545	"We moved out of a rental house that we had been in for two years at the end of May. We did not leave this house in any sort of terrible state by any means, it for sure could have been cleaner but we were short on time due to moving complications in buying a new house(closing was delayed twice.)  Everything seemed normal at the move out day and keys were provided then the landlord said they would be in contact about the deposit and such. Well over a month went by and we had not heard anything, I reached out at this point and they apologized and said we would get a summary shortly. Several more weeks went by without response so another attempt was made to contact them, this time we got back an angry response how ""the receipts were still rolling in"" and they ""weren't sure how we thought there was any deposit left."" After that email I responded with with a request for the itemized list they were required to give us and challenged a few odd things mentioned like having the grout professionally cleaned and replacing the locks (we returned the keys.) I took videos when we moved in and they all show the state of the house when we moved in as not clean and the grout already being very dirty. I also challenged them charging us to replace carpet as it was not clean when we moved in and seemed to us that it needed replacement due to wear and tear. The response to this email was even more things listed removing things I mentioned and adding even more ""charges"" to justify the non-return of the deposit. This response also included two receipts both dated far outside of the fourteen day period they had to return our deposit.  Here in Arizona we have the ARLTA which seems to cover issues like this in this section here...  D. Upon termination of the tenancy, property or money held by the landlord as prepaid rent and security may be applied to the payment of all rent, and subject to a landlord's duty to mitigate, all charges as specified in the signed lease agreement, or as provided in this chapter, including the amount of damages which the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with section 33-1341. Within fourteen days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays or other legal holidays, after termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession and demand by the tenant the landlord shall provide the tenant an itemized list of all deductions together with the amount due and payable to the tenant, if any. Unless other arrangements are made in writing by the tenant, the landlord shall mail the itemized list and any amount due, by first class mail, to the tenant's last known place of residence. E. If the landlord fails to comply with subsection D of this section the tenant may recover the property and money due the tenant together with damages in an amount equal to twice the amount wrongfully withheld. F. This section does not preclude the landlord or tenant from recovering other damages to which the landlord or tenant may be entitled under this chapter. G. During the term of tenancy the landlord may use refundable security deposits or other refundable deposits in accordance with any applicable provisions of the property management Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act An Arizona Department of Housing Publication Page 15 agreement. At the end of tenancy, all refundable deposits shall be refunded to the tenant pursuant to this section. H. The holder of the landlord's interest in the premises at the time of the termination of the tenancy is bound by this section.  The advice I am seeking is confirmation for me really, I believe they violated subsection D here which would make it fall under subsection E, I am debating on filing in small claims court on this matter since they don't seem to want any part in coming to a mutual agreement. I believe its a violation as they did not provide anything within the fourteen days and what they seem to be holding the deposit for is for things done far outside that time as well as ongoing things.  Sorry I know its a lot of info and I tried to condense it as much as possible, I appreciate any advice given even if its simply contact an attorney."	No
1546	My boyfriend moved out about a month ago while I was staying with family. Some of the things he moved out were mine, things I paid for and never intended to gift him. Things like my mattress, Keurig, tv stand, sound bar, personal care and cleaning items, groceries, and art supplies. Pretty much anything he wanted that was mine, he took.  In May, he needed money to have his car fixed and I loaned him $5,000. I had him sign a basic contract stating this.  After he moved out and I realized he took my things, I contacted him about returning them. He's claiming he will pay me back for the items along with the loan. I admittedly called and texted him multiple times trying to get him to commit to returning my stuff.   This morning, I received an email that a hearing has been set for a protective order he filed against me. There isn't a protective order in place yet but it could happen. The only evidence he has against me is threatening to have him arrested for stealing my things and asking him to return my stuff. I definitely blew up his phone a couple times but I was trying to get my stuff and panicking about bills.  He always responded to my calls and texts and even texted and called me unprovoked a couple times over the last couple weeks. I want to fight the protective order but don't know how the hearing will go. My ex is currently on probation for a domestic battery against his last girlfriend but I don't know if that will matter.   We're also on a lease together but from what I've heard, I'm pretty much going to have to eat his half of the rent, utilities, etc.   What do I do? How do I go about preparing for the protective order hearing? I don't want to not be able to contact him because I want him to return my stuff. Should I take the $5,000 loan to small claims? He really screwed me over and I feel like he keeps finding ways of avoiding his obligations. Thanks in advance for any advice, I really appreciate it.	No
1547	"They keep referring to it as ""policy change"", but they have, in reality, altered the essence of the service provided: I have signed a contract for unlimited data for a certain price, and now they're charging me the same price for a limited amount of data.   They have issued a notice around New Year's saying that they intend to do so; I have immediately called their customer service and said that I do not accept that type of service to which they have told me that the """"new policy"" is not being rolled out yet"""" so basically to chill since is not impacting me any time soon. I have just logged into my account to discover that the data cap has been imposed for some time now without anyone contacting me after my declining of the altered service.  Does this qualify as a breach of contract given that I have specifically declined any alteration to my contract?   Again, they keep saying that it's a ""change in policy"" which, based on their standard contract terms they have the right to update, but I see it as a change in service provided since I'm now getting less for the money I'm paying and I specifically disagreed to take that cut. Thanks guys!"	No
1548	Hello,   I am from Korea where car seat laws are pretty lax. While most people choose to use car seats, there is no law requiring them, so many people will often just hold their babies in their laps while riding in taxis or buses, etc.  I'll be travelling to Boston and staying there for a month this fall, and I'm wondering about car seat rules for my one year old. I will be using a car seat for my everyday rental car, but what about taxis, commuter rail, subway, shuttle buses etc?  From what I read on the internet, it seems like Americans are really strict about car seat laws, so I don't want to do anything to upset CPS or the police.   Will I be in legal trouble if I don't use a car seat on the taxi or shuttle bus at their airport. And what are the standards when travelling with a baby by subway or commuter rail? Is it okay to just hold the baby in my lap?   I did do a quick google search which told me that car seats were not required on taxis, but I wasn't sure if the site was trustworthy.  Thank you so much in advance!	No
1549	On mobile, throwaway, first time posting, etc etc.   So I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada on vacation. I'm originally from Alberta Canada. Tonight me and a group of girls went out for some Asian fusion. Unfortunately I am anaphylactic to peanuts. I carry meds in case of a reaction and always tell the waitress of my allergy.   So at dinner we decided to let the server just bring us food that would end up totalling $40-50 each and sharing instead of each ordering something individually. I told her at the beginning that I am severely allergic to peanuts. This allergy includes peanut oil. Server says great she understands. Awesome.   So our food comes out, one dish being chicken satay. I double check with the server that dropped it off (not our waitress) that the satay does not have peanuts. He says nope, it does not. Great! He said the dressing in the salad (which wasn't on our table yet) might have peanuts and he'll go check. So I start dishing up. I use chopsticks to put some veggie dumplings on my plate. I then grab some other food and eat it. Notice an immediate allergic reaction. Not awesome.   The waitress then hurries over and says don't eat the dumplings as they are cooked in peanut oil. Unfortunately I used the same chopsticks to pick up the dumpling as I did to eat something else. So serious cross contamination. We call the hotel paramedic and an ambulance. I spend about three hours in the hospital for observation. I gave myself my epipen and Benadryl at the restaurant. They gave me prednisone at the hospital. Had an IV and fluids given.   My question is do I have any grounds to sue? I'm pretty pissed since we're here on vacation and I felt like shit. I do have travellers insurance so the hospital stay will be covered by them. I'm really just curious what my options are. Thanks!  TLDR; told restaurant about peanut allergy, served food with peanuts, spent evening in the hospital emerg.	No
1550	My 12 month original lease is scheduled to end on October 22nd. The apartment complex gave me a written notice of increased rent on August 4th saying my rates were going up. My understanding is I only have to give 30 days notice to vacate but my contract says I have to give 60. Is this enforceable? I'm still unsure if I plan on renewing or not so I don't want to give my notice quite yet.	No
1551	So, I went on a date last week that ended up with me and the girl making out in my car. She had stated that she didn't want to have sex and I agreed. We made it pretty heavily for about twenty minutes and she started pulling on her clothes and said she wanted to go inside. I said okay and she kissed me and told me to text her when she got home. I got home and texted her and she responded hours later saying that she thought I was disgusting and never wanted to see me again. I just had a missed call from the police saying they wanted to talk to me about the incident. I have never been involved with the police ever. What do I do?	No
1552	A little back story here. I was given two tickets, a ticket for stunt driving and ticket for driving without consideration. Me and some friends were out in the industrial area of our town late at night(no houses in the next 10km). It's a pretty well known area of our town for people to come down and drift or race there cars . Cops have come there before and usually just make sure no one is drinking and driving, or say to go home, I've never seen a ticket issued. So at about midnight I was doing some doughnuts. We saw some head lights coming down the road, I moved into the parking lot and shut my car off. The officer drove behind me and turned his lights on saying he saw me burning out my tires ( there was over 10 people there all drifting in the same colour of car, could have been anyone of us but I'm owning the situation here). It was also raining so sound of tire squeal would be minimal. I got my car impounded for ten days, $200 driving without consideration ticket (which I disputed), a stunting ticket which I was unable to dispute, had to pay $600 in impound fees, and lost my license for 60 days. I feel I was treated excessively as this was my first ever ticket, no one was in danger or at risk, we've been verbally told to come down there if we want to do things like this by one officer instead of harming people on the streets. There's my spiel any help would be great .	No
1553	Hey Legal Advice, I'm working on putting together a crafts business.  I know I need to register for a business license/tax ID from the state, but it's not clear to me if I also need to trademark my business name federally.  It's an extra fee I'd sort of prefer not to incur, and I am not making unique enough things to worry about copycats.  If I were to start selling unique patterns or instructions, I would definitely trademark. Mostly, I'm looking forward to a tax-ID that allows me to pay wholesale/tax free for supplies.   I have verified that my company name is not taken (in VA or on the federal database), so that is not the issue.  If anyone can provide clarification, I would appreciate it.	No
1554	I'm asking on behalf of my friend, so I may have some details incorrect.    As part of my friend's divorce agreement, he co-signed on his ex-wife's lease for a new apartment.  My friend has never resided in the apartment, and in fact lives out of state.  The initial year is over, and he no longer wants to be on the hook for this, however he is being told that since he was on the original lease, he must remain on any future leases if she is to remain in the apartment.  Is this true?  Does he have any recourse to have himself removed from the lease without her moving?  Thank you!	No
1555	I'm finding a lot of different answers when searching for a definitive answer through google. My best guess is that it is legal unless they are under 16, in which case the vehicle must be going 25 mph or slower. Besides the overall legality of it, are their stipulations? Like a maximum speed limit, number of passengers, etc?	No
1556	"Hey everyone,   For one year I rented one bedroom in an apartment unit that was owned by my then roommate and his family in Manhattan, NY. I rented directly from them and I initially put down a security deposit of $1,400.00, which is equivalent to one months rent. While living there, I took on a small DIY project and mounted my TV to the wall in my bedroom. It was my first time doing it, and I ended up making six holes all one inch in diameter in a sheetrock wall. Before I vacated the apartment on January 7th, I repaired the wholes to the best of my ability with some spackle and drywall tape. Again, it was my first time repairing drywall holes so it could have looked a bit better.   On the move out day my roommate and I made a verbal agreement that he would use the money from the security deposit to have the holes patched up professionally if he chose to, and then return the remaining money in the security deposit to me. My father was present during this interaction, witnessed our mutual understanding of the agreement and watched us shake hands.   After eight months my former roommate won't answer any inquires on the verbal agreement. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point, but my plan is to take him to small claims court. I've read that it verbal agreements can hold up in court, but it's hard to prove and I'm also worried about how language of the lease. It states that: ""the lessor is responsible for the cost of all repairs to the apartment except for damage to the apartment caused by lessee, the costs of which damage shall be the responsibility of the lessee. A roommate who damages the personal property of the other roommate is responsible for the cost of repairs of that property."" I'm not sure that he as the lessee is obligated to return the remaining about of the security deposit.  So far I've recently sent him a certified letter detailing our verbal agreement and asking him to fulfill it. It has a return receipt and I plan to use it in court as evidence of contacting him. I also plan to have my father testify as a witness to the verbal agreement, and subpoena the signed lease since I just can't seem to find my copy. What do y'all thing? Do I have a case in NYC small claims court. Thank you so much in advanced!"	No
1557	As it says in the title, I received a ticket for doing 70 in a 55, but I just looked at the ticket and the name and home address were of a complete stranger from another city. The car information on the ticket is correct, and everything else seems to be correct.  My question is this: Does this mean the ticket can be dismissed? Also is the stranger now in legal trouble? What do?	No
1558	Hello everyone,  I am moving into my first apartment this fall near my University.  I signed a lease for a two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend last November.  On the lease it says that we can move in on August 19th.  Every other apartment complex we've heard of in this town, including his current apartment, ends their lease on July 31st and begins the following year's lease on August 1st.  This lease has us move in on August 19th and move out on July 31st.  While this is frustrating because he is without an apartment for the first part of August, we understand that we screwed up and signed for a later date.  The landlord wants the cost of an entire month, $569, due on August 1st even though we are only allowed to begin moving in on the 19th.  We have asked them to move in earlier since we are already paying the cost of a month and nobody will be in the apartment, but they have said no.  My parents think this is illegal.  Is it actually illegal?  This is in Iowa. Thank you!	No
1559	Sometimes we go out drinking in places like the forest where there are no trash containers.  The back of my truck is generally filled with other stuff.  I don't like to litter.  I also don't want to risk hitting a bump and a trash bag with 47 empty beer and wine bottles flying out of the back of the truck and maybe killing some poor motorist behind me.  So is it OK to put them in the back passenger seat of the truck if all of the bottles are empty?  Or am I likely to get 47 open container violations?	No
1560	I have been granted a temporary order of protection against an individual who is borderline delusional and 100% stalking me. The day before I changed my phone number, he sent me 89 texts alone (not counting Facebook messages, e-mails) and this person was also calling my home and cell phones from blocked/anonymous numbers.  I've changed the numbers and subscribed to TrapCall to prevent more anonymous calls, and had my phone company block his phone number and all numbers I know to be associated with him. A few weeks ago, I set my phone to automatically reject all calls with blocked called ID...the problem is, only the ones I answered showed up on my phone bill and those that did show up, are listed as restricted/withheld. The hearing to make the protective/no contact order permanent is scheduled for August 15... is there anyway to obtain this person's phone records to do it?  Also, this individual put a tracking app on my phone and has been monitoring every text, call and google search I make for who knows how long...except of course I can't prove it was him. This is so frustrating. The burden of proof should NOT be on the victim. Just looking for any suggestions or ideas that might help me prove to the judge why the order should be permanent. Thanks.	No
1561	I'm trying to get on disability (height is 4'10 with a few mental disorders that have been left untreated, and 27 years old). The only diagnosis that I have are over 10 years old. It feels like I've developed another disorder as I feel like I can't go outdoors and have trouble completing my job because of this. I know that you have to have documentation of your disorders to get on disability but without insurance, I can't readily get up-to-date diagnoses. What is it that you guys recommend?	No
1562	[CT] Hello, My mom had a bill from her dentist which was sent to collections. The dentist told her she would have to pay both the bill and the collections fee. So my mom pay the fee through the collections, but has not received a bill for the fee the dentist hired for collections. Will she receive a notice about this or is everything set? She no longer goes to this dentist.	No
1563	"My sister recently passed away under some bothersome circumstances in police custody, and as a result, my family has been involved in a lawsuit regarding her death. This lawsuit is nearly over, and everything is about to be finalized. We were recently informed that my father is legally entitled to request his own share of the settlement. Naturally, this has caused a collective ""WTF"" among my family. Here are some key points:  * My sister died unexpectedly and left no will. * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate. * My father isn't attached to or associated with this lawsuit in any shape or form. * My father has dodged child support for well over a decade, and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail several times over this. * My father hasn't had any contact with my family since 2003; nor has he made any attempts to make any contact, in any form. The last time we saw him was when he showed up to my sister's funeral for approx. 10 minutes, and left. * My father made no attempt to help arrange, plan, or pay for my sister's funeral service."	No
1564	There must be some limit between the end of the 3 day notice and when I submit the eviction request to the court.  This is the first time I'm a bit behind on having the paper work completed.	No
1565	I recently quit a debt collection company.  When I was hired roughly 6 months ago they made me sign an employment contract for 1 year with the term that if my employment ceased before the terms of the contract that i would owe the company an amount of money that would diminish over the course of the contract. I just got my final paycheck and it has a letter saying that I still owe them an amount to buy-out my contract and gives the remaining amount due.   The letter also says that authorized per the employment agreement and allowed by federal and state laws, that they reduced my pay for the final 2 paychecks to minimum wage and applied to the amount I owed (they sent both of my final pay periods on once check for some reason or another)  I was wondering what I should do next and if this contract itself has any legal weight. I asked when signing the contract and upon leaving if I could see or get a copy of the contract and I was denied.  So as to the specifics of the contract I'm not really sure what it says. I also know that employers can garnish your wages but I though they had to notify you and go through the legal process first.  I live in the state of Nebraska  (This is my first post so please be gentle)	No
1566	"In October, our roof started leaking. We live in a townhome, and the roof is covered under the HOA. They sent roofers out who ""fixed"" it.   It has leaked 5 times since then. Each time it gets fixed. Today during a heavy downpour it was leaking AGAIN. Same spot every time. I want the ceiling opened and checked for mold, as well as repainted. The carpeting should also be checked for mold, since there are times it has leaked and we have not been home to put towels down. Can we make the HOA provide this?  The water also rained down on an (expensive) printer that may need to be replaced, is there any way to get them to replace it?   The roof is approximately 17 years old. Rumor has it that the HOA knows they will need to start to replace them, but does not have the money to do so. What can we do. We live in Florida and it's the summer now so heavy rainstorms are an every day occurrence. We just want it fixed properly."	No
1567	"So my roommates and I have an apartment in upstate New York. The lease ended July 19th, but the apartment complex that we lived at automatically extended our lease for an extra month, to August 20th.  Their reason being that we did not let them know that we were moving out at least 60 days before the lease ended. We were given a paper with three options, and I checked the option that said ""I will not be renewing my lease. Please send me your notice to vacate form."" And i also signed this document (I am the one that is in control of the apartment) This was May 19, 2017.  We had told them that we would be moving home (this is a college apartment) and would be back July 15 to sign any forms and to move our stuff out. On July 1st, I called to check what the prorated rent cost would be, since it's not the full month, and was told that the lease was extended one month because we had not given them notice that we were moving out at the end of the lease. I argued saying that that was not true, I had spoken with someone, and turned the form in, but she basically said ""Too bad we can't do anything about it""  The only thing that the lease states is that ""advanced notice needs to be given to move out"".   And is it even legal that they can just extend the lease and not tell us at all?   Thank you"	No
1568	My boyfriend came home from work today to find a Comcast service guy hanging out in our bedroom. Or rather, the guy SAID he was from Comcast, but he wasn't wearing a uniform or anything to identify him with Comcast, and his truck was unmarked. He didn't have an ID badge or anything. My boyfriend freaked out and told the guy to get out.   Our property manager left a note on our door on July 6 saying that Comcast services would be coming by on July 7. We were concerned about a tech being in our apartment unsupervised while we were both at work, so the manager said she would have the maintenance guy oversee the service call. We were still apprehensive, but we know the maintenance manager and trust him, so we thought it would be fine.   July 7 came and went. We came home from work and hadn't seen any Comcast person. We didn't know if anyone had come or not. Our management, as you can see, is terrible about communication.   Note: we did not request Comcast to come out. We already have our internet service all set up with Comcast--this is our complex's service setup.   Our lease does say that management has access to our apartment for maintenance and such, but I was under the impression that the law in Utah says that they must give us 24 hours' notice. Notice was given that they would be coming three days ago, but the visit today was completely unexpected and unwelcome.   Also, he broke a shelf on our bookshelf when he moved it to do his work, tracked mud onto our brand new rug, had his grimy work gear all over our bed, and left sawdust all over the place.  So one, the tech was here 3 days after they said he would be. Two, he was unsupervised. Three, he wrecked our stuff. This feels like a huge violation.   Our downstairs neighbors were not home when the tech came to their unit, but they said he left a huge mess, left the lights on, their furniture was moved around, and again, sawdust everywhere.   Do we have any recourse? The manager has been unresponsive so far. We do have renters insurance. Our main concern is this violation of them letting just anyone barge into our place with no/inadequate notice.	No
1569	"I have been living in the condo that my mother owns, as well as helping her (she's disabled) for the past 3 years. I help pay her mortgage and HOA fees. I have a young Corgi dog that really likes attention from people, and he sometimes barks at other dogs and people out of excitement. He's the sweetest dog, and has never bitten anybody or any other animal. Who could hate a Corgi? I received notice last month that several people have complained about my dog, and that he appears ""vicious"" and ""aggressive"" but I have yet to get any sort of proof of this, not even a log of the occurrences or dates/times of these incidences. I purposely avoided taking him to the dog run (where dogs pee and poop) and I also avoid the main lobby where people could possibly come in contact with him. I also signed him up for an obedience class to help with the barking. I did this to appease the complainers, not because he is actually vicious or aggressive. If someone is afraid of dogs they might see a barking dog and complain. He is kept on a short leash at all times.  I have now received a letter from the lawyer of the condo association that they want me to sign, which states that I agree that my dog is a nuisance and aggressive and if he so much as barks unprovoked, bites, or ""makes someone retreat from him"" he will be removed from the building within 24 hours. I didn't sign it. Because he's not aggressive and has not or has ever been. Barking does not equal aggressive.  I reviewed the condo docs and there is a clause that states that ""any dog that is a nuisance must be removed"", but it doesn't clearly define nuisance. And again, a lot of dogs bark at other dogs. And there are many other dogs at this condo that bark. What legal rights do I have in this case - can they actually make me remove him without any proof?"	No
1570	Hey all,  Did not see this in the list of threads or with a search, but forgive me if something similar has been posted....  I was recently involved in an at-fault accident when I backed into a coworker's car. I am hoping to resolve this out-of-pocket and want to ensure that I am taking the correct steps. Below is some information:  * State: MA * Total damage to other car: $1,500 (dent in BMW so bit more $$$ than I hoped for) * Other party was not in the vehicle * Insurance deductible is $500 but filing a claim will add 3 pts to my driving record, which already includes a speeding ticket from last May  Ultimately I am worried about my rates going up and I would rather take the hit to my bank account now than deal with the headache on my insurance record.   After doing some research, I am looking to have my coworker sign a *Release of Claims* and was hoping someone might be able to tell me if this is the correct step to take to close out the incident once payment is given. If so, is there a particularly well-formatted template to use, and does it vary by state?  Also, if there is anything else that I should be getting in terms of documentation please feel free to suggest. I do not expect the other party to swindle me into more money, but I also would rather be safe than sorry. I appreciate the help!   **TL;DR** - Had an at-fault car accident, will pay out-of-pocket but want to ensure that the incident is finalized with a Release of Claims.	No
1571	"A former tenant, a married couple, have filed a restraining order against my father in law, claiming he harassed them by driving past their home. The woman further claimed that she was afraid of him, because he was acting crazy and laughing maniacally.   All of this is so drastically out of character for my FIL, that I believe they filed this out of spite to inconvenience him, or maybe even as a means to another end.   He had to evict them because they stopped paying rent and strung him along with promises of payment and the occasional payment of less than 10% of what they owed. He tried to work with them for about 6 months before he filed for eviction.   They rented two small commercial offices in a small town building. They contested the eviction, but then settled for being granted a few more weeks and in turn agreed to a payment plan, which afaik they have not honored.   When they finally moved out, the places weren't in great shape, but there was nothing obviously malicious.   However, they did claim at that time already towards a deputy, that he had been harassing them by tearing apart their shop sign and screaming at them. I do not believe for a second that he would scream at any person ever, and he probably did not tear apart their sign, because he could produce it intact immediately. But, he had gone there and taken it down when he posted a for-rent sign.   When they found new places, the owners called him for a reference. He is fairly active in the community, and many people know him. He did describe exactly what happened to the owners, and it is fairly likely that they lost their not yet signed lease because of that call.   Now, the restraining order is actually a problem, because it appears that the woman has found a new place within 500ft of his property. So when he goes in to show it, he would be violating the restraining order, if I understand everything correctly. I could also imagine that they're trying to somehow trick him into violating it, just out of revenge, or maybe even to establish a pattern for yet another frivolous suit later. I have personally not met them or witnessed anything, but again, everything they described in the restraining order does not fit at all to his character.   Now, my question is what would be the sensible steps to take?   He wants to go to the DA's office, and ""explain the situation"". I wouldn't think that would really achieve anything. (Though, maybe it would, because he might actually know someone in that office.).  I suggested he let his attorney handle it, who negotiated the payment plan with them. But really, right now he doesn't know how to effectively react, he's running more on instinct, which might just be wasting time."	No
1572	"Hey everyone, not expecting to get a ton of feedback on this but anything would be appreciated. So let's get started. My mother is currently renting out a house on the property of her landlord and long story short they made a ""verbal agreement"" that her contract would only last six months. Welllllllll the ACTUAL contract says that the lease is terminated when both parties agree on a termination date. So, no set date but seems kind of odd. Six months is approaching as of July 30th but the landlord is stating that my mother cannot move out and must continue to rent from her because she ""needs to protect herself"" by attempting to force my mother to continue to rent. My mother is trying to leave on said date above but is worried that the contract is binding her and she is forced to live here until the landlord deems that she may go. The landlord has since ceased to respond to my mother or attempting to work anything out and is straight up ignoring her now. Any suggestions or insight on how legal any of this is or how stuck my mother actually is? Can the landlord legally obligated her to continue renting because of he contract wording? Thanks in advance."	No
1573	"So I'm not sure what to do as I have never experienced something like this before.  I waited for the walk sign to turn on and went when it said to.  This girl was taking a left turn and ran right into me.  She stopped and asked if I was okay which I replied, ""I think so."" Because I was in shock, I probably didn't do everything right.  She gave me her business card and left.  A couple of witnesses called 911 and stayed with me.  The cop said she did everything right and that it was an accident, although she was at fault.  She said the sun was in her eyes.  My question is, do I have any grounds to get compensation for the anxiety this accident has caused me?  I already have bad anxiety issues and this has exacerbated it.  Also, I had to spend 6 hours in the ER, I am assuming her car insurance is going to foot the bill?  Any suggestions for next steps are greatly appreciated."	No
1574	A vehicle was stopped in the road. He then began driving very slowly. I decided to cross the double yellow line and pass him. Lucky for me a cop saw me and ticketed me. I explained he was driving like an asshole but she said it was a no passing zone. I want to plead not guilty as I can just barely afford the $170 ticket. Any professional input is much appreciated!

1575	I have a tenant is a 2 family apartment that cannot pay rent. We live in 1 of the units. His lease is until august 2018 ( it was just renewed). His old lease expires at the end of this august. He has only paid in full &amp; on time once in his 8 month stay. I know I should not of renewed the lease. He just informed me that he cannot pay August and I know he probably won't have September rent.  From experience working in the court system, summary process I think will take a very long time, become expensive, and I doubt I will recoup my rent.  I am thinking of offering to give up augusts rent and give the tenant until the end of September to find a place. He will not have to pay September since he paid last months rent. Basically tell him to use this time and whatever money he would of paid rent to find another place. Ideally I want to just part ways.  If we both sign an agreement to terminate the lease, will that be legally binding? For example let's say we sign, but he doesn't move out at the end of September, could I begin the eviction process then as a tenant at will?  Thank you for reading	No
1576	As many of you know, Augusta is home to the Masters Golf tournament, which occurs during the first week in April. I am currently renting a room in a four bedroom house. My landlord also happens to live in one of the bedrooms.   A provision in my lease states that I have to temporarily move out for the first week in April so that the homeowner can rent out the house for the Masters. This involves me moving all of my personal belongings, an endeavor that will be extremely time consuming.   I had no issues with this provision when I signed  the lease because I believed that the rent / utilities for that month would be prorated to reflect my absence during Masters Week. However, I have come find out that my landlord expects me to pay my rent in full for April, as well as the utilities in full during this month while she simultaneously profits of both me and her Masters Week guests and effectively renders me homeless for the week.   I do not believe this is fair at all. Do I have any legal recourse in the state of Georgia?	No
1577	Hi, I'm here seeking for legal advice.   On 19/4 I was asked by my supplier via email to pay for a certain invoice amounting to $2500.  On 22/4 the supplier emailed me again, saying his bank is 'auditing' his bank account, and the bank advised him not to accept any payment from his customers. He asked me to bank in the money to another bank account.   Of course, up to this point, I believed everything he said.  Then on 29/6, my boss received a call from the supplier, saying they did not receive our payment.   I then sent them the email correspondence between us and the payment details to them. Their accounts guy then told me his email got hacked, and he did not ask me to pay to a second bank account.   Now, they're demanding that we pay them the amount we owe, even though we did what was instructed by their emails. They're threatening to go to court if we do not pay.	No
1578	"Basically, my boyfriend and I are looking at places to live. We found somewhere on Craigslist that is being rented. To be somewhat vague, he and I emailed the husband and wife. They responded saying that they are in Africa ""running an organisation"" doing religious stuff, i'm not sure. They basically said their previous property manager wasn't working out, so they decided to rent it out on their own.  Next thing they said in the email is that the documents and keys are with them and they can send the keys, which would take 16 hours FedEx, after receiving a deposit  and they will refund the deposit if we do not like the inside and do not want to live there. (Also included application questions, basic stuff, no confidential information asked for)  They provided an international phone number and said we could call if we have questions and they would call if we weren't able to call them. I had them call me and earlier in the day the phone call came from a number that said ""Russia"", but then later when I was able to answer, it was the number they provided in the email and caller ID thing said it was from Africa.   I asked my questions and ended by asking if there is any way to identify them just to make sure it is legitimate and he said there is no one local here to identify them. I told him we want to drive by and look at it tomorrow and he said we could email him afterward.  I'm not sure if this is legitimate and I don't even know if this is the place to post this, but i'm just trying to figure this out for the both of us.  Sorry for such a long post, but thank you for taking the time to read it."	No
1579	Hey! Long time lurker, first time poster.  I got pulled over tonight because my headlight and tag light are out. Fair enough, I knew my headlight was out and my fiancé was planning to help me fix it tomorrow. Unfortunately, I forgot my wallet at home this morning, so I didn’t have my license on me.  The officer cited me for not having my license because it’s “easy to deal with” - however, I’m a teacher and I’m at work all of the times the courthouse is open. I’d have to take a full day off (nigh impossible during testing season) to go to the courthouse and pay 10 dollars.   I don’t want my kids to miss any instruction - my days are thoroughly planned to make sure they get what they need before the state tests. If I just pay the 116 dollar fine without going to the courthouse, does it look any different on my record?	No
1580	"After almost two years of giving the landlord the benefit of the doubt and not making serious repairs, we finally draw the line. City inspectors come out and say it's serious. The city is filing criminal charges. Now we're waiting on the magistrate's decision on how much rent we get back out of escrow because they say they can't make the repairs.  Three times in the last two weeks, twice before the hearing, and once after, associates of the landlord have stopped by to ask us to leave. Now we have a notice that they're going to enter the premises today and tomorrow, and that it would be convenient for them if the house is empty. (delivered to a minor daughter) As far as I can tell, Ohio law states that once we've filed for escrow, they can't ask us to leave.  The wife is writing a letter to the magistrate as we speak, outlining what she believes is a serious transgression.   My only concern is that the judge is going to think we're just digging for money or something. But I think, as we've payed on time diligently for two years and have given them wayyyy more latitude with repairs than most would, we're probably on the safe side.   Should I be asking for something specific? Cease and desist? Protection order? Or just leave it as extra information to add to the case?  The letter is ""signed"" by the landlord even though he's out of the country for three more weeks. The requests for continuance were also ""signed"" in such a manner. Should I press the issue of forgery?  If they do try to enter the premises, am I right to tell them to f%^&amp;* off? and call the police?"	No
1581	"I previously made a /advice thread a few weeks ago asking how to approach this situation.  Background info:  We moved in to a new construction home in May. Our next door neighbors have been in their home for around two years. They have a split rail fence along the property line. We had the builder include a split rail fence around our property as part of the purchase of our home. The builder connected our fence to the existing fence our neighbor has on our shared property line.  We received an email several weeks ago from our neighbors asking us to pay a half portion of the cost of the fence they have had up for two years (the part of the fence we are sharing). They are asking for $625.50.  As suggested in the /advice thread, we responded to the neighbors stating that we would not be retroactively paying for the cost of the shared portion of the fence.  We would however contribute to 50% of any maintenance and repairs.  We wrote a super friendly email.  Fast forward to today, and we receive a super passive aggressive email from the neighbors:  *Thanks for the disappointing reply about the cost sharing. The argument of an established structure ""for quite some time"" is without basis. All of the construction here is new, and per the covenants, fencing should be completed within 6 months of move in. That pretty much dictates that the first people here have to get the job done and work with the adjoining neighbors once they arrive. Our landscaping was done last September, which isn’t exactly “quite some time” ago. The point is, you are benefiting from the fence now and you own some responsibility for the expense. When you enclose your property in part by utilizing another's fence, that is on the shared property line, you are expected to reimburse the neighbor for half of the expense for the part you are using. That does include future maintenance as well. There are a couple of Colorado Statutes that speak to the concept. Would you mind if we removed our shared section? That could create some liability for you given your deep uncovered window wells. We were not part of your negotiations with the builder and can only look to you as the owners benefitting from the fence. Certainly, Builder only charged you for the actual linear feet that they installed. They have nothing to do with our shared linear footage. You have every right to ask the people behind you to contribute half of what you paid Builder, directly or indirectly, for that common fence. No one can force you to do the right thing even if it does come at the expense of having good relationships with the people within this wonderful neighborhood. Hopefully, we can discuss further.*  So my questions: 1. Do such statutes that she referenced actually exist?  I can't find any. 2. If so, is our neighbor right, and do we have to pay? 3. What did we do in our former lives to deserve this person as a neighbor? 4. What would you do?  We don't want them throwing antifreeze tainted meat at our dog.  Thanks for reading this far, and I appreciate any advice that you might have!"	No
1582	I moved into an apartment complex 3 years ago. Since then they have continually raised the rent, which I know happens in a lot of cases, however many of the amenities that they advertised upon me signing my lease were not available.  The ftness center has been closed for 2.5 years, the pool was closed all last summer, and the laundry center has been under construction and  not available due to them renovating the property for about two and a half of those years.   They kept telling me those amenities would come back but now their website does not have them listed. I took screenshots of the website and I've been taking pictures of the property continually for the past 3 years. Do you think that there's any way that I can obtain retroactive rent abatement in small claims court?	No
1583	I'm in a dispute with a landlord whose home I moved out of and kept half of my deposit for damages he claims were made when I was there. On a hunch, I called the Maryland Landlord/Tenant office and apparently they don't have him registered as operating with a license.  Are there penalties or repercussions for him operating w/o a license? I imagine this would help me in my case when I present it to landlord/tenant court? But I want to report him to make sure he doesn't do this to other people as well.	No
1584	So I was sleeping, when I was awoken by loud banging at the door at 3:20 AM.  It was a 24 hour maintenance crew from our apartment complex and he said that our apartment was leaking water. Upon hearing this we turned on our lights, and saw that the bathroom was flooded with about and inch or water, and it had progressed to some of the carpet. After we allowed the maintenance in, we started placing towels everywhere to soak up as much water as possible and cranked up the heat to help dry out the carpets.  The maintenance said that our water heater was old, and overtime rusts on the bottom and he believes that is why it broke and leaked water everywhere. We have  $100,000 of Personal liability coverage which protects you financially (up to the policy limit), if you are responsible for damages to your unit as a result of fire, smoke, explosion and in most states water damage. If you accidentally start a fire you will be responsible for damages to your unit and damages to your neighbor's unit and their personal property. A liability policy will pay for these damages up to policy limit.  My question is we ARE NOT responsible for these damages because we didn't cause the water heater to break so will we need to file an insurance claim for this, even though we did not cause the damage or reason for the damage (water heater breaking)?    Sorry if there are any errors, I was just asleep 20 minutes ago, and am dealing with this as we speak.	No
1585	Location: US - IOWA   Hello legal advice I live in an apartment and my complex is going through a huge remodeling. I received a notice about 2 1/2 weeks ago that said people will be in my apartment doing construction from 8-5 anytime for two weeks. They were behind schedule and I just received an additional notice for another week.  It's Thursday now and they have until tomorrow to finish and there is not a chance they will finish tomorrow.   Anyways, my entire kitchen has been on the ground for a 3 weeks. Most likely they will not finish until a week or two from now. So it will be at 4-5 weeks. I don't come home from lunch anymore because they could be there anytime from 8-5.  It's been a nightmare and I am not alone in this. All of the first floor apartments are going through this.   I'm asking for myself, but I am also asking for everyone at my complex going through the same issue. Thanks a lot in advance	No
1586	"... My friend is not on the mortage though and she and her sister made a verbal agreement that as long as my friend pays the property taxes, the sister will pay the mortage. My friend and her 13 year old daughter are the ones who live in the house.

1587	"As title says, I have lived in my house for just under a year. I began noticing an area in the back corner of my backyard was slowly eroding away every time it rained, and more recently the hole has grown to a very large size. In my closing documentation, it states that proper drainage was installed ""per Home Owner Warranty Act"" however clearly this is not the case, as every time it rains the water is slowly taking the earth away with it.    I have reached out to the builder with basically no luck, and all they have offered to do is fill the hole in with dirt for a ""cheaper"" price than what the going rate would be for a local contractor, but mentioned nothing about fixing the root cause, which is improper drainage. I brought out another independent contractor to evaluate the situation, and he pretty much told me the situation was pretty bad and gave me a quote for several thousand dollars to fix.    Do I have legal grounds to bring a lawsuit upon the builder? It has been under a year and this problem was brought on strictly due to there not being proper drainage in my lawn. Additionally, as the ground has eroded away, large chunks of concrete have been revealed, alluding to the builder just throwing all sorts of rubbish into the ground in order to build up the level of the yard during construction phase.    Any help will be appreciated."	No
1588	Hi /r/legaladvice, I am a single child of two immigrants now living in Maricopa County. Since I understand the most English, they look to me for help regarding this stuff. A bit of background: My parents combined make &lt;40k/year (even now) but through bring frugal they managed to pay off their first home quite some time ago (&gt;5 years ago). Living on a new property, they started renting that home a few years back (3-4 years ago).  Though I was a minor, I tried to help them with lease agreements, etc since I understood the most English. Obviously in hindsight, it would've been best to look for a lawyer. However, they are the type to handle things under their own purview and due to their own ignorance and my own, we failed to notice that one must register the property as residential/rental. [See here for specific law](http://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/33/01902.htm).  I found out about the law this morning and informed my parents who are willing to comply with the law. Now my parents are looking at some hefty fines (at least, for their income level) of $1000 + $100/mo of not having the house registered while renting. They plan to cease renting soon (current tenants are not under lease, so I believe it's at-will?) and we all want to make sure we're not missing anything that could bite us later.  Regarding registering the property w/ the County Assessor's office, their current plan is to come forward to the office and pay the fine in full, then register the house as a rental residential. Then proceed to ask tenants to leave (with a month's notice at least) before registering back to residential (which will remain empty and not rented). My parents want to avoid hiring a lawyer since they believe it will just tack on a lot of additional $$$, but I can see where using one can be worth it to avoid a lot of hassle.  [Link to County Assessor's Rental Registration FAQ Page](https://mcassessor.maricopa.gov/faq/faq-rental-registration.php)  Is the problem best handled with my parent's current plan, or should they look for a lawyer? What types of lawyer would be best for the job (looking for specific titles to google)? What sort of advice/services should we seek and the ballpark fees for such help?  Separately would the fact on how the house was improperly registered impact my parent's past taxes (well, the taxes of the breadwinner of my parents)? Should we also be looking into a tax-related lawyer?	No
1589	"Hey guys. The title pretty much sums it up. Here's the situation:   Smoking of any sort is not allowed in my apartment, so I smoke in my car. I don't smoke much, so I'll have a single puff in my car for about 5-7 minutes, then go back inside. We have street parking on public roads. Anyway, I guess someone complained, because then my landlord shows up from out of nowhere, and approached me in my car.   Now, where I live, weed has basically been decriminalized. At least, when you get caught with it in small amounts (all I ever carry is maybe 1g) you get something like a $100 ticket.   Anyway, my landlord approaches me, and tells me to get out of the car like he's some sort of cop. I do, and greet him. He says, ""I can have you evicted for this."" I say, ""for smoking weed?"" and he says, ""yes, the lease prohibits it."" I say, ""the lease prohibits smoking inside of the apartment."" He says, ""we'll see about that,"" and drives off.   He then sends me an email saying, ""tomorrow I will be serving you with a notice to vacate for violating the lease.""   My lease does not end until October. How is this going to play out for me?"	No
1590	I live in Eugene Oregon. I paid the Security deposit in full with my own money. The tenants I lived with were people I didn't know (craigslist). they re-signed the lease under my nose and had the full security deposit, all of which was my money paid with a check in my name, transferred to the new lease. I went to the property management company and they said there is no way to get the money back unless I track down the individuals who are living there and get them to sign an agreement saying that the Deposit will be given to me after their lease is up in July 2018. This seems very unlawful considering the check is in my name, I was not notified of them re-signing, and I am no longer on the lease/living there. Any advice would help! thanks.	No
1591	My friend picked up a 3 month sublet lease on an off campus college house this summer. Its mainly empty for the summer. But since she's moved in she's had various issues with place. She wanted a single but the room she got was a double. The subletter promised she would have the room to herself since the other roommate wouldn't be around. This hasn't been the case and the other roommates visits frequently and often time brings other guys with her to the room which makes my friend uncomfortable.   Also the place does not have wifi or Internet hooked up. She constantly brought this up with her subletter but they never got around setting anything up. Even though she's only a subletter, she still tries to keep the house clean but the house always keeps getting messy whenever the normal residents show up and bring people with them. The normal residents don't do any cleaning themselves.  While this was going on, she looked for a new place to move out to. She found one, liked it, and it had everything she wanted. She then paid the first months deposit afterwards. Now as she's trying to move out, she has a big hurdle. She's discussed her plans to move out and all the reasons she wants to move but she's still stuck in the contract. It's August and there's still one month left. She had discussed this to both the landlord and her subletter. Even knowing all these issues, the landlord sided with the subletter and said she has the follow the contract. As a result of this, the subletter has said that my friend is free to move out, but she'll still have to pay the final months rent. Even if she doesn't live there. Does my friend have any legal standing on this? She's paid for a place she's likes and wants to move into but is stuck in a place she's doesn't like and still has to pay whether she's there or not.	No
1592	"Tuesday around 2:30 AM a couple friends and I were leaving a bar. I knew I was drunk and shouldn't drive, but this isn't about me justifying myself. Well, I was heading from one parking lot to the other across the street to take my friends back to their cars, where someone would have taken me home or I would have Uber'd (more on that later). I turned left on a road where I didn't know there was a median, crossed the street, got to my destination, but before I could pull into the lot I had lights on me. Since I already knew I was driving on the wrong side of the road like an idiot, I figured that's what I was being pulled over for. It was. However I just left the bar, I had 3 (and a half) beers between 10:30 PM and 2:30 AM, so I'm sure I smelled, or my non-driver smashed passenger did. Officer has me do field sobriety tests, I probably failed, but while under the impression my sentence would he lighter if I blew, I consented and went along with it.  Blew a 0.121, arrested, and I was allowed to leave the station with my stepdad.  Totally cool with paying the fines and the 90 day suspension and even the classes as I know I shouldn't have been driving drunk, even if it was just to cross the street. Got off lucky that no one was hurt, I acknowledge that. The important part for me is when my court date came, the judge told me I was being charged with 2 counts of DUI, one for driving and one for blowing over the limit, meaning my first offense is counted as my second. He said I'm facing something like 180 days in jail/10k fine/1 year suspension. I wasn't even in the car for 5 minutes. Sidenote: my breaks are broken and I was driving my brother's car. How big of an issue is this? (Again, I know I shouldn't have, even to cross the street, but honest to God I was JUST crossing the street, I was not driving home. I was on the wrong side of the road, so me getting pulled over is justifiable, I just didn't think it through. I would have gotten pulled over sober because I'm just stupid.) Though it's not my place to say, is that ""fair""? I have an attorney who I can hopefully afford, but I can't meet with him until Friday. I just need some peace of mind, and knowing how much trouble I'm in could definitely help me prepare mentally."	No
1593	So my friend is currently in a holding cell awaiting court at 1:30, she was caught with 3.7 grams of Molly, an ounce of shrooms, 3 ecastcy pills and under 30 grams of weed. My questions are, will I be able to post bail for her? Since it's her first offense can she get an ibond? What can I do to make sure she doesn't land in jail?	No
1594	"Good morning all,  I've never been a big believer in ghosts. I believe in the afterlife, but not ghosts.  About a year ago I saw a post on Craigslist looking for a ""Supernatural tester"" to come to a womans house and test if it was haunted. She said she required some evidence of legitimacy to be hired. So I printed out a license that stated I was licensed to ""Ghoul Inspect"" by the United Paranormal Hunting Association(UPHA). Technically, this is true. But I had started UPHA about an hour after I saw the CL posting. So I licensed myself.   Anyway, I went to the (obviously not) ""haunted house"" and looked around. I said that there were no ghosts and only took half of what she offered(She offered $300 so I took $150). I figured this was a win/win/win in a kind of scumbag way but at the same time the girl said the other people who emailed wanted $900 and she *was going to pay it*. Plus she would have been told they were real.  Anyway, so I realized how amazing this is for money, so I did it to other people, all while making the operation look more and more legitimate.   At my best after bringing in two friends to help, I made $1700 from 12 people in a single week for about 10 hours worth of work.   Anyway so this is one of the two cases that worries me.   The first is this:  So about 3 months ago I met this Super Atheist and she lived with an older lady(Her aunt). Her aunt was quite wealthy(they own a local business in a ritzy part of Maine, you'd know it if you lived there) and she had inherited it. The aunt basically bankrolls this young girl. The Aunt was convinced she was being haunted by a ghost, but she didn't know who(though she had a few ideas which I won't divulge because of privacy). So the younger girl(Sara) wouldn't agree to call the more expensive ""paranormal investigators"" but called me because I charge $150 for initial investigations, and that was worth it to put the issue to rest.   So I went there, and here is the thing, I said the house *was* haunted. I needed the return business. I'm not proud, but I did some bad things. I moved items when they were in the bathroom, at one point I took a recorder and stuck it in her ACHV unit to make screaming/moaning noises. All in all, I'm a terrible person and I admit that.   Anyway, the woman passed and I went over to the house of Sara and said how sorry I am.  But Sara was now convinced that the house was haunted. I know how bad this is because this girl is an atheist with a near ivy-league degree in a STEM Field. My practice *really* fucked her up.   Not knowing what to do, I doubled down.   I did just about the worst thing I'd ever done and I took the spare key to the house she gave me and I paid a man to wait in the basement when she came home and then act as scary as possible(he also stole a painting, but I didn't tell him to do that). I thought he would just like pound the walls and then I could say we caught him and the ghost is gone, your aunt is at peace etc etc etc.  Instead this fucking idiot straight up ran after making some screaming noises in the basement and the *GIRL WAS HOME*. I mean he ran out of the basement, and she was him! She got scared out of her mind and then called me.  So I ditched it. I ended the whole practice, changed my number, etc. The ""address"" was just a PO box so I stopped paying for it.  That concerns me but it's on the backburner.  The second one is what worries me.  So after a few weeks had passed I got the service going on the DL and some girl said she needed help. Yadda yadda yadda, I did the standard procedure while mentioning that her daughter might be experiencing some hauntings.  This stupid bitch went out and paid for a $4,900 unofficial exorcism by an unlicensed priest!  So I don't know what to do. What if she comes after me? I never said to do that! Am I in the legal right here? Do I double down and endorse the exorcism?"	No
1595	My neighbors contractor flooded their unit, which in turn caused damage to my units kitchen and carpet. I called his insurance company about their procedures and my reimbursement for moving expenses and he says they're a liability company who reimburses the owner after they submit an estimate. I take this to my landlord, and now his representative wants us to either continue paying rent while we stay in the unrepaired unit, or move all our belongings out while they do repairs without reimbursing us for moving fees or hotel charges. I had told her if they wanted to break the lease 7 months early, they'd have to give us our deposit and last months rent back (which was paid at the beginning of the lease), and allow us to stay for the month of August rent free while we searched for another home. She countered with a hard no, and said we can continue to pay rent on the damaged unit until we leave, at which point they'll refund our deposit and last month if required, or she will call the state to have the unit condemned then lock the doors and have us escorted to gather our belongings and exit the property...sans our deposit of course.  My question is, what are my options here? I'm dumb and don't have renters insurance, and believe me I'll never make that mistake again. My realtor who is a family friend recommended I go to small claims court and make my case, and they'll side with me considering the situation. I tried to be cordial with my landlords rep, but she devolved into insults and that was quite frankly the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't want to get taken advantage of here, especially for doing nothing except having the misfortune of living in the unit next to the one where the problem originated.   The unit isn't unlivable, but the condition of the kitchen cabinets and carpet is beyond repairs; should I be paying rent during a time when the apartment isn't in a state that was agreed upon during the lease? Do i have recourse in seeking reimbursement or even straight payment for my moving expenses? And what abkut the lease...can my landlord just decide to condemn the place even if it truly isnt condemned and unlivable just to have a reason to break the lease? Can I get some advice? Thank you so much reddit, it's very much appreciated.	No
1596	Colorado  We notified them months ahead of time of our intention to leave, in accordance with the lease.  The original lease was up earlier last month and I had moved out before that date.  My roommate, however, didn't plan ahead so he extended it by a month then packed up and left a few weeks ago.  He's no longer in the state.  The rental company left me a voicemail claiming I never officially moved out and need to pay his bill.  I never signed anything to extended the lease nor spoke with the company since I notified them I was moving out 4 months ago.  I cleaned my half of the apartment before leaving and haven't been back since. There's a good chance his half is trashed.  How fucked am I?	No
1597	I made an offer on a house in Georgia. The transaction uses a digital contract so you can see a verified signing date. The seller is also the broker. The seller (in her capacity as the listing agent) signed the contract 30 minutes prior to the offer expiration. She then signs the contract in her Seller capacity 6 minutes after the Offer expiration. She then allows us to do a home inspection, which cost us money. Now, she's saying because she signed it late, that we don't have a binding contract.   I believe what happened is she was waiting on another offer but it didn't come by the time our contract expired so she planned to use us as a safety net and string us along until a higher offer came in or just sell to us if it never came.  Do I have an enforceable contract?	No
1598	I live in a 10 building apartment complex in a small town. I have had trouble with my air conditioning(working when I moved in) for the last few months and I feel like Im getting the run around. Any time I request repairs I am not contacted by management and maintenance just shows up a few days later. He works on it for a few hours inside and outside of the apartment and just leaves when he's done. No communication. When I check to see if it's fixed, sometimes it is and other times it's not and I have to call again to find out what's going on. My last repair request was answered quickly and I was actually told he would be back in the morning to repair the A/C. At 4 p.m. The next day I have to call management to find out what is going on and am told to hold. After a few minutes I'm told the maintenance guy (yes one guy for the whole complex) was injured this morning and can't get to until tomorrow. I was then informed that I could have a window unit but the others were being used my other tenants at the moment (I was never informed of there units when I was having trouble before). After asking if I could get an outside company to look at it I was told he was the only one who could work on the air. She then offered to call maintenance to work on it anyway and I declined saying I don't want an injured man to have to work in the heat to repair my air. She said she would figure something out for me and I left to go home. 10 minutes later maintenance comes in, splint on his finger, and starts workin on the air. He works on the unit outside and leaves without any communication again! So I'm sitting in my 90 degree apartment writing this before I drive around to cool off.

1600	"I recently signed a contract for a new construction home expected to close in December 2017.   The financing section of the contract states ""If buyer intends to use a lender other than designated lender, buyer shall cause said lender to execute an ""outside lender addundum"" within seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract, one the form prepared by seller, and buyer shall provide seller and escrow holder with a copy thereof within such seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract.""  Does this mean after 72 hours, I am stuck with the designated lender and can't shop around for a mortgage with different lenders?"	No
1601	On last months wireless bill AT&amp;T did not include the amount for my installment plan, and it wasn't even mentioned on the bill. One this months bill, which I'm calling this months bill because the amount due for the billing period is due this month, they included both last months and this months installment payment. The amount per installment is $61.50. Times two, $122 on this months bill.  Now, these also are the final two payments of the the installment agreement. The device is payed off after this periods bill is payed.  I contacted AT&amp;T via chat, phone, and visiting a retail store(who politely informed me everything is done over phone and they don't know why I was sent there), and I asked them if I could have one of the two installments moved to next month.  They refused, and insisted that I pay the entire bill amount. I said I was open to other arrangements to lower this months bill and pay the rest later, and reminded them that it was AT&amp;T who made the mistake by not including it in my bill the previous month. One of the 7 or 8 people I spoke with said that it was a known issue that happened to several of their customers last month, and was resolved.  I don't think I should have to pay the $61.50 that AT&amp;T neglected to include in my bill and then added the next month without notice. However I am willing to pay it if they spread the 2 payments over 2 months as they should be. I did not ask AT&amp;T to forgive the installment, but I did tell them many times that I was willing to do it over two months, inline with what I originally agreed when I bought the device.  First, what organization(s) should I report AT&amp;T to, and how should I do it?  Second, how can I best get out of paying the $61.50 they did not charge me one month? What legal grounds do I have there?  Thank you for your help. I realize the dollar amount here is not that much, but AT&amp;T's absolute refusal to work with me on payment options makes me want to pursue legal options.	No
1602	I live and work in Ohio. My job is taking out taxes for PA. I called my boss, he said he would fix it, he didn't. I called HR and they said I have to fill in a form from the IRS, but they were unable to tell me what form. Is it a W-4, and who do I send it to? HR didn't know who to send it to, either.   Google and the company website say payroll should fix it. I'm confused. Searches only pull up that I should file out of state during tax time, but that's a while away.  Thank you in advance.	No
1603	I live in NYS.  My car was stolen while I was at work an involved in an accident before I could report it stolen. The their hit another car and fled on foot.   My question is, am I liable even though I wasn't driving? The insurance company is telling me that I'd have to prove that I didn't give my keys to someone. It's a keyless ignition car, so there was no physical evidence of theft when we recovered it (there wouldn't be, they essentially hacked a computer).  But this doesn't sound right to me, if I'm the defendant in a civil suit, can't I use he negative defense of superseding cause, since I wasn't driving the car? How can you prove a negative? (That I didn't give my keys to someone)  Thanks for taking the time to read and respond!	No
1604	Almost a year ago I contacted a housekeeping company on Craigslist. I will change names here, let's call the owners of the company Viktor and Svetlana.  Svetlana sent a cleaning lady to my apartment, we will call her Vera. Vera does a fantastic job, we like her a lot. She is very sweet and meek and deferential. She comes every other week or so as needed, we have a tiny apartment, she charges $60 and I add $10 as a tip for a total of $70, I make out a check to Vera directly every time she comes. She cleans the whole 550 sq. ft. apartment including the dishes.  Vera does not speak basically any English at all, so anything I have to say I have to communicate through Svetlana by text message. I have never met Viktor or Svetlana, but I text them to arrange cleaning or if I have some request for Vera. I have the suspicion that Svetlana may be a bit stern or mean to Vera.  This summer Vera started bringing her girls. The girls are out of school and are helping her clean. Usually I am not home when she comes, so I didn't notice at first, but I worked from home one morning and she had brought her daughter, and then another time I noticed that she has two daughters she sometimes brings. The girls are very sweet and always smiling and pleasant.   I am not certain of the age of the girls, but they are both teenagers. The older one is probably 16-17, the younger may be 14-15.  I don't know what to do.  My concerns:  - We like Vera and her girls a lot. I actually used to clean apartments myself when I was in college full-time and I can't imagine doing it as a single mother. She seems like a great mom with happy girls and we are not judging her or wanting to get her in trouble, I am confident that she is making the best choices she can for her girls. Whatever I do I do not want to make life harder for her or her girls.  - I don't know how old the girls are or if they are being compensated fairly. I can't ask Vera about this because she knows so little English she is nearly mute. I could ask Svetlana, but I don't know how much I trust Svetlana, I have never even met her.  - I have no idea how many hours a week the girls are working, I don't know how many homes Vera cleans. It seems she only brings her girls occasionally and only since the summer began, she brings the older one more often I think.  So I guess my question is, how do I know whether this arrangement is legal? Am I violating child labor laws? How do I remedy this situation in a way that is best for Vera and her girls?	No
1605	Hello Reddit, First off all, sorry for the grammar, I'm posting this on my phone. So I'm living in an apartment complex close to campus, and my lease expired Aug 8th. Originally we planned on renew our lease for another year, but since the rent for next year increased a bit too much over the budget, we looked and found another place that we can moved in July 24th. Now we just received our offer for renewing the lease at the beginning of this month (with the new rent rate). However, our current landlord required us to give 60 days notice before moving out. Our landlord put us under month to month payment instead of a renewal. That would put our move out date to Sept 12 (we put in our written notice July 12).  My question is, are there anyway we can avoid or minimal the rent for an empty apartment for a whole month of August and a part of Sept? We are college student and we can't afford paying rent for 2 places with 1 place being empty. Thank you	No
1606	"I work at a state park in Nebraska. I am currently the only one working in a small store. On my off days someone else works so I have 2 days off. My hours have recently been changed to factor in a half hour lunch, and I am currently at a point where I work exactly 40 hours a week. However, my boss told me that I will have to take a ""working lunch."" That essentially means I remain in the building and continue to work through my lunch, but I am not paid for it. My math shows that I am missing out on 2.5 overtime hours every week.  I am currently a part time employee, so they do not want me working over 40 or else the state gets upset. I told a colleague about my situation and he suggested I keep working until I am done for the season, then pursuit legal action. Tonight at the end of my shift I'm going to collect all past pay stubs and keep them organized.   Am I being wronged here? I just want an outsider opinion on the situation."	No
1607	My Girlfriend's ex who hasn't lived with her in almost a year is currently making her life hell Bc we got together. We went to the beach for the weekend with me and her and her son, and he went to the landlord and told him that she moved out and got the locks changed. She is still on the lease and pays all the bills. After getting this sorted is there any legal action we can take to remove him from the property entitlements.	No
1608	"**TLDR: signed sublet lease, didn't pay a deposit, I want out, what are the repercussions of bailing?**  I'm a 26 year old nurse that recently relocated from Denver to San Francisco for a new job.  I'm not terribly familiar with San Francisco, so I decided to look for short-term housing until I decide on something more permanent. My ex from college heard through the grapevine about my move and offered me to stay with him for 'basically free rent' (with subtle hints at hooking up-- no thanks!). He lives in San Francisco too.  I looked on craigslist and found a cute room that's only 10 minutes away from work in a 4 bdrm house. Met with the landlord (an elderly Asian man, he said he's been renting out for 20+ years).  The place seemed fine at first glance, but only after signing a lease did the problems start appearing...  * The central heating works intermittently (yes, I know its summer but it's cold at night in San Francisco). I mentioned this to the landlord and he replied ""You're only here for a few months, it shouldn't be an issue!""  * The shower water takes 45 seconds to warm up  * The roommates lead a different lifestyle than what I anticipated... one college senior, one barista, and one club promoter (that I can hear having sex on a nightly basis when he gets home at 3am).  * The kitchen is a fucking mess and no one cleans up after themselves. The landlord addressed this by taking a photo with his phone and send he will ""look into it"" (the roommates weren't home at the time).  I have been here for about a week now, and this sublet is the least favorite part of my move. I really want to get out.  I mentioned this story at happy hour yesterday and one of my coworkers friends told me that her and her girlfriend have a spare guest room that's unoccupied, and they would love to have me over and help me find my own place.  So to rewind a little bit- I signed a 2.5 month lease in mid July (so it runs through July, Aug, and Sept) for $1600/month. I explained to the landlord that moving between states was expensive and I couldn't afford the $1600 security deposit yet, and he agreed that I could pay it on August 1st with my rent. So he's expecting 3200 in about a week (August 1).  The information he has about me (through the lease form that I filled out) are:  * My full name * My old address in Denver * My social security number * My car model and license plate number * My job offer letter in San Francisco  He does not have any copies of my ID or any of my bank account information. Also, the pro-rated July rent that I paid was done through cash.  Are there any consequences that may arise if I just pack up my belongings, leave the keys in the empty room, and leave the house on July 31st? My concerns are whether this has the ability to affect my credit or if this could backfire and count as an ""eviction"", etc.  Also, should I inform the landlord on the last day that I'm leaving? Or maybe inform him once I am out?  **TLDR: signed sublet lease, didn't pay a deposit, I want out, what are the repercussions of bailing?**"	No
1609	My husband and I are a young couple barely starting to build a life. We bought a trailer home for $500 with the idea of repairing it slowly since it's a bit run down.   We needed somewhere to put it so we got a property which was $1000 of downpayment and would be $250 every month.   We paid someone close to $2000 to move the trailer home into the property. He did and its been there for about 2 weeks now.   Today my husband got a call from the lady who sold him the property saying that she wants to break contract and move our home elsewhere into another one of her available properties all because the man who lives right next to our property is complaining that our home is too ugly to be next to his or in his immediate vicinity. The lady is siding with him because this man turns out to be the city commissioner.   The other available properties are not the same as the one we have now. They are by a creek and they pretty much get flooded every time it rains. The lady did offer to pay for someone to move our home again and use the first downpayment for whichever other property we get so we wouldn't have to pay twice but we don't want to settle for less just because this man feels superior to us but we don't know what to do.   Please help us. Your advice will be greatly appreciated.	No

I have two young kids (4 and 1) and I can't continue to keep them in these conditions. Help please.	No
1611	Hello, I will attempt to condense this to the core of the issue, but I'm seeking advice as this information just came to my attention yesterday.   I live in California, and I purchased a new vehicle in Texas in April.  The dealership  said they would handle registering for me in California, that they had done this before.  Fast forward 2 months, a week before my temp tags were going to expire and I contact them asking what the status was, as my tags were about to expire. This prompted a flurry of emails which quickly became apparent, that they had dropped the ball with my paperwork and only just got started.  They issued me a new set of tags for another two months.*(which I question the legality of the new tags, since they have a purchase date displayed that doesn't match my paperwork, I assume because temp tags can only have a 2 month limit... But I digress, I hope I wont get pulled over by police and need to explain)* They also requested that I get my vehicle VIN inspected, and a smog check completed.  Upon getting those two things done, the VIN inspector told me I would need to get it weighed as well since it was a truck, so I got that done as well, and the dealership then told me that was needed afterall...  Good thing I was told by the VIN guy.  All additional paper work was sent a couple of weeks ago, which I followed up on multiple times.  All was quiet until yesterday when I receive an email from the finance director, who this particular individual I have had zero contact with up to this point.    &gt;We have been notified by our titling agency that the State of California is requiring  &gt;more in taxes to register your vehicle.  The amount that was used was calculated on  &gt;the Base MSRP **as requested**, but California has calculated it using the Sale Price. &gt;If you have any questions regarding this amount feel free to contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx &gt; and I will do my best to assist you.  The above **as requested** line is the one I have an issue with, this sounds like they are trying to cover their butt, and it makes it sound as if I requested that they calculate the sales tax differently than they should have.  I did not make any such request, nor did I even know that they did that until yesterday.  April is a long time ago, and I thought all the financials were squared away.  The amount that I owe all of a sudden is not trivial, it is $1670.24.  That is a large mistake, one that I feel the dealership should take some responsibility for.  Do I have any recourse?  Should I expect the dealership to cover some or all of this?  What would be the proper approach to take in your opinion.  Many thanks.	No
1612	"1.	We are in a rental agreement with a roommate on a apartment. We pay rent on time every month to other roommate who pays the rent. For the past couple month’s roommate has not told us about other fees such as electricity, gas, internet, water etc. So we have just been paying our half of the rent and that’s it. Because we are renting and have signed a contract with a landlord, we pay our rent. Well our time is coming to a close with this roommate and just to make sure could he bring legal action against us for the fees from the apartment. Just to make it clear we are and still paying our rent, this question is for the fees that come with a apartment, but is not included in our lease with our landlord.    2.	Interview with a company. Had 2 great interview and constantly told the entire time that I am being considered. Even told last week that I am high on the candidate list. Well I didn’t get the job. I was wondering if I write a review on a website could the company come after me? Also is there any option to report this company for doing this to me and other people.   Thanks again.

1613	I've an ongoing dispute with my employer for over a year now. We've been going back and forth through the state Labor Commission over wages and unpaid overtime. Thus far we haven't reached a resolution.  Recently, my boss handed me a memo that detailed a bunch of new policies about when to clock in, clock out, overtime, etc and asked that I sign the memo. I declined considering that a lot of what was in the memo didn't make sense and my boss wasn't able to clarify.  Payday has come and gone without my paycheck being deposited. Obviously this is a problem but what do I actually *do* about it? I have bills that need to be paid and I don't have the money to do that because my wages haven't been deposited.	No

1618	"I purchased a home in October 2006. At the time I thought the house looked like a modular or trailer, but the appraisal came back as ""standard built home"" and listed the value at $85k. I purchased the home for $72,500 with a 9.65% ARM. (I had some bad credit at the time, but I figured I could pay on the house for couple of years, sell it, and move into something bigger for less interest)   As you all know, in the spring of 2007 the market crashed. Everyone lost out. I tried to refinance in 2010 and this is when I was told the home was worth $70k and it was a manufactured house. I found a bank to go through that did manufactured housing loans. I had to get a retired title in order to refinance or sell it. Unfortunately, I owed more than $70k so I wasn't able to refinance. Earlier this year I tried again. This time I owe $64k but it's valued at $57k. I put over $42k into fixing the house up over the last 5 years..........I know that money is gone. At this point, I do not want to put 1 cent into the house for improvements, but I am stuck with an interest rate of 9.65%. (Other than dumping every extra cent I have into paying down the principal) Does anyone have any advice?"	No

1620	"Hi all,   Here's the situation: *In Nov of 2016, I go apartment hunting. My husband really wants a pool and we find a building downtown with one. I'm meh on it, but he is really keen on it. The rent is $2400. It's a 15 year old building. *Our second choice was was a place for $1900 in a nearby neighborhood. New construction. *In the immediate neighborhood, around our building rent ranges from $2000 up. Another contender nearby was $2800 for the same size, but amazing views and brand new.  *The pool was the thing that influenced the decision. *Moved in in December 2016. *The pool was closed for remodel at the end of January 2017, along with the rest of the building - lobby, all amenities, etc. *It's August and it's still closed. :) The last note that went up was stating that it would be done by end of July. We've spent 6 of 8 months living without the one thing we wanted here. *ZERO was said about the impending remodel. *Yesterday, when having a ""lively"" discussion, one of the leasing agents stated that ""[Management] didn't want us telling about the remodel..."" *Yes, the rental agreement has a note that management can close amenities, but the common sense reading is that this is for a temporary and limited duration - not a half year!  Naturally, we're pissed. We are moving out, but it's been something that sticks in our side like a thorn. If we had known, we would not have moved into an impending construction zone. These types of projects don't happen overnight, so it seems unreasonable they they wouldn't have known this was coming. Their failure to inform us of this seems like there's some culpability here.   What are my options? Ideally, I would like to drag them into small claims and go for a small sum of money from them. That said, I'm not sure if this is small claims eligible. Thoughts?

1621	According to our lease, our ex landlord was supposed to bill us each month for water for 2/7 of the bill for the entire house(it was a duplex and were supposed to be billed for number of people in our unit vs total number of people in the house). Not once did he send a bill to us for the entire year despite our numerous documented requests for the water bill. Our lease has been up for two months now and our ex landlord is now saying he will keep the deposit and will settle the balance for the water with that, and will send us the remainder or bill us for the amount still owed depending on how much the water bill comes to. My SO and I do not trust him at all to bill us the correct amount and want him to send us the deposit that we are owed in full, and then bill us for the water, so we are going to send a debt validation letter to him via certified mail using a template we found online. Will this be enough to cover our asses in small claims court if he does not send verification of our water bill and/or does not return our deposit? What else should we be doing?	No
1622	Hi, I'm 17m working at a fast food chain in CT. My boss is taking hours from myself and the other workers. He's done this before, I had my hours written down and he told me that I changed them to give me more hours. Last time he did this, he shorted me by about 14 hours. Well now I have my printed receipts for the hours that I worked. He told one of my co workers that the hours I stayed late with her, because it was busy, I won't get paid for.(to clarify this is maybe an hour once or twice a week) I get paid on Tuesday.  My questions are, if my hours don't match up, what should I do to get them back? Can I sue him over this? What about my co workers, they don't have any evidence that they worked more than he has said, can they get any hours back?	No

They are suing for an amount that is magnitudes over my coverage.  Its Saturday so I have to wait till monday to speak to my representative.  I am afraid my insurance company will only pay so much and I'll be left with the remainder which would cripple me for a very very longtime.  Is that possible?   Is this just a scare tactic to get the most out of the my insurance? Or is there a chance they really want to get all of this from me.  as you can imagine, am very distraught	No
1624	Hi I cross posted this with /advice I hope I'm doing this right because I've never really posted on Reddit...also sorry for formatting I'm on mobile and also incredibly stressed out.   So basically there were issues with our carpets when we moved out of our apartment. There was a bleach stain in the hallway caused by my roommate that we all witnessed her make (myself and other two housemates). She said before we moved out that she knew she would have to take responsibility for it. Turns out when it came time she tried to lie her way out of it by blaming me (because she hates me, she told the others girls exactly that). In the end she ended up taking responsibility.  We thought we moved on but fast forward to this week. My landlord send my security deposit to the girl I subletted from and I haven't been able to contact that girl to get my security deposit back (that's a whole thing in and of itself). The landlord said the carpet cleaning for the living room went well except one or two small stains that wouldn't come out but it wasn't a big deal. We all made stains on that carpet that we tried to clean. I personally had two tiny coffee stains because my dog stole an empty k-cup when I first moved in. However I spent a long time trying to get it out and it was almost unnoticeable by the time I moved out. Unlike tar my roommate has tracked into the living room after the beach one day.   Anyway today the landlord tells me that my roommate is upset about the living room floor and decided she wants it to be replaced which would cost all 4 of us $1000-1500. She also sent my housemate a picture of said stains and guess what, they're HUGE. They look FRESH. They were not there before. But now the others have turned on me saying now it's my turn to take responsibility. I feel like my roommate is being vindictive and wants revenge.   I'm also concerned on whether my landlord is allowed to try and charge us after the fact she already send my deposit with my itemized list of damages/deductions and it's been 21 days (this is the max limited allotted under CA law to send a security deposit back with deductions).   I am so stressed and confused and really need any help I can get, especially in terms of my legal rights. Thank you.   P.S. I am a sub letter so I know that technically any charges would actually go toward the master tenant but I am so confused on the legality of all this as we never filed paperwork with the landlord regarding my sublet (I filled it out but the master tenant never signed or sent it in)	No

1626	"The accident happened in Irvine, CA. I was giving my girlfriend a ride to work on my motorcycle in the far left lane before HOV. With the intent of using the HOV lane, I waited for a break in the yellow lines, hit the turn signals, looked over my shoulder and then mirror, saw that there were no vehicles in the HOV, and made the lane change. Maybe ~10ft from the point where I changed lanes, I heard another motorcycle's tires screeching (assuming he locked up his tires), and the rider going down in my rear mirror. Pulled over and did a police report. He and his bike suffered some rashes; neither my gf, my bike and I were harmed.

Then where does the 60 months come from? Also what is ""pay or appear"" exactly?   Any help is greatly appreciated on the admittedly limited information I've provided."	No
1628	Santa Fe, New Mexico:  My lease ended in May 2017, and I have been expecting my $400 security deposit since then. I recently contacted my old landlord and asked why I hadn't received the deposit, and she started by lying about giving me $200 in cash, which I quickly dismissed. She then said she would be making large deductions based on repairs done to the heater (which was never fully operational during my tenancy), and fees related to a cleaning requested by the tenant who moved in after me. I asked for an itemized invoice of the charges, and received a scribbled mess that added up to $200 in deductions from my deposit, along with a check for $200. This is the first invoice and check I've received since May, long after the 30 days I believe landlords have to deliver either.   Do I have grounds to dismiss the deductions and receive my deposit in full?	No
1629	"Basically, my friend is willing to come up with the 4k to break the lease, however, the apartment management requires a signature from both people and her ex is refusing to sign until she ""meets with him alone"".  Which is obviously dangerous.   The apartment complex is looking into if they can do anything on their end, but until then, what are her legal rights?"	No
1630	In early July, I established a subletter for my room in the apartment I was living in before moving to a different state. He applied through the leasing agency and was put on the lease, which ends in September.   Just yesterday, I received pictures from him showing a burn hole in the carpet in my room about the size of a fist. He claimed that he forgot to tell me about the burn, but that it was there before he moved in. I know that the burn was not there before leaving the apartment. My roommates who I have contacted about it agree that it was not there when I moved out. I also have a picture taken before moving out that doesn't show the burn mark.   My question is about what options I have if I confront the subletter about his lie and he refuses to pay for the damages. The security deposit was paid by me at the start of the lease. When I contacted my rental company, they said this was likely a situation that I would have to work out with my subletter. The only sort of leverage I can think of is threatening to take him to small claims court with the evidence I have. Are there any other routes I should consider?  Thanks for reading!	No
1631	So I am looking to rent a new place, the application I applied for had [this wording](http://i.imgur.com/w8PqZ1y.png). The landlord is telling me the fee is separate from the security deposit. From my understanding this went towards the deposit, am I in the wrong here?	No
1632	"Hi, my friend lives in Ohio (USA), and her lease is almost up. She lives with her SO and their child.  She has been turned down by multiple landowners, despite having first months rent and deposit in hand because her landlord is giving her bad references. She says to her knowledge, there is no reason he should be doing that (they always pay their rent early, there are no damages, the apartment is clean, they don't party or do drugs or smoke, and he's never complained to them once about anything). She's been searching for a new place for months.  It seems to me like this would be slander/libel, or if not, simply illegal. She says the bad recommendations he's giving are 100% false. Is there anything she can do legally? She says they have a court date in a couple of weeks to fight their ""evictions."" But she is about to be homeless with a toddler, and needs help (she has no family or friends in her area to crash with).  Any suggestions?"	No
1633	So to start this out. From 6 months old to 20 years old, I had only lived in one place. At 3 years old i had blood lead levels of 16. My brother who was about 6 years old also had high lead levels.  We were on section 8(subsidised housing. For families that make less than a living wage)  The landlord and section 8 were notified about the lead paint. What was done was that he painted over the lead paint with different paint. No other changes were made. My mother didn't sue.  Fast forward the rest of my time living at this residence. Not once was the house repainted. For about 17 years. It had gotten to a point to where paint was just peeling all over the house. We attempted to have him paint it again. But to no avail. Neighbor with small children saw peeling paint blowing in her yard from said house. She tested it for lead. Came out positive. She made a report to the town. My landlord had to scrape it all off but did so in an unsafe manner. Did not cover the scaped paint. He just let it fall and fly all around outside.   Now. I'm 22 and no longer live in the house. (none of my family does). But I recently found out that I have mystery hearing loss. I have been seeing multiple doctors to uncover the reason. Today. My doctor looks at my new audiogram And asked me if I have had any childhood illnesses or exposure to heavy metals.  A few months ago I also uncovered old medical files as to where I had hearing loss as a child in elemetary school.(when they did the in school hearing and eye tests). Unfortunately, my mother isn't the most caring or responsible. You could even call her negligent. But that's besides the point.  In the state of New York the statue of limitation for a lawsuit involving lead poisoning as a child is 3 years after turning 18. I am 22 years old. Is there nothing I can do if this is possibly proven to have caused my hearing loss?	No
1634	"I have 2 roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. ""John"" is the one bringing his family over. He said his mom would be over for a few days, and we consented. He had 10 members of his family over for 5 days, then had 4 members stay over for another 5 days, at which point he had 10 again for the final 2 days.      I told him this was too much when I realized, but he said they had to stay as they had nowhere to go. This is the second time his mom has come in 4 months (totalling 16 days).      We are all on the lease equally. I want to know, what are my rights in this situation? I've googled and saw it was OK if it was just an overnight guest like a girlfriend, but I saw nothing about 10 people... I'm not trying to get all of us kicked out, but it feels like I have no power in this situation if he wants to bring his family back. I told him not to bring them back, but I also said to get a hotel for them, which he did not. Any advice you can give would be helpful"	No
1635	"My family and I recently relocated to Houston from Shreveport for a better job opportunity. We have a 14 month old daughter and a 9 year old big fluffy dog. I'm the sole provider for my family and we're still pretty new to the whole parenting thing. I don't have very much extra income in the first place so potential legal costs and this unreasonable landlord are very daunting.   We had family members check the house with a realtor multiple times and it was under construction at the time. It looked like a great house from all that we could tell while it was being worked on. We were promised that it would be deep cleaned and completely move in ready by July 26th. We moved in on July 28th only to find that it hadn't been cleaned or exterminated in a very long time. After we loaded all of our furniture and belongings into the house the AC completely shut off. It's summer in Texas and those days were well into the high 90's. My wife and daughter began to feel sick from the heat and left to stay with family members while I continued to unpack and wait for an AC repair person. We were told a repair guy was on his way, but then found out it would probably be a few days.  The AC attic unit was not only so poorly maintained that it had nearly flooded the attic, but the repair guys told me a secondary line was never run. Which is not up to code and would definitely end up flooding the house after not being able to drain properly.   When the centerpoint energy tech came to the house to turn on the gas he showed us that the water heater wouldn't possibly heat enough for a warm bath. Sure enough we had to boil 6 pitchers of water, to compensate for the inability of the water heater, in order for our daughter to have a lukewarm bath. The landlord denies that it's an issue and said it feels fine to him.   The centerpoint technician also informed us that the roof isn't up to code and had many holes in the wood. You can see tarpaper, shingles and nails just looking up at the attic access. There is old braided wiring that's exposed throughout the attic and many place where the wood has broken away and would allow for leaks.   There weren't interior locks on two of the doors so we had to replace them and add a lock at our own expense. Just to feel safe at night and also to meet the standard of Texas tenants rights.   The landlord told me that ""renting a house is a lot like owning a house. You're going to have to do a lot of work"" he also said that he'd ""prefer to tear up the lease and let us walk because he doesn't want to change anything with the house and we're getting a great deal"".   Not long after that conversation we discovered that the house was suddenly over run with what looked to be some type of ants. We found them in our bedroom, the babies bedroom, all over the living room and dining room. This is also after we cleaned the entire house ourselves. So there wasn't food or anything out to attract insects. This happened on a Friday and we asked the landlord to hire a professional exterminator. He said he would right away and then waiting until the following Monday. We didn't feel even remotely safe with that level of infestation so once again we had to leave to stay with relatives. We have now been in houston a total of 12 days and have only been able to safely stay in the house 3 non consecutive days. He is claiming that we are luck if we get our deposit back and he also wants to keep the first month's rent or prorate for 12 days.   I don't think this is ethical seeing as we haven't even been able to fully unpack or stay in the house due to his inability to provide a safe living space.   I brought this to his attention and he claimed that we rushed the construction and that it's our fault. He said the house would be move in ready on July 26th and we moved in July 28th. So we in fact showed up two days later than the offered move in date. I'm not sure how we rushed the construction or how they planned to fix any of these issues and supposedly decided not to do so since we moved in already. The landlord brought a person over that he claimed was the broker on the house. This man claimed that we were in the wrong and the house is perfectly fine to live in and that we're losing money for our landlord, even though he's trying to keep the majority of what we paid him. I called our realtor and she said that is not the broker of the house and that he's just a guy that works in their office. He's not attached to any paperwork that we signed and has no legal right to be telling us what we can and can't do since he's just a friend of the landlord.   I have also found out that the previous family who lived in the house were not all legal citizens and had to go back to Mexico City unexpectedly. The neighbor was friends with some of them and told me when he noticed we had t been staying at the house. The previous tenants left a lot of their belongings in the garage and back shed as if they didn't have time to take it all. It seems as though the landlord is accustomed to dealing with people that may not be able to fight back when he isn't being fair.   Seeing as the house didn't match up to Texas tenant rights standards. Does anyone know if he has the right to act this way and why should we pay for days we couldn't safely inhabit the house. Also, why would he claim that it wasn't going to be ready to live in and he made an exception for us and his supposed broker said that we have no reason not to be in the house? Seems like they aren't on the same page about anything except for wanting to keep most of our money.   Without him returning the majority of the money we definitely will not be able to afford a new place and will be stranded either without a home or staying with family members in rotation for an unforeseeable amount of time.   Can anyone help?"	No
1636	"We filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy four years ago and our mortgage was discharged. We did not reaffirm. Now, we are a few months behind on the mortgage and cannot afford the repairs needed. We have spoken with our mortgage servicer and they have said that we are not legally obligated to pay the loan.   They offered deed-in-lieu as an option, and we have told them we'd like to go that route. We signed an initial document that they asked us to sign and now we're waiting for further instruction. We will be vacating the property next month and we already have other living arrangements in order.  We haven't heard from the mortgage servicer since last week. I talked to multiple agents to try to get information, but they keep saying that someone new will be assigned to our case and that we should hear something within a ""couple days.""   I have also tried emailing them to no avail. Basically, we just want to sign the deed back over to the bank and move on with our lives.    I'm hoping a bankruptcy attorney or real estate attorney can give me some insight on how long this process takes considering we don't have any legal obligation toward the mortgage.   I don't want to be liable for anything that might happen on the property while it is vacant--pipe bursts, someone slips on ice on the sidewalk, etc.   Also, do we need to notify the insurance company that we're no longer residing in the property?  Thanks in advance for any information you can give me."	No
1637	"My landlord is requesting £180 to replace a glass table that I 'broke' during my tenancy.   This happened when I placed four or five admittedly heavy medical textbooks on one end of the table. The glue that was connecting the base to the top subsequently gave up, and the top came away from the bottom. There is no other damage.  The base attaches to the top by an approximately 9"" by 4"" flat glass piece, and supports a heavy, approximately 42"" by 24"" by 1"" ovoid glass table top.   The piece did appear rigid, but in retrospect, how glue is supposed to hold this thing together I have no idea.   My question is, should I have anticipated this, and do I owe my landlord the replacement value of £180? The table is expensive, but not really fit for purpose. My opinion was that if I had paid for this table and it had failed like that, I would not have repaired it myself, but taken it back to the manufacturer.   I feel like it was an accident waiting to happen. Any advice would be much appreciated."	No
1638	Okay, so my friend has been renting an apartment for a couple years near the campus of the university that we attend and every semester his landlord has called him and asked if he wants to renew his contract for the next semester. Well this semester instead of calling him, his landlord sent him a letter saying that all of the contracts in his building had been sold and that he would need to be out of his apartment by this coming Saturday.   So we understand that it's not her obligation to ask him every semester if he will be renewing his contract but is it legal to give him 2 weeks notice to be moved out of her apartment? Is there anything he can do to stay a bit longer until he can get a contract at another apartment?	No
1639	A summary. A friend of mine in Dubai has been applying for his student visa to study in an Italian University for a year now.  The details here are hazy because I'm paraphrasing what my friend has told me.  Just recently (10 days ago), he was requested by the consulate to submit his bank statements, a photocopy of his flight ticket and his certificate of acceptance. When he did, someone working at the embassy told him the documents were false and to never apply for the visa again. In a threatening manner, I might add. They stamped the rejection on his visa.  I asked my friend, and he's certain every document is valid. I'm writing this here because he'd dumb af and doesn't want to seek help.   Isn't this illegal? I don't know much but I'm pretty sure falsely accusing someone is criminal.   What can one do about it?	No
1640	Sorry for the long title, I called my dad who is the owner of the property and since I have shit service where I live it dropped, so I gave them his number and then they just left and never called him back. I have tried looking their numbers to people that I think are related, but no one answers. Can I just untie their boat and let it drift away or should I do something else?	No
1641	Say I created a transcription service, where people payed me to transcribe their audio. Instead of hire people to do it 'myself', i just passed the audio files on to other companies who costed less, and took the price difference.  This *seems* like it should be wrong, but also seems like it'd be awkward to make laws for (outsourcing to 3rd party companies might be part of the process, like how sliced bread manufacturers don't grow their own wheat).  What would be the 'official verdict' behind this, or is it more of a grey area?  Thanks!	No
1642	To provide some backstory, I moved up to Colorado a few years ago and when I did, my best friend's mother allowed me to stay at her house. I ate their food, and received some gifts from them. I did some chores, as well as assisted with a renovation of the house I leased with her son (again, my best friend). Fast forward to today, I've decided to move out and separate from my best friend for personal reasons. My move out date is August 4th and our landlord has been generous to allow us to stay past the end of lease date while we sort a few things out, presuming we pay another months rent. (no contract has been signed for this month's rent. The landlord could kick us out on the 31st and there is nothing preventing them from doing so.)   Their mother is now threatening to sue me if I do not pay my full half of the August rent, when I feel it's reasonable to leave with paying 1/3 instead. Based on what I've told you folks, does she have any reasonable course of action in a court of law?	No
1643	I'm a US citizen, my wife is a permanent resident green card holder. We're looking to put a revocable living trust in place so that when I die things don't end up in probate etc. Do we need to find a lawyer who specializes in a living trust for non-citizens? My wife is under the impression that non-citizens are treated differently, so we need a special lawyer?	No
1644	"I guess I'll give this a shot.  I roomed with 2 other roommates in California. One of them in the middle of the lease moved out and we replaced him in the lease with someone else. We'll call him ""AC"". Now AC was stressed out because he got a new job somewhere else and he just forgot or didn't have time to get his portion of the security deposit back from the landlord.   So for the next two years we go through two different replacements. It's been me and the other initial roommate, we'll call him ""SM) the entire time. Throughout these two years AC doesn't contact or seemingly care about his security deposit. Finally, when SM and I move out, we decide (perhaps wrongly) that fuck it, we'll just take out any common (shared damages) deductions from AC's portion of the security deposit. We do not notify AC about this. Suddenly, more than a month after we all moved out, AC messages me saying it wasn't fair that we took out the common damages from his portion.   So before we get started I just want to say that I agreed to try and work it out with AC, I'm not trying to turn this into some crazy small claims battle, and AC and I are friends. That being said, I do have questions about this (and yes I'm sour because he suddenly now cares about his deposit)  1) Is AC still entitled to his security deposit? Is there a law saying after a certain amount of time it's forfeit? He did get replaced in the lease, we didn't replace bodies without replacing the formal entity in the lease. Again, I already agreed to talk privately with AC first to try and reach an agreement. But this is such a confusing situation I wanted to talk to you guys for insight to satisfy my curiousness.   and on an emotional note: 2) I realize that we should have at least notified AC we were going to deduct from his portion. That is on us. However, do I have a right to feel annoyed? He didn't care about his share for so long and/or possibly didn't need the money, and now a month and a half after we move he wants it back all of a sudden?  Any guidance will be appreciated."	No
1645	"My 21 year old deaf stepdaughter is a full time college student at a prominent university in New York - our home state is Florida. She signed a lease for an apartment at a student housing complex (not affiliated with her university) last November, along with four of her deaf friends. In the process, she signed my husband's name as a cosigner to this lease. We just found this out in the last two weeks.    To give you some background info, because of her deafness, she essentially operates on a lower maturity level than most people her age - she acts and functions on about a 16-17 year old level. While I understand this is not an excuse to not act like an adult, we genuinely believe she didn't understand what was happening or what she was doing or how serious it was (she STILL is having trouble understanding the gravity of the situation). The entire time she dealt with this student housing complex, she thought she was filling out an application, and that was what she had communicated to my husband and I at the time. When she asked him for information about financials, he thought it was for a credit check for the application. She rushed all this at us last year in a few hours one afternoon while we were at work - everything had to be immediate because the housing complex was pressuring them to apply because ""all the apartments were going to be leased so fast."" He never saw the lease, and she signed his name to it without him knowing she was doing that. He would not have signed this lease if he'd known or read it. She didn't tell us anything about this until two weeks ago, because suddenly all her friends are also not going to live in this apartment because none of their government funding, which all five of them rely fully on, is going to cover off campus housing, even though the apartment complex told them it would be no problem. So really, there are five students here who have signed this lease, and none of them plan to live there.    I have no idea what anyone else's parents are doing, but we've tried explaining the situation to the apartment complex, and they are adamant that the lease is binding and the only option is for the students to find someone to relet their rooms to. However, if none of them move in August 1, the entire rent defaults and is due immediately for everyone. They all live down here in Florida, and only are able to talk to their friends and post on facebook groups to find someone to relet to, which is proving futile. The apartment complex has placed them on a ""relet list"" but they only refer to that list once the entire complex is full, which it isn't at this time. We're now on the hook for over $10k for this because my husband's name is on this lease.    I don't know enough about real estate law, or if there's anything we can do about this situation, or if we're just stuck because our name is legally on this lease. We're trying to get in touch with the legal services at the school, but because it's still summer, it's hard to get a hold of anyone. Is there any way we can get out of this lease? What would happen if we pursued legal action against our daughter for signing my husbands name without her knowledge? While paying the $10k bill monthly or immediately is really going to be incredibly hard for us, we could feasibly consider paying for a lawyer if it could get us out of this lease.    TL;DR - deaf stepdaughter fraudulently signed our name to lease as cosigner for student housing; will not be living there, can't get out of lease.  Is there anything we can do?"	No
1646	Hello! My four friends and I rented a house for the past school year.  We moved out on May 14th. We still have not received our security deposits back from the landlord because he just told us one of our friends didn't pay rent for the spring semester yet. We confronted the friend and he said the landlord was right and he'll send it in asap (which he did). This was about 2 weeks ago. We still have not received the deposits back and have not heard from the landlord. Is he allowed to withhold ALL of our deposits for one person not paying their rent?	No
1647	"After moving to NYC last summer for work, I signed a 2 year lease in a rent-stabilized housing development. Due to unforeseen circumstances I have had to suddenly move to another state this month. In order to avoid paying a heavy (3 months rent) early termination fee, I was hoping to assign my lease to another party. However, my landlord is making it very difficult to do this, and I suspect that they are violating my lease by in doing so.  In particular, while my unit has a legal regulated rent, when I signed the lease it was with a preferential rent rider that stipulated that the landlord would accept a substantially lower monthly dollar amount through the end of the two year lease period. This preferential rent rider also has a successors and assigns clause applying to both myself and the landlord. To my untrained eye, it seems as though this clause should mean that my landlord must also accept this preferential rent as payment from any potential lease assignees. However, after I found someone to take over the lease, I was told by the legal department at this development that there would be no preferential rent for this assignee and they would instead be required to pay the full legal regulated rent (plus some adjustments). When I asked them about the successors and assigns clause in my preferential rent rider they wrote:   ""We stand by all of the information provided to you.""   They then stopped responding to my emails. Because the adjusted legal regulated rent for the unit is about 33% above market value, it was too much for my assignee to pay. Accordingly, my assignee had to back out and I am proceeding with termination of the lease, as I cannot imagine finding any reasonable person to pay this much for the unit.  I have two questions:  (1) Does the successors and assigns clause in my preferential rent rider mean that it should apply to someone to whom I assign my lease?  (2) If so, hasn't my landlord violated the rider (and thus the lease), giving me grounds for legal action against them?  Thanks for your help!!"	No
1648	As the title says, I'm moving to St. Croix from the mainland US in August. I have a few months of expenses saved, interviews lined up, and I'd like to think I'm as prepared as I'll ever be. The only particularly tricky aspect of this move has been finding an affordable rental without physically being on the island. Until about a week ago. I was given the contact to info of a landlord by a current tennant, after all my info checked out, she approved me and emailed me a copy of the lease agreement to sign and send back. Now, where the finance comes in. The Landlord would like me to send the security deposit via check or money order in order to reserve the apartment, which doesn't seem unreasonable to me considering I won't be moving in until the 17th of August. But a friend of mine made me doubt myself. Is there anything I can do to ensure I am not putting my security deposit at risk by sending it?  TL;DR Is there anything I can do to ensure I am not putting my security deposit at risk by sending it to an island I'm not currently on.	No
1649	My wife and I are in the middle of short sale that we started in December 2016. To clarify we are selling our house and moving in with her parents. My aunt died about two weeks ago and we just found out that her house has my name and my sisters name on the deed. Apparently it was my aunts wish that me and my sister sell the house and split the money. My sister is currently in the process of getting the house ready to sell. I have a couple pf questions: Will this in anyway affect the short sale? Do my wife and I have to inform our lawyer and real estate agent that I may be getting money from this house? Can my mortgage company put a lien on my aunts house and or take all of the proceeds from the sale of the house? If I have my name removed from the deed will there be any legal repercussions? If anymore details are needed please ask. Thanks, Al from Maryland	No
1650	Suburbs of Denver They live in a duplex. Both sisters rent out their own side of the duplex. Sister #2 is getting evicted for not paying rent. Landlord in a text said that the children are not allowed back on the property of Sister #1's side. Is this legal?	No
1651	I signed a lease from 2015 to 2016 in Texas.  At th end of the lease we let the private landlord know we wanted to renew it. She mailed me a paragraph which I signed.  She was supposed to mail me a copy once she signed but never did.  Currently, she is taking some liberties with my security deposit and I am trying to figure out what is legit per lease and what I signed.  I asked for a copy and she sent me a copy of the lease where she typed in my name.  Can I compel her to give me a copy of the actual signed addendum? I clarified that I wanted to see what I had actually signed and have heard crickets.  Am I legally responsible for a lease I didn't actually sign?  Thanks in advance for your help.	No
1652	A company called conservice is a third party biller for our apartment complexes water.  Long story short a year ago we had a water bill that said we used 12,000 gallons in a month.  This is impossible in a two person household particularly in a small two bedroom apartment.    Naturally we called and complained and they told us it was possible and we should conserve.  The next month was 8k gallons.  We knew something was wrong.  We requested all of our previous bills and they were all insanely high.    About 5 months after the initial complaint they finally sent a tech out and with a simple bucket test discovered that our meter was reading 7x normal (a ten gallon bucket registered as 70 gallons).   Here we are 6 months after that and the meter is still broken but they are continuing to charge us on a completely fictitious number of gallons.  They've been out a second time and determined that they need to change the pipe as well as the meter and on top of that our meter is the same rfid as another in the complex so both units are being double billed.    Is this fraud at this point?  Do we have legal recourse?   We are one of 5 units with faulty meters could this be class action?    And they charge is $13 a month for the bill.	No
1653	I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52). They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month. Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month. On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym). I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months. The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer. Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes. I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!	No
1654	"Hi, I have an apartment with the lease in my name. I also have a roommate who is not paying rent and I want them to leave. She will not communicate with me, so I ca't even ask her to leave. She only comes back to the apartment when she knows I'm at work. She won't answer my calls or texts.  At this point, I don't care about the back pay in rent; I just want her gone. I'm scared that she will hurt my cat or steal my stuff.  What I want to do is have the locks changed and put a note on the door that says, ""Call me and I will let you pack up your stuff to leave"". Since she is not on the lease, the main office won't be able to let her in or give her a key. I'm worried that this is illegal though? I'm not trying to keep her stuff; I just want her to talk to me.  Could anyone give me some insight as to what to do?"	No
1655	"Hi, last year I was charged with petit theft, around September (stupid, I know). I've been paying my fines on time and haven't been in any further trouble and don't plan to.   Today I received a letter for a ""notice of resetting hearing"". Does anyone know why this would happen? I was sentenced last year and my punishment was one day in jail (served) and a few hundred dollar fine, which I am paying and haven't missed any payments. The reset is set for August 23rd, so next month. One month before my sentencing last year.   Sorry I'm just a little flustered and nervous, I wanted this put behind me. If you have any questions I'll answer them."	No
1656	Can someone help me find a warrant? I have called the jails. The only thing I have is the Warrant or Case Number.	No
1657	So I recently purchased a mobile home. I confirmed with the owners of the park that it could stay there.  Well after paying the application fee (which is still pending) I was told I was denied and had two days to move the home or they'll tow it and charge me, unless I pay them $1500 (which so happens to be the previous owners past due amount)   They also went on to say I was denied due to the previous owner. I've never met the woman before buying the house.  Is this legal, what can I do?   I have a gut feeling they're going to tow the house away regardless if I pay them.   The lot manager even went on to say that I couldn't afford the $1500 and that even if I do pay it I'll most likely be evicted anyways	No
1658	So, we noticed the beginnings of some rot on the siding &amp; decking over this past winter and decided to tear it all out and get it repaired.  When the contractor pulled off the ledgerboard for the deck, the siding was completely rotted out and came off with the ledgerboard.  We expected this, but what we did not expect is that there was ZERO sheathing or moisture barrier under the siding.  It's T1-11 plywood siding nailed directly to studs, no tyvek, no OSB sheathing.  The only thing separating the insulation &amp; studs from the outside elements is the cheap 8'x4' plywood or pressboard siding sheets.  Can I sue the previous homeowner (they had it built in 1983, original owners) or sue the inspector?  Does homeowners insurance cover this?	No
1659	Question from someone I know: 2 months ago she began to rent a room in a home with the owner on a verbal agreement that she would stay for 12 months. Absolutely no paperwork was done or signed by the owner or my friend. The owner was paid by cash and check weekly (~$700 per month). Last week, she decided to move out but the owner said that she still had to pay rent for the remaining 10 months, and expected a 1 month notice that she was moving. My friend offered to pay rent for one more month, and the owner accepted, but claimed that they would pursue the case in small court (I don't know what that means?) How much ground does the owner have in this case?   (Ohio)	No
1660	My uncle was a landscaper. He was working for someone that owns a family business company. They were working on a  yard and he needed to get something from the back of the truck. While he was standing behind the parked truck someone under the influence drove by and struck him . That was at 2pm yesterday. He was pronounced dead at the hospital around 3pm that day. His wife and children are obviously distraught. The man that hit him has prior d.u.i convictions. A couple of months ago my dad (his brother) passed away. My uncle was generous enough to help put in thousands for my dads funeral but with doing that his family is left with little to no money for my uncles funeral and other expenses. If the guy driving doesn't have a legal license or isn't insured are they at a loss? Is there any legal action they should try to take?	No
1661	I have two credit card debt default judgements against me from about 5 years ago.  Even though my credit is repaired now, I am concerned if those creditors can still use that default judgement to come after my brokerage account.  I have recently opened a brokerage account where I am attempting to do some stock trading and my concern is if those creditors from the past can use those judgements to try to seize and/or garnish my brokerage account and I end up losing all funds in it?  The judgements were issued in an NYC court.  Any input would be appreciated.	No
1662	So my other post is on here but I'll cut to the chase now. My ex has a RO against me and I found a video on my google drive that was connected to my old phone of her sexually assaulting and raping me in my sleep. I called the police and they are having an officer call me back. She took the footage on my phone while i was asleep. I can't get in trouble for having this footage can I? Should I not report? Please help. The officer should be calling me any minute.	No
1663	Hi all,  This information is all from my mom's memory and she told me as many details as she could recollect.   My mom is currently 56 years old (California current residence). She came from Guatemala in 1989 with my dad and oldest brother. They were caught by immigration. After paying a $500 fine per person they were let go with court dates etc. My mom actually was pregnant with me at the time. I was born and a couple of months later she went back to Guatemala to see her family. My dad (now deceased) attended all court dates but she did not because she was not in the country.   When she returned around '92-'95 she applied for a work permit and was granted one that lasted from 8-10 years. Around the time the permit was up she received a letter that informed her that she needed to apply for residency. She went to see a lawyer and due to fear told him she was in the country when she was required to appear in court but was unsure of what to do so she did not attend. (In reality she was in Guatemala and that's why she wasn't present but she has been too afraid to admit this fearing the consequences.)   She applied for residency in the mid-2000s and went through the process almost getting to end until she was informed that due to the 1989 deportation order it would not be granted. She was too scared to do anything else and that's where the situation is now.  My mom has been in the country now since returning from Guatemala for 25 consecutive years. I am 27 and a citizen that lived abroad for about a year after she had me. Currently she is married to an immigrant from Mexico. She has three children born in the United States including me aged 27, 25, and 17. She is still scared every day of being deported and asked me to please seek out any resources/advice I can regarding her particular situation to try and find options for her to become a legal resident.  I appreciate anyone and everyone's advice. Thank you so much.	No
1664	"I am the only one of my 4 roommates moving out. I am moving out of my apartment on August 2nd. The next tenant waived the ""clean up"" period to move in as soon as I move out. The apartment complex told me that they don't prorate rent and that I need to pay the full month, but told the other guy that they DO prorate rent and that he would have to pay for the time he lived in the apartment, which is essentially the whole month. So they are basically charging both of us a full month's rent for the same room in the apartment. Is it legal for them to prorate for him but not for me? They are double dipping and it feels illegal, but I'm not a lawyer."	No
1665	"I need some advice as I'm not sure that what my landlord is doing, is actually legal  and junk.   Ok. Been at my apartment for well over a year now, and their is a parking lot right outside the building. I was told that there was 1 parking spot available for each apartment. Not assigned spots, but just a ""park anywhere"" kind of gig. I've never had any issues before.   This spring I got a job closer to my apartment so I stopped using it as much. Eventually, because everything I need is within walking distance, I stopped using it all together. I didn't think much of it until my landlord told me I need to move it.   Now they are stating that their insurance doesn't allow car's to be stored there and the insurance company is saying I have to move my car.   I explained I wasn't storing it, just haven't been using it and plan to start using it again in the future. But that's not good enough, they want it gone because ""The insurance company says it has to move"". If I don't move it they are going to tow it at my expense.   I'm getting a weird feeling like they're lying to me or what they are doing isn't legal. But I could also be dead wrong.  I'm just looking for some advice on how to navigate this. Thanks."	No
1666	Last night I got hit with a possession and paraphernalia citation. I'm in Missouri so their new decriminalization law of marijuana keeps the fine to only $25 but that's not all I am worried about.   I was sitting at my buddies house waiting for him to come home, he was taking longer than usual so I had been sitting there for a solid 20 minutes or so and then some cops pull up. They tell me one of the neighbors called about a suspicious car (which is BS because I have had this car for 3 years and am at this buddies house at a minimum of once a week, I am 100% sure they have seen my car on multiple occasions)   I wasn't smoking, not even a cig, my car was off and I was just browsing Reddit. When the cop started to talk to me he noticed a blunt on my floorboard. They of course confiscated everything, but they were very nice about it, probably understanding it was just coincidence and I wasn't even doing anything.   I ended up getting a citation for possession and paraphernalia and my court date is in October. Now what I'm really worried about is the fact I want to be a firefighter, I'm already certified but I'm worried about getting hired somewhere now. I haven't been smoking very long, and was going to quit once I started taking some more classes in the fall. Is there any way I can keep this off my record? It would pretty much destroy my whole plan in life if I can't be a firefighter, I've been training and taking classes for it since high school.   Any help or suggestions would be great, my buddy said I should get a lawyer to try and keep it off my record, but I don't know if that would actually work, and I don't have tons of spare cash lying around for one. Thank you.	No
1667	Not fixing anything. Long story short. My landlord will not fix any issues regarding rental unit. I have lived here for 4 yrs and in those 4 yrs he has only fixed one problem, after 3 yrs of trying to get him to fix it, which was the shower hot and cold water. Before that, i would go buy repair kits to fix myself. Anytime someone is taking a shower upstairs, water will pour down into the living area. The section of ceiling has a hole and mold around the area where it comes from. He knows about this, but will not address it. Also, there is leakage from the AC unit upstairs, leaks down to the landing behind the wall and has caused mold to form on the landing and on the floor at the base of the stairs. He claims that the skylight is leaking so its the HOA's problem. Carpet stays wet even if it isnt raining. Now onto the carpet. He installed what i call scrap carpet. Instead of one piece for the living area, it is in sections. Shortly after moving in, the carpet started to separate in the middle of the living room. His response....i should buy an area rug and cover it. The carpet has also separated, top from the bottom, so cleaning the carpet will not work. So now we are battling over this and what is actually owed in rent, thats another tell for another day. Question is, whom do i call to get him to fix these issues? I called the city and they said to work it out with the landlord. A lawyer is out of the question due to finances. Any direction will be helpful.	No
1668	I'm in Florida, though this probably pertains to federal law. I had my wisdom teeth extracted early this year and I was prescribed far more hydrocodone than I would conceivably take. I don't care for opioids or the way they make me feel, so I probably never would have taken any more of those pills, and I had just put the bottle in my cabinet and ignored it. Yesterday, I noticed that the bottle was missing. There are only a couple of people I suspect could have taken it. One was a complete stranger who was in the house in order to assist with installing a security system, but another is a close friend of the family. I really do NOT care about the pills, and I don't want to burn any bridges asking questions about (or of) the friend of the family. However, I know that giving my prescription medication to another person can be a serious offense (I think it's a felony), and with the crackdown on opioids, I am concerned that if my pill bottle shows up in someone else's stash, this could come back to bite me if I don't file a police report about the missing pills. I really don't want the hassle and I *really* don't want to cause trouble for anyone else, but I need to know how serious it is that I cover my own butt here. How far would denying that I even realized the pills were gone go? Are police likely to even investigate something this small? We're talking maybe 20 pills here, tops (probably fewer---it's not like I counted).	No
1669	"I signed a 12 month lease for my current apartment which ends next spring. The landlord never sent me back a signed copy of this lease, and it specifically says in the lease that ""This form becomes a binding lease renewal when signed by the owner below and returned to the tenant."" They also never provided any required attachments --lead warning and a rider regarding rent stabilization law.   I contacted the landlord about leaving early at the end of August and they came back at me that they want me gone even sooner at the end of July because according to them that is what my lease says (which is not true at all). They also said if I do not vacate then they will be billing me for damages (which there are no damages other than normal wear and tear).  I plan to stay through the end of August regardless.  My main question is -- Is it ok to not pay them last months rent and to just use my security deposit as the last month, since I'm sure I will never see that deposit again based on their rudeness; and since my lease is not technically executed?   Or do i risk legal action from them and risk getting sent to collections for not paying the last months rent?  I would appreciate any advice!"	No

1671	I recently got into a fender bender with the other person being at fault. Their car is fine, mine is not, and I have to pay a $500 insurance deductible to get my car fixed. Does anyone have advice or tips for how to get the other person to pay this deductible, or at least pay part of it? I've heard I can take him to small claims court, but how successful would I be in doing so? I'm a poor college student and I can't afford another $500 when I just spent that amount 2 days before on new tires.	No
1672	I am a homeowner. The house next door is vacant due to the owner being in a nursing home. Her son, whom I have never met and cannot get hold of, is supposedly a real prick according to my other neighbors. They tell me he will likely never sell or rent it out as it was his childhood home. Seems stupid to me to leave it empty, but whatever.  Long story short, the yard next door has become overgrown with blackberry bushes and other brambles and scrub. It's infested with vermin (had rats in my my attic over the winter, and have seen them scurrying over the fence from his yard), and the brambles are destroying the posts of the 7 foot fence between our yards. The fence is on my property.  My one neighbor who has his contact info was reluctant to give it to me, but he did reach out on my behalf a few months back to no avail. At this point, I do not want to deal with or talk to the owner's son. I will happily eat the time and cost of trimming/fence repair just to resolve the issue.  I want to know: Am I within my legal rights to go into this yard with a brush cutter ($75 to rent for 4 hours ought to do it) and take care of it?	No
1673	We just moved into a new (to us) apartment with brand new furniture we just bought and the place is absolutely stifling. They've tried to fix it and it just keeps breaking. I constantly run a dehumidifier, but it doesn't do much good. I sleep in a moist bed every night and my furniture is being exposed to less than ideal conditions. It's an expensive place as well with excellent reviews. Is there anything I can do or say to maybe leverage them into giving us a new unit or something? Thanks!	No
1674	As stated in Title. I just began working in the area a coworker has said I can move in to help save my rent money and their mortgage. As far as I'm aware they own the home and have one or two people already living in the home with them. Is there anything we should sign or get put in writing other than what my obligations are as far as rent and utilities goes. Also how official does the rent, utilities, and anything else need to be?	No
1675	"TLDR; my lawyer is advising me to bring the money I'm accused of stealing to my preliminary hearing to avoid heavy charges and plea to a summary offense.   The city police have followed through and charged me with theft. I met with my lawyer yesterday and he advised me to think about bringing the $150 (I'm being wrongfully accused of taking) to my court hearing next week. He said that even though I'm innocent, ""throwing money at something sometimes makes it go away""..He says that all the prosecutor needs to prove at my preliminary hearing is that I was in Warren at the time of the incident. That my presence in my hometown is damning enough for a judge to assume they have enough evidence to go to trial. And that if I AM convicted, I'll be seeing 2 years of probation and a HUGE fine-FOR A CRIME I NEVER COMMITTED. I'm so scared and confused. I'm not sure a jury WOULD find me innocent or not. Maybe I feel that way bc I'm scared out of my mind... He said if I bring the $150, that I would be facing a summary offense, and a small fine instead of facing jail time or probation. He says that sometimes even though we're innocent, the criminal justice system finds us guilty anyway. Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated!"	No
1676	Our landlord says he has evidence of us breaking lease by letting another person live in the attic of our home. On our signed lease we have 4 people and a few rooms permanently locked and we signed it. Now he says we had 5 people living in the attic and says we have to get them out and he will come lock the attic. He sent this today and they plan on coming out Monday. We never had 5 people and there are just couches and a TV upstairs they are still there. The attic was not locked on the lease. We live in Newark DE. Do we have any options? Thanks	No
1677	Upstate NY, Exact Town or county unknown as of this time but most likely within the 518 area code.  Basically as the title states.  I'm currently shopping for a home, and as a single person, I would like to potentially rent out the spare bedroom firstly because I prefer not to live alone, and secondly to recoup some of the costs of owning a home.  I would like to rent to a single person, or a childless couple, which is what leads me to this question.  To be frank, I won't have children living in my house.  I myself am permanently childfree, and I do not want to end up having to childproof my home, or be asked to babysit.  I know that as a landlord, this would be discrimination, but as I am using this property as my primary residence, would the same rules/laws apply?  I have tried to find information via Google but it seems like a lot of sources I find contradict each other.	No
1678	"So as the title states I bought a used truck from a used car dealership and they claimed they would be sending the title to my bank since they are the lein holders. My bank says they have a copy of the title but not the original. I've just found out that the dealer went out of business when I texted the salesman who sold me the vehicle after the dealer phone hasn't been picked up for a while, and he told me ""they went out of business I dont work there anymore you gotta do what you gotta do."" I bought this vehicle in the state of Connecticut and I live in rhode island. Basically I am wondering what on earth I have to do to get my hands on a title. It is an 07 and needs a title to be registered still. What I have come up with to do so far is to find out who the owner of the business was and contact them and see if they have it. Does anyone know how i would find out who opened the business? Is it public record anywhere or anything like that? Also do I contact either the RI or CT dmv's about this? And can they even do anything for me? I will be letting my bank know as soon as they open in the morning since they are the lein holders on the vehicle. If there is anything else I can do please let me know I only have until the 17th until my temporary plates expire. The only information the business had to contact them was 1 landline phone and nothing else. The phone is off/disconnected and have no other way to contact them as the salesman isnt getting back to me anymore I have had the vin checked and it is supposedly a clean vehicle even though this situation is very sketchy. If anyone is interested in going past advice and doing some sleuthing the business was called Atlantic motors based in waterbury CT.

1679	Hey everyone.  There is a great internship opportunity for me in San Francisco that I'm applying for. It's only for the spring and it's a paid internship. I live around 2 hours from it but I want to somehow get a place to stay for the duration of the job. Is this legal at all? And if so, how would I go about doing this?

1680	Hello, I entered into an illegal sublet agreement with the lease holder in February, 2017 who had taken a security deposit and overcharged us on bills. However, while moving in we were notified by the landlord that the lease holder had no permission to do this and we signed under a new sublet agreement with the landlord with an additional deposit.  We had to end our sublet earlier than the termination date and the lease holder doesn't want to come back to finish her lease, wants us to remove all of her furniture and items, and is refusing to give back our security deposit.   We found out about the bills when we found out from the landlord that the rent is $400 cheaper than what the lease holder demanded, but after discussing with her we relented to just paying her that amount, even without proof of receipts. Stupid, I know, but I was naive and she was adamant and pregnant so we just dropped it.   Can we sue them for the overpaid bills and the lack of security deposit or is it null because we signed into a sublet with the landlord? As a subletter am I responsible for terminating the sublet early? I have the lease agreement (with the landlord because I'm assuming the one signed with the lease holder is void) and to me it seems like there isn't a clause about such an event except for one part which I'm not sure if it says that I am the responsible one for the termination or if it is the lease holder's responsibility. From websites I've looked at it seems that it's not the subletter responsibility.  Other than ending early, we've been as helpful as we can and the landlord initially told us she empathized with us and that she would give back our additional security we had given to management, but now I think that the lease holder lied to her and now the landlord is saying she can't guarantee it. They've been coming in and out with repairmen and showing the apartment while we've been here busy packing so it's been a bit of a bother as well.  We're both not well off financially so I don't know how much it would cost to sue or how we can go about getting our security back, if we even can.  Very sorry about the long wall of text. Any information and advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.	No
1681	"Well, there were no responses to this but I wanted to submit one in case somebody came here looking for something similar.  I did *not* have a bench warrant. The lady that initially told me there was a problem with my license was saying that I probably had one, but, as it turns out, they just communicated my unpaid traffic fines to the Georgia DDS.   I called first thing this morning, and the folks at the courthouse told me how much I owed and allowed me to pay over the phone. They then told me it would be immediately removed from the system, BUT in order for there to not be an issue getting a new license, I can call their courthouse with the DMV office I'm going to tomorrow, and they will contact the office directly and let them know of the status.  Basically, I can get my license again and be legal now that I paid my fines, and I only had to Uber to work one day. :) Yay. I'm by no means saying that this was a good situation to be in, but I was absolutely terrified of what this meant when I initially realized what was going on. Google searching ""Didn't show up for traffic tickets in Georgia"" yields terrifying results. I was surprised I wasn't arrested right then and there at the DMV after googling all night.  But, this is a lesson learned."	No
1682	"So for those of you who are familiar with Chicago, we have a large amount of speed enforcement cameras and red light cameras throughout the city. While driving down north clybourne, there were alot of young kids and adults jaywalking, causing me to brake suddenly twice in a one mile section.  I ended up only going 25 mph on a 30 mph because I feared it would happen again, and a speed enforcement camera ending up triggering on me  and the car behind me as we passed it and as I was going five under. Would it be possible for me to receive a citation do going too slowly, even given the circumstances? Is it possible the camera triggered due to two cars occupying it's ""zone"" at the same time? Would it be possible to contest the ticket in front of a hearing officer and using the testimony of my passenger? Sorry for what probably seems like a run of the mill post; I'm just afraid and annoyed that I might get ticketed for trying to be safe in an area they want to fine people to drive safely in."	No
1683	"I moved into a house several months ago and on account of having cash upfront, the landlord did not run a background check or check my credit, nor did I sign anything permitting him to do so. He doesn't have my social security number and didn't ask for any identifying information, so I could be John Doe instead of Joseph Doe, for all he knows, though I'm not.  There have been problems getting him to repair anything in a timely and correct manner. He commented that I ""have a problem with everyone"" and referenced a suit I'm named in; It's a class action lawsuit that I was invited to join and an issue with a company and their business practices, not an individual, so it barely has any relevance. I asked how he knew about it and he said that ""he has a guy.""  I know that background checks etc. can be run at the inception of tenancy, but the lawsuit was filed about three months after I moved in. Is he allowed to essentially keep a tab on me, or does it not matter since, if you search the Court Index, you can find my name listed as a plaintiff, and it's therefore considered public information?   Thanks for any help."	No
1684	"Hello all,  I am in a predicament right now regarding my current employer. I recently became a member of the management team at a new local restaurant. My company currently has six restaurants under its belt, and we opened this new restaurant for business last year and I've worked there since. My co-supervisor was recently trained on how to complete payroll before payday rolled around. In passing she candidly said: &gt;I have so much work to do! I have to go through everyone's time punches and edit them to be at least 5 minutes before their shift.  Our company policy essentially states that all employee's punches that are earlier than 5 minutes before a scheduled shift time will be edited to be, at most, 5 minutes before that shift.   That night I talked to one of our company's longer tenured managers and asked him about this practice. He told me that its ""company policy"" and everyone agreed to these policies when they signed their contracts. Many of the managers at other restaurants seem complacent about this practice. I know that you can't just write whatever you want in a contract and call it a day so I was thinking this may be an unenforceable.  I did some light research on the topic on the DOL's website and, from my understanding of the law, the law states that an employer may only edit time punches if an employee incorrectly recorded time (i.e forgetting to clock in or out). But they may not edit time punches in order to reflect something like a ""company policy.""  Now I'm not losing any sleep from my punch being edited from 2:54pm to 2:55pm. I am, however, concerned that my company is simply operating unethically. I want to talk to my HR representative and understand more about where this policy is coming from. But I also feel a little slimy doing payroll and having to edit these punches. Long term I am not interested in going to court about lose wages, etc. I just want my company to operate ethically and fairly.  So, my questions: 1) Is this legal at all? 2) Is this employment contract ""unenforceable"" because of this verbiage? 3) Is there anything a lowly supervisor can do about this company-wide practice?  Thanks in advance"	No
1685	My wife and I rent a small one bedroom home from her uncle, which shares a back yard on the same lot or two lots connected. My wife has some mental health issues that prevents her from working currently and last month is brutal and had a lot of things hit us hard and we were late on rent quite a bit. I talked to him and he made everything sound like it was okay.  I was messaged on facebook about the new lease even though our current lease doesn't end til November. He states that we must keep the attic window open from spring till fall or its a 200 fine per month. Anything left on my porch is $25 fine, she must park on the street and not use the three car spot on the lot. If our dog uses the yard to pee or poop its a $25 per incident. all of which end with can lead to eviction. I can't leave the property for more than 2 days with out written notification. Which I assume is part of his insurance clause. Also rent goes up in jan according to the new lease, and each day its late prior to the increase is $5 and $10 after increase per day after the 1st. In the original lease we had until the 5th before it was due. I am sure its all because of last months drama which I was hoping a close family member would have understood what I was going through trying to keep my wife alive.   The attic window is kinda insane to me, I get the theory behind it but we don't have insulation in the attic nor any moisture barrier and it just seems like in bringing an excess of moisture which is bad for electronics and other things. Maybe I am out of line.   I can't afford to move, and I will abide by his requests it just seems far fetched in some areas as if its more of a trap than anything.  Any ideas of this is all legal or is he over reaching in some areas?  Thank you kindly.	No
1686	"I'll summarize what had happened:  I was driving up to an onramp, and traffic was moving up when the car in front of me slammed on their brakes and I slammed on mine but my car still hit their back bumper. The person behind me had a lot of distance from me, and his car was unaffected but I immediately notice him running to the car in front of me. They spoke a foreign language to one another for a while before I could get their information. When I asked the young driver what had happened, for their side of the incident and why they slammed on their brakes, they said I hit them and caused them to hit another car in front of them. Moments later, the ""witness"" turned out to be the front (car that my car hit)  drivers father. This was my first accident, and I drive on this street/onramp daily for work, it seemed extremely fishy to me that he waited until we parted to mention that was his daughter and he was following her. I sustained a neck injury, and leg injury from the accident, and the others said they're fine with no injuries. I was already on the phone with my insurance when I asked them if they had any injuries. Their insurance card stated it expired back in February.     Should I report this to my insurance or have them investigate?"	No
1687	I purchased a computer and it cost over $1500. The computer was slow, incredible heavy, and very large. This was a computer that was stated as mandatory by the university but when you get there you quickly realize that is not the case. I emailed the support email stating that this computer does not seem adequate to what needs to be done, and compared to the other options. They asked me to meet with them and offered to replace the computer with another model. I accepted the offer but now they want me to meet with a guy from the company that made the computer. I waited for the email from this corporate guy and it took about a month. He has been slow to reply ever since then. I'm talking a week or days. He set up a meeting for a few weeks out, then emailed me a few days later saying he was in town, give him a call, and we can meet if I'm available. I called, no answer, left a voice mail, no call back, emailed mentioning the call and that he could call back at any time that suits him, no email back for 3 days so far.   At this point I am just tired of the process. I don't really want to deal with this any more and the weak computer seems to be less of a hassle than this process. What can I do? do I have to keep going through this process?       ---      **tl;dr**: Customer service of university offered to replace computer and the process is just incredibly tiring. They are slow to reply and it seems to be more work than its worth	No
1688	For example, a former 3 bedroom apartment is being rented to separate individuals for say $1800/each, and not to three roommates (or a family) who rent it together. I am not sure, but I believe this is illegal since non of the landlords are operating hotels but rental apartment buildings. So I guess my question is: is this now somehow legal and if not how to proceed to make landlord abide by the law?	No
1689	"I was blackout drunk. The girl said nothing happened. Ex-father-in-law said he saw sex. I fought the case for a year. Assistant DA said they were going to bring in an expert to say the girl had ""Stolkholm syndrome"" and felt the need to defend me since she had a history of sexual abuse. Lawyer advised I take a plea for a county year and 5 years felony probation with the requirement that I ""p.c. 290 register while on probation."" That's a direct quote from my minute orders. I finished my probation, without incident and am still stuck on the registration. My lawyer called my charge a wobbler. This was all in California. Is there anything I can do?"	No
1690	"I'm trying to find a job so I can afford to leave an unhealthy marriage. My immature husband cannot handle this like an adult and is now telling me that if I'm not gone (from our apartment) in a week, he's going to call lawyers and the authorities. Because he makes 90% of our household income and pays rent etc. he feels he has the legal hand and that he can kick me out because I'm a ""squatter"" who is ""taking advantage of him"". Both our names are on the lease. I give him money monthly (we have separate bank accounts) to contribute to expenses but it isn't much. Is there any legal authority he can take with regards to living space?"	No
1691	"A while back, I bit down on a rock hidden inside a sandwich.  There was a loud crack and a sharp pang but no ongoing pain.  I notified staff and they talked to me and disposed of it before I could get a picture.  I didn't notice any damage or lasting pain so I didn't make a big deal out of it.  Fast forward two weeks, it's starting to hurt, I get it fixed.  I'm talking to the company, I have a picture of the food, a receipt for the dessert I got, but not the sandwich itself.  I'm trying to play nice and I don't exactly want to sue since I really like this place.  The company is saying things like ""well since you don't really have any definitive proof..."" and coming up with excuses with insurance... and offering me 1k to settle.  I declined since I didn't think it'd cover the dental work.  They bumped it up by a bit, still doesn't cover my dental work...   I kept telling them I wanted to wait till I settled the dental work.  There were quite a few complications and trips to the dentist.   Finally, most of the dental work is done and I have a pretty good idea of how much this is going to cost.  They offer the cost of my dental bills and a tiny sum of cash.  I feel like they're trying to screw me over while I'm sitting here trying to play nice.  What should I do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Let me know if more details are necessary. Thanks for reading!"	No
1692	Hey, so I'm getting laid off in the state of Pennsylvania. I have a bit of advanced warning, and I know they are going to offer me a shitty contract employee position that pays by the job.  I'm not going to accept that job, and am actively looking for work. It won't pay nearly as well, and involves being out in the field 100%, while my current position only requires occasional field work.   Can I file for unemployment in my state? Or does my rejecting the shitty job disqualify me? I'm pretty surey boss offers everyone he fires a shitty job to avoid paying unemployment to anyone.   It won't affect my decision, but it will help me plan financially.   Thanks!	No
1693	I live in Pennsylvania and roughly a month ago my wife and I moved into our new house. We were renting from a company have them a few months notice since we were paying month to month. We told them our last day would be June 30th and that we wouldn't be paying for July since we would be moved out. Fast forward 3 weeks our bank accidently cut an auto pay check to the company for rent. The lady who we spoke to about us moving out is the one that cashed our check and now it's almost August still no return check. She stated the day that it happened she would write us a check the next week which is now 2 weeks late. We have all of this documented through email. So my question is, can I do something to have them write me a check since they really took our money without permission? Anything would be helpful thank you.	No
1694	My landlord just gave back my security deposit with a note. They said they had to repaint the walls which is something I accounted for. But for the first time ever I see they took out money for time. 320 dollar for 8 hours. Is this allowed? If so, 40 dollars a hour? I live in Virginia. If anyone can point me in the right direction with information I would greatly appreciate it.	No
1695	Never doing those shifts again which amount to about $4 per hour and required I essentially lived at the doggy day care (there was a bed downstairs to sleep on) for the duration of the time. They initally told me that this payment is counted as 'salary' even though I was told upon being hired that I was paid/hour as minimum wage.  I've worked under the table before but have never been this unfairly compensated. Am I right in thinking they are blatantly violating the law?	No
1696	posted this in finance but no one seems to know... So I am about to buy a house by myself on the title and my girlfriend is going to live me. I will be paying for all the bills utilities and the cost of the house. What happens if say 15 years later we are still not married but we split up. Would I still keep the house or would she be entitled to some percentage of it since she lived in it. Do I need to go to a lawyer before we make the move?	No
1697	My sister is a Canadian citizen who married a US citizen over a year ago.  They had a child about 7 months ago, born in Canada.  She tried to cross the border yesterday with the aforementioned family and she was denied, because they believed her to be emigrating to the states, which in a way she was, but she wasn't aware of how strict the process to emigrate was.  Her husband has a job in the states and he had to go, but she had to stay here.  As far as I know, being denied from the border already puts her on a list which makes it harder to enter.  She's been living long-distance from her husband for a very long time already, she was very excited to finally have the family together and after returning early this morning she has been crying on and off all day, I haven't really seen her this torn before.  Is there anything she can do at this point?      Any and all information would be extremely helpful.  Thank you ahead of time.	No
1698	"To preface, we live in Georgia in the United States. My girlfriend is 19 years old.   So my girlfriend was offered a job as a manager of a brand new store that was opening up at the beginning of July. This was the second of an already existing store in the town we live in. She was offered the manager position, $12 a hour, at least 40 hours a week, the freedom to make her own schedule, 5% of sales at the end of the year from both stores, and a bonus at the end of year.   So they hired her and no contracts were signed before or after hiring. No official papers stating what she would be doing or that she worked there at all. She starts the job during her two week notice at her previous job. They ""train"" her, which was really just teaching her how to run the register and computer system and using her for labor. She was told to find employees to run the new store that would open roughly four weeks after she started. So I help her set up an online ad for the position of part time employee and numerous (probably 30) applications came in.   She reached out to a few applicants to set up interviews only to be told it was completely up to her to hire these employees because they would be splitting her hours with her. So she decided to hire none and no interviews took place. During her time at the pre existing store she worked alone probably 80% of the time. Over 40 hours a week not by choice.   So the new store opens up. It's a good 40 minute drive to the new location for everyone involved. She's scheduled to work everyday its open for the first week. And she works there with the owners daughter. (The only employees are the owner, owners daughter, my girlfriend, and someone who was hired not long after her to cover at the pre existing location). The daughter mentioned how the other employee would not work at the new location because she ""didn't have the look for it."" The owners daughter is very rude to my girlfriend as well. Always complaining about what she did the night before and telling her she should know how to do her job. The problem with that is, she received very little training if you could even call it that. Every day she would tell me how she got in trouble and sometimes openly in front of customers.   Then comes the Fourth of July. She's running the store alone and is left a letter from the boss. The letter is two pages long front and back that states she has a learning curve and didn't train well. It also states that the boss never guaranteed 40 hours a week and that she wouldn't receive her bonus or percentage of sales. She even mentioned reducing her hours each week.   So she texts me the letter and asks her parents and we all agree she should quit the job because it was nothing what they offered her and we felt she wasn't being treated properly. We believe she was used to make the drive to the new store because the owner and her daughter had no interest in doing it daily. That's just a theory however.   So she texts the owners daughter that she quits and needs to come to the store to take over. She continued to work and help customers and make sales until the owners daughter arrived to relieve her.   She worked 8-10 hour shifts alone in busy towns. She wasn't given an opportunity to go grab food or take a break. She couldn't use the bathroom unless there were no customers, which was rare and when there weren't she had to run to make sure no one came in. She was never given any pay stubs for any of her checks and in the letter the boss stated that she guesstimates her pay and overtime pay. I correctly calculated her overtime pay and it was double what she was actually paid.   My question is: what here is illegal - if any of it is. I believe some of it may be and we're curious what we can do about it. Apparently someone heard about what happened to my girlfriend and said the same store and boss and did the exact same thing to another person previously.   Sorry for the long patchy story.   tl;dr: Girlfriend was offered a management job at a new store and was given zero management duties. She couldn't take a break to get food and eat and could rarely use the bathroom. Owner and her daughter were rude to her and told her another employee didn't have the look to work at the new store. She received zero pay stubs with checks and was underpaid for overtime hours. She also received a letter claiming she had a learning curve during training when they never properly trained her or worked with her enough to know how she was."	No
1699	I tried to work on a floor at my past rental, but botched it up.  I own up to that.  But the way the landowner/real estate guy is handling problem is the problem. I am in Orange County, NY.  1. Owner isn't close so I have text messages of real estate agent saying he will tell the owner place is in good shape.  He said this twice without checking anything off.  We left keys June 15. 2. Owner says the floors were sanded and stained bad-I admit to-but a week after realtor said all was fine.   3. He had someone try to come and sand and stain floors 4. It has now been fourty days since being out and no deposit minus fixes or detailed sheet saying what needs to be done.  Question: 1. It is later than 21 days, a local law says, either money back or details of repairs is he wrong? 2. Was the owner or realtor supposed to do good walk thru and let me know any fixes, before leaving keys? 3. Does these two wrong doings, if they were, trump the messing of the floor legally? 4. Does the realtor's word, being the agent, mean alot when he said that he will tell the owner place is good? 5. Will my text trail that has all of this in there help me in  a case?  Any advice would be helpful.	No
1700	I live in Columbus, Ohio. I moved into my apartment yesterday, and I found a lot of problems with the apartment.  The previous tenant had a dog, and there was still a large amount of dog hair around the apartment. I do not have any pets. I called them and asked if they could come out and clean it, since it is in writing that the apartment will be professionally cleaned before we moved. The cleaning crew came, but there was basically no change after we left.  I then discovered some bug issues in the bedroom. There was also some mystery substances in the kitchen and bathroom. They also left a piece of paper stating what they did and did not do to the apartment prior to us moving in. This paper said they didn't clean, change the locks, paint, or clean the floors.  There is also retail space below the apartment that has not ever been in use. The space below has been neglected and some of the retail space has been left unlocked, which worries me from a safety standpoint. The apartment has a back entrance that we were also never told about, which leads to the abandoned retail space.   Lastly, the front entrance, which is the main entrance for all tenants, is only secured with a simple deadbolt. This requires me to rely on other tenants for my own safety leading into my apartment.  I realize I didn't rent a luxury department, but this is in a decent neighborhood, and I pay a decent amount for just a one bedroom with added amenities. I really liked the apartment when I first toured it, but now I just feel like I've been misled and doesn't feel like what I originally agreed to. There are more issues, but I feel like this is getting too long. Is there anything at all I can do about this situation?	No
1701	If I vacate ahead of time with a month left on my lease (i.e., move out before the final month begins), can I refuse to pay rent for that month and just forfeit the deposit (equal to a month's rent)? Apartment would be broom clean, no damage, etc.	No
1702	"Can anyone help me out? What legal action should I take?  I co-founded a business in 2013 in freshman year of college with a friend of mine where girls step on insects. We usually sold our stuff using xxxfetish-media, which is a good place to sell bug crush and femdom content. I used their official OCMB forums to help figure out what people liked best when I started out. Early that year I saw a legit filesharing website (we'll call it fetishare) where people made accounts to trade videos and got points for it, so I figured that it'd be a good way to spread my store's name around. Well soon after that I found out from the admin on the OCMB forums that they were spying on customers, farming IPs from 'known pirate websites, and in some cases placing malware to track people. I figured I'd stop using the fetishare site and just sell normally.   Well last year in June when I was waiting for a payout from them, I didn't get it and started wondering why it didn't hit my bank account. I contacted them but the customer service wasn't good at fixing it. I eventually got a response saying: 'Your account has been suspended for copyright violations'. So basically I got locked out of my store for something that happened three years ago. Notice I said 'locked out' and not 'closed down'. My store is still up. People can still buy from it and they can make money from it while giving none to me. They don't respond to any of my emails either, except for one when I ask for how I can restore access to my store they said: ""We will for forgive this if you sign a statement saying you will never again share videos.'   I made about $41k/yr from that store. In hiatus/hibernation mode with no updates it at least made $10k from last year to now. I'm owed money, and this isn't right. They're not only hurting me, but other producers by banning customers left and right from being able to buy and lowering profits.  Since then I started my own e-commerce store and hosted on Clips4Sale and Kinkbomb instead. However I would still like to know what to do about this.  I live in Alabama.  Any thoughts? Should I take legal action?  - tl;dr: Possible embezzlement with my store on a fetish hub. What do?"	No
1703	We have lived in this apartment complex for 11 years and in this particular unit for over 3 years. This summer the complex has been having a problem with fleas. We have been flea bombing our apartment every two weeks, washing everything every week, and putting flea stuff on our cat as often as possible. Note we paid a pet deposit for the cat when we moved in. This week one of the managers called us to notify us that someone was coming in to flea spray when we tried to schedule a time that would not conflict with work so that we could take our cat out of the apartment which they said was necessary they completely lost it. They started screaming at us.  They said if we didn't do this we had to leave. Eventually we calmed them down and came up with a time when the person could come and flea spray. Two days later on Saturday we received a termination without cause notice giving us 60 days to get out of our apartment. Is trying to get a time when we weren't at work covered under legally protected tenant actions ? I'm having trouble deciphering what is and is not covered  under tenant rights. Oregon law contains a catch all clause that covers tenants that are attempting to assert their legal rights.	No
1704	"Hi all, I looked at the landlord-tenant megathread but couldn't find anything related to this, so I hope I'm not being repetitive. Key facts:   * Signed a lease earlier this month to move in to an apartment in Maryland mid-August. Was told after signing that I could request a copy of the lease ""whenever.""  * Emailed complex last week to request a copy of the lease and to take care of some final details, was told again to come ""whenever"" as anybody in the office during regular hours could help me.   * Went to office, asked for lease, was told they don't give the lease copies to tenants until the first walk-through and move in checklist was complete (in the lease I signed I remember it saying that I had to complete the checklist within fifteen days of move-in, and that walk-throughs could be scheduled within the first fifteen days.)     My questions: Am I entitled to my copy of the lease? Is this normal? All the other places I've lived have made copies of the lease for me the day I signed it, so this and their lack of clear communication seems unusual to me. I have not had the best experience renting so I might just be a little paranoid. Thank you!"	No
1705	"My bf &amp; I were late paying rent this month, and apartment staff left a notice on our door - ""Pay Rent or Vacate"".  We paid rent the next day, but we didn't notice a section on the note, that they will inspect our apartment on a specific date.  That date was today.  Marijuana use is prohibited in the apartment contract, and there was a joint left out on the table.  Now my bf &amp; I are stressed, looking for new places to live, anticipating being evicted.  Has anyone been in the same situation before?  Suggestions?  Recommendations?  We both have been low on cash for a while now, so I don't know what we can do.  Thank you for any help!  We live in WA state."	No
1706	I’m having an issue with my neighbor and I’m educating myself before I take my next action.  I have a flag lot with a driveway leading to my house, planked on both sides by fencing from the street up to my gate.  The fences were there when I purchased the property 10+ years ago.  One property adjacent to my driveway was sold about 3 years ago.  This new neighbor recently opened up a section of the fence and excavated the ground on both of our properties and prepared for paving, to connect his driveway to mine.  If he were to succeed, it would give him a convenient loop for his driveway.  He does not have a (recorded) easement to use my land, nor did he ask permission or even notify me that he planned to do this. Attempts to communicate with him have been fruitless.  He tried this once before, not long after he moved in.  He took down the fence sections without asking. I put them back up, and sent a letter demanding him to leave the fence alone and stop trespassing.  He refused to accept the certified mail.  I recently vacated the property and put in on the market.  This latest attempt of his started a couple days after the realtor’s sign went up.  I presume he thought I moved away and would not catch him, or care, and a new owner wouldn’t know any better.  I had the sheriff come out.  He told the sheriff that the fence is his, that it’s on his land, and that he has a prescriptive easement to use my driveway.  I asked the sheriff if the neighbor had any proof and he said he had “paperwork from a lawyer” but no County records.  The sheriff bowed out of the situation, saying they can’t make judgement calls in such civil matters. I understand.  I’m reasonably confident that the fence is mine, and that it’s on my land.  I could get a survey done to prove it, but even if it’s mine, there is still the claim of an easement, and I would like to avoid the cost if possible.  Regardless of fence ownership, if he can prove easement on my land, he’d be allowed to cut through, I assume.  Regarding his claim of a prescriptive easement, I have some ideas and questions.  Here in California, if I understand the laws correctly, the occupant of his lot would have to use my driveway for 5 years, without permission, yet unchallenged.  Looking back using historical imagery, it’s clear that about 20 years ago an unimproved connection existed between our driveways (then the fence got built and has been there ever since).  Thus, it’s remotely possible to establish the 5-year statutory. But did that previous owner use my driveway with or without consent from my previous owner?  I don’t see how he can possibly prove it was without consent, which is a factor for the establishment of a prescriptive easement.  We’re talking about a window of time some 20-25 years ago, minimum!  The old owners from that timeframe are deceased.  I think my best angle isn’t to disprove the possible creation of a prescriptive easement, but to prove that even if one existed, it would be terminated by now.  If the owner of his lot built the fence, blocking the path, is that not a reasonably clear indication that he abandoned the easement?  If the owner of my lot built the fence, wouldn’t that then prescribe the easement back after just 5 years?  What do you all think?  Is my strategy sound?  -Mia	No
1707	Hey now, So I wanted to move out of my apartment for 3 months of summer so I could go to europe. Well, I put an ad on facebook for someone to take over my lease for 3 months. We're not really allowed to do it at the apts I live in so we just agreed to have him pay me directly.   we didn't have a contract or anything. But I've got texts and so forth.   He paid the first two months, 500 each month, but i was gone the first two weeks of this month (july) and it's been difficult getting him to pay me.   Is there anything I can do to make sure that he pays the last month before he leaves?   I have his phone number but I dont know where he's moving to next.	No
1708	"Hello, looking for some advice about the probate process for a small estate in the state of Arkansas. I've read up on what to do but I am still confused. Trying to understand if I need to go through probate court, or if this can just be solved through Arkansas's small estate process. I feel like this should be straightforward, so hopefully someone has some answers or recommendations.   My mother passed away last month. My father passed away 11 years ago, and I only have one (younger) brother.  I am named in her will as the executor of the will. My brother and I are listed in the will as beneficiaries, splitting any assets 50/50.   Her assets that are part of the estate are as follows: Checking account &amp; savings account, together totalling about $3K 11 year old van which she didn't owe money on, worth $1K at most  Assets that have my brother and I named as beneficiaries (so they shouldn't count towards in the probate process, right?): Life insurance policy for about $40K IRA account, about $30K 401K account, about $7K Another savings account, has about $200  Debts: Student loans, at least $20K Chase credit card, about $2K Not aware of others but will be running a credit report soon to confirm  From what I've read, her estate qualifies as a small estate in Arkansas, since it's worth less than $100K. So it should bypass probate court, and I simply need to file an affidavit of small estate. However, on the form for the affidavit of small estate, one of the stipulations for filing as a small estate is ""There are no unpaid claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate."" This is where I am confused. Chase wants to make a claim against the estate. If they make a claim, her assets are enough to cover the amount of their claim...so I assume I would need to pay them from the estate. However, I can't get the funds from her bank account to pay the claim without filing this affidavit. So how the heck am I supposed to pay them? Do I have to go through the probate court simply because there is a claim against her estate? I don't believe I should pay it out of my own pocket, it's not my debt. So it should come out of the estate. I'm just so confused about what to do next."	No
1709	"Is there anything I could do if someone repetitively ignores a prominently placed ""No Solicitation"" sign? I have a smart door bell (camera/mic/speaker) and have asked the person putting it on to not put it in the future. I have even called the business and spoke with managers/owners and requested they stop putting flyers on my door.  I travel for work, upwards of 3 weeks at a time, and I know advertisements at the front door is a sign to thieves that no one is home. My previous neighbor used to trash them for me however they have since moved and the new neighbors arent too friendly.   Could I add a sign that say violator contact information will be entered on junk mailing/telemarketer contact lists?"	No
1710	"My boyfriend and I rent a house directly from the homeowner. He always argues with us about the necessity of any requests we make for repairs or maintenance, so I've started emailing him lists of things we need addressed just to have it documented in writing. In these communications, I have tried to be as cooperative, polite, respectful, reasonable, and understanding as possible. He refuses to respond in writing and will call instead, making promises that he later claims he never said (I suspect this is why he does not respond in writing).   Last week, he sent some employees to replace our broken fridge and remove a broken window unit AC.  The next day, he came to the house with one of those same employees to look at some other problems.   He and I were talking about some of the items in my latest email, and he began getting angry and increasingly loud with me. He is upset that we ""complain about every little thing."" I remained calm and did not raise my voice, but I did respond to some of his accusations and complaints. At one point, I said, ""Please do not yell at me.""   My boyfriend heard the argument (just him yelling, since he wouldn't really let me speak) and came into the room to ask him not to speak to me in that manner. He also said, ""What's the problem here?""  Landlord turned his anger onto my boyfriend in an even louder, more aggressive tone. He accused my boyfriend of being on drugs the day before (something the employees he sent out must have said). Not true at all - he works second shift and had just woken up. The employee present this day came into the room at that point and stood behind my boyfriend. This was in a small, enclosed space, where the landlord and his employee had my boyfriend effectively trapped. The landlord started waving his fists around and threatening to fight my boyfriend.  Boyfriend managed to get out of that room and went to the bedroom in an attempt to walk away from the situation. Both men followed him and also trapped him there, still yelling and threatening.   We are considering filing a police report just in case anything like this were to happen again in the future, but also fear that may make the situation worse. I know he would not be notified unless a warrant was signed, but we live in a small town, so that's not always a guarantee.   I'd really appreciate any advice or feedback you guys may have on whether we ought to pursue this, since we now don't feel particularly safe around him and definitely don't feel as though we can ever mention another maintenance problem. Thank you."	No
1711	I work as a waiter in Pembroke Pines, Florida, where minimum wage for someone in my profession is $5.08. My paychecks have been about $35-$40 dollars and i'm definitely working more than 8 hours. I know that if an employee doesn't meet the hourly mark in declared tips  the company makes up the difference. But does it work the other way around? if i'm declaring tips which reach or exceed the appropriate hourly mark are they allowed to cut into my hourly paycheck and give me less than $5?	No
1712	My husband and I are pretty sure we just witnessed a raid in our expensive apartment complex. Due to his job sensitivity, we don't want to live in a place like this any longer. Can we break our lease due to feeling unsafe? Our apartment complex might be filed with rich, drug dealing college kids. (Also, we're pretty sure our mailbox got broken into the first month we moved in.)	No
1713	I live in a multi-bed apartment that has individual leases on bedrooms. There was an empty bedroom in the apartment and the leasing office filled it without giving me any say. My new roommate showed up and started selling weed in the living room with me sitting across from him on day 2. I've witnessed a few more deals since the first one, and I'm not comfortable living with someone dumb enough to start selling drugs in front of me. I'm worried that if I report him and he isn't immediately removed from the apartment that I'll have to deal with the consequences of any angry dealer having a key to my apartment. What options do I have?	No
1714	"I have been in between apartments for 5 days. I'm staying with my mom in another town and everything I own is in storage units. My roommates and I were set to move in tomorrow so we can get settled and back to work. Today, halfway through the day, we learn there is a flea infestation that will take at least a couple weeks to clean. They are offering to let us stay in another of their units in town but they will not adjust the rent to what we had agreed to pay for the original apartment. It was very difficult to find a good location that was within our budget in this town so there aren't many other options and they won't help us pay to move an additional time. They are offering to ""let"" us break the lease and walk away but it feels like that is giving up all my rights when we agreed to this lease back in March. Am I just out of luck here or do they owe us something more?  I'm willing to provide any more details needed but I'm desperate for any advice at all. Thanks in advance all."	No
1715	This is slightly personal, hence the throwaway, and this situation is based in South East Asia. So, I know that there will be a certain degree of difference but I just want to know what I can expect. Also note that I am not the embezzler  If a person has been embezzling money from the company and the company goes to the cops, will the tax records of the company be under scrutiny?   Also, if the some of the money embezzled has been used to buy houses listed under that person's kids names, will that money be recouped? Alternatively, is there any way to force the person to return the money without going to the police?	No
1716	I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	No
1717	I want to apologize if I'm not doing this right, I'm not one to usually post here and I'm not too sure what to do. I just came home for the summer from my university to find out my mom got a new job! Unfortunately, she has to work 3-4 jobs ahead to keep her head afloat. She found this job with a Freight company on Indeed.com, and contacted her two weeks later.   A woman representing the company explained to my mother that the company was located in London, and told my mother that she would be taking packages and distributing them out for the company. My mother signed a contract which she checked with a lawyer friend of ours, who said it was valid. The work came quick shortly after. Mom was in contact with them, and did her job as the contract stated.   Where it gets messy is that, May and June we had work coming, and she was expecting a paycheck for the two months together(as the contract stated of the first month). As July rolls around, the packages ceased and my mother's bank account didn't get the money. She attempted to call both the number on the website and the number of the woman she was in contact with, and they either hung up on her after she identified herself, or just hasn't answered any of her calls.  My mother is upset because of the validity of everything, and also the fact that this money was meant to pay back bills she owed. Can my mother take the company to small claims court? What could be her next step? Everything is recorded in texts and recorded phone calls, as well as the sight she used to receive and send out the packaging. I sincerely hope she wasn't scammed, since she gave out very little information. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for reading.	No
1718	I am currently residing on a condo type of home and my room is basically a wall from a hallway. They put a wooden wall on the living room and made it a room. We have a contract that I have to pay rent for $400 and she is trying to increase it to $450 because of the reasoning of bills. On the $400 everything is included utilities and such, we also agreed that if the bill increase over the summer whether its gas or electricity we will split it. Can I say no to rent increase because she also mention she is going to give me a new contract.	No
1719	Hello. I live in Vermont and for about two weeks now, our water has been contaminated with diesel fuel. You can smell it on the water. I had consumed it, and had negative health effects for almost an hour (this was me testing confirmation bias ). I've never been given notice by the landlord that the water has been contaminared. I have talked to my neighbors in the same building as me. They have the same problem. I have been told the only way to force legal action is to pay several thousand dollars to test the water, and show the results law enforcement or some other justice agency. Several thousand dollars I do not have.  I was wondering if you had any ideas on how to force the issue legally speaking?	No
1720	My son's car has been egged several times over the last few months.  The second time it happened we made a police report but it's happened 3 times since and we haven't called it in.  They have also gotten my husband's car and our house.  What I want to know is, is this considered illegal?  The egg just washed off so no real damage, but my son thinks it's kids at school doing it because he is gay.... would that make it a hate crime if egging isn't even a crime?  I am so frustrated.  We only have room to park one car in the driveway, not that it would deter them, but it seems like whichever one of us is parked on the street is getting it, just us, not our neighbors.  Our neighbor behind us did get it once, but not since.  My son's car is just a $2000 car, but my husband and I drive much nicer cars and don't want to have to deal with this crap.  It happened once on a Friday night, but all other instances were on Sunday nights.	No
1721	Throwaway account to protect those involved.  A good buddy of mine has worked in management at this one place for the past twenty or so years, up until it recently moved out of state. A church has purchased the building, and has employed him to keep things in order as it is is renovated (it is becoming a headquarters for the church, as well as for a house of worship for the town). However, there are a few suspicious things going on that leave me feeling uneasy.  1. Although he is employed to be working 40 hours a week, he puts in a good number of hours of (unpaid) overtime each week, so that he is really working upwards of 60 hours a week. This is in part due to the fact that  2. in hiring him, the church had fired all of their other staff (the guy who mows the lawn, etc.) for a separate location, and is now asking my friend to manage that facility as well. Unfortunately, he's a bit of a pushover, and so he is just going along with it. So, while he is employed to be managing one location, he is really working two, without anyone under him to actually provide assistance. As such, he is doing a good deal of manual labour himself, between driving back and forth for hours between both locations. I'm worried, because his age is definitely getting to him. I fear that a few more months of this could ruin his health.  3. He is now a salaried worker of the church. However, they are consistently late with paying him. For instance, supposing he was meant to be paid on the 4th, it might be added to his account on the 7th. Usually, there is a delay of 2-4 *business days*, meaning that, when he was meant to be paid on June 30th, he only receive it on July 6th, due to bank holiday around the 4th.  Him, being the person he is, is unlikely to make a fuss about this with his management, because he doesn't see that anything is wrong. I have read up a bit about overtime exemptions for EAP employees on the DOL's website, and from what I gather, that his work primarily consists of manual labour would seem to exclude him from that exemption. The two main questions I have hear are a) is this an accurate assessment of what the DOL says about overtime exemptions in regards to the first point, and b) is there any more information I can give my friend that he can use in filing a complaint with his current employer?	No
1722	My kids (9 and 8) are doing a dermatology study on a cream of some sort. When the dr approached us we were told they would each receive $650 for about 16 weeks of study, using meds and getting blood drawn. We discussed this with them and they wanted to do it. Upon signing the paperwork we noticed that it said the payment would be $500 for each. My wife talked to the Drs tech about it and she was assured that the payment was $650 and that it would be changed. Fast forward until now and we are being told it is actually only $500 and that we signed for that amount. Drs office isn't willing to do anything about it. Do I have any legal action I can take or are my kids just screwed for trusting them the staff in the beginning?	No
1723	"Hello,  I recently moved out of an apartment... My lease was not renewed because the complex is renovating each unit, and they wanted me to move into a different unit (along with an $200 increase in rent).   Anyways, when I moved out I left the apartment clean, patched all the paint holes, etc. I didn't do a particularly thorough job cleaning the appliances/cabinets (I left them empty and wiped down, but didn't detail clean them) as they were going to thrown out during the reno.  Yesterday, I received my deposit back. The statement said that my deposit was being deducted by $55 for ""misc. damages."" The 'itemized' statement only had the beginning balance of the deposit, cleaning fee ($0), the misc damages ($55), and the ending balance of the deposit.  I know in Ohio, that landlords have to provide an itemized deposit... But how detailed does it need to be? I called the property manager, and they said it was 'likely' due to broken blinds and a damaged curtain rod, but wasn't sure. When i asked for more detailed information, they said that they weren't required to provide a more detailed statement because the management company is based in New York... I told that even if the parent company is based in NY, they still need to abide by Ohio State Laws, he got mad and hung up.  It's only $55, so I don't know if its worth pursuing, but I'm more curious for future reference. What constitutes an 'itemized statement' under Ohio laws for rental security deposits?  TL;DR: Security deposit deducted by $55 due to 'misc. damages.' Property manager unwilling to tell me the specific reasons for the deduction, due to the management company being based in NY, while property is in OH"	No
1724	"Hello! As a small business owner, I am looking for help from lawyers/business owners alike. I have run into a fraudulent injury lawsuit from a stranger on my property. This person claims that a piece of equipment on my property hurt him as he was passing through. The person has no proof and when asked to provide medical documentation or pictures of the injury, the person refused. Knowing what I do about the equipment in question and his story presented, it is not possible that what was claimed actually happened. In addition, the person is claiming an exorbitant amount of money. It is obvious that it is someone with a piece of shit lawyer looking to make a quick buck. As a small business owner, I do not have access to high power lawyers nor do I have the money to just pay off people for everything they threaten lawsuits with. When asking my insurance appointed lawyer how this could possibly hold up in court, I am told it is a sympathy case and there is no way to defend against it. It is absolutely infuriating that I am not protected in some way from fraudulent injury claims especially with no proof! It seems that the system is rigged against the ""big bad company"". How can a small business stay in business with no protection against these shit heads? Big companies obviously have cash to pay off people or lawyers on retainer. For me, a lawsuit can literally make or break my company. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Or how to retaliate?"	No
1725	I first tried to hand deliver a letter to our landlord about a week ago. After two tries of him not being there, I didn't want to just drop the letter in his mail box.  Instead, I sent a certified letter a few days ago. Per the tracking, they've tried two attempts to deliver it, but no one has been there to accept it.  Given this all has been going on for over a week now and our last day to give notice we're not renewing our lease is today, who else can I do?  I do have the receipt and tracking showing he's not there to accept it, post marked July 29th. I want to make sure we meet that 30 day window of prior notice. Lease goes to August 31st.	No
1726	"Currently renting at an apartment community in GA. I've been here for a couple years and every year they send out a renewal offer each year. Well, i've been trying to get them to send the lease over so I can lock in my renewal rate for another year (we lucked out and pay MUCH less than any of our neighbors). The staff in the office has changed a lot over the years and I'm worried someone new will come in and really jack up our rent. We received a written renewal offer on the company letterhead stating our renewal rate for 2017-2018 with absolutely no expiration date or stipulations (i.e. offer is void if presented with future offers). Would they have to honor this since it's in writing? We've been calling and going into the office in person and keep getting the old ""we'll get to it"". Starting to get very nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!"	No
1727	Northeast Ohio!!  Long time reader, first time poster!   About two years ago, our meter reader left both gates on my moms property open when he came and read the meter, and our dogs got out. We luckily got everyone back safely. After that we called, and the lady said she would put a note on our account. A few months later it happened again so we put padlocks on our gates. The next month the meter reader knocked on the door and said we needed to remove them and I told them too bad so sad and that was that. I moved away and last night my mom called me saying they had been told to remove the padlocks or the power would be turned off a few months ago, and yesterday they left the gate open again. I'm not exactly sure what we can do at this point. I told my mom to jus remove the gates and put up permanentfencing since they don't use them anyway. Or ask them to move the meter. Are they really allowed to turn the power off if they can't read the meter?	No
1728	I was recently approached by a friend asking if my husband and I could room a 16 year old who's family is about to be evicted. How legal is this?   Background: We are in Pennsylvania. teen in question has a mother who is frivolous with money. Spent rent money on other things. They are about to be evicted. My friend knows the teen and is trying to find them a temporary home in their school area. Which is where we come in. He asked us if we could take on just the teen, not the mother. 'Worst case' they'd be staying with us a year.   We have spare room, but little money so the teen would effectively be paying 'rent'- even though we'd only be taking some money for their food and a little for the extra electricity (AC, computer, what have you).   As they are a minor and not emancipated, how legal is this? We want to help the kid but not if it'll fuck us and them over in the long run. I know some states you can get in trouble for harboring a runaway, although as far as I can tell the mother would be aware of their location.   Help?	No
1729	We are purchasing a house in NJ and have already gone through the process of getting approved for the mortgage and set up a closing date for this Friday, July 14th. House has been appraised for slightly more than what we are purchasing and we are in a contract with the seller since a few months ago.   More background information: The house has been appraised that satisfies the bank, the repairs have been done that we and seller both agreed upon, our title company requested for a closing date to be set for this Friday, everything had been done according to what information we received before. However, the seller's title company and broker just did a title search on the house, last Thursday, and it came up that they have 4 mortgages on the house (one that is over 500K, even though the house is worth half of that), and is now in foreclosure status so we cannot move forward with the closing. According to the seller's agent the seller told them that all of the mortgages had been paid off, but the seller never provided the proof of that except for one of the four mortgages to the seller's agent.   Now we have already put thousands of dollars into this ordeal; 2,000 for the deposit, ~1,200 for the appraisal and inspections, among another few thousand for various other fees for the purchase.   We have emails from the title company and the seller's agent stating that we cannot move forward with the closing because of the unpaid loans on the house. Our agent told us that they already did a title search back in May and it came back clear, but now its not according to the seller's company. Our real estate agent and our loan coordinator have never come across a situation like this before ever as they told us. Which makes sense since the lender would not have moved forward with the loan process in the beginning if this was the issue. Both our agent and loan coordinator have told us that we can sue the seller and the seller's agent since this is in breach of the contract we signed in the beginning.   We are just baffled at the fact that this is all coming out a few days prior to closing and we are in a tight spot since we were supposed to move in next month. In addition, our current lease is up as well since we planned for moving into the new house.   We have already contacted a few lawyers and are waiting to hear back from them.   How do you guys see this situation? Is there anything we can do from a legal standpoint at all? What would you guys recommend?   Thanks guys any and all advice is appreciated greatly. If theres anything that I missed above about the issue please ask away. We are in dire need of help with this.	No
1730	My roommate and I received a petty text from our landlord about a few cigarette butts in our backyard. Our landlord came over before 7AM on a Saturday to 'spray some weed killer' without giving any notice. Does the proper notice extend to the backyard? It is fenced in--if that makes a difference?	No
1731	I live in a [Mitchell-Lama](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/mitchell-lama-rentals.page) co-op.  I moved from a 2 bedroom to a 3 bedroom in 2011.  They never transferred billing of my garage fee to my new apt.  I wrote the management company &amp; CC'ed the President of the Board telling them to do so.  They didn't.  I figured screw them, I did my duty, I informed them, they ignored me.  I wash my hands of the situation.    Now 6 years later they're sending me a bill for six years of monthly fees.  My question is...do I have to pay?  Is there any kind of statute of limitations?  It is after all their job to bill me.  Their screw up, not mine.       PS:  Just so nobody thinks I'm that bad a guy...  After all, why shouldn't I pay for my garage space...  This was an incompetent, possibly corrupt Board with an utterly incompetent &amp; almost certainly corrupt management company.  They were already fighting with me on other issues.  So I felt justified not paying, if they're too incompetent to bill me, even after I brought the situation to their attention.	No

1733	Hello r/legaladvice,  My parents have a home they currently are renting to own, however due to past mistakes, the ISR has put a lean on the house and they are not able to buy it.   The goal was they would buy it and in 2 years they would sell it to my wife and I, and rent someplace else. Now that is not an option, our thought was that we could buy the house now, rent it to them and in 2 years when they move out we would have the house like planed.   However, looking online it looks like this is considered mortgage fraud because we would not be immediately living in the home. So my question to all of you is, what are my options? We have the required down payment for a conventional mortgage, but do not have the required amount for an income property mortgage.   Any help is appreciated, and I can provide more detail if needed   we are located in Michigan, USA  Thank You	No
1734	"I let a girl I've been friends with for years and her yoing kid move in a couple months ago until she could find a place. She agreed she would help with rent and keep the place picked up. Flash forward and its been a couple months and i haven't seen a dime. She claimed she had a job when she moved in but that was a lie and she still doesnt have one. I'm top of that she is constantly trashing my place. I will clean before I go to work and by the time i come home there will be trash and clothes all over.  I asked her to leave last week and she called the cops saying I was ""screaming at her"" which even the cops didnt belive. She even threatened to get a child order of protection against me so that I woukd get kicked out of my own place which I found out is how her own parents got her out of their home when she pulled the same crap on them.  As it stands i dont know what my best option is. If I try to evict her my.landlord is going to find out that I violated my lease. If I simply end my lease and she refuses to leave then according to my lease I may be on hook for those legal bills.   Just trying to get out of this the lest damaging way possible. My thanks for trying to help a yoing mother and her child I guess."	No
1735	So, this is a throw away account just in case because this deals with insurance, and I know little about it.  I posted in r/insurance and r/personalfinance too as I was referred.  A couple nights ago I was working an ON shift, and I typically park my car across in a lot that our company is allowed to use. This is downtown in a big city. Me, being a moron, left my spare set of keys and a spare debit card hidden in the center console. My shift ended somewhere around 7 am, and that's when I noticed my car was missing. Where it had been was replaced with a large pile of shattered window.     I called the police, and filed a police report. Then my dad (he handles the insurance and I pay him for it) filed a claim with our insurance guy. We have pretty good coverage, but the police have to search for the car for up to 14 days before the claim is considered I believe. Given the car was bought for about 7k, but certainly not nearly as valuable anymore, and there were things of value I could replace easily through insurance, I was not entirely upset.  Today, I was reviewing the cameras at my work out of curiosity. I noticed that my car started and took off at 330. I went backward in time and saw two people staring at it, looking around, and approach it at about 315. Their full faces are on camera, a little blurred, but identifying. The car window getting smashed was too dark to see, but there are companies with cameras next door.     What I would like to know is what would be my best option from here.    I can:    A. Report the footage to the officer.   B. Gather more footage and take my time.   C. Let the suits in Washington figure this out.    I do not want to do anything very illegal and obviously not commit insurance fraud, but I also would like to know my best decision financially.   I appreciate any and all advice.	No
1736	Hello, I'm 17 and in Austin, Texas, today i got pulled over on i-35 for going 86, although my spedometer said 80. I am not trying to say I wasn't being stupid (I was) but I was wondering what the best course of action would be. I can pay the ticket but I am very afraid of the insurance charges added. I have read a couple of posts but mostly by people going 20+ over. I want to know if I should just pay the fine, or if I should contest and hope the officer doesnt show up to court. I am insured, thank you for any advice	No
1737	The short story is that the repairs our landlord has done to this house, starting from long before we moved in, are dangerously bad - ie; tin foil and duct tape holding together pipes, rags tied around pipes in leu of insulation, etc.   The latest issue is that water started pouring through the furnace and electric outlets because the roof is bad, we asked them to fix it, they came and dabbed some tar in random spots on the roof and left.  They insist that this was appropriate (they didn't even know where the leaks were inside the house and didn't come in to look and see if it was even safe with all the electric and water) and we had to shut off power to the furnace and ceiling because of all of the water and the antique cloth covered wires.    We have a baby due in two months and with all of the water/electricity being maintained in this way, there is no way it's safe for us to keep living here.  So we (while completely paid up to date on rent) told them that we would not be paying any further rent and are moving out as soon as possible, with a maximum of 30 days.  We have done several thousand dollars worth of improvement on the house, and we even told them to keep the security deposit.  We were late on rent one time last winter and the wife came over at 10pm at night with no warning screaming and accusing us of being liars, when we were genuinely just waiting for a check to clear.  They are very angry with us for blowing the whistle and calling it time to go, so with the wife's history of late night drama, I don't really feel safe having them come in the house when we are already this stressed and trying to move.    They are demanding entry, demanding to start showing the house and threatening to bring the police over to let them in.  As far as my legal knowledge goes, they can't possibly do anything of the sort - can they?  At this point this whole thing just seems insane - I just want to move somewhere where I know that my family is safe! We are in Michigan and this whole thing started on Monday.	No
1738	Mom in Ohio is a permanent resident of a nursing home but underwent surgery in a hospital and upon her return to the nursing home requires physical therapy to recover. Medicaid has covered her permanent residency but then Medicare Part A steps in to cover the skilled nursing physical therapy she is receiving post-op.  The question about simultaneous status has arisen because we took her to an appointment outside of the facility (unrelated to the surgery) and we were informed that her status as a permanent resident vs skilled nursing patient matters for billing purposes. They explained if she is covered under Medicaid then they would bill them, however if she is currently covered by Medicare then the nursing home should be billed directly or her personally if the nursing home doesn’t deem the appointment vital.  So can you be considered both a permanent resident and a skilled nursing patient by a nursing home? Meaning the nursing home is concurrently receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid (the per diem and the patient liability amount).  This is my first post! I am sorry if it is not worded well, I have very limited knowledge of Medicaid/Medicare/Nursing Homes and am learning as I go. Also, I am cross-posting in hopes of getting it in the right place!	No
1739	This is a bit of an unusual one. I will try and make it simple points.  There are 3 of us each with our own room. We all signed jointly.  One roommate failed to tell the others that he has stopped receiving income. He kept paying late until the point he couldn't pay anymore and is now waiting on disability money from the government.  The other roommate and I have covered his last 2 months of rent and late fees. He kept saying he will get the money but it doesn't come. We can't afford to keep covering his rent.  He signed an agreement that he will pay us back but I doubt we will get our money.  Even if we win against him in small claims court the money he is getting is disability money and normally we cant collect from that.  I talked to management and they said the only way to get him off the lease is for them to evict us all for non-payment or him to sign himself off the lease.  If he refuses to sign himself off the lease, what are our options?  I was thinking of putting all of his stuff to an offsite storage unit and putting it under his name. Then adding someone else to the lease and renting out his room just so we cant get someone to pay rent.  He basically lives with his partner and uses the space he has with us as storage.   Are there any legal repercussions of moving his stuff into a storage unit in his name?	No
1740	I'm considering purchasing a property and have come upon an issue - the two owners have had physical and legal problems in the recent weeks and one of them needs to sell the property. The owner who wishes to sell it wasn't even aware of the other being on the deed, as they purchased the house alone (as stated in the buyer's agreement).   Is there any way for the owner who wishes to sell to do so without agreement of the other owner?	No
1741	How long does a restraining order take to get filed? I am accused of cyberstalking and harassing via text message. Theoretically, if my ex girlfriend were to have decided to get a restraining order against me, how long would it take to file? Would the police knock on my door the next day? Would it take weeks? I'm in no accusation of domestic violence or stalking her physically. It's only following her on social media and texting her. How long?	No
1742	Alright so I've tried googling this but have no guts on my specific situation.  I'm a server and the owner has 3 more restaurants all within a block, so we swap and take things we need from the other 3 if we ever run out of anything. Occasionally we will run out of a certain liquor and they will typically send a server to go grab an unopened bottle and bring it back to the restaurant they work at. Is it legal to walk it if you're under 21 since it is for business and you're on the clock?	No
1743	I own a trailer that is on my father-in-laws land. He is now deceased. The deed to the land is in his name. He did not have a will. But the land was automatically inherited by his children. Two of the heirs are now deceased as well. One of them was my husband. Our trailer is sitting on his part of the land. Which is in Carter Co Ky. Could any of the heirs tear down our trailer? What happens to my husband's part of the land that he is now deceased. He did not have a will. Is it legal for any of the heirs to tear down our trailer without our permission? Any help would be greatly appreciated!	No
1744	"After a traumatizing roommate experience, and a long search for affordable housing, I signed a lease of one year on a lockout type apartment underneath someone's vacation home. (I'm on the coast of North Carolina). They are a conservative, religious elderly couple who go to bed at 8 pm. I knew from the start we would have some personality clashes, and I only took the place because I was desperate and I was under the impression they would not be there full time.    They were hesitant to rent to me because I'm a bartender; I work long hours and come home late. Additionally, I am severely mentally ill and I have a cat, who is an emotional support animal which I have the necessary documents for, signed by my psychiatrist. I am well aware that private renters don't have to accommodate non-life saving assistance animals, and I signed the lease just so happy someone would rent to me. They added to the lease that they could kick me out at any time with 30 days notice if they decided my cat was ""a nuisance"". This, coupled with the fact that the man had the audacity to ask me WHY I have PTSD, were red flags, but for lack of other options, I signed anyway.   Well this past week, I've been dealing with the death of a friend and co-worker who was shot and killed last Saturday. Cleaning has been on the back burner, and I've had trouble keeping a clean living space my whole life anyway, as a result of my depression. I know it's not a good excuse but it is what it is. This is not to say I live in filth; my clothes are all over the floor and sometimes there's a few empty pizza boxes lying around, but the litter box is scooped twice a week and dumped/replaced every 2 weeks.   Well, literally as I'm walking up to my door coming home from the funeral, my landlord informs me that it's not working out, claiming that he can smell the litter box from upstairs. Funny, since I dumped and changed out the litter that morning. Furthermore, if it had been an issue, I would think most reasonable adults would want to have a conversation before evicting someone with very few options from their home. I asked if the deposit I paid upon moving in, equal to the amount of my rent, would cover the 30 days. He said no, reread the lease, it's a security deposit and not the last months rent. Well since he waited until the 27th of the month to inform me that I needed to move out, and I obviously can't afford to pay for another month if I have to find a new place, I have 3 days to get out. That's not really a problem, I can stay with my boyfriend and I don't want to live under these people anymore anyway. Additionally, I went back last night to retrieve my birth control pills I had forgotten there before I moved my things out today. When I first left the apartment I know for a FACT I locked the doorknob and not the deadbolt. When I returned to get the medication, the deadbolt was locked. Indicating that my landlord had been in without permission or notification and I have no way of knowing he didn't dig through my stuff. I'm very upset about this, and how poorly he has handled all of it. I understand completely that the whole house is his property, but how is it legal that he entered my apartment, which is still leased to me until the 31st, without at least notifying me?  Most of all, I'm concerned about getting my deposit back. In my lease, it is stated that the deposit is to be returned to me minus any costs for damages. The only damage to the entire place is one small lipstick stain on the bathroom wall, maybe half the size of a dime. I've removed my things, cleaned top to bottom, and everything looks as it did when I signed the lease. There is absolutely no way he should get to keep my entire $500 deposit over a tiny lipstick stain. If he tries to do this, is there anything I can do? They aren't customers at my restaurant, we have no mutual friends, and I have no personal ties to them whatsoever. I have no qualms about taking him to court if that's what it comes to. Even if I don't get the whole deposit back because of the stain. He has no reason not to give me at least part of it and I'm not sure what to do."	No
1745	I live in Pennsylvania. My landlord, in the few months I've lived here has let our water shut off from no payment, refused to fix our stove and now it appears she hasn't paid taxes in years. There was a notice on our apartment today that the city is going to claim the building. What are my options? I'm about positive it will not be paid. I should add I paid my rent yesterday. We stopped that transaction. Are they going to throw me out? Do I have any legal recourse here?	No
1746	"My mom in the process of buying me a house (her offer has already been accepted) and I might be able to start working on it as early as next week.  There are at least 2 homeless people who are using the attic above the garage for shelter. I've never seen them but I have spoken very briefly with one of them.  I really don't feel comfortable with them continuing to use the house once it is mine. What are the proper steps I should take to let them know they need to leave?  My mom is worried once we tell them they will ""tear up the place"" but I think that's unlikely and even if it were to happen, I'm not sure there is anything we could do to stop it.  Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation? Also, if any homeless or formerly homeless people happen to see this post, I'd love to hear your perspective and advice."	No
1747	I wanted to apologize before hand, as I have never dealt with a situation like this before and I may be mixing terms up. If anything is unclear I'll explain to the best of my ability.  I recently received a letter in the mail regarding my deceased grandfather's estate that I was included in the Will for. It included a check for my portion of the estate.The letter stated the following verbatim:  &gt;We represent ****, executor of the estate of ****, Deceased. At this time, we are in a position to make a partial distribution of the amount bequeathed to you under **** will.  &gt;There are insufficient funds available in the estate to make full distributions. Accordingly, we are distributing funds at the pro rata amount of fifty percent of the amount bequeathed. Enclosed please fund two copies of a Receipt, Release, Indemnification, and Refunding Agreement for your review and signature. If you agree with the Receipt and Release document, please sign one copy in the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in the envelope provided. The second copy is for your records. I have also enclosed an estate check payable to your order representing the amount due you as indicated in the release document.  &gt;One the estate is completed, we will be sending you an additional pro rata distribution of the balance of the estate. If you have any questions concerning the enclosed materials, please feel free to contact me at the telephone number listed above.  The letter then continued to the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement that said the following terms:  &gt;NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned, beneficiary, intending to be legally bound, hereby: 1. Declares that he/she has read this instrument and that the facts set forth above are true and correct to the best of his/her knowledge, information and belief; 2. Requests the Executor to distribute the sum indicated to him/her and the acknowledges receipt of such distribution to him/her effective upon delivery to him/her; 3. Releases ad discharges the Executor and his successors from all further liability, responsibility, and accountability with respect to such distribution to him/her; 4. Agrees to refund all or any part of such distribution to him/her if it shoulder later be found that distribution was due to mistake (either innocent of negligent) is that all or part of it should have been paid to others or that taxes or other charges should have first been paid; 5. Agrees to indemnify the Executor against any and all liability, loss or expense (included, but not limited to, counsel fees) that the Executor may ever incur as a result of the distribution to him/her without first securing an award by the Court having jurisdiction over it; 6. Agrees that any claim under this agreement may be brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, agrees to submit to the jurisdiction thereof, and waives any objection to the jurisdiction thereof; 7. Declares it to be his/her intent that this instrument shall be governed by Pennsylvania law and shall be legally binding on him/her and on his/her executors, administration, heirs, successors, and assigns; and 8. Agrees that any period for the limitation of actions for the collection of any erroneous distribution to him/her shall commence only at such time as the Executor shall have obtained actual knowledge of such erroneous distribution and that in no event shall the period for collection of any erroneous distribution be less than two years after the actual discovery thereof by the Executor.   My major question here is to ask if anything above suggests that I should wait to deposit the check included with these documents and if I should have the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement signed and sent prior to doing so. Also, for an ELI5 of the terms I'd be agreeing to. I ask this because the executor of the will has done some cheap, questionable things in the past that have given his siblings and I reason to be suspicious that he might do something to exploit these terms. He also works for the firm that sent and wrote up these documents.  TL;DR-I received documents (detailed above) and a check from the firm handling the estate of my grandfather and wanted to make sure everything seems kosher since my Uncle who is the executor has been a shyster in the past. I also wanted to know if it is okay for me to deposit the check sent to me right away and when the appropriate time to send the signed documents back to the firm.	No
1748	A few years back I rented an apartment with my ex. Things fell through and I was removed from the lease and the utility bills upon her and the landlords approval. I have a formal document signed by myself and the landlord that I was taken off the lease. Currently I have a bill for the apartment as well as the utilities affecting my credit score. If I was taken off the lease am I still liable for those payments or can I dispute them?	No
1749	Problem 1:  My cousin has cancer. It was at one point treatable, but because of her mental health issues she was not able follow the plan established by her doctors. She is now terminally ill. Last week (Wednesday, the 44th day of her stay), we were notified by the hospital  that they planned to discharge her the next day. We were generally not happy with the treatment she received there (they would forget to feed her and administer her medication), but the nursing home she came from was worse, and we had yet to find better alternatives.  The next afternoon (Thursday) they returned her to the nursing home after saying she had consented to leave. She has  schizophrenia,  has not consistently received her medication, and is unable to make these kinds of decisions. I, her power of attorney,  did not discuss her discharge with anyone at the hospital (I was unable to return their call in time), and did not consent to her return to this nursing home. After speaking with my cousin about the incident later, she denies saying she was prepared to leave. Friday, around noon, less than 24 hours after she returned to the nursing home, she was readmitted to a different hospital for breathing problems. She was diagnosed with Pneumonia, and doctors noted spots on her lungs.   We are appalled by the way they have treated her, but aren’t sure who to contact, or what we can do about it. Should we contact the medical board? Do we need a lawyer? What kind of lawyer do we need?  Problem 2:  My cousin has siblings who so far, have not participated in her care, but seem very interested in her assets, and the possibility of acquiring them after her death (she has no children, a nice home, and over $150,000 cash). Though we haven’t mentioned it to her, she has said she suspects they are “only coming around now because they’ve figured out how much money i’ve got”.  One sibling is particularly intent on using her in any way possible. After meeting with her doctor to discuss her prognosis, his first thought was to search her house for life insurance policies. He has asked my husband and I to purchase bonds with her money, and a number of other “small” horrible things.   This weekend we found out that he broke into her house and changed  her locks. We do not know when it happened, or if he took anything, but my cousin says she did not want him in her house, and did not ask him to change her locks. He says he did so because he needed to find her insurance policy. He doesn’t want to be responsible for her funeral expenses after she passes, and didn’t trust me (the power of attorney) or her other sister to go to her home. He claims to be trying to do what’s best for her.   He has also been very adamant that she not return to her house (we’ve considered placing her there with an in-home nurse for her final days). We now believe it is because when he was there he stole something.   I am not sure how to protect her property from him while she is still alive, and I am wondering if I should call the police, and seek a  restraining order.  Thanks for any advice you can provide.	No
1750	"Hey guys, I'm kind of freaking out cause it looks like my eyes will never get to be 20/20 and I'm out $4000+ due to my current situation..  This kind of a long drawn out process, so I’ll just put everything in bullet form in chronological order:  •	December 2016: LASIK (using Contura laser) performed by doctor A. Result is ok, no longer have to use glasses, but not even close to 20/20.  •	March 2017: Go in for a check up and doctor A suggests an “enhancement” surgery  •	March 2017: Enhancement performed  •	June 2017: Go in for another check up, vision still not improving, doctor A suggests another enhancement.  •	June 2017: Wary of third surgery in the span of 7 months, I ask doctor A for medical records so I can get a second opinion.  •	June 2017: Get a second opinion for doctor B. He says my cornea has now become too thin for any more surgeries. He says that doctor A over corrected my astigmatism during my first surgery, then tried to correct the over-correction during my enhancements, which did not work.   •	June 2017: Share with doctor A what doctor B told me and recorded the conversation with his consent. Doctor A said that doctor B doesn’t know how to read the provided medical records because doctor A is using the “Contura” laser which doctor B is not familiar or had training with. **With ultimate confidence, he went on to say that with one more enhancement, my eyes will be 20/20 and will not require any more enhancements for the rest of my life.**  •	July 2017: Get a different second opinion from doctor C. The doctor echoes the opinion of doctor B and further went on to say that my cornea could be unstable at this very moment due to the two procedures. She said that due to my cornea thinness, there cannot be any more work done on my eyes now and for the rest of my life. Off the record, she went on to say that doctor A has a reputation in the community to perform reckless procedures and that the claims that he's making about how other doctors can't read his ""Contura"" laser is all ""bullshit"" because she has part of the Contura training as well.  At this point, I have lost all trust in doctor A and don’t think I’m going to not share any more information that I’ve gathered. I am definitely considering moving forward with legal action. Do I have a case? What do you guys suggest I do? Do you guys have any recommendations for a lawyer that can handle this kind of case in San Diego?  Thank you!"	No
1751	My wife and I are on what you might call an informal separation. She's been staying in another US city for about a month now. She's a 10-year green card holder and she recently mentioned that she might try to find a summer job while she's there.  My question is, could she potentially get in trouble with Immigration if she does this without having filed for a change of address? I'd imagine she'd need to give a potential employer an address and that she'd provide where she's currently staying. I'm concerned about the idea of USCIS seeing that one day and her being penalized in some form or another.  She hasn't indicated that she's going to stay there permanently, so she of course still has her official address the same as mine, which is what's on her driver's license, green card, etc.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!  *Also posted this to r/immigration before I realized it'd get more traction here, sorry*	No
1752	I'm renting an apartment through a management company. The least list my name, the agent's name of the management company, and the independent owner of the property (I guess the company manages properties for clients who own them). However, only me and the agent has sign, and this concludes the contract according to the agent. Should I ask the agent to ask the landlord to sign before I send in the deposit, or is it standard for only the agent to sign?	No
1753	"I will have lived in this rental property 1 year as of August 18th. When I moved in last August he prorated my rent for the rest of the month, but my lease agreements of 6 months have always been from the original move in date which falls on the 18th of the month. I've been paying my rent on the 1st of the month since September of last year. This month I paid my rent as per our agreement (agreement says by the 3rd of the month without penalty) on August 1st which covers August 1st through August 31st. On August 7th my landlord emailed me a new rental agreement (without any prior communication about the new rental terms) along with a note that said the rent would increase from $650 to $670 for the next term (which starts august 19th basically). I told him then that I likely would be moving out.  In our text messages it's clear I was interested in doing this based on what he expected and I texted back and forth with him over the next few days asking various questions about the move out process and what his expectations were for me to leave on good terms. I even explicitly asked about prorated rent and deposit if I left on the rental agreement date of August 18th (since I've already paid this entire month of August). He said ""I can refund you the amount if you choose to leave during this month. It's 22 dollars per day"" and ""The deposit is for leaving the room in clean and great condition. Once I see the room I can send the deposit back through Venmo."" I will be leaving the room clean and in good condition regardless of how this ends. We had other various exchanges about me keeping him informed on whether or not I'd officially found a place. After our conversations I believed it was understood and ok for me to move out on the 18th without any loss of funds (neither deposit owed after inspection nor prorated rent money) and was actively looking for another place with a move in date of August 18th.   Today August 10th he texted me saying that since I didn't give him 30 days noticed in our lease he would not be refunding my rent for the rest of August. This blew me away and I texted him back and told him that I'm willing to abide by the terms of our lease, but I'm curious where that leaves me? My lease agreement says August 18th, but I've paid through September 1st. So I'm not sure what happens after the 18th? I live here for 13 days with no rental agreement or I move out and leave $280 dollars on the table? Can I get that money back? Even september 1st wouldn't be proper 30 days and I'm worried he will not refund my deposit because of it even though the room is in good condition? If this becomes nasty (which I hope it doesn't) do I have any rights legally if he takes my deposit out of spite? I have text messages showing my intent to leave on good terms, his respones to that, and this his flip flop 3 days later. Is the lease agreement the only binding thing here?  tl;dr landlord is increasing rent. I decided to move. I've paid through the end of the month, but my lease expires on the 18th. Do i get my money back, am I out of $280 dollars ($22 dollars per day), or do I stay for what I've already paid for? Can i sue him if he tries to keep my deposit and prorated rent after he failed to notify me of lease agreement changes in a reasonable time?"	No
1754	Somebody left our house a few months into the year and now won't pay the share of the bills - despite not being relieved from the contract. Is the person obligated to pay?   I know some bills aren't fixed, ie heating/gas - but even then diminishing returns means we would be paying more. However internet etc are fixed - surely they should still pay for them?  Thanks	No
1755	"We've since moved out of state but the property in question was in Eastern Washington. Landlord sent a proxy for the walk through who was in our opinion completely over the top with the walkthrough, but despite that we thought it went okay. We were expecting for the landlord to find ways to chip away at most of our deposit with stuff here and there (for instance, there had been an ancient, cheap garage door opener which disappeared; we got charge $50 for it, but whatever). So even though we thought we had done a very good job taking care of the place and prepping it for the next renters, we were prepared to kiss our 1200 goodbye.  The landlord sent us a bill for $5,000 in ""damages"". That's it. No explanation, just ""tenant damages"".   There was no damage whatsoever that was caused by us that wasn't repaired before we left. There had been some severe damage caused by a freak windstorm a year prior that the landlord had never fixed. There had been damage that had been there before we even moved in, but the landlord claimed they didn't have our damage report on file and that they were going to go off old photos from ""before we moved in"". We had completed that when we moved in, sent it in, and wrote it down separate in a notebook since it was a single page form that they said they would copy and send back and of course never did. We completely repainted, we completely rebuffed and waxed the floors, we made every bathroom sparkle cleaned the chimneys, etc. We can't think of anything else they could possibly be charging us for.  What can we do to dispute this? They said we had ""ten days from the time of this letter"" to respond before it would be escalated to collections, and the date on the top of the letter was clearly marked two weeks before it was even sent. I've never had a landlord try to screw us like this before so I don't even know where to start."	No
1756	So I live in an apartment with 2 other people, the past 2 weeks we've had a small bee problem thats progressively gotten worse. All 3 of us have contacted maintenance multiple times but nothing's been done. We've gone through about 12 cans of wasp/ bee spray. They get in through a hole in the frame in our kitchen window we'll wake up to about 20-30 dead bees on our window every other day. Can we withhold our rent until something is done about this?	No
1757	"So here is the story,  My girlfriend and I just moved down to South Carolina and we are renting a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment. There are many flaws in this particular apartment, most of which were said to be taken care of before move in or right after move in. It is now 2 months after we have moved in with nothing happening, as well as myself going to the front desk 5+ times asking the dates of the work orders, or if the community manager can confirm that this will be fixed or if she can sign anything and date anything, but no luck.   Now, after multiple times of going to the front desk, the community manager got frustrated and said, ""you know what, you can hand in your 30 day notice and be let out of your lease without penalties"" so I got her to write that down for me in case of legal actions because now on our online payments there is a fee for early lease termination. Is there anything I can legally do to not have to pay the early lease termination?"	No
1758	"Basically what the title says. My wife and I just recently had our first child, and so we need to get a will and living will/medical directives in order.  I know wills can be complex, and rather than wasting an attorney's time with "" um, we don't know"" and ""we will get back to you"" responses, I figured that we could start with something like Willmaker pro. Then we could take our time and get everything filled out exhaustively, and take the documents it produces to an attorney to review and advise on. I figure this ultimately saves the attorney some time, and therefore saves us cash. I DO want an attorney to be involved because there are a lot of factors in our finances.  However, I wanted to see how actual lawyers who deal with wills feel about this. Would it be better to work through everything with the attorney from the beginning? How do you feel about things like Willmaker? Would my approach actually make things harder?"	No
1759	Hi all, 18 year old from GA. I made a paypal when I was under 18, roughly in 2014 so about 15 years old when I made it. Lied about DOB, did NOT attach SSN to the paypal, and attached my debit card when I was maybe 17. My dad just sent me something saying that paypal can seize funds of accounts made by minors, but I have no money in my account, only on my debit card, and I never put my social into the paypal account. Could paypal take the money from my bank for being a minor at the time? Anyway my credit could be negatively affected? Should I make a new account? Not really wanting to make a new account, because then I would also have to make a new email and get a new debit card.	No
1760	"Sorry this is a second post.  This is a separate issue.  I work at a corporately owned restaurant as a bartender-and there is a lot of shady practices.  Right now they are attempting to get me to quit/ fire me and I need to know what my rights are and if I am in a position to file for unemployment insurance in Ontario- and how to go about it.  Here's the run down:  *  I've been asked to resign in writing by the GM- they've threatened to fire me if I do not. * There is a lot of pressure to resign and the GM is angry when I do not * I did not resign, but I have been outright removed from next weeks schedule (they expected me to resign) prior to my refusal  * This is the second time I've been removed from the schedule- in November for 2 weeks I was given zero hours AND name was removed from the schedule- complained and was given hours * Have been asked multiple times if ""I am happy here"" and ""why haven't you resigned""  or they don't ""understand why I keep working here"" * Was provided with 3 writes up immediately following refusal to resign: I did have a bad week last week, however was not informed in writing or verbally reprimanded for anything after it happened. * Have not been provided with an opportunity or plan to fix any issues in the write ups.      I feel a strong pressure to leave, and clearly am a person non grata at the business- I know they want want me leave, yet don't seem to want to fire me and am attempting to force me to resign.    Where does this leave me?  Can I do anything via the Ministry of Labour?  Am I in a position to collect unemployment insurance while I find a new job?  Advice please?"	No
1761	Just like the title says. I have a recurring payment the first of every month to have money automatically taken out to pay rent. However, for some reason it was not taken out yesterday and now the apartment wants me to pay a late fee. I dont plan on paying that fee since it was the complex's system that did not take money out. However I am worried about them threatening the lease if I dont pay the late fee. What can I do?	No
1762	So my dad is on a ton of medication for his blood pressure that causes extreme frequent urination. Yesterday morning when he was headed home he got the urge to go RIGHT then. Anyone that has been on diuretics will understand. We are in Oklahoma by the way.  He pulled over in to an enclave (in a fairly rural part of town). As he was leaning against the hood urinating into the woods, someone drove by. They turned around as he was getting in the car screaming at him. (The guy had his wife and child in the car). My dad drove off because that is obviously a scary situation to be in.  Later we find out that the guy is blasting all over social media that my dad had his pants around his ankles and was masturbating in public. He didn't name him by name but we have an EXTREMELY recognizable car. Think only one of them in the state. He has since taken down the posts but claims to have made a police report and such.  My dad is an absolute wreck. He believes he has ruined our families reputation, is going to be hauled off to prison because its his word against theirs and they have three witnesses.   We have been in contact with lawyers and they just told him to lay low and not worry about it. They said worse case the cops might come by and talk to him. Urinating in public isn't a sex crime here in Oklahoma either.  Is there anything else I can do, what should we reasonably expect? What can I tell my dad to calm him down?	No
1763	Hey guys,  First off, I wanted to state that I know I am in the wrong here. Backstory is, I rent from an agency and the pet policy on my lease is no dogs, 1 neutered declawed cat allowed with pet deposit. When I moved in 2 years ago, I had a cat. I paid a $200 refundable pet deposit, and a $20 monthy pet rent for the cat. The cat died after around 7 months of me living here. I called the agency and told them the cat died and they removed the $20/month pet rent.   August 2016 I got a dog. At that point, I had been living in this apartment for over a year and had not seen the owner or maintenance around ever so I figured they would stay out of my hair about it and if they said anything I'd eventually deal with it. Almost a full year later (June 2017) I got a phone call from the agency and they left a message saying that I needed to start paying the pet rent for my cat and that they knew I had a dog and that I needed to get rid of it asap. At that point, I was away travelling for a month and the dog was staying elsewhere. I called them back and left a message saying that my cat had died over a year prior and I had notified them of that, and that I didn't have a dog.   I returned with the dog a month later and I have not been contacted again by them about it. No letter was ever sent, just the one phone call. I plan on moving out in 2 months anyway so I am not too concerned about it, but I am wondering if this will give them any grounds to screw me out of my security deposit. From reading this sub, am I wrong in thinking that their option in order to deal with the dog issue was to evict me, and that if they didn't do that, they cannot take my security deposit because of it ? Unless, of course, the dog destroyed the apartment (she didn't, she's a good girl). Also, how about the pet deposit? Please advise, thank you.	No
1764	So basically my ex-girlfriend borrowed my cat on Thursday under the pretense of needing to spend time with her for emotional support.  Then this morning (Sunday) she started sending me text messages saying that she is keeping the cat and that she will not return her at all.    What can I do here?  I've already called the police but they said I'd have to hire a private attorney and take her to court.  I have mountains of evidence and witnesses that the cat is mine and not hers, the cat is chipped to me and I have vets bills etc with my name on it.  I also have the texts where my ex says in clear terms that she knows the cat isn't hers but is keeping it anyway.    What can I do here?  I know this is a silly question but I really love the cat and want to get her back, thanks for your help.	No
1765	Specific legal question (So you don't have to dig for it): Are there any specific laws or previous court cases regarding similar situations that will provide useful information to us in moving forward in this dispute with our landlords?  My wife has a number of disabilities and mental conditions which have been diagnosed over years of work with various health and mental health providers.  These issues include, but are not limited to: PTSD Borderline Personality Disorder Codependency disorder Depression Anxiety  This situation revolves around my wife's psychiatrist prescribing her an emotional support animal due to her issues becoming unmanageable with medication. She reached the point that if I did not come home from work to get her out of bed she would stay there until I got home.  Since obtaining the animal just one week ago, my wife's condition has improved drastically.  Our landlords are demanding that we remove the animal. I've provided a dated timeline, and I would like to request any advice or specific laws/regulations pertaining to our situation. We reside in Indiana. We live in the country in an area with farms, but our mailing address is out of a nearby large city.  I have reached out to an attorney and I am awaiting an initial consultation so I can begin directing communication to my attorney, but I thought I would see how /r/legaladvice feels about the situation. Thank you for reading - I'll be skipping a tl;dr as I'm not sure how to condense this with enough details for solid advice.  -----  June 27, 2017 - My wife was prescribed emotional support animal by Bloomington Meadows Hospital.  “The above requires an emotional support animal - This is a medical requirement for her health”.  Due to the nature of ESAs, we delayed speaking to our landlord as our hope was to find an animal that would require no accommodations. We already had pets allowed in our lease, on a per-pet monthly fee of $25/month.  July 13th, approximately two weeks after the initial prescription, we made the decision to purchase a Kunekune pig. The reason for this decision are:  Comparatively long life - 10-15 years, comparable to a dog or cat. Small stature (100-200 lbs, 2’ tall, fully grown after three years, likely well after our lease terminates with the church) Cost of veterinary services - Pig vaccines are widely available at feed stores, and even having them applied by a veterinarian is under $40 every six months. Apart from vaccinations, watching their food, and hoof trimming, they require no additional special medical care. Intelligence - They are just as intelligent and capable as dogs, and are easy to train. Wife’s personal needs - As this is for emotional support, we wanted an animal that would be both bonded with her and independent enough to not need constant attention. Pigs can be as independent as cats, but love human attention as much as dogs. This was an acceptable in-between. Allergy Concerns - While ESA’s aren’t provided the same rights as service dogs with regards to public access, we wanted an animal not likely to raise allergy concerns in the event we recieved written permission to bring him into public areas such as the mall. Cat and dog allergies are common, mostly due to their saliva and fur. Kunekune and pig allergies are much less rare, and typically only involve being allergic to ingestion of the meat.  2:00 p.m. - Sent our landlords (Who happen to be a church), an email regarding my wife’s prescription, explaining some of the situation, and stating that we are understanding that we are responsible for certain liabilities with the animal. I also provided a copy of the prescription along with an offer to sign any additional legal documents requested by the church.  July 16th, 2017 - We went to Ohio and obtained the emotional support animal.  July 17th, 2017 10:00 a.m. - Landlord secretary replied as she was out of the office the previous week. She said she would contact the board for us and asked for information on the animal.  2:00 p.m. - I responded with the requested information.  3:00 p.m. - Landlord secretary asked if we had any certifications from any organizations (CertaPet, etc) regarding the animal.  4:00 p.m. - Landlord secretary stated that she believed that we required the landlord’s permission for any emotional support animal due to insurance, etc.  4:00 p.m. - I replied to the 3:00 p.m. email stating that online certification programs were primarily scams, as only a medical professional can prescribe an emotional support animal. I then sent a second email letting the landlord secretary know to alert me to any insurance issues. It was my hope that with us already paying the $150/month additional pet fees that there would be enough available to cover any insurance cost adjustments, considering we would be responsible for any damaged caused by the emotional support animal. I also sent a third email to elaborate on the nondestructive nature of the Kunekune, and to express hope that their insurance would only have dog breed restrictions.  9:00 p.m. - I sent an email with a photo of my wife and the pig to demonstrate the emotional support animal’s small size.  July 18th, 2017 - 9:30 a.m. - Landlord secretary responded stating that the animal’s current size is irrelevant to their concerns.  July 20th, 2017 - 5:30 p.m. - I sent an email asking about the inspection date under our current pet policy, and gave details on the upcoming rent payments.  8:15 p.m. - Landlord secretary sent an email stating that local code prevented us from having the animal, and demanding the eviction of the prescribed emotional support animal.  Landlord secretary also stated that they had made several consultations, including an attorney, and informed us incorrectly that we would be responsible for any legal fees as per item number 23 in our lease. Item 23 specifically states that the party that loses the legal dispute would make those payments.  9:00 p.m. - I responded by attempting to explain and educate regarding the law and emotional support animals. I also researched the city’s ordinances, and noted that the line regarding pigs specifically named a specific species. I made several other attempts to dissuade the church from what would be a waste of church funds. I also alerted the church that I would be seeking an attorney and could provide contact information in the future if this course was unavoidable.  July 21, 2017 2:45 p.m. - Landlord secretary emailed me and provided multiple counter points to my previous response. I was also informed there will be an inspection on Monday, July 23rd, in order to ensure we have removed the animal. I was also instructed to keep all communication with the church written. Landlord secretary also attached the zoning ordinance regarding pigs in non farm zoned areas. However, this ordinance was from a small town nearby that is not the city which is the home's address.  5:00 p.m. - I responded stating that we would not be removing the pig, due to it being a legally prescribed animal protected by law. I also stated that due to their pursuit of the situation we would be providing contact information for our attorney.  I also informed the landlord secretary that as per previous situations involving my wife’s mental state, I would be forced to take off work on Monday, July 23rd, if they insisted upon attempting to inspect the house on a day I worked. I offered to schedule for July 29th instead. I also stated that I would reach out to the small town as I was confused as to which ordinances affect our home. Our home has a mailing address in a major city, and is also in an area with several farms as it is outside the main city limits and therefore there are already farm animals in the area.  I also apologized for any legal misinterpretations or misrepresentations I offered, and explained that I would be providing our attorney’s contact information after an initial consultation and filing some paperwork as I did not wish to further discuss items which are not my place of expertise.  I also provided another reminder in regards to rent for August, and asked if due to their previous statement on documentation if they would prefer I mailed the checks. If that is the case, I can not guarantee they will arrive by the 10th. If this is the method they would prefer, then I believe that would be permission to be late with checks (Within reason) without incurring the $65 late fee.  6:15 p.m. - I submitted a complaint to HUD for discrimination.	No
1766	One of our neighbors busted a water pipe and it ended up seeping into our master bedroom, bathroom, and closet. We noticed the wood laminate in the bathroom starting to warp and when we lifted it up, it smelled terrible and looked like mold had been growing underneath it. I talked the property owner and he said he will not higher an inspector. He has agreed to replace the carpet and laminate, but Im concerned with how long that mold has been sitting there. We have less than two months left on our lease and Im trying to weigh my options. I told him we would be open to leaving, but he wasnt going for that. I want someone in there yesterday to tell me whether or not we're breathing in something toxic and Im not opposed to hiring my own inspector.	No
1767	Im in a really bad situation right now, i was caught at my school with possession of marijuana, and the court date is coming up. My family is stressed and they think they are going to be deported because we arent citizens. They think they will be arrested when we arrive at the court, and this was my first offense (im 14) please help, do i just get probation and community service or are we getting kicked out of usa	No
1768	I bought a 2014 Ford fusion used about 6 months ago. A few days after having it I found out it has some issue where it goes into the limp home mode if you accelerate too quickly. This means power train service light and airbag light come on and the car refuses to accelerate normally until turned off and back on again. It's sometimes accompanied by a check engine light but not always. I bought it with a third party extended service warranty that covers almost everything and it still has the manufacturers power train warranty.   It was bought used at a non Ford dealership who initially tried to repair it under their warranty for me, but they were unable to diagnose it and they had me take it to a Ford dealership and they would pay for it.   Over the course of about 4 months and 5 visits, they replaced a mass airflow sensor, the battery, and the throttle body. None of that fixed the issue.   I took it to a different Ford dealership but they were unable to fix it under warranty (the third party warranty required it be fixed at the selling dealer if I was within 40 miles of it) and they wouldn't honor the power train warranty. I took it back to the welling dealer who said they couldn't diagnose it and they told me to go to Ford. I took it back to the Ford they sent me to previously and they said it would take them several days to diagnose it and asked me to come back later.   At this point I was in the process of moving across the state, so I moved and found a Ford dealer near me and took it there. They kept it for a week and replaced the accelerator pedal. The check engine light came back on with the same code so I took it back the next day. They turned the code off and test drove it for a while and it didn't come back so they stated it was fixed.   I picked it up again and the original limp home mode issue happened again so in immediate dropped it off again. That was yesterday, and at this point its been at the third ford garage for 2 weeks now. I've been to garages for the same issue about 7 times or so over the last 6 months.   At this point it seems unlikely to me it'll get fixed and this has been an extreme hassle dealing with. Do lemon laws apply to used cars? What are my options here?	No
1769	Standard info for my county is [here](http://www2.duvalclerk.com/departments/county-civil/).  I cannot find the instructions for master tenant / subtenant evictions.  Maybe I can look up some similar filings somewhere?  In addition to the above general question, one specific issue I have is how to prove (or if it's required to prove) that I'm the master tenant if my lease with the landlord has been lost by both parties.  Or will the court simply accept that I'm the master tenant on the face value of my assertion that I am on the eviction filing?	No
1770	"This happened in Dallas. I got cited for out of date registration in Dallas Thursday of last week. I took my car to get it inspected on Friday and plan to get the registration handled today.   However this morning a DPD police officer gave me another citation for the out of date registration. I showed him the earlier citation from the same police department and showed him how I was doing my due diligence on getting the inspection done so that I could get it registered.   He did not care. He told me that he ""Had no choice but to cite me.""   Now I am looking at 2 23.50 dollar fees at the dallas municipal courthouse. Its a 20 dollar dismissal fee plus 3.50 for using a card.   Does this not fall under double jeopardy since this is the same PD for the same violation?"	No
1771	"I'm currently living in a home that's owned by one of my roommate's grandfather. Every month I pay rent to his parents. Lately I've come into conflict with my roommate, and by extension, his parents or my ""land lords"" over noise complaints, saying that their son, on the other side of the house, can't get sleep. Though I've never heard anything from my other roommate who sleeps in the room right next to mine. I say ""land lords"" because I never signed a lease, I pay every month in cash, and I doubt they claim the income in their taxes. More recently I've been threatened with being ""thrown out onto the street"", needless to say I don't quite like that. If the address on my license is this house, how long would the process be? How long if it wasn't?"	No
1772	"I posted a while ago in the HomeImprovement subreddit about mold in my business, I can provide the link if necessary.  Per their advice, I have been ripping up the carpet, scrubbing as much mold off as possible from the subfloor with a broom/brush, attempting to kill it with bleach, then coating the floor with polyurethene.  I am concerned about my health and the health of my customers, I do not want people breathing in spores while they're in my business.    I contacted my landlord about reimbursing me for the cost of the remediation materials.  (I realize now I should have been more specific.)  They agreed to reimburse me, so I plowed ahead and have spent nearly $1000 on polyurethene.  (The business is 2600 feet, there is a lot of space to cover.)  They sent me less than $400, and when I recently asked for more, I was told that they agreed ""to pay for the section of the floor in need of repair from the water damage, not the entire studio floor.""  I offered to send them photographs of the mold, which has proliferated through a LOT of the space, but I haven't heard back.  (My understanding is that the whole floor NEEDS to be done, because even one surviving spore could render the entire project useless.)  I am furious and I don't know what to do.  It will be difficult for me to afford fixing the rest of the floor myself.  I've thought about threatening to contact the Board of Health, but my lease doesn't end for another 2 years and I want to try to maintain a working relationship with these terrible people.  It's even more enraging to me because the mold wouldn't be an issue if they put any effort into maintaining the property; there is water damage from a leaking pipe in the next space, and my ceiling leaks when it rains because the roof is in terrible condition.    They've said they're going to fix the roof which is good, but I'm also worried about it because their lease places far more responsibility on the tenants than usual, and their practices have driven a lot of my neighbors out, so I may be responsible for an even greater percentage of the common area maintenance than I already am.  I am feeling increasingly trapped by these dishonest people, and any advice would be greatly appreciated."	No
1773	I will be leaving the country for six months for work. I have a few roommates who pay me rent. I have one who I feel comfortable putting in charge of collecting rent and paying any handy men if they are needed. Should I give her a limited power of attorney for these matters? Or is a written contract enough to hold up in any suit should things go south? Is there anything else I should consider to ensure rent gets paid while I'm away?	No
1774	Hello please help if you can! My fiancé now 27 got into an altercation with his child's mother when he was 19 and because of that they gave him a felony and made him register as an predatory offender for 10 years. Years have gone by and all has been fine. 6 months ago he got his first dui. They put him on probation for two years. In bad luck he recently became homeless and did not have a valid address for two months. The officer called him and told him to check in yesterday because they haven't heard from him since may. So he went in today and they arrested him. Now they are charging him with a felony and his court is in 48 hours (Thursday). We can't afford a lawyer, already told the people he was homeless. I am so scared what's going to happen! We are in the state of Minnesota. Please give advice or help I am so worried!!! -Gypsy	No
1775	First off, I was a dumbass and didn't take pictures before I moved in. It was my first apartment and I thought the move-in checklist would be enough to prove my innocence for damages that were already there. There is one spot on the carpet on my bedroom that they are charging me $300 for. It was there when I moved in but I overlooked it on the checklist because it's honestly so minor. The common area had two spots because my roommate was horrible and had a horrible dog, but once again, they're pretty minor. They split the cost of that between all three roommates, which comes out to $200 each. They did not make me do a security deposit since it was a 6 month lease. My question is, is there anyway that I can fight this? I emailed the property manager and she was very snarky and reminded me that my balance will be forwarded to the collection agency after 30 days. Rent was only $425 a month and they're charging me $500. I find this disgusting since the majority of tenants are university students. They're taking advantage of us but I don't know how to fight this. Any advice would be amazing. Also, I've linked the pictures of the damage. [carpet damage ](https://imgur.com/gallery/uvSEg)	No
1776	"He and his roommate don't really get along; he told me signed an agreement that he would pay to live there on a month to month basis. the roommate deals with the landlord and he deals with the roommate as his ""landlord"".  Well, long story short, they end up not liking each other and the roommate now tells my friend he has a couple of days to get out and find a new place. She's asking for him to get out and give him the keys to his room. Even threatening to change the locks and call the cops. As far as I know; my friend has been up to date with rent. Is this legal? My friends working right now and he's scared he's going to go home any not be able to get in with the keys he has? What can he do then?   Call the cops and tell him the situation, can he sue for being thrown out of his apartment? He's a good guy; I have no reason to believe he did anything terrible that warranted him being kicked out so quick. But then again I don't know the whole story"	No
1777	Hello all. I've been putting off posting this for some time as I fear the social backlash it will likely cause against me, deservedly so.  I have been charged with a DUI and wonton endangerment. This is my first offense with no prior of any wrong doing of any kind on my record, aside from a couple speeding tickets years before. I will share this short story that I believe contributes to my case, but I suspect it will not be relevant to those who make the ultimate decisions:  I was in a physically abusive relationship and couldn't hold a stable job; unable to find work in my field I was a miscellaneous contractor for a couple different positions that I was thoroughly unsatisfied with. I honestly thought I was only a drag to my partner, not worth anything, and unable to contribute to the household; because I couldn't.  Rewind to end of last year: two days prior to my offense, my partner finally hit me hard enough for me to call the police. He went to jail that night which was not my intention at all. I was expecting the police to show up, see me, give him a stern talking to, and leave. Instead, they saw my face and took him to jail.  So, now, I sat in an empty apartment realizing the severe trouble I just caused. I couldn't possibly have made his life any worse at this point. Two days go by I am alone still having heard no word from him at all. Unware of if he was still in jail or what was happening. I didn't want him to be in jail. It was never my intention to make his life worse than I already had.  He finally texts me the night of the incident and that's when I made the poor decision to go pick him up. The worst mistake of my life.  I thank whatever supernatural power you may believe in that I did not kill anybody. I struck three vehicles, none of which caused any serious injury and my insurance company has taken care of them well. I was petrified I may have hurt people trying to rescue the situation I caused with my partner by attempting to pick him up.  I did not press charges against my partner for abuse because I still believe I pushed him to the point of physical violence with my stupidity and inability to contribute to the household.  Since then, on the brighter side of the fence, I am on home incarceration and finally have a very stable job at a very respectable company in the field I love. This job started at the beginning of the year; I got it within a week of having a work release in HIP and in the short time I've been here I have already been promoted.  My lawyer and I talk very little but I'm hearing this is pretty common. I just received a release to visit his office and speak with him. The little I have gathered (and this was only a couple weeks ago) is that the prosecutor wants 7 years of hard prison time.  With as little as I have talked with him, he doesn't sound very confident in the ability to change that. From what I have gathered at my hearings, that is an offer made by the prosecutor but my lawyer has not yet approached me with it.  Is there anything I should be bringing to his attention of the situation? Is there anything I should be pushing for?  Ultimately, I just want to prove that I am still a capable human being and would love to resume being a good, tax paying citizen. I've worked my butt off the past 3 months in an effort to show the world the one mistake I made under duress was a one-time thing, but I suspect it will all be for naught very soon.	No
1778	My girlfriend and I are notifying our landlord we intend to not renew for August 31. She's currently across the country and will not be back until the 31st. We are both listed on the lease agreement.  Do we both legally have to sign or can I just sign it?  Also, our landlord's house is about 5 minutes driving distance away. I plan on mailing a copy as well as giving him one in person as he's around age 80 and has shown to have no idea what he's doing. We've sent him things before and he's 'lost' them. Should I send it via both methods or only one?  Located in Pittsburgh, PA	No
1779	"I am sorry in advance if this is long  3.5 years ago I had some issues where I woke up and wasn't able to move my joints, this was accompanied by large lumps on my legs. I was 24 years old (Female). I was referred to a dermatologist as they thought I had Erythema nodosum. Over a month or so I was doing tons of blood work and seeing this dermatologist anywhere from 1-3 times a week. I was constantly being told it was something else and being put on new medication. During this month I was also referred to a rheumatologist. Rheumatology and dermatology had a big meeting (?) where there were roughly 50 specialists of different levels in a room (I dont know what its called) to discuss my case because it was extremely rare. I was diagnosed with something called ""polyarteritis nodosa"" which is a rare form of vasculitis. My dermatologist called me with great news that they finally new what it was and then prescribed me.. prednisone (a oral steroid). I was given it for 6 weeks. Over this 6 weeks I started experiencing dehydration, frequent urination, some weightloss, extreme fatigue. I made appointments and saw him on numerous occasions because I felt that this should not be happening and something felt very wrong. He assured me it was just side effects and would send me on my way. At the end of the 6 weeks he essentially told me I was good to go and that I shouldn't have any more flare ups. Roughly a week later I started seeing lumps on my legs again and quickly made an appointment. Without questions, blood work, anything, he prescribed me another 6 weeks of prednisone. He told me he absolutely did not want to see me for 6 weeks and to not come back in. I started taking it and within a day or two all the side effects came back.. and they only got worse. I started losing lumps of hair, losing drastic weight and started blacking out. I would leave class ( I was a student at the time) and then wake up on a couch in the hall 4 hours later. I had lost roughly 35 lbs which was essentially all muscle. I am overweight and always have been.. my legs were the size that someones upper arm should be. I started barely being able to walk because my body wanted to collapse. After 3 weeks I made an appointment. The first thing the doctor said to me was ""I said I didn't want to see you for 6 weeks"".  I started crying and told him something was very wrong. Then he said ""I think you have type 2 diabetes because you are so overweight"".  This came from a doctor that ran 15+ blood tests on me months prior. He sent me for blood work that day and I got a call from the emergency room.  My sugar levels were at 29 mmol/L (540mg/dl). I was kept in the hospital that night and had an IV of fluids going through me. The nurse I had was talking to me and was very confused as to why the doctor put me on prednisone. She went and spent some time reviewing my file. She came back and told me that before the steroids my blood sugar levels were completely normal. She told me that in that meeting with all the doctors.. every single doctor recommended he NOT put me on prednisone because of the risk of type 2 diabetes (Due to the fact that im over weight). I am in the process of retrieving all my files from the hospital. I recently moved out of Ontario to Alberta. My diabetes are pretty controlled but this is still something that will effect me for my entire life. I know it has been 3.5 years but at the time I had no energy to think of anything to do with legal, I was also a student. Now that I am in my career and still need to see numerous doctors on a regular basis I am starting to realize how much what he did has effected my life and will continue to do so. I pay for medications that I should have never needed if it wasn't for him. Although being overweight I am and extremely active, healthy person. I always have been. I played soccer for 18 years, basketball for 5. I was a bike messenger riding 60-70km daily before moving to alberta.. this should have never happened. I need to know if it is worth it to go and talk to a lawyer.   Tl;DR  - a doctor gave me a medication against the advice of roughly 50 other doctors that resulted in me developing type 2 diabetes despite me showing all signs of type 2 and him ignoring. Do I go to a lawyer?"	No
1780	Hi,  My boyfriend and I live together in a neighborhood with an HOA. My boyfriend is blind, and takes our dog to the park every day, which is in the center of our community.  Our neighborhood does not have sidewalks or curbs, it just has road which turns into grass. In the past, they dug a large 4ft by 4ft hole in the middle of the road and only had 4 tiny cones, one on each corner, to mark the area. My boyfriend fell into the hole and luckily didn't hurt himself. I contacted the HOA and told them, and asked if they could please use taller cones slightly outside of the perimeter, and some type of caution tape so my boyfriend would hit that with his cane before physically falling into the hole. They apologized and did this.  Today I got a text from him that he fell into a different hole. This one was right on the edge of the road, they dug up the corner of the park area 4 feet either way, and about 3 feet deep. Absolutely no parking whatsoever. It was filled completely with water because we had heavy rain yesterday.  What can we do? Are they allowed to do this? I don't want to sue anyone, I just want to know if they're required to mark construction in a certain way or not, and if they're doing it wrong I'd like to ask them to make sure it's marked correctly in the future.  His cane catches a lot of things but it doesn't catch everything.  Thanks for any help you can offer, thanks.	No
1781	Hello everyone! Recently, i have decided to take a trip to India to visit my friend and of course, i need a visa. That friend of mine sent me a link on phone but i got to the wrong site by mistake when i used my laptop; it is called etavisaonline.in Later, I had my friend paid the fee, which was €99 and waited for 3 days as it said. After the third day, i received no reply and the application id they gave me turned out to be invalid as i checked it on the site of the gov. I've realised my stupidity and applied on the right web this time, got my visa for nearly half of the price.  Now i'm scared that we have paid a fraudulent source and what frightens me more is the safety of my friend's information as he used a visa debit card. I'm sincerely asking for advice since i dont know what to do now. Pls help. Thank you guys so so much	No
1782	"**The Story** My Fiance's dad (let's call him Saul for anonymity) has been living in his father's old house, in upstate NY for the past 30 years or so. This house has fallen into a state of disrepair: caved in ceilings, mold and water damage. Basically it needs to be torn down and a new house needs to be built on the property before the conditions become too dangerous.  **The Problem** Saul and his family are low income, and he hasn't had the cash upfront for repairs over the years. The bank will not issue a loan against the property since he does not have legal ownership. He has told me that for the past 17 years he's been pursuing legal action to gain ownership, but the hired lawyer is making very little progress.  **Tricky Family Situation** The house was left to my Fiance's dad and his siblings in their father's will, but, Saul only has a copy of an un-signed will. Here's where it gets tricky, Saul's mother was never married to his father (who also had two previous marriages, and was never legally divorced from the second wife).  Saul has five siblings, three immediate and two half from previous marriages.

1783	Last month my landlord and I had a hearing with the Ontario Landlord Tenant Board. The board offers mediation prior to the hearing to help move cases along instead of long drawn out hearings all day. My landlord and I agreed in the mediation that he would pay us a month and a half rent back on top of our last month's rent deposit by the end of the month. I then went to deliver the keys to him at the rental at which point he brought up a damaged garage door. The door was not damaged by us. The end of the month came and he only paid the last months rent deposit back. He said he would pay the remaining amount minus what it cost for the repairs to the door. As far as I can understand, this is not how this works, and the agreement we signed states he must pay the alloted amount by the end of month. I explained this to him and he has now decided to take me to small claims for the damages. There was no written or physical inspection done at the beginning of the lease. This is also indicated on the lease we signed. The landlord and an overhead door repair company had been to the rental multiple times over our tenancy to inspect/repair the door and at no point mentioned that the door was becoming or had become damaged.   So it comes down to this: 1. What are my options? 2. If he does take me to small claims, how much of a leg do I have to stand on? 3. What should I do to prepare myself for if he goes through with small claims?   Thank you in advance.	No

1785	Hi, /legaladvice,  About two months ago, I got engaged. We moved in together and did not get along at all and he became very controlling and weird so I ended the relationship and moved back out and am living with my parents at the moment. We both signed a one-year lease for the apartment. I have since contacted him and he has no problem with me removing myself from the lease.  So my question is... what will this do to my credit and will it affect my ability to get another apartment?  I have a 760 score and I am self-employed, if it matters. I know from Credit Karma that the first lease gave me a hard inquiry on my credit. After being removed, would I be able to sign my own lease soon after?  Thanks in advance	No

1787	This is a long story, but I will try to make it short. I bought a house in June, so I wanted to move out of my apartment. However, my lease contract did not have an early termination fee (I found out that Texas laws are terrible for renters). So I decided to try subleasing my apartment, announcing it on craigslist. I was offering good incentives to whoever decided to move in, hoping to find someone as soon as possible. Apparently, the only legal way to sublease the apartment was to remain in the contract and add the new renter as a roommate. l felt safe since I knew that the apartments always do a background check before accepting someone. Several people asked about the apartment, but the one that finally accepted my offer was a woman. Some things on her profile were weird, but in the end, she passed the background check and things looked ok. On July, I got a call from the apartments. They told me that Ivy had rented the apartment to two other guys and that she did not live there anymore (I visited her before and I am sure she was living there in June). She was not answering her phone and she had not paid July's rent. At that point, I tried contacting her at her job and they told me that she never worked there. I had to pay the rent, late fees, insurance, etc. The guys that were renting the apartment from her were asked to move out immediately and they also lost a lot of money (from rent and deposit). The worst part is that the apartment complex is not giving me any information to help me locate her or even sue her and they won't take any action since I am paying the rent. They also say that I cannot search for another person to rent the apartment since I would need her signature! So my only option is to pay a reletting fee and the monthly rent until the apartment is rented. Do you have any idea about how to proceed in this case? How can I get the apartments to help me? Are they partially responsible since they did the background check and approved her? I am planning to go to small court to sue her and see how that goes. But if you have more ideas I would really appreciate them.	No
1788	"I happened to stumble upon an interesting situation the other day. Of course, we all know that a Representative working for a said company while speaking understand that any call they are on whether outbound on inbound is recorded and they agree to the recording through employment. While the customer understands and agrees to the recording as calling the Call Center with a message stating the recording.   Say that the customer gets the Representative; which we will place both the Call Center and the Customer within The state of Maryland. The customer then before the conversations starts he allows the representative to know that the call is being recorded for their personal use (Most likely just in case any wrong information is given, info about the account, and for their safety). Yet, the call center Representative states they do not authorize the recording from the customer and disconnects or will disconnect the call if he plans to keep recording the call ""because in the state of Maryland each person(s) has to agree to the recording for it to be valid'.  How are they able to deny a recording of a call or conversation when their job is literally always recording them and both parties agreed to the original knowledge of the call being recorded."	No

1790	Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	No
1791	"I work at a minimum wage service job and put in my two weeks on Monday last week. As the usual two-week courtesy notice would have it, I would typically work until my last usual shift which is this Saturday. However, I told him in writing on my two-week notice that I only want to work til this Thursday (two days from today), which is kinda like a one and a half week notice. To get me to work the last couple shifts, he claimed two things (in person)    1) I need to show up to work because ""I already paid you for those hours, so you need to show up for them"". and    2) ""I need to give you your last paycheck on your last day"" in exchange for my uniform.    ...now for the record I think I know the real reason as to why he's doing this. A number people are leaving for vacation during this time (which is why I couldn't request time off myself in the first place) so he kinda maybe needs me. I also know that I have a direct deposit with the company, so the ""hand me my paycheck thing"" seems pretty bullshit. At the very least, I know he's heavily bending the truth, either too proud to tell ask me straight ""Hey I know you wrote you wanted to give me one and a half weeks, but I really need you this weekend."" or just hoping I'm gullible enough to believe whatever he claims.    Or is he? That's what I want to ask you guys.    Is he legally able to indebt me with ""wage prepayment"" and as a side question, how bullshit is his need to ""hand me my check on the last day""?    Thanks for your time."	No
1792	"Hello all! I live in a house in CT that has a somewhat unusual arrangement regarding the driveway. When we purchased the house, we were given an almost 30 year old agreement between two former owners, who agreed to ""grant each other mutual access"" to their yards for the sum of $1. The property line between the two houses runs lengthwise down the driveway. The yards can only be reached through the driveway or through the houses themselves. The lawyer who helped closed on our house told us that technically, as per the arrangement, both us and our neighbors could block each other from parking a car in the driveway, and that the arrangement concerns access to the yard, not use of the space in the driveway itself. So, I own half, my neighbors own half, and we split the driveway down the middle.   They are considering selling the house and I'm thinking of approaching them about extending my property line to the edge of their house. Of course I would grant the new owners the same arrangement, whereby we can both access our yards from the driveway. Is there anything I'd want to keep in mind here? Legally, this was a strange-sounding arrangement to me, and I'm not sure what my options are or what the process is.   Thanks!"	No
1793	So long story short a guy at work took a picture of a friend in the bathroom stall at work cropped him out and placed in a lot of hilarious locations. It was then distributed around our group text among friends at work. Everybody, including the guy on the shitter, found it extremely funny and it good humor. Somehow this picture got out HR got involved and interrogated everyone apart of the group text. We explained it was horse play and admitted to the foolery. Can they company terminated the person and anyone involved in the group text?	No

1795	It is a laughable number. This is in addition to the $1200 deposit they're keeping. We left the house in good condition, given we had lived in a 5 person roommate situation for 3 years. We weren't expecting the full deposit back, but were hopeful for a couple hundred bucks or so. Any holes or dents were nicely patched, we steamcleaned the carpets, professionally cleaned the empty house, pressure washed the garage floor and every concrete patio, cleaned the gutters....you get the gist. The repairs they are charging us for are absurd and unreasonable.  What options do we have to go against this? They are threatening to send the debt to collections if we dont pay within 30 days. There are 2 names on the lease, do we each get that debt? Is this one of those things that they throw out an insanely high number and settle for way leas later? Does renters insurance help with this at all?  I dont even know where to start with this, any help is greatly appreciated!! The rental company is Waypoint Homes if anyone has any experience with them.	No
1796	I thought i'd come get a more informed opinion before I go forward with this.    I'm a student at a public university in the NC state system. Our recreation center provides a specific kind of barbell in the weight room for student usage, it is a 20kg weightlifting bar meant for males.    This type of barbell is also made for women with different specifications; shorter length and thinner diameter, as these characteristics are better suited for female athletes/exercisers. Our recreation center does not provide an equal amount, or even one, women's weightlifting bar. We have plenty of female students that would benefit from having them.    Based on a cursory overlook of the Title IX provisions am I on solid ground bringing this to the attention of the recreation center management? I feel as though they'd be forced to act on it immediately to provide more equipment and thus equal access/opportunity for both sexes.    Any input or corrections would be appreciated.	No
1797	Hello!   Today I moved out of my student-centered apartment complex. It was fully furnished when I moved in, and over the course of my stay, I broke the chair that came in my room. No problem, the replacement fee was like 30 someodd dollars. The chair was never replaced by maintenance, however, and when I tried to log into our resident portal this morning, I was told I currently cannot access the account. This is where the itemized list of charges and payments was housed, and we were given no indication that we would not be able to access it at any point. While I do have payment receipts that show on my bank account, it's not itemized, and since I paid for the chair in one swoop along with rent and utilities, I can't prove that the money I paid was for that charge.   There is a good chance that when they evaluate my apartment, they will see the broken chair and charge me again. Is there any recourse for this? Or any way to regain access to my account and my records at all? Without those, it becomes a game of he-said she-said, and I feel certain I won't win.   Thank you!	No
1798	Ok so my apartment complex gave me an offer to rent for a 712 dollar move in fee and 705 a month rent for 6 months. This offer was received in the form of a detailed lease agreement in a pdf document. However when I went to sign the agreement they told me it was wrong and wrote me a lease agreement for 725 a month and 838.33 move in fee. Both agreements use proper language and have due consideration. I told them they have to honor the firm offer rule and honor the first contract. They are refusing. How do I get them to honor the first agreement. They are in definitive breach of the UCC to my understanding. What court do I take them to?

1799	Hi!  I work for a company in Philadelphia. I'm salaried and paid every two weeks. Last pay period the checks were delayed a week and when I received my check I noticed NO taxes were taken out. The amount of the check was for my take home pay. I complained and a few days later the proper check was issued with my salary and taxes taken out to give me the take home pay amount. At the same time, other employees paychecks have bounced. Now, again, my paycheck is delayed.  I want to quit this job and get my owed paycheck, plus the paycheck for the last week I worked.  I plan on quitting today or tomorrow because as of now I've worked three weeks for free and my boss doesn't seem like he's going to pay me.   How can I go about attempting to legally collect my owed pay?	No
1800	I interned in another state this summer, and took over a lease for housing. I signed in early April, moved in May 6, and my lease ended July 31.    In the lease that I signed with the complex, it states my lease start date as May 6, and says that I am to pay a total of $1738, which is equal to two months of rent. I assumed that the girl whose lease I took over read this, and was ok with it. Now, three months later, she is demanding that I pay her back $600 for the month of May. She has said that she will be filing a claim in small claims court today if I do not pay her.     I am not familiar with how small claims court would work when I live in another state. We are currently in Georgia, but I will be moving back to Florida next week.     Since the lease I signed states that I am only responsible for two months of rent, I do not think I am obligated to pay her. We also never talked about me paying her back for May.     What are my options here?	No
1801	Throwaway for obvious reasons.  So, I've been living with my boyfriend for about 3 months. I have a room here, my stuff is here, everyone knows I live here. I receive some mail too.   I am not on the lease. He rents from a couple. I also do not pay rent. I have not changed my address on my ID just yet because we've been having trouble lately and I pretty much assumed it would end in a breakup, which it basically has.  I'm wondering what he can do if we breakup. Can he force me to leave his home tonight? If he calls the police on me and I have done nothing violent, can they arrest me?  Can he legally lock me out of the house and refuse to give me my things back?  What if he destroys my things?   I'm so paranoid. I'm waiting for him to go to work so I can move my things out without him here, but until then I would like to know my rights.  Thank you in advance.	No

1803	Hello,  I am facing a situation where I decided to move in with two roommates in Massachusetts that I met them through a Facebook Housing Group. I met them in person, and they seemed like decent people I could live with. We all submitted an application and put the money down on this place, and were e-mailed the lease to sign. Me and one other roommate have signed it; however, the third has been hesitant. She says due to health reasons she may not be able to work, and does not want to commit to signing the lease without first getting results from a specialist (this appointment could take many weeks past the due date of the lease signing to get). There is a broker's fee also, so we'd potentially lose both our down payments and the lease entirely if she does not sign it by the appropriate date. I care about her health and don't blame her for being hesitant, but at the end of the day I do not want to lose my money or this apartment. What are my options if she doesn't sign, or is that entirely at the discretion of the lease office? Thanks for any advice!   TL;DR My third roommate won't sign a lease, and it may be too late by the time she does. My concern being is I can lose the first month's rent I put down as a deposit if she does not sign it by the date. What should I do? Would this mean I lose both the lease and the deposit (there is a broker's fee)?	No

1805	Hi everyone. Long story short, I moved into a new apartment complex a little less than one month ago. I have a work vehicle with commercial plates (nothing major, just a sedan) that was originally allowed to be parked in my parking spot assigned to me with the apartment. Yesterday I find out that the apartment complex just changed the rules so that no commercial vehicles can be parked in the lot (I found out as I come outside to them about to tow my car). I reached out to the main office and they said that in my lease it says that they can add an addendum at any time so I'm SOL. Do I have any recourse? I've considered just leaving but I'm worried about the legal implications as well as the effect on my credit but I'm kinda screwed if I can't park my car on the premises and there's no street parking within 2 miles.	No
1806	We are currently in Jersey, my dad is in the hospital. We want to take him into Penn for cancer treatment, but they won't discharge the only way they will let him leave if he signs a against medical advice form.  We want them to do a transfer, and they won't, Penn already has an agreement with hosipital. We want to know what their treatment plan is but they don't have one and say we need to talk to the oncologist who is on vacation until Aug 3rd.  He had a procedure done last night and it was successful. They took another MRI and noticed more cancer cells. They said we need to start thinking of a plan and need to talk to an oncologist who is here till the 3rd of course.....   We want to leave and we are ready to sign the ama but there's this  thing that's been bugging me. The nurse said we need to sign it so we know the hosipital is liable.   I'm think why would she say that??? Was there something for concerning in the second MRI?? Why won't they just transfer to Penn???  ---  If us signing this form means my dad can get to Penn that so be it and great, but I want to make sure the currently place we are at didn't put us in a worse situation. He's been there since Thursday and we've requested for transfers since Friday. Their stent doctor came Monday and preformed the procedure we were there for originally. Now we are looking for an out to start cancer treatment.	No
1807	"Hi,  I recently moved in with 2 other people into a 3 bedroom town home in Virginia. The 3 of us signed the lease paying $516 a month each. They agreed I could have the master bedroom so I would sign on with them since I was more interested in living on my own which they said they were fine with.   Fast forward about 2 months later, a week before move in they bring up that they think whoever has the master room should pay more. This is annoying because we had never talked about it before but I was somewhat amenable because the room was better. I offered to pay $560 a month which I thought was fair but no one answered the group message.   3 days before move in one of them messages me saying they were willing to pay $600 for the master room and if I wasn't willing to pay that price they would take it. This is infuriating but I say we should just move in and discuss it later because I was worried one of them would move into the room before I could get there.  Now a few weeks have passed and it's time to pay rent. They message me to ""confirm that [I] am good with paying $600... or discussing a room swap"". I never agreed to paying this much and I certainly don't want to swap rooms. The only reason they were able to convince me to live with them was because they agreed I could have this room without ever suggesting I would have to pay more than the amount we all signed on for until mere days before move-in.  I have a ton of student loans to pay back and really don't want to be paying almost $100 more than I signed on for. I think it's incredibly rude and unacceptable for them to promise me the room and then essentially auction it off among us because suddenly they think the room is worth more and arbitrarily chose a new number for me to pay. My worry is that I don't really have much leverage or a way to stop them from moving all my stuff into another room while I'm at work if I don't agree to pay the price they decided. These are people who have been my friends for about a year, but have know each other longer and I feel like they are ganging up on me. I don't know what to do and I'm hoping you guys can help.  Thanks!"	No
1808	"Hi folks,  I live in a 3-person apartment in California. All three of us are on the lease. I suspect one roommate might be encouraging the landlord to evict the other two of us. I don't believe our small city has any specific rental laws re; eviction, so we're just bound by state law. The roommate's complaints:  * My other roommate occasionally plays music too loud in his room, though not late a night. * We mop, but don't mop frequently enough. * We scrub the counters and sinks, but not frequently enough. * We, infrequently, leave a pan or two in the sink overnight (once every two weeks or so). * Sometimes, small messes (e.g. a bit of flour powder from cooking) are left scattered too long on the sink top. This usually gets cleaned up quickly (e.g. soon after cooking) but every month or so, we might * The smell of the foods we cook bother him, though we run the fan and open the window. * I once restarted a what I thought was a malfunctioning router while he was gaming (I didn't know he was home). * I make too much noise walking in the apartment (creaky floorboards and I usually stay up until 1:30, though I try my best to slink and wear slippers). * We don't shut the lights off every time we leave the room. We do when we intend to permanently leave, but not always if we're going to other rooms to retrieve something or take a call.  Otherwise, we pay our rent, treat the apartment well (the landlord frequently comments how amazing it looks), keep things always sanitary, and don't engage in illegal activities. Does my roommate have a case that the other roommate and I are a ""nuisance"" and thus could be evicted for cause?  **Context for what set my roommate off**  My upset roommate frequently sends out long and vaguely threatening rants to me and my other roommate (""There's scum on the sink behind the faucet. Here's a picture. Clean this up. I will not ask you again"" ""You left your cutting board on the counter and I wanted to use the counter. Move it immediately"" ""You left the dishwasher door open too much. I had to close it.""). I have many emails and text messages containing these rants.   While I was away on vacation, he sent me some pictures of a extremely minor mess (flour spill + oil spatter; 10 sec clean up time), which I didn't make, and told me to clean it up. I finally lost my temper and to him to knock it off and not bother me on vacation and that the kitchen was perfectly usable in the state it was in. He ranted over text message for a while and then told me that I'm welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. I told him he's welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. He told me that he was the original tenant in the apartment and kindly allowed me to move in and live with him and therefore am morally bound to follow his rules.  ** My commentary**  I agree that, given the standards of cleanliness my roommate demands, the other roommate and I are a nuisance ***for him***. However, I argue that his standards of cleanliness are unreasonable and that my other roommate and I are already meeting him much more than half way. Frankly, I think he has serious control issues and possibly has some form of mental disorder (e.g. no eye contact, shuffling walk, no furniture in his room, never laughs or smiles, never accepts invitations to socialize, etc...).  He does have a point that my other roommate and I are messier than him. However, that's because he doesn't actually use the apartment. He comes out of his cave in once in a blue moon and has a fit when he sees that everything isn't spotless at the moment (i.e. he doesn't consider how long a mess has been there). He doesn't cook or use the kitchen or use the living area. His complaints seem to be primarily about minor aesthetic issues that eventually do get cleaned up regardless or things that he could solve on his own without any difficulty (e.g. he can spend 3 seconds moving a cutting board someone forgot, in a rare instance, to put away if he wants to use the counter). We all have our own bathrooms, so thankfully that's not an issue.  We also know that he allowed the apartment to be illegally sublet at a profit prior to our move-in, but we don't have any evidence beyond the word of the guy who sublet the apartment (and maybe he has some paper-work, but he probably doesn't want to get involved).  We also know that he had previous conflicts with one or two of the previous tenants.  I asked him to compromise and understand that living with roommates always comes with minor annoyances but he told me something like, ""It's unfair that you would expect me to do extra work for anything I didn't cause."" In the context of this conversation, it was regarding the fact I forgot to close the dishwasher door after unloading and he had to close it as he walked by.  ** My question **  * Does he have any legal basis to get my other roommate and I evicted? * Now that he's officially complained to my landlord, what options do my other roommate and I have to present our case and make sure the landlord doesn't see us as bad guys? Both of us intend to move out when the lease terminates, regardless, but I'd prefer to not have to deal with any ensuing landlord issues."	No
1809	"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, and it's very long, but I'll give it a shot. Disclaimer: I already know I made poor choices and deserved what I got. Just asking for advice.  I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know). This is a suburb of New York City and the cab was private. Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point.  We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open. I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?  Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.  Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did? I was terrified out of my mind..you can't just drive off with someone against their will. Or can you?"	No
1810	Located in San Francisco, CA  I am one of three tenants on a lease that ran for 12 months and then converted to month-to-month back in July.  One roommate has moved out and gave the landlord and us 30 days written notice.  We've been advertising the room everywhere but haven't found a replacement yet. I'm panicking about paying rent on February 1st. My remaining roommate says departing roommate is liable until someone else moves in. Departing roommate says he gave 30 days notice and that's all that was necessary.  All three of our names are on the lease agreement. Can one roommate give 30 days notice and release himself from his portion of the liability, even though all three names are on the lease? I've reached out to the landlord but would like to hear from this group as well.	No
1811	"Moving out of a house and our landlords are basically taking all of our deposits to clean a dirty fridge, dirty bathrooms, a bit of trash left in the back, and literally 3 holes in the wall. Apparently those ""damages"" amount to $1250. Anything I can do to try and stop this? I dont want to go to small claims court for my portion of it but if there is something else I could do that would be amazing! Thanks in advance!"	No
1812	"Hello.   My grandmother recently passed and left her estate to be divided among her grandchildren, including me.   My aunt, who was my grandmother's caretaker,  has sent all of the grandchildren a letter from her lawyer titled ""WAIVER OF NOTICE OF HEARING ON PETITION FOR LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION AND CONSENT TO THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER OF SOLVENCY, WAIVER OF BOND""  The letter is about a page long, and basically states that upon an order of solvency by the court, my aunt will be the administrator of the estate and will be entitled to distribute or close said estate without court intervention or supervision.  She can sell, exchange, lease, mortgage, convey, etc the property of the decedent without court order, and without notice, approval, or confirmation.  The undersigned also waives the requirement for the issuance of a bond.     Is this basically asking me to give up my portion of the estate?  I'm having trouble understanding just exactly what she is asking me to sign, and when I've questioned her about it, she has been defensive and is pushing hard for me and the other grandchildren to sign it.     I could really use your advice, thank you for any light you can shed on this situation."	No
1813	I live in Iowa.   Relevant information:  In March of 2016 I move into a house for rent and put 950$ down for a deposit, 200$ nonrefundable pet deposit and I sign a paper to say he can automatically withdrawal 950$ on the 1st of the month.  There was no washer and drier in the place when I moved in, so I knew I would have to provide my own. When I signed the documents, I was also finalizing a divorce.  I signed all the documents (first name) (married name)-(maiden name).  I told him once the divorce was finalized I was to go by my maiden name.    January of 2017 I tell my landlord I'm looking for a house to buy and I've had no issues with him or the place, and would keep him up to date on my hunt.   I get a house, approved and signed in like 2 weeks. It happened way faster than expected.  But I couldn't pass this deal up.  I love my house.  But, there's a crossover month of rent and mortgage payment.    I asked Landlord if he would consider letting me out of the lease early and he wholeheartedly agreed over the phone.  He stopped the recurring 950$ payment and I was not charged for my final month. I moved out February 27th when we had our final walk through.   He didn't find much to fix up, basic paint and small scratches from my dogs.  Nothing major.  He said he would take off the carpet cleaning from the deposit and any other cleaning things.  Totally reasonable.   We also had an agreement that I would leave my washer and drier there and he would buy them from me for 100$ total.  I just didn't want to deal with them.  They were working when I left in February.   All is good in the hood as of Feb 27th. We shake hands and walk away.    In April (I have the texts)- I ask him when I would receive my security deposit check. He tells me over text that it was returned via post office and he was out of the country.  Once he gets back on May 6th, he would reach out.   He never did.   I call again on May 15th.  He picks up and we have a phone conversation in which he apologizes and says he'll talk to his wife (the bookkeeper) and he will get back to me asap.   On June 1st I text again asking what's going on.  No reply.   On June 5th I call and no reply.   3 voicemails, 6 texts and I'm fed up.  I call my uncle who is a lawyer in Pennsylvania and ask him to send a letter. Im very aware he can't do shit in my state, but maybe it'll get the ball rolling.    Out of no where I get a certified letter that's dated July 3rd, I just get notice of on July 29th. I go pick it up on July 31st and it's a letter from my landlord letting me know he is not going to give me the 100$ for the washer and drier because in April the new tenants tried using it and they were broken.  The receipt for the service provider was dated 4/4/2017, a full month after I had left the premises.   I just received my second certified letter, this morning, dated August 3rd stating that in order to get my security deposit check I need to:  -meet him in a public place -sign a document that the original envelope is unopened (dated 4/6/2017) that was returned to him  -I will sign a cease and desist document - I will acknowledge that I received the certified letter dated July 3rd about the washer and drier.    More relevant information:  -the original check envelope is addressed to (first name) (married name). This hasn't been my name for about a year at this point. This is why it wasn't forwarded to me in the first place, but I texted and left my forwarding address to him  -the way I understand the Iowa law, he has to send me information regarding the check (and receipts) within 30 days.  According to the original check date, he was past that date.  (I moved out February 27th, the certified letter was April 6th)   Should I just take him to court for the 1050$ or go meet him in person and drop it?  What should I do?  It's 85$ to file which I think I can tack it on... should I also include interest?  He never attempted to resend the letter even after telling me over the phone he would... 3 months ago.   It's kinda bullshit that I left my washer and drier there (and they were working) and he gets to decide after a month of having them that they don't work so he doesn't pay me?   That doesn't make sense or sound legal at all.	No
1814	We purchased a large farm a few months ago.  On this farm is a spring that feeds my house as well as two other homes.  The spring is fully on my property.    I made a mistake and let the spring run dry while I let the hose run overnight watering my garden.  The undereducated neighbors were upset (I don't blame them).  I take blame for running it dry,  and the spring was full again in twelve hours.  However, they are threatening to sue (?) to make sure this doesn't happen again.  I looked up the the courthouse deeds for any easements or other agreements on all three properties, and there is nothing in place.  My question is, in Pennsylvania, what legal rights do they have to this water?  I don't intend to shut off their supplies, but want to know where I stand legally.    Any advice would be very much appreciated!	No
1815	"Hello, throwaway account here...originally posted in thr wrong sub...  Seeking some advice on my current situation. A little background...  Currently living in a small, older apartment with less than 10 apartments in the building. Have lived with my wife, toddler, and infant for the past year without any issue. Rent is affordable and the location is ideal. The most attractive part is that the landlord doesn't rent to college kids, which was important with my family.  Once our lease ended this summer, we decided to renew for this upcoming year. We verbally agreed to the lease through text message this past June, which would start August 1st. We have NOT received a lease to sign as of today.  Unbeknownst to us, our landlord had trouble filling out the apartment directly above ours and we had college kids move into it recently. We received no warning to this and only found out in passing from a neighbor.  It has been a nightmare since they have moved in. With it being an older building, sounds travels through the floors/walls. The first few nights consisted of moving furniture at 10:30 pm at night, people coming in and out of the building at all times, and vaccuming past midnight. I understand thry are college kids. Hell, I wouldn't have wanted to live next to me when I was a college kid if I had a family. I thought a few knocks on the ceiling to the apartment above us when they got loud would solve our issues.  I was wrong. Things gradually increased. The kids have only gotten louder. My wife and I have respected the fact that they are college kids and make sure our kids stay quiet before 9 am. We don't feel that we are being unreasonable with asking for them to quiet down after 10 am. Last week, I bought up my concerns with the landlord and asked him to speak with the kids. We asked for them to respect the fact for them to quiet down at 10 pm and maybe save the vaccuming for the afternoons. He defended them by suggesting they didn't think vaccuming at midnight was a problem. He always promised to speak to them. It has yet to happen.  The last two nights have been the final straw. The parents are in town visiting and brought some furniture over. I was looking forward to potentially getting a good nights sleep. Once again, they decide to bring in the furniture at 11 pm at night and move it around. Once my infant is woke up from the noise, I send a text to my landlord regarding it. I receive a reply in the morning with a ""promise to speak to them."" Last night, they once again have people in and out of the apartment. The infant and toddler are both woke up from yelling from upstairs. I decide to handle it myself and head upstairs. I find a parent standing in the open doorway of their apartment. I ask her if she ""could please keep it down since my kid was woken up?"" I receive a nice glare and an ""ok."" It continues far past 1 am.  I have reached my breaking point and have lined up a rental at a small, more expensive location where I do NOT have to worry about the noise. Again, I understand that they are college kids. I don't have an issue with that. Our schedules just don't match up and it is starting to affect my family.  Since I have not signed a lease (I did pay rent for August), but agreed to one through text, am I able to move out without consequence? Has anyone had a similar situation? How did you handle it? I am looking to make a break as cleanly as possible. I don't anticipate a way of making things work with the current location.  I apologize for the long post and venting. Any suggestions are appreciated!"	No
1816	"Hello, everyone.  I submitted 60-day notice to break my lease with my current apartment complex because of noise complaints against a tenant. In addition, there are renovations being completed that have been handled poorly so I wanted to get an idea of what steps I should do next or what I could expect.  1) **Noise:** According to my lease, a tenant must:   ""Respect the privacy of your neighbors with regard to televisions, radios, and stereos.  Gatherings must not become loud, boisterous, rude or generally disturbing to other residents.  Residents playing loud music in their units, the common area or cars will be in violation of their lease and may be issued a citation for disturbing the peace.""  The city noise ordinance says:   ""As to multifamily structures including apartments, condominiums, or other residential arrangements where boundary lines cannot readily be determined, operate or allow the operation of any sound amplification equipment so as to create sounds registering 55 db(A) between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday or between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Friday or Saturday or 50 db(A) at any other time, as measured from any point within the interior of another residential unit in the same complex or within the boundary line of the nearest residentially occupied property.""  I have spoken to him in person, called the office over 10 times, emailed the office, called the courtesy officer twice, and called 911 once. Despite these notices, he continues to play music through a subwoofer on his television after 11 pm, often throughout an entire night.   Since talking/calling/emailing/911 did not stop the music issue, I decided to submit my notice because the behavior continued. I have lived here 4.5 years and this has been a constant the entire time. The apartment has changed management twice so I'm afraid they will ignore everything.   2) **Construction:** My biggest concern is the safety of the walkway and the lights. On July 6, the walkway looked like this:  http://imgur.com/71Jq3ZF  My boyfriend had to crawl over the boards to get to school that morning.  I feel like a small amount of debris is absolutely understandable, but this is not easy to walk over and it has nails sticking out.  The exterior lights have been out since July 5, and the manager's email says construction replaced the lights when they have not as of last night. The below image is the view from the sidewalk and the place where the light should be installed.  http://imgur.com/QpTPDTS  http://imgur.com/dziOj0P   **Reply:**  When I emailed corporate (after emailing and speaking to someone in the office) to bring the noise complaints and the walkway/lights to their attention, I got an email saying they would not release me from my lease.   ""I understand you have had some issues with noise from your neighbors that our on site staff has addressed with your neighbors.  We have also shared with you that we have a courtesy officer that could assist in these matters after business hours.  While I cannot address issues that occurred prior to the management change to [company name], you mentioned that you have emails that you could provide regarding your complaints to the office.  I would be happy to review them for you.    As for the construction, we have sent out numerous notices to the residents informing them of the days their buildings would be under renovation.  Understand that in the middle of this renovation some debris will fall but is being picked up on a daily basis.  We were unaware of the lights in your building but once we were made aware of this, we had construction put them back immediately.    Without further documentation that our on site staff with [company name] has not followed policies and procedures, I cannot agree to release you from your lease at this time.  If you would like to provide the documentation you alluded to in your email, again I would be happy to review them on your behalf.""    I'm not worried about this part, but if you read his reply regarding the fact they provided notice about the construction, the notices that were sent out regarding the dates the construction crew needed access to my apartment were incorrect.  The first notice stated the construction crew would need access to my specific building's apartments on June 29. The construction did not actually start until July 5.  The second email stated construction would replace windows for my specific building on July 18. The access to the apartment was not made until July 24.    I have not emailed him back yet, but I have compiled a list of my previous emails and dates I called the office, called police records to confirm I called 911, taken pictures at night of the unlit building and took pictures of the uninstalled lights.  I can pay a buyout fee of $1416, but I would like to avoid this because I feel like I shouldn't be penalized for all the times I've contacted management and nothing is being done regarding the noise complaints. I'm also uneasy because he was willing to say the lights were put back by construction when they were not.  At this point, I would pay the buyout fee just to leave here and avoid the hassle, but is there anything I can do to get them to let me break the lease? Any tips on what I should email back? I have a draft prepared with the pictures and previous emails."	No
1817	"I bought my first house about a year ago in a small ohio town. On the property disclosure form the seller filled out they stated ""the property gets some standing water towards the rear of the yard"". After some decent rains this past year iv realized the flooding situation is worse than i first thought. The back 40 yards of my property has about a foot of standing water after a good rain and most times ir takes a couple days to drain. Is there anything i can do legally to keep the water back? Could i go after the sellers for the cost to fix it? Seems like a grey area since you cant really define ""some""."	No
1818	"ay 28th Vial Email""I will be living in another location for the month of July as well as the end of June. I will begin moving my things out the week of June 19th-25th. I will still be renting here @ XXX XXXXXX as I have set up to balance my portion of the lease agreements."" The email describes what I intend to do in order to pay my remaining amount for the apartment. I moved out the 19th of June and picked up my things (living room, bedroom and bathroom) and left on the 24th of June. I had left a check for the internet bill for the month of july, I even went as far as having no internet until july 7th due to my roommate having paid his portion of the bill cycle. I informed him I would be cutting the internet as it was in my name. June 21st: ""I'm coming over on Friday with family to move my things out. I have to transfer the internet service. Spectrum will not let me have two accounts nor will they let me transfer an account to another name. I'll transfer service on the July 7th as it is the end of the bill cycle and it has been paid for. You will have to start service under your name. I'll pay you half of the internet bill to you for July instead to balance out the last month of internet. I'll leave the check on the counter on Friday. "" My roommate never responded to any of my emails. I even asked him if he had any questions to ask me. Jump forward this week. I asked him if he was moving out so I could cut energy service since our lease ends the end of July. I forgot to send him the energy bill for June as it is in my name. He agreed to pay that one and the current bill. I asked him that I would come pick up my mail and I'll come pick up the checks. I also asked him what is going to happen with our deposit. This was his response: ""You have no mail. The only mail for you in the box has been junk mail, coupons and stuff, and I chucked that out since you never said you were coming back to pick up mail and didn't give me a forwarding address. As far as I'm aware you're going to have to ask them back for your half of the deposit as they're not cashing it back to me just so I can repay half of it. "" The then followed up with: ""Also, I never cashed your last month rent check, nor the internet one, so just mail me a check for $401.60 and you'll save yourself the trip."" The measures I took to pay internet and rent in advanced he decided not to cash. I was in charge of utilities, he was in charge of rent. He would pay rent in full and I would the supplement the rent payment with a check in his name. This wan never an issue. I checked my bank account and I don't see my checks were cashed. He states he didnt cash my checks even though I gave him the means to supplement the rent payment. The checks have not been cancelled and I dont feel I should have to write another one. If he wants the money he can cash the checks. What are my legal obligations in this situation?"	No
1819	Hello, I'm posting this for a friend who's too old to probably post here and handle the situation.  He's been at the apartment for 6 months, it's actually an extremely small room that violates a few codes I'm sure but he's paying low rent so has been dealing with it.  The landlord snapped last week (we think he might be crazy) and started making outrageous demands including an immediate $500 security deposit and bump in rent to $700 or more (it keeps changing).  Obviously my friend doesn't know what to make of this and can't really afford paying $1200 in one go and given the place, it's probably not worth it.  He and I have tried looking for a new place to live but it's hard finding something for $500 (unless some people have ideas?) and under such short notice as well.  My question is, doesn't the landlord need to provide at least 30 days written notice even despite there not being a lease?  Ideally he could stay there for at least another month or longer so he can at least make other arrangements.    The landlord reminded him today that he needs to be out this Sunday (and also made physical threats apparently - but I wasn't there to witness it).  Thanks so much for your help!	No
1820	My paycheck was witheld this last pay period because my supervisor failed to approve my hours before she left on vacation.  I submitted my hours in a timely manner and the number of hours worked were consistent with my normal ammount.  Because of this I will not be able to pay off my entire credit card balance and will have to pay interest on my balance - in addition to the inconvenience of not having the money.  My employer told me that they cannot pay me until the next pay period.  Do you think I have any legal recourse in this situation - specifically two get my pay sooner than in another two weeks or having my employer pay all or a portion of my interest charge on my credit card?    I am in Utah.	No
1821	Hello. A truck hit my car a few months ago and drove off. The car was parked and in the am we found the damage. We were able to find the company by pulling tapes from surrounding buildings, but the time I lost just tracking them down (I am a freelancer) took me over three days. I asked them to compensate me for the time, but they refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Small claims court? I am  in New York City if that helps. Any advice you can offer would be amazing. Thanks Terrie.	No
1822	I'm currently drafting a non-fiction book about economics and the software development industry.  I want to compare charging an unreasonable amount or demanding excessive payment to the fictional character Rumpelstiltskin from the titular fairy tale.   As far as I'm aware, no one owns fairy tales and I'm allowed to do this - am I right?	No
1823	Hi r/legaladvice,  I was helping my grandparents organize their finances and 1 item that stuck out was that my grandmother has a credit card exclusively in her name with a balance of about $5K. She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.  I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).  Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail? I haven't had an issue like this before and want to do things the right way here.  Thanks!	No
1824	On 7/7 my landlord texted me saying she was selling the house we live in. I was a little shocked but ok it's her house and we just rent it. Her text stated we have 30 days to move out. I responded by politely stating that since we are currently month to month ( we had a one year lease but stated on as periodic tenants) and have been living there over a year we were required to receive 60 days notice. I also asked for us to be served properly as I believe an unclear text message was not proper notice.   Landlord sent a certified letter dated 7/7 stating our move out date is 9/1. By my count the date should be 9/6. Landlord scheduled a walk through with her realtor a few days later which was fine. At the time she said she would forgo giving us our deposit back in exchange for us not paying rent for August. She said the house was in great condition (true). The Realtor wanted to put a lock box on the door which I objected to. We have dogs and I don't want people in and out of our home when we aren't there. She agreed and I asked for 24 hours notice of showings so one of us can be home.   Then the realtor sent a super aggressive photographer to take pictures of the property. Fine it was super invasive but it's done. Now the realtor is texting me wanting showings with two hours notice. I said no and gave her a list of other times that would work when someone would be home.   My question is:   Should I address the 60 thing or just cut my losses and move on 9/1? I want my landlord to give us a good recommendation. We are actively looking for new places but haven't found one.   What can I do about the realtor scheduling  showings? What are my rights?   Thank you	No
1825	I have a friend who has been having issues with a roommate and it came to a head last night. She tried to call the cops on them and get them kicked out, which didn't happen because she didn't follow the eviction process whatsoever, and so they have plenty of time to stay there. However, she decided to leave herself, and took the router/modem for the internet when she did. My friend paid half of the internet bill, although she has no real physical proof of that, but does have a verbal agreement for paying half of the utilities, and also her occupation REQUIRES that she has the internet, so she is unable to make money without it. Is this legal, is the roommate who technically has her name on the bill allowed to do this? Can my friend really do anything besides try to sue her? She doesn't really have the money for that kind of thing.	No
1826	I'm taking a leave from my university, after signing an agreement to pay for the entire school year's housing. That said, students not currently attending classes are not allowed to live in university housing. Is it legal for the university to require me to pay for housing I'm unable to live in?	No
1827	My friends car was stolen out of my driveway last week and the cops found it 2 days ago and towed it to a local impoundment. My friend is in Europe for the next 2 weeks (from US) and will obviously not be able to pick up. The impoundment is charging $30 per day which will add up to about $400 plus the cost of towing. Is there any way that he can give me permission to get his car out? The impoundment is claiming there is no way anyone can retrieve it besides my friend.	No
1828	As the title states, my bathroom has been unusable (as far as I'm concerned) for a little over a month.  The issue started when I was contacted at work by my landlady who said the apt above mine was leaking water into my bathroom, and they needed my permission to enter. I said yes. I soon received another call saying that there was mold and that the ceiling would have to be repainted. Again, I gave my assent.  When I returned home that evening the ceiling above my shower was [missing](http://imgur.com/gallery/JRI29Ac) and the mechanical fan providing ventilation had been removed. It has been this way since ~6/20/17  I haven't been able to determine what type of insulation is being used even after asking, plus dirt and debris falls from the ceiling and woodwork above (making it hard to get clean). Today I finally managed to get the property managers on the phone all together (no one had any authority to do anything individually) and request that the repairs be expedited and that I be compensated for the month plus that I was essentially living in a 2b/1br while paying for a 2b/2b.  The property managers are basically saying to shove it and I'm just after free money. They say the shower may be ugly but it still works. I told them that I don't feel comfortable showering and steaming up the room full of unidentified insulation. I also mentioned that per CA Residential Code R303.3.1 the room is required to have a mechanical fan for ventilation. I also researched online and found that insulation covered in paper that is left exposed is a fire hazard.  They say that they'll rush the rest of the repairs but unless I'm eating the insulation I should have no problem and I haven't lost any services so I'm not entitled to anything. I forgot to ask why they never said I should/could be using the shower the entire time I've been calling them to complain about it not being in working order.  I don't think I ever told them they could take out my ceiling to begin with, and certainly I think the month+ of repairs is ridiculous. Am I in fact owed compensation? Is the shower unusable? Or am I just whiny?  tl;dr - Management left me with exposed insulation and no ventilation for my shower for a month and counting, but say I have not lost any services and am not entitled to compensation since the shower still has hot and cold water.

1829	"Long story short I got a vandalism charge, and went back the next day to pay the owner for the damage.  It was exactly 250 and the arresting officer ""added"" additional damages to get a felony arrest so it was originally vandalism over 500.  I didn't realize until I got my background check that it is incorrect and has been on my record this entire time.  So that makes me think the amount that I paid my probation was incorrect as well.  What steps can I take to getting this fixed and correcting it to a ""misdemeanor"" which is what it should have been in the first place."	No
1830	Hello everyone, I have encountered a situation that I hope someone could guide me though.   I recently found some land to purchase in South Carolina. I put down a deposit, then paid for the survey, forty year title search, and various lawyer fees. When my wife and I went to sign for the sale on Monday morning, we learned the seller had died that morning. The seller's daughter was power of attorney, but as I learned that day, POA ends after the appointee dies.   I know the family is going trough a difficult time, and I know when I lose my mother I won't be interested in hearing from anyone outside the family.   I am still very interested in the land. I want the land but I'm afraid that somehow the contract is void and the new owner or court will sell it for a higher price to someone else, or use it to settle a debt.  Any thoughts? Can anyone point me in the right direction for how to begin researching this kind of thing?  Thanks a lot, SS	No
1831	Hi. I'm unsure what to do here. I'll try and make this brief (at work, sorry!).   My mother's boyfriend kicked my mother out of the home they've shared on Wednesday. My mother has many mental health issues (MDD and bipolar disorder). She will not be able to emotionally handle any interaction with him. So I've taken over.  I've moved her into my home and plan on getting the rest of her stuff on Saturday. This includes a washer and dryer. The issue is that the ex is claiming he is keeping it. My mother purchased this with her own money and has receipts. When I told him no, he said we will now need to give him $1,500 to repair his car that he let my mother occasionally drive. I said no.   I wouldn't put it past him to damage the washer and dryer or sue for the cost of the car he thinks she damaged. She did not. What do I do here? I'm very overwhelmed and just trying to get my mom somewhere safe.	No
1832	"I have already decided to lawyer up.  The purpose of this post is to tap your collective knowledge so I may better manage my expectations and vent my frustrations while I choose an attorney and proceed.   And now the backstory.  You may want some popcorn to enjoy as this long and messy trainwreck unfolds.    I rent space from a now former friend.  He owns the house and has rented me the master bedroom with attached bathroom and a parking space in the garage.  This was all arranged verbally.  The only written acknowledgement that a lease exists is in the form of the 20 day notice I received a few weeks ago.  My last day is here is Monday, July 31st.   The initial lease violation occurred 13 or 14 months ago, late June or early July of 2016.  I came home to find his girlfriend (who lives here and has been acting on his behalf) offloading appliances from a dolly into my garage space.  She informed me that her parents needed a place to store them temporarily and would be arriving with a truck in a week or two to collect them.  While I was annoyed that I wasn't asked first, we were still friends at that point, so I didn't raise any objections.  As you might have guessed, those appliances occupied my garage space for much longer than a week or two.    When the washer and dryer had been sitting there for around 3 weeks or so, I asked her what is up with her parents.  When were they coming to collect their things?  She said their truck broke down and they'll come get their appliances when it's fixed.  Two months went by and I asked again.  Sure enough, the truck was still in need of repair.  I offered to help them out by splitting a truck rental so they could get their washer and dryer home.  The offer went ignored.  After another month by, I asked again and this is when she started getting pissed that I was even asking.  I calmly reminded her that I offered to help and would be happy to do so.  When this offer was ignored again, I took it up with my friend who said he would talk with his girlfriend's parents and see what arrangements could be made for collection.  I never got a response, though.   Now this is where things get truly messy.  And I mean that literally.  When I first moved in, there was no garbage service here.  The landlord had a hard time keeping up with the bills and his service was terminated.  Since storing garbage in the garage is gross and I got tired of making weekly trips to the dump, I volunteer to establish service again.  A year later, I would lose my job and find myself behind both on this bill and a few months of rent.   I did my best to stay on top of the garbage problem, but when the company truck I borrowed from my new (and very shitty) job broke down, I lost the means to dispose of the bags of trash.  And they kept piling up.  Guess who's space they used to store them?   By the time February 2017 came around, I had been denied full use of garage space for around 7 months.  But here is where it gets even better.  I put my foot down and say, ""Enough is enough, I want to use my work bench again.""  They promise to take care of it, but that never happened.  Later on in the month, I came home to find the parents and her brother sleeping in the living.  I didn't think much of it and figured they came for dinner and were just staying the night.  I decided to speak with the parents personally, but before that could happen, I went into the garage to find my space full of their belongings.  They had to move on short notice after a dispute with their previous landlord (the dad's brother) and they were told they could stay here for a few weeks.    Weeks became months and in that time the new residents have got very comfortable.  They watch Netflix all day long which racked up some VERY large overage charges to my internet bill.  I'm charged for every gigabyte over 1024 and this limit was being hit before we were even two weeks into the month.  In all, I've paid out more than $1000 in overages.  Since I require an internet connection to work, I just have to eat it.  They paid me $200 to help with the bills, but I don't press the issue since I know they need as much money as they can hold on to for a new place.    By the time April comes around, I'm sick of living in this crowded house.  Because there is no vent fan in the bathroom, I have to open the window if I don't want my bedroom to smell like ass.  The window opens up into the back yard where the old man is always lounging.  I can't even take a shit by myself anymore.  On top of all this, their cat, which has been staying the garage, has covered my belongings in urine, feces and hair.  While cleaning this mess up, I discovered that in their haste, they had knocked over my box of cleaning chemicals and the bottles had broke.  Paint and harsh chemicals damaged or destroyed quite a few items: one of my tents, both suits of armor I made, other leather projects I made, my prized Defcon t-shirt and some other odds and ends.   I confronted everyone involved about this and let them I'm livid.  They did witness the tantrum I had at this discovery, but when I spoke to them directly, I was calm, firm and communicated my anger like a grow up.  Nothing was done, however, and since then, they feel even more entitled to my space.    I take my former friend aside to let him know that I'm interviewing for jobs in Redmond and Tacoma and places in between, and that I plan on moving to wherever I land a new job.  Later, I would learn that he would offer the parents my room, but only after tensions were rising.  I was never notified or otherwise informed or consulted about any of these decisions the landlord is making.  I just had to figure it out.    So here were are now at present day.  The dad has taken to antagonizing me daily, making sure he disrupts my sleep.  They all feel entitled to use my garage space and just being shitty to me in general.  They've even taken to packing my things for me.  I've also been given 20 days notice of lease termination and was handed a printout showing rents collected.  There's a mistake here but the landlord refuses to speak with me.  He just hides in his basement room and has told me via text message he won't talk to me when I tried to set up a time and place to talk some things out.  Right now, I'm worried he's going to screw me big time when my apartment applications call to confirm residency.   Here's your **TL;DR**:  Landlord can't/won't get garbage service and has been using my garage space to store trash and his girlfriend's parents' belongings, denying me use of the space and damaging my belongings.  The appliances have been there since July 2016 and the rest of the parents' things have been there since February 2017.  The parents were told they could stay here and have since been told they could move in, creating a disruptive nuisance of themselves in the process and have wracked up more than $1000 in bills in my name.   My goal in hiring an attorney is have my debt forgiven (a few months of rent is owed from the period I was unemployed last year) and enough money to pay the attorney.  I might be able to get greater compensation, but I do not wish to put my former friend out of a home as this will likely damage my relationships with our mutual friends.  But I don't know yet if this is a reasonable expectation.    Users of /r/legaladvice, what sort of outcomes could I reasonably expect or persue?"	No
1833	This is in Florida.  I just moved into an apartment. It is the same apartment complex I was already living in, but another building. My old apartment had no issues with bugs. The current apartment has a cockroach problem. I've seen 5 already on my first day and 3 on my second day. I noticed there is a giant tree right near the property and cockroaches on the stairs. I asked to install a weather strip under the door because there wasn't one. I thought that would take care of the problem but it hasn't. A neighbor told me the person below me is a hoarder and that may be an issue, but the management told me they can't come in from another apartment.   Anyway, my point is, what are my legal rights here and how much time do I have to exercise them and how do I exercise them? I am going to write them an email stating the problem and requesting pest control come to spray and management come to inspect, seal off wherever they're coming from. If that fails, am I within my legal rights to end the lease?   Thanks!	No
1834	As the title states, I am renting out a room in San Francisco and I had stored some of my belongings inside of the garage as did most of the other tenants. One morning I go to work and to my surprise when I get back, all of my belongings that I stored in the garage were gone. Apparently the home owner sent out an email claiming that we needed to vacate the garage or else anything would be thrown away. I never got that email. I had a little over $1,000 worth of stuff in there and I am livid over the fact that they would throw my stuff away without properly notifying me. There were no notices in the house, no texts, no phone calls, just an email that I never received. What can I do to help recover my lost belongings???	No
1835	"Could somebody point me to the statute(s) that cite the right to own private property and can't be refused due to the sole purpose of taxation. I heard this was a thing and would like to re-classify my property because I'm sick of ""renting"" my own Property from the government via property tax. Thank You!"	No
1836	I live in California.  I lived with 4 other guys and my girlfriend lived in my room. Only me and the 4 guys were in a contract with the landlord, not my girlfriend.  We agreed on the set price for each person at the beginning of the year (my girlfriend didn't pay and the other tenants didn't ask her to).   The day before the final month, one guy said he wasn't going to be paying rent and was moving out. He said my girlfriend should pay his rent since she has been living in my room for free. He ends up slowly moving stuff out and staying at the house about half the time anyways. He didn't pick up his final belongings until the last day when everyone moved out.   My girlfriend ended up fronting $200 and I $100.  I had been the person collecting the money from the roommates and paying the landlord each month. That means I also got the security deposit back from the landlord minus cleaning fees.   Am I legally able to keep his portion of the security deposit since he didn't pay me his last month of rent?  He is filling out a claim and is threatening to sue me if I don't give him his deposit back.	No
1837	I want to make a brand of cat plush toys and coloring books. I was planning on naming it Mushu, but the dragon from the Mulan movie has that name. I searched the trademark website and it said the trademark for that is 'dead.' So would it be okay to use that name for the company and the products?	No
1838	I was evicted from a rental property over a month and a half ago in Texas. The landlord returned part of my security deposit and gave my itemized deductions.   However, now he's claiming that I owe additional damages that weren't caught before he returned the deposit. Am I legally required to pay those if they're legitimate, or am I in the clear since he already returned my deposit?	No
1839	My dad owns a small business in a mall in Southern California, but the landowner/mall owner has given him an eviction notice to leave because they want more profitable businesses. He's looking into other locations, but my father's unsure of how to negotiate. This is his primary source of income. I honestly feel like the landowner is going to charge the rent at a ridiculous price just to force my dad out. We know that the landowner has already done this to three other family businesses in the mall. Each time he says he's sympathetic and will help them relocate to a less popular area in the mall, but he has gone back on his word with all three. We don't really have the financial means to sue.We've also recently paid for new carpeting in the space because a neighboring business leaked water. Please help! :(	No
1840	I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical. When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas. A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call  b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her.  Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request. I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper). *Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty.  *She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.” *Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them. *I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored. *I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.) *I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy. *My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic. *My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call. When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy. Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.	No
1841	"After buying a week+ of groceries on Friday our refrigerator and freezer stopped being cold Sunday afternoon (was probably not working for longer but that is when we noticed). I waited until Monday morning for our landlord's office to open and they can't get anyone even in to look at it until Wednesday morning. Per our lease, they need to fix problems ""promptly"". What is the definition of promptly? Because all $200-300 of food is going to rot. So to me this morning right now is what I need. They refuse to reimburse if I get someone else to fix it. What are their obligations? What is your advice? Thank you.  ""6. Landlord’s Obligations: Unless otherwise agreed upon, the Landlord shall: (a) comply with the applicable building and housing codes to the extent required by such building and housing codes; (b) make all repairs to the Premises as may be necessary to keep the Premises in a fit and habitable condition; provided, however, in accordance with paragraph 11, the Tenant shall be liable to the Landlord for any repairs necessitated by the Tenant’s intentional or negligent misuse of the Premises; (c) keep all common areas, if any, used in conjunction with the Premises in a clean and safe condition; (d) promptly repair all facilities and appliances, if any, as may be furnished by the Landlord as part of the Premises, including electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems, provided that the Landlord, except in emergency situations, actually receives notification from the Tenant in writing of the needed repairs; and (e) within a reasonable period of time based upon the severity of the condition, repair or remedy any imminently dangerous condition on the Premises after acquiring actual knowledge or receiving notice of the condition. Notwithstanding Landlord’s repair or remedy of any imminently dangerous condition, Landlord may recover from Tenant the actual and reasonable costs of repairs that are the fault of Tenant."""	No
1842	So, long story short: my child was admitted to the hospital I work for. Their lab value ranges in their EMR were set to adult values, so my kid was discharged without treatment. I took her to a different hospital when symptoms didn't resolve and her pediatrician (employer) acted as though we were exaggerating the pain.  New doctor points out her lab values were very off. Turns out kid has bone infection and will likely need many future surgeries since the bacteria ate away some of a growth plate.  New doctor's opinion is this would've been avoided if initial lab values were addressed. Also that if my wife and I had listened to the original doctors, my kid would be legless or crippled.  So I'm in a rough position. I don't want to lose my job, but I am facing many days off work, many long trips to specialist, likely future surgeries, and a whopper of medical bills from both hospital stays. Not to mention the suffering of my kid, 5 (so far) days of being hospitalized, one surgery, and future pain from this.  If I would sue, can they terminate me?	No
1843	Is there anything I can do about this? My current lease ends August 27th and I gave the notice by email on July 7th. Seems a little unforgiving to charge me for an entire extra month (September)..	No
1844	I was pulled over yesterday while on my way to work. I had just lit a cigarette and I guess I was swerving a little bit while trying to light it. It was my first cigarette of the day so I had a pretty strong buzz from it. Usually I don't get much of a buzz but that morning I overslept and was late so I hadn't had breakfast and had only woken up about 15 minutes prior. The officer asked why I was swerving and I told him it was because I was looking at my lighter while trying to light it and told him that I guess it had given me a small buzz. At that point I had no buzz but he told me to get out of the car. He made me do all the things that you'd expect if you were driving drunk and I know I had absolutely no problem doing them but he claimed that I was stumbling and having trouble and arrested me anyway.  At this point I just got home and I'm wondering if any of this could possibly stick? I've never heard of being charged for DWI for nicotine. Is this even possible? What do I even do now?	No
1845	"I have over 70hours at work. I work in a restaurant in florida. The owner hasnt paid multiple employees and has also had 2 illegals work for him recently before they got ""married"" to citizens. I am not sure where to go from here. I have a previous paystub and also have the other employees that are frustrated. I quit last night after he refused to pay and he got very confrontational. I called the police and made a little report but they said they cant help me and its a legal matter. Im frustrated and now jobless but thankful i dont have to work for such a low life. How should i approach this matter? I feel like going into the establishment tomorrow and recording conversations between the other employees who havent been paid aswell as me amd getting a lawyer. Good idea?"	No

1847	My parents are buying a house without a mortgage, but are using a home equity loan and loans from 401Ks to get the cash together. They plan on selling their existing home to recover all the costs, but it's in a rough state, and I think it could take them 6 months to get it into a good enough spot to sell and make the money they need to cover all the debt.      They are still a little short and are asking for a loan from me. I'm extremely concerned that they are getting in over their heads and will end up bankrupt.     My thought is to make a condition that they buy the house and then sell it to me immediately so that it's in my name. That way, if they ever get behind, they still have a place to live.      Will this plan work? Will I be liable for any debt they carry? Is there anything that can happen that will cause this to backfire or end up with them homeless?	No
1848	He was pulled aside after a shift and accused of theft. The LP guy said he had video evidence, fingerprints, and if he admitted it he'd let him keep his job. He then took his phone and wouldn't give it back until my friend went to the carrier to have them print out a receipt as proof of ownership. The LP guy then called the carrier store to speak to that employee to confirm that my friend had in fact walked in. After that, he said he was still lying because he must be friends with the employee at the carrier store.   He then said if he gave up whoever stole it he'd be rewarded with a check. Said his boss was on vacation so he'd like to wrap this case up before he arrived. He also banned my friend from using his phone and that if he was ever caught he'd personally escort him out and have his job.   Apparently to even take your phone in the trucks it has to be registered and a sticker is placed on the back. My friends sticker faded so it didn't have the info the LP guy wanted. However, when they checked the records of the registered phones her serial number, the IMEI, and all the information added up. The LP agent then accused my friend of making a counterfeit sticker to put on it so he could steal phones.   What can he do? If you guys have any more questions I'd be happy to provide more information. This is the gist of what has happened.	No
1849	Under our side of our duplex there's a little door that leads to the piping, heaters/boilers, machinery of both units. Under our unit, while inspecting it with the maintinence guy, my boyfriend found a large amount of black mold.  &amp;nbsp;  For one, we've already spoken to our landlord about our AC not working properly, and we're in Georgia in the summer, so this is about as pleasant as you'd expect. They sent someone out and supposedly fixed it. They did not. They then (also on the first visit)  pointed out that there's a leak in our washing machine, to which the second maintinence guy said is probably what caused the mold.  &amp;nbsp;  We took a few pictures of the mold, and I plan on sending our leasing company an email outlining these issues, as well as the fact that we've been running our AC under their assurance that it is working and it wasn't, running up our electricity bill. I will be asking them to re-reimburse us as well as either fixing this mold issue within 24 hours or that they need to house us at another property, or something to that effect, as we just got a two-month-old puppy a day before finding this out, and black mold (which is right under our bedroom) is particularly dangerous to infants. **I've even read somewhere that this may be valid grounds to break our lease without damaging our credit and even get some sort of 500-dollar civil fee from our landlord?** I don't care about the fee so much as leaving this place, because I honestly don't feel like they're going to fix this in a timely manner, and my boyfriend and I are beginning to feel signs of the mold's effects... we have no clue how long it's even been down there, but the side effects have been felt for a month or two now (chronic fatigue, chest compression/finding it hard to breathe, etc.) and my boyfriend and I are fit, and healthy, well under weights considered to be obese.  &amp;nbsp;  What can/should we do here?	No
1850	"Hello,  I currently rent an apartment with two others in Massachusetts since April. For the past couple months (June, July) as well as probably August it seems, I have been assisting one of my roommates with making rent. I have also been working out of New York for the past couple months, so I have been relying on my roommates to let me know what is happening, it's been a struggle.    We're having a huge communication problem. My roommate that I've assisted has stopped talking completely to both me and my roommate. I've attempted to contact her via text message, Facebook and Facebook messenger. She hasn't said a word to me in days, but she still logs into Facebook so she's definitely blatantly ignoring me. According to my other roommate as well, she hasn't been home, and hasn't been talking to her as well. We're running out of options.  Is there anything we can do to remove her from the lease? If we can't, is there anything legally stopping us from getting another roommate to assist us beyond the landlord saying ""no?"" We've been trying to get in contact with her for awhile now.  Last note; I have text messages of her saying she would pay me back for rent as well as utilities. Would these be legally considered ""evidence"" (don't know if there's another term for it in small claims court) if I were to sue her to gain the lost money?"	No
1851	A friend and I are renting a two bedroom condo in Atlanta, GA from the unit's owner. He has asked for an in-person meeting tonight and won't tell us why over the phone. This and some external factors has led us to believe that he would like to sell the condo, and break the lease with us (with the in-person meeting serving as an opportunity to deliver written notice to vacate).  I went to the lease to see what it says and the relevant sections reads as follows: &gt;**Early Termination by Landlord** Tenant agrees that Landlord may terminate the lease prior to the lease expiration date and Tenant agrees to vacate the property if the following conditions are met: &gt;**A:** Landlord gives Tenant sixty (60) days written notice to vacate (Tenant still owes rent through the sixty (60) day notice period). &gt;**B:** Landlord pays to Tenant an amount of $_______ as compensation for disturbing tenant's quiet enjoyment of the property and for the inconvenience of moving early. This credit will be applied to the Tenane account at the time the Tenant vacates the property and will be included with any applicable security deposit refund. The foregoing shall not relieve the Tenant of his or her responsibilities and obligations regarding any damage to the property.  Obviously, the unfilled blank in B is a huge problem. Do we have negotiating room to now agree on fair compensation or does that blank default to $0? If we can negotiate, what amount of compensation would be reasonable/typical/possible?	No
1852	So, I entered a 14 month lease June of last year. This is all in Wisconsin. Around December of 2016, family issues required me to move away, and I talked with my landlord about finding someone to replace me on the lease. He said I would have to pay the lease breaking fee and all rent until the new roommate took over. I asked if I could apply my $500 security deposit toward my $600 lease breaking fee, and landlord declined. So I remotely find a replacement guy around February, and he moves in, no problem. I don't ask him to pay the security deposit, as i hadn't listed it as a requirement in my advertisement. I just figured i could get it back when the lease ended at the end of July. No issues until now. I call to check in with my landlord about getting the security deposit returned to me, and he claims that I am no longer on the lease and therefore my replacement roommate has the right to my share of he security deposit despite him never paying the security deposit. Landlord claims I need replacement roommate's consent to release the security deposit back to me. Now, replacement roommate seems like a nice guy, and I think I can ask him to do the right thing and he will. But did I really lose the right to my security deposit when I canceled my lease?   TL;DR  I had to cancel my lease and landlord still has my security deposit. Landlord says my replacement roommate is entitled to the security deposit and I need his consent to get it back. Is this true? I'm in WI.	No
1853	I'm trying to find more information on moving out of a rental property, I gave my landlord a 30 day notice at the end of last month saying we will be out by August 1st but she didnt receive the notice until the 6th of July.  That being said It's nearing the end of the month, she since yesterday has had a contractor coming in and replacing the plumbing fixtures. She then states that we need to be out by the end of the day while It's entirely possible to be out today, can she force us out today or do we have until the end of the 30 day period to vacate the premises, no one at the time is living here. Any help is appreciated, thank you.	No
1854	I own in a really strict HOA and the renters nextdoor have it in their head that I am somehow connected to some fines they got (I am not connected in any way). They have signed me up for PornHub, put my phone number and email on Craigslist in an explicit ad, and stared down visitors to my home who later mentioned it to me (I never told visitors of the issues.)   The landlord and property management company are non-responsive. The HOA is monitoring the situation.   I have made police reports and reports to the HOA where it made sense.  Is there something else I should do? Can I take another approach, like civil court?   x-posted	No
1855	So I've learned that somewhat recently there have been cases in which plaintiffs have won cases against companies which have websites which are not ADA complaint (sites which are usable by the blind/deaf).  My understanding throughout my career (which was probably false) was that only US Government agencies were required to comply with these rules.  I have heard of many cases in which lawyers have sued small businesses over failing to have wheelchair ramps, elevators, etc. in the past but only recently that website operators and mobile app owners are being sued. I am quite concerned that there could be a liability by simply having a website. What's worse is that it seems the DOJ has not even finalized any regulations on the subject.  How can plaintiffs justify damages by not being able to access free websites? I've never understood how a disabled individual could justify damages for being unable to access a restaurant or other business.	No
1856	Should I inform my rental insurance agency of the looming threat of significant property damage? I've already informed my neighbor, and given them the owner's contact info. I've sent pictures to the landlord, and stressed the urgency to them. It was damaged in a storm and could fall at any moment, cause massive damage, and there's the potential for injury/death.	No
1857	"I'm renting a home in city of miami and had water come into the house through the walls last tuesday (heavy rains) Before signing lease, landlord promised the house has never flooded because ""it sits 3 feet high off the ground"" When I contacted Landlord, Landlord didn't take action and instead questioned the validity of the claim and ""sent out a guy"" to check it out ""guy"" reports back that water entered through an AC unit and will be back later in the week to fix it when it dries. Until today, I had heard nothing back from either party and hoped that it wouldn't rain because it would likely flood again. Landlord says they want to halt any repairs until they return from their 3 month trip overseas in mid Sept.. meaning I have to sit and hope it doesn't rain. r/Miami... I really need some perspective in all of this. I will try and answer all questions as best as possible without revealing names, pronouns, or anything... But im really lost for help and feel like im being screwed hard. When I asked landlord for a pro rate for the portion of the house that I had to clear (their orders) I was told that could not happen becuase they had a mortgage and bills to pay. Seriously... this feels like a twilight zone and I feel like I am without any rights or leverage. I have no money for an attorney and no hope right now.."	No
1858	Hearing was in May and didn't bother going as I didn't know the judge could change the ticket to a lower speeding offense or a non-moving violation.  Is there any way I can have this changed at this point? I'm past the 60 day window for a Motion to Reopen. Could I file one anyhow and hope the judge would rehear the case? My driving record is clean besides this ticket.	No
1859	I think it seems obvious in hindsight these meds where a problem but when your unwell and in a psychiatic settig you tend to take meds like it or not and i didnt associate the increased meds and pain fully until lately. It wasnt until i read about Akathisia that i noticed this is what i had been suffering. I just want to sue because this has bankrupt me and ruined my life and could have been avoided if a docter had just noticed these very negative side effects and stopped the meds.	No
1860	My girlfriend's new place has a single shower which, when set to the hottest setting, eventually gets up to a lukewarmish temperature. Somewhere about 89-90 degrees if I were to guess, though we have not been able to measure it. The hot water heater is fine as both sinks have plenty of hot water, just the shower is having the issue. Work orders have been filed, but he is notoriously slow about getting anything fixed. I believe this may be intentional as a rat problem which was just discovered was taken care of swiftly, but was likely motivated by the obvious legal issue if he had neglected it.   Is there any legal obligation for the landlord to repair this, and if so, what steps are involved if he decides to just leave it unfixed?	No
1861	"Here's the provided evidence, my car is the silver SUV behind the white car.   https://streamable.com/4902w  http://i.imgur.com/bOMhlFb.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/6YWqWsy.jpg  On the citation it says ""Yellow Time: 4.2 sec, Red Time: 0.2 sec"" which from what I can gather means the light had been red .2 seconds at that point when I crossed the line. I am really surprised that they are mailing me about a ticket for .2 seconds and it honestly sounds ridiculous. It's literally fractions of a second. I googled around a bit and found some other state had their law written that nothing less than .3 seconds was ticket-able which I guess is slightly more reasonable.   Do I have a good chance to get rid of this if I dispute it or do you guys think I'm clearly guilty and .2 seconds into red is illegal?"	No
1862	Hello all,  I moved out of apartment end of June 2017. I initially paid $950 as security deposit and today I received a check for $800 (stating $150 for cleaning). This is 1BHK/1bath approx. 600 sq.ft and I have pictures of it when I moved in and when I moved out. I also cleaned the place and sent pictures to landlord. I know for a fact that someone moved into that apartment the very next day and I am not sure when the inspection was done. Please keep in mind, I did not hang anything on the wall and there were hardly any damages to paint etc. So my questions are  1) What I should do to get my $150 or something reasonable back? 2) Can I go ahead I deposit the check I received or wait till I file anything in court?  Thank you	No
1863	Let's say my wife and I are 58, have $500k in an 401k and 4 adult kids. We would like to gift them money now instead of waiting until we die to give them their inheritance. We want to do this in a manner that results in the least amount of taxes/penalties possible. As I understand it, the government looks back 5-years when determining how much one is charged for a nursing home, so we would like to make our gifts sooner rather than later. We wonder also if there's a way we could ensure half the amount we give to each child could be made untouchable just in case of emergency.   We went to an elder lawyer to ask for assistance with this, but he wasn't a lot of help, so I turn to you. If you were me, how would you handle this? Thanks in advance.	No
1864	My parents bought their California house in 1981 and their property value never goes up for property tax reasons.  Does anyone know what law caused them to have this benefit?  It's not proposition 13 because their property value doesn't even go up 2% each year.  They are in San Bernardino County in California in case that's relevant.    I believe that people who bought their house at a later year don't get this benefit because their next door neighbor bought about eight years later and has a substantially higher property value for property taxes.	No
1865	I received a letter from our landlord today (fairly large apartment building) claiming that multiple other residents have filed complaints about us having marijuana  smell coming from our apartment on two occasions. They note that no smoking of any kind is allowed anywhere on the property and that according to a human rights tribunal decision landlords are now permitted to give a single written warning to a tenant on the issue and a second occurrence would require automatic lease termination and that the matter must be rectified by tomorrrow.  Now this is extremely unsettling to my husband and I for multiple reasons. First neither of us or any of our guest have ever smoked anything in or around the building and definitely not in our apartment. Also I am currently 8 months pregnant and we are scheduled to move out of our current apartment into another apartment run by the same management a few weeks after my due date. I am very concerned because we seem to have no way to prove our case, not only that, it would greatly effect our lives to have our lease terminated for this reason since it would mean us not being able to move into our new place at the end of september, and it would most likely prevent us from being able to find a new place to move into since the vacancy rate in our city is already about 0.5% so landlords can be extremely picky. I will obviously be talking with the building manager/landlord as soon as possible, however this is really stressing me out as I don't know how I am supposed to prove that I haven't been smoking and there seems to be nothing stopping these people from complaining again since they have done so in the past. The other detail to note is our apartment is next to the elevator which I have noticed the smell of marijuana in before.  Any suggestions as so how we should approach this would be greatly appreciated.	No
1866	"Im not too sure what to do. I sent back an email saying I've never been charged a deposit for my animal and she says ""well you can either pay the animal deposit or I charge you 2 months rent for the initial deposit.""  Here's the kicker though, I already signed my lease with the originally agreed upon deposit. What do I do? I don't have the money she wants and I have to move in or I'll be homeless.   Please help."	No
1867	Hey I live in the bay area of California and am trying to do whatever I can about an eviction that currently shows on my record. When I was 19 I was living with my father while attending school. Because I was 18 I was required to be put on the lease. Eventually we were served an eviction notice but were never actually evicted as my dad ultimately paid the the required amount and we moved out. Now I am 24 and my record still shows me as being evicted.  Essentially I am trying to see if there is anyway for me to get the eviction expunged so that I can have a better time while apartment hunting.	No
1868	I told this landlord I wanted the apartment and she took it off the market for approxamitely 2 weeks. The rent is 1100 a month and I gave her my security deposit of that much. I changed my mind about moving in as I found a cheaper option and I would have had to double rent for a month and a half. Is there any legal way to get my deposit back or have I lost the  money? This is all happening in missouri.  This was the email my potential landlord sent:  Not only have you wasted my time but you’ve cost me income. You did not take responsibility to know when your current lease ended. On July 11th when asked in writing, you confirmed you DID want to take possession on July 15th as previously agreed to verbally. On July 12th you informed me you don’t. Your current lease termination date should have been considered before you committed to take possession of my apartment July 15th when you gave me your deposit on June 29th. The unit was available July 1st and I compromised and split the month with you. From June 29th to July 12th, you still have not provided the requested information to complete your application.  I have now lost, at the least, one month’s full rent of $1,100. I’ve paid for two background checks at $25 each due to the information you provided for your social security number was incorrect. Both of our time is valuable and I’ve spent at least 8 hours dealing with this issue. All totaled I’m out, at least, $1,150 and I need to begin the entire process over.  For the above reasons, your deposit is forfeited.   This email is accurate, except the listing was off for 14 days, not a month.  Thanks for any insight.	No
1869	"Okay so, I didn't have a written/signed lease with my land lord as well I did not have to pay a security deposit. I paid rent every month for six months to live in a room that had the washer and dryer in it that everyone in the house used and I broke the sliding door to the closet that they were in. At the end of May/early June I was evicted from the house without being given a written notice from the Land lord( it was a "" you have 48 hours to get you things out of the house or I'm throwing them out."") I currently haven't lived there for over a month and they are wanting me to pay for the door repairs. I'll pay for the damages if I have to but legally do I have to? This was in Colorado but now I'm Kansas."	No
1870	I just moved into a new place, 2br, 2 bath. A good friend of mine wants to move in. Now, I already have a co-signer for me, who is prepared to take care of any problems that may arise. Would my friend also need a co-signer? He has little to no credit.   I have the funds to take care of anything by my own means, so the Co-signer will never be involved, really. I only got a co-signer so I didn't need to to expose too much of my finical situation to my landlord.   Thanks!	No
1871	I am a legal permanent resident(via employment) and in April, it will be 5 years so I can apply for naturalization this month. I think Naturalization is a straight forward process that I can do myself without an attorney.   I got married last year and my spouse has overstayed her tourist visa by a number of years and is out of status. I know I can apply for her green card once I am naturalized. I want to know when I should start the process for her: 1. When I file my N-400 2. Or during the oath taking ceremony 3. Or after I get citizenship  Also, what should I put in as the status of my spouse while filling up N-400?   As mentioned earlier, I was thinking of filling up the N-400 myself and only use the services of an attorney while filing my spouse's paper. Does that sound good or is it safer to use an attorney for the naturalization process as well?  Thanks :)	No
1872	"I own a property in New Orleans that has 4 units near Bourbon Street. I had issues with two tenants who would rented two units. They would rent one unit out on AirBnB, and then stay in the other unit. This was not an issue until damage occurred and the City of NOLA started fines for unlicensed AirBnB rentals similar to Denver.  After removing the tenants, the city received an ""anonymous"" tip that my units were being rented on AirBnB. During the hearing, the lawyer that represented these previous tenants happened to be at court, and mentioned that he heard the owner (myself) planned on renting the units via AirBnB directly.  I ended up getting fined $3500. I never said this, nor did I ever intent to rent via AirBnB. I obviously plan on appealing, but I did manage to find a previous AirBnB listing for my property that was removed here: http://airbnb.com/rooms/12874458  I'm honestly wanting a little justice, and was curious what you all might recommend.  Their attorney obviously sticks out for malpractice, but if I can get this listing info from AirBnB, then I can show the previous tenants were renting the apartment and not me. I just emailed AirBnB to try and get this basic info like the listing, description, who rented it, and the reviews.  I'm not sure what else they would disclose without law enforcement etc.  Any advice what to do?"	No
1873	My husband had a DUI in Pennsylvania in 2009. He went through ARD to have it removed from his record. Will this impact his ability to enter Canada through Alaska for a fishing trip?  Thanks!	No
1874	Hey, so the gist of the story is as follows. I have a safe in my house that is key operated that used to contain $11000 as well as a rolex and some other valuables, during a party I had a few weeks ago some friends slept at my house, one of them in my room because it has two beds.  Today, I opened my safe to discover $5700 was missing.  To clear a few things up..  * The safe is in my room  * I never take my money out of the safe and the safe stays in my room so there is no way I would have misplaced the money, I know when I have opened the safe, and the last time I opened it everything was there.  * The only people that knew about the location of my safe was a few of my closest friends   * I have searched my house to see if my money was anywhere just in case  * the key to the safe was on my keychain which was next to me while I slept in my room  *  No one broke into my house or has otherwise had any unsupervised access to my room, the only time when the theft could have happened was while I slept after the party  * Me and my friends are all 17  * The money is all mine and of course I want it back  What steps would you suggest to recover the money, there is only 3 or 4 people it could have been, I have proof in the form of pictures and receipts that I had the money.	No
1875	"Hey, Guys! It's my first time posting here but I've been a long time lurker of this Sub.  I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do here so I figured I would ask.. Back in mid June my fiancé and I went to see a movie at the local theater. We were leaving and back on the main road that has a few exits onto a main highway. It was very busy and the traffic was stop and go. While trying to change lanes into the lane to our left the traffic again paused very quickly and we hit the back of the car in front of us. It was a low speed collision and there was absolutely no damage to the other car, not even a dent. We took pictures. We have been in contact with the other drive since and there have been no issues with her car. Our vehicle took some damage but we later found out it was cosmetic only and only because our inner rebar had rusted. The damage was minimal enough that we did not go through our insurance.  Cops were called, everyone gave statements.. As far as car accidents go it was pleasant. I was not driving (I currently have an injury that prevents me from doing so but didn't drive previously either). My fiancé was. He has been driving for over 10 years and had never been in an accident before. This was his first. We get a ticket to appear in court.  We get there at the court date and are given a packet of info pertaining to the case. Included is the full police report as well as a plea deal. His plea deal was for a $85 fine and 2 demerit points. We were shocked... Both of us had assumed it would be a fine only. We considered taking the plea but then started looking through the report. The summery that the Cops wrote does not match what actually happened at all, nor does it match the statements from either of us or the other driver.  In the report it states that we were turning onto the road we were already on from a completely different road and literally turned into her from there. This sounds much worse than what actually took place and there is a diagram to match this false account. At the court was the first time we had seen this report. It also states that the other car had a dent and took damage which is untrue and we have pictures to prove that. I am able to take pictures of this if it would help for advice on here.  I'm at a loss. When we got to the judge he tried to explain that the report wasn't correct but all we got was a new date to appear, which is this coming Wednesday. This is new territory for both of us and I'm not sure what to do next or what he may need to say to get this dealt with. The original plea is still on the table. The technical charge is ""Changing Lanes Not in Safety"". There was a woman ahead of us in court who was there for ""Wreckless Driving"" which originally held a charge of 6 demerit points and her plea was for 2 and a fine.  Neither of us think his plea accurately reflects the accident. We're just really shocked at how all of this went down considering he has such a clean record (like, not even a speeding ticket!).  Really, we just need advice on how to move forward. Thanks in advance. :)"	No
1876	Hi. Should I inform the owner of my apartment (a log term hotel) that management appears to be responding inappropriately to me after I reported a bed bug infestation in my apartment? At the end of May I became infested with bed bugs no fault of my own. My landlord has responded slowly and often replies with thinly-veiled threats, deflections, guilt-tripping, and intimidation tactics.   Although management has notified me of a plan to replace my bed, clean the carpet, and a plan to spray my apartment specifically for bed bugs, they also make other comments during our conversations that concern me. During our various conversations, management has told me: • no other tenants complain  • other tenants supposedly complain about me • in 30 years they’ve never had problems like this • she is busy with her other job and family matters • other tenants supposedly take care of their pest problems themselves  • she has made comments suggesting any of us could be evicted any time  • she has made comments suggesting I don’t have tenant rights because this is a “hotel” • she has made comments suggesting I could be displaced with no compensation to fix the bug problem  My friend insists I should send the owner an email about those inappropriate replies to cover my butt if I wind up getting evicted and having to challenge it – or if this otherwise winds up in court. He tells me failing to do this would make it seem like I am retaliating if I bring it up later. He tells me “document everything in writing.”   I live in a building from the 20’s in the East L.A. area of Los Angeles. The landlords claim it’s a hotel but I never see overnight guests with luggage. Everyone who lives here are long-term residents, month to month. I never see overnight type hotel guest According to the Zimas map this property is under Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO). I am a disabled person in poverty and I make money to pay rent doing gig work. I certainly don’t have the money to easily up and move.  I don’t like confrontation and I am afraid they might retaliate by evicting me if I inform the owner about these types of replies. Also, I don’t know the actual owner well. He appears to live in another state. As far as I know he could be happy to be a slum lord.   In late May, I first reported the bed bug problem to the manager, he reacted grumpily (shrugging off body language) and offered no follow up. It was not until I sent the building owner an email and we had a phone call in June that management began to show signs of taking steps to try to stop the bed bugs. I was then told by management that my bed would be replaced.   I then contacted the owner and gave him an update. I was then told by management to stop emailing and calling the owner and to notify management only (my friend insists I should confirm this for myself by checking with the owner). The reason why I contacted the owner, is because, the exterminators hired by management continue to fail at stop the cockroaches. I worried they would not stop the bed bugs if they hired the same company – or that they could spread. I want management would find a new extermination team since the current extermination team fails to rid my apartment of cockroaches. I have conveyed this concern to the owner by phone and to management at least twice by email now. So far, it looks like they’re planning to hire the same failed exterminators.   Almost a month after I reported the problem, after I showed management photos of the bed bug infestation, they sent a construction crew to repair some baseboards in my closet and restroom. However, the construction team did a terrible job and left many un-repaired cracks and holes remaining in my apartment. They’ve used this construction team before and they always do a poor job and make a mess. Likewise we’ve had cockroaches in this building and their extermination team always fails to rid the roaches. Roaches are always back within the same day and never go away. Although I should not have to tolerate them, I have tolerated the roaches. Beg bugs however are intolerable.  It was not until the second week of July when management sent in a pest control team to confirm the bed bug problem and make a plan to exterminate them. They’re only now planning to do a bed-bug specific spraying at this time in mid-July.   My feeling is management should be communicating with me solely about factual things being done to rid my apartment of bed bugs. The management team consists of three people so certainly they ought to be capable of fulfilling their responsibilities as the management team. If they make inappropriate comments to me, they could be making these types of comments to other tenants who may be too afraid to speak up for themselves (some may not have citizenship) if they too have bed bug problems. Perhaps that’s why no other tenants complain about bugs – if that’s indeed true. While I empathize with any personal problems management may be going though, bringing up their personal problems after me reporting bed bugs feels in appropriate. Despite my sympathy for their problems, it does not change the legal responsibilities that management and owners have (to stop the bed bugs. What’s more, bringing up alleged complaints by other tenants about me during conversations about the bed bug problem seems retaliatory and that’s prohibitive by California law. See: AB-551 Rental property: bed bugs.  Speaking of the law, I have emailed management 2 emails outlining California law regarding this bed bug matter citing official State and Los Angeles County / City laws pertaining to this matter. I also emailed them a summary of all the info provided by the county about how to stop bed bugs as a courtesy to them – and to show I am proactively trying to be helpful in solving this problem.   Being told things to the effect that I don’t have traditional tenant rights because we’re supposedly living in a hotel appears to contract the law. It appears to contradict the law when I am told things to the effect that I could be displaced without financial compensation or arbitrarily or purposely evicted as the result of this bug problem appears to contract the law.  I emailed management a summary of laws applicable to this bed bug infestation and also about the rights of people living in hotels.   So should I indeed email the owner about these inappropriate reactions as my friend suggests? Or should I just tolerate it since they’re sloooooly addressing the problem albeit with the same failed construction and extermination teams they’ve previously hired.   Thanks.	No
1877	So I recently bought a trailer from a guy here in New Jersey. The guy that I bought it from bought it brand new recently but never used it or registered. I have the certificate of origin, a receipt, and a notarized bill of sale. The problem is the certificate of origin has the place it was bought from name on it and the bill of sale has the guy I bought from name on it. I go to Dmv and they said I can not register because the guy I bought it from needs to register it first basically so they can collect the tax on it. The other problem is the guy I bought the trailer from wants it back all of a sudden. So even if I went with him to Dmv and had him register it then he could technically say oh that's my trailer and try and say I stole it. Not really sure what to do here. Don't really want to have to give this thing back because I bought it as a package that came with some other stuff too and it would be hard to separate everything.	No
1878	"My roommate and I signed a lease last year for August 1st, 2016 through August 31st, 2017. Our landlord is very rude but otherwise doesn't bother us. Due to his rudeness we were very worried he wouldn't let us renew the lease, so after pestering him he finally said over text that ""we're good for another year"". Only now, weeks later, we realize we actually would like to move.   I checked the language of the lease, if neither tenant nor landlord makes notice of termination of the lease 60 days prior to its end, it automatically renews for 365 days. We also have ""No Right of Early Termination"", so presumably as of about 3 weeks ago we're stuck here for another year. Is there any way to get out of this? I'd like to know my options before speaking to my landlord, since he's kind of a dick, and admittedly we did text him A LOT to confirm that we were renewing for a year (mainly because he didn't ever give us a straight answer). Any advice?"	No
1879	"I am a young girl and I was pulled over today after taking a picture at a red light. After the light turned green I no longer had any contact with my phone. I was soon greeted with blue lights and quickly pulled over. The first thing the police officer said to me was ""I saw you texting on your pink phone"" which was weird considering my phone is not at all pink. I told him I took a picture at the red light and he took my license. He came back after a while and said ""Now we are going to have some fun."" I didn't know what to say so I sat there and he said ""take out your phone and take a picture of my car and post it for everyone to see"" I obliged and he then said, ""Good, now everyone should make fun of you for it."" Then proceeded to hand me my citation where I could see that he wrote as a note that ""driver had both hands on phone typing while head was down looking at screen while vehicle was in motion."" Now this is a complete lie because all I did was take a picture at a red light. What are my options and how do I get out this expensive ticket considering I'm a broke college student!"	No
1880	Dear r/legaladvice,  I recently was driving long distance when my tire blew out on the highway.  I put in the spare and drove to the nearest rural town but everything was closed since I got there on a Sunday.  I stayed overnight and in the morning went to one of the local tire shops.  They said my tires were old and all needed to be replaced (which turned out to be true), but that they only had two tires that were the right size.  So I got the two front tires replaced on my car and drove to the next nearest town to another tire shop that replaced the other two.  After my long long road trip I finally made it to my destination.  The next day one of the new front tires was flat.  I had to put the spare on again and drive it to Pepboys, and the folks there said the two front tires were the wrong size and poorly installed, and that the damage to the flat one was irreparable since it was probably poorly installed.  So basically I had to replace two brand new tires to get the correct size.  I will never go back to the rural town hundreds of miles away so I can't return the poorly sized and improperly installed tires, so I left them at Pepboys.  Anyway this has all been extremely frustrating and costly and I am totally unsure what to do.  Should I call the rural tire shop that screwed up and yell at them and demand a refund, even though I have no way of returning the tires they put on car?  Should I call my credit card company and dispute the charge from them?	No
1881	Hello! I am a tenant who has  been living 2 years at this house that I'm sharing with the landlord and his family. We share separate bathrooms. The bathroom in mines recently had a shower door hinge broken. The repairman came and stated that they did not have the hinge model anymore, so they wanted to replace the entire shower door, which runs around the cost of $800. The landlord has a history of purchasing older-model items in which have to be completely replaced due to discontinuation of parts (ex: washing machine). The door was purchased in 2012, however we moved in 2015. It was most likely ruined due to normal usage (below average usage in my family's case I'm afraid to admit). In fact, I spoke to the company who did the installation in 2012 (the same one who are doing the repair now) and they told me that under my reason do they suspect it being my family's negligence. Rather, they are pretty sure it was due to poor construction at the factory and/or poor installation by whoever installed the door. Do the landlord and I split the cost for a new door or am I responsible for the full amount (or am I not responsible at all)?  Thanks in advance!	No
1882	The police emergency detained me because they believed I was suicidal. I was in my car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazards on as I was crying and couldn't drive with blurred vision. They took it upon themselves to assume I was suicidal even though I made no indication of it, have no history of mental illness or even a police record.  I was forced into the back of a police cruiser, taken to the ER against my will, and they tried to charge me $2400. I negotiated it down to ~$650 and left. The doctor cleared me after talking to me for 5 minutes because he knew I should not have been detained for anything. I did not even have to see a psychiatrist as the police earlier said.  I'm not sure if there is anything I can do, but I was hoping to find some advice.     TLDR: Police detained me wrongfully, forced me to go to ER, and I am stuck with the bill now.	No
1883	I just graduated from a one year masters program and of course, the last year was Insanely busy because of my coursework (i.e. not sleeping one or two nights a week). The neighborhood was right next to my school and fine, but the next neighborhood over is notoriously dangerous.   I rented an apartment in August and by October a sexual assault had occurred in the middle of the day. Two young men followed a girl into the building and assaulted her at 2pm in the entry way. I was the first person on the scene after they fled. There were also many mugging in the neighborhood that semester. I talked with my landlord on the phone and he refused to install a camera in front of the building or better lighting.   A few weeks later I came home from Thanksgiving break and someone had cut a perfectly smooth, circular hole out of the outer pane of my bedroom window, which goes out to a fire escape. I think they didn't break in all the way because either someone saw them or they noticed I have an alarm sticker. (which only goes off when the window is opened- but they didn't know that) The neighbors said they heard people running up and down the fire escape. Also the neighboring building had break ins off the escape. I sent pictures to two glass companies and they both said most likely someone had tried to break in. My landlord said it was bird. I knew at that point he didn't care about my safety at all and was a liar. I took pictures of the window and it wasn't fixed until a month later. (It took forever because they had to special order the glass.)   After that I couldn't sleep or even shower in my apartment. I Ubered to class and had severe anxiety. I moved an hour away to live with my boyfriend and commute to school, which took a toll on my school work.   My landlord told me I could move out and get my deposit back if I found a new tenant. I have two emails from him saying this. I found a new tenant (I did tell them the area was dangerous and that they should install an alarm). My landlord signed a new contract with them.   He then refused to give me back but 200 of my 2000 dollar deposit. My deposit was so large because I was a student. He said it was because of a placement fee that's in the lease (it is there but I thought his emails overrode what was in his contract).   I was angry but too busy with school to deal with it. That happened in February. It's now been 6 months and I'm done with school. I've never filed a lawsuit before and am feeling apprehensive. Should I pursue a lawsuit? I think I still have a copy of my lease and the deposit slip and emails. I'm not sure how much legal ground I have to stand on. I'm in the state of Maryland by the way. Thank you.	No
1884	Hello world of Reddit.  This may seem inconsequential to some, but for me, this is a big deal..one that has been weighing heavily on my mind the past couple of days..and I do not know where to turn, who to talk to, or if there is any action that can be taken. So...here is my story in short.  I am a first time homeowner. I bought a house in January of 2016 under a construction loan. Although that part does not mean a whole lot to the story, there is a small significance to it. Since my house loan still has not been 'closed' due to us fixing it up, the homeowners insurance cannot be escrowed in yet. Therefore, the first year of homeowners insurance was included in the initial loan amount, and when a year passed, it was time to pay again. This time, it would be out of pocket, because, again. We still have not completed the loan process. Well. We have updated the house significantly. The insurance company told me that I could send in proof of all updates, and that the policy amount would drop significantly. So, time comes to pay the bill, I call the insurance company and they tell me what to send in to update the policy. I send in the documentation. Call back, they don't have everything. Apparently I didnt understand one part. Agent says. No big deal. So I send I'm the proper documentation to the e-mail given to me. I don't hear anything....I send it again. I still don't hear anything. I finally call, and am told that where I sent it was not the proper place. They give me a new place to send it. So I send it...again. At this point I have faxed and emailed. So fast forward to freaking June.... Yes this started in January... And I get a cancelation notice. I call them and explain what is going on, yet once again. They tell me why something wasn't right. I explain to them that it I DID send what they are asking for...once again. They give me a new e-mail to send it to. I send in the info. The insurance agency says, OK, we have this taken care of. You are not canceled and your new policy is $XXX (almost half of what it used to be). I am ecstatic. I get a new e-mail asking for that amount, due by the 28th of June. I pay the full amount on the 12th of June. The money is taken from my account. Fast forward...once again...to yesterday. The bank contacts me to let me know they have received a cancelation notice of my homeowners insurance. I send the confirmation e-mail to my bank, and call the insurance company. After being put on hold numerous times and being on the phone for over an hour, the insurance company tells me that the policy was canceled and the amount I paid was for the coverage from Jan-June! The told me that my policy was NOT canceled and that amount I paid was the new policy amount. There was no mention of the policy only being for the beginning of the year and if my policy was canceled, why was I not offered to reinstate a policy? Oh...that's because they told me it wasn't canceled. Well apparently that is too bad for me. The insurance company gave me a mailing address for a complaint department. They told me I could write a letter and send it in. They would not provide me with a different number, a fax number or e-mail. Just the mailing address. They would not provide me with a refund or a reference number for the call. I also asked for an e-mail to be sent with documentation of contact from the call and proof of attempt of resolution to both me and my bank and they refused.  Now my bank is mad, I'm broke, and uninsured. Do I have any case at all whatsoever? Is there anything I can do? I'm just at a loss at what step to take next. I don't even know if this post will get read at all...but I would be forever grateful for any advice.  TL;DR. Homeowners Insurance agency told me I was covered, took my money, and then canceled my policy. Help.	No
1885	I was driving home from the gym and there was a car parked in the narrow street right outside the gym. I thought he stopped for the red light but he was parked the entire time. As I was waiting there thinking he would move a car hit me from behind going slowly. I was driving at pathfinder whereas he had something along the lines of an accord ? And his license plate was dent whereas nothing really happened to my car. When i went home however I noticed that my rear bumper had a crack on it not really noticeable. Unfortunately I'm an idiot and didn't bother exchanging information with him. Can I still ask him to fix it ?	No
1886	"Hello /r/LegalAdvice,  I recently won a trademark infringement suit against someone... however, mind you he was a college student when I sued... I have just found out that he filed for bankruptcy and had all his assets transferred over into his brothers name.  Am I shit out of luck to get my judgement? He is supposedly ""unemployed""...  Thanks for your help."	No
1887	I've been running around in circles trying to find a lawyer to represent me in filing a case against the state of California hiring board for discrimination. Long story short I was ranked #1 on the eligibility list due to score and veteran points, after applying to several positions and not receiving any call back for even an interview I called the hiring manager to find out what was going on but weak after that conversation I got notified that I was being removed from the eligibility list. So if anyone has any advice or any leads on someone I can talk to please let me know	No
1888	My contract ends on August 7th and on July 2nd, my landlord asked me whether I want to sign another contract or move out. I said I cannot decide just yet and we did not talk for one week. Last night (July 9th), he suddenly told me I have one day to make up my mind, if I don't respond today, he's going to assume that I will move out and my contract will not be renewed. His argument is it takes just as much time for him to get a new tenant as it takes for me to find a new house (which is utterly bs because his house is 1km away from the uni). How come I only get 1 week to find a new house and he gets a whole month to find a new tenant? Any legal document that can help me win this case?	No
1889	8 block complex served by 4 garages. Towed within an hour of being there. They have a sign that says have to go to some of the restaurants to get a parking validation immediately and only valid for 3 hours.  Went to a different restaurant first and then was going to get drinks at the one next door on the list. Apparently I was followed by someone and then they towed.  My argument would be immediately isn't defined in terms of time. Walking from the farthest garage to the farthest restaurant takes 20 minutes in the complex. Gonna try to get a hearing in front of justice of the peace to file a dispute on the tow using immediately as not a time. Think I have a chance?	No
1890	I received a Petty Misdemeanor about 5 years ago in New Mexico for shoplifting under $30. At the time I was homeless and hitchhiking through Albuquerque on my way back to Florida. I was never arrested but they took my information, banned me from going to any Kmart's, and gave me a court date. I talked to a public defender and she told me if I never plan on coming back to New Mexico that I should just leave. So I did. I ignored the court date and headed back to Florida without a second thought.  It's been 5 years, I have my shit together and I'm living in Colorado now. I haven't heard anything from the state of New Mexico since I left and forgot about the whole deal until I applied for Lyft a couple months back and was declined because of that charge from New Mexico. How should I go about dealing with this? I now regret just leaving like I did and feel like I probably made it worse. Does this mean I also have a warrant out for skipping a court date? The way the public defender talked about it made me think it was no big deal but obviously you can't just ignore stuff like this. Any guidance is appreciated.	No
1891	"Hi all thanks for your time, as the title suggest I have just recently received an eviction notice, and I'm not sure what my options are, what I should do, or if it's even a legal eviction notice.  Allow me to explain;  I live in the state of Mississippi, I live on land that is owned by someone other than myself, we'll call her R. Along with R, lives her son, B, and her other son, D. All three of these people live in the same house, and right next door, lives another family, inside this family is a mother, and father, and two little girls. We'll call this household the E household.   Across the yard, lives another house hold that we'll call "" H Household"" and there in lives a father and mother and 1 little girl. There's one more house hold, and that's the A household and there just lives 1 mother and her son.   Everyone on this land is related, and have been living on this land for 5+ years. There has been no formal agreement for living here, as it was verbally agree'd upon that it was okay to live here. Recently, however, the E &amp; H household has had to put B into jail for heinous crimes against them. Because of this, D &amp; R are now evicting everyone off of the land in anger. They feel like this might be an attempt to steal the land out from under B.   I've received what looks like a very generic eviction notice that doesn't look notarized or official at all from D. D doesn't own this land, in fact the land has a loan out on it that is in R's name.   I know this subreddit is for general advice, and that's what I'm looking for, so I have a few questions here, and hopefully some of them might get answered, or I'll get pointed to the right direction to ask.  &gt;1. If D doesn't own the land, can they formally evict us?  &gt;2.  Could there be a case for wrongful eviction(because D is evicting us in retaliation of B going to jail), if there is no formal agreement made to begin with &gt;3. The eviction notice doesn't have the correct addresses on them, does that mean anything? Or is this a mistake that would need to be corrected in order for the eviction to be legal? &gt;4. Is it entirely legal to evict us off this land for the reason of a family protecting their family(having B thrown into jail) due to such heinous crimes committed by the land owner?  Everyone's lives here are being flipped upside down due to no action of their own, and it seems extremely unfair, but I'm not sure if it's illegal. Thanks so much for your time, and thanks for your help if I've been unclear at all, or you need more information let me know and I'll reply as best I can."	No
1892	Hello Everyone,   The title says it in a nutshell. I have lived here since April and it has been ok in that time, but I've suspected there might be mold, which is why I called my landlord asking how that would be handled. They informed me that they have never tested for Radon or mold, and that if I wanted testing it would have to come out of my end since they wouldn't pay for it.   What are my options? The lease agreement doesn't say anything about testing or anything on this subject.   Thank you all in advance.	No
1893	PREFACE - I am in Ohio. The I-70 incident occurred in Columbus, and the I-75 incident occurred in Cincinnati.  Ill start from the beginning to lay out all the facts. Thank you in advance for reading.  Feb '17 - I hit a large pothole in a construction zone on I-70, causing a sidewall bubble on my front right.  May '17 - I learn of ODOT claims, and filed a damage report. They defer me to the construction contractor who, for all intents and purposes, laughs at me. I am out +$100 for an alignment and now have a sidewall bubble.  July '17 - I hit another massive pothole on I-75 which blows my right front tire. I make it to a tire shop, and paid $618 for 2 new front tires and an alignment.  Today - I have filed another ODOT damage report, and attempted to file a claim but realized I was in over my head.  **I am looking for some advice on how to move forward. Here are my questions:**  What are my chances of repayment? This is the 2nd time in 2017 an ODOT liable interstate caused damage to my car.  What else can I do to accomplish repayment? Does this involve a claim?  Since my car did not need to be towed, and there was no police contact, there is little official documentation of the incident. Will they believe me?  I drive a performance car which has all wheel drive. This stipulates that all four tread depths must be similar. Now, my front 2 tires are new and my back two are 1 year old. I did not have the money to cover all 4 tires when replacing, so I did what I could. Since my car requires all four tires to have similar tread, is it reasonable to claim that the state pay for all four tires?  Thank you again for reading.	No
1894	"So as the title says, I have some evidence of my landlord entering the house I live in with my 3 other adult room mates.   We are 28, 29, 40, and 21 males respectively with the 21 year old being out of the country for most of the summer. The three older of us all have full time jobs while the 21 year old attends college full time in the fall and spring. We rent all 4 rooms of this house and obviously with that comes use of the bathrooms, kitchen, common areas, etc. Typically all four of us are only home in the late afternoon and hang out in the evenings, so we have little interaction with our landlord Paco (changed for this story). Paco is an Argentinian immigrant, and for the most part a nice dude. All this is just background info.   Recently my girlfriend has been off school for the summer and has been spending time between my house, her parents house, and work considering she hasn't been bogged down with papers, class, etc and has been working a little bit more. On Friday 7/21 she had decided to stay the day and just hang and watch tv in my bed while I went to work so she could meet me at the gym afterwards. Obviously that's boring and she decided to clean the kitchen in the meantime, because with a house full of dudes it hardly ever got a deep clean. Pretty nice of her right? She figured since she was staying over extra that would be her way to contribute something to the house.   Well at some point Paco opened up the side door to the kitchen from the backyard and came face to face with her mopping the floor. He quickly said something along the lines of ""oops sorry"" and quickly closed the door.   Quick backstory on Paco, he pretty much bought the place as a tenant cash grab. My room is an illegal addition that used to be the living room, he lives in an illegal studio built off the side of the garage, and he lugged two Gulf Stream trailers back into the backyard to also rent out to additional tenants.   Suffice it to say we all know it wasn't the perfect situation to be in, but it's cheap so whatever.   Not anymore. After Paco opened up the back door with gf there mopping the floor he decided that we could only have guests over one night a week, which was never specified in the contract. The ONLY thing explicitly stated by the rental contract is that I would be paying rent on the 5th every month and that I would pay a security deposit before hand. Nothing limiting any sort of guests, or behaviors for that matter.   We had a talk about it where I reiterated that gf was off school for the summer and would be spending more time here until she goes back at the end of August. We seemed to agree on that point, and I thought that would be the end of it.   Well he decided to take the thumb turn off of the kitchen deadbolt, and then started stalking around my bedroom windows this morning while gf was getting ready to leave for work. When I walked her out to her car he was sitting right at the fence to his driveway staring at us while he seemed to be trying to fix the fence.   I'm pretty sure code enforcement would love to come have a look at all the living situations up in here, but until I find a new place to live that really isn't an option. Is there anything I can use to keep my landlord out of my place, or am I screwed because I rented a room and not the house? I'm just trying to see what my options are, me and the two older room mates are getting a new place as soon as one becomes available because living with this petty weirdo is getting really frustrating. Beyond giving me grief he's been giving gf anxiety and making the rest of the house incredibly uncomfortable.    (Sorry if this is rambling, it's kind of a developing situation and I'm a little frazzled)"	No
1895	So here's my deal: I live in Los Angeles. About last November I was looking for a new place to move into. A friend told me about two friends of hers who were looking for a roommate. Rent's $350/mo. Cool, right? I move in, no lease, mo-mo, no contract, but I pay a $210 deposit. (If I got a receipt at the time it's gone now.) Well this place was alright (except for the cockroach infestation) and these two fellas seemed ok at first.. but they're both actors and one has a hot head because he looks like Thor. If Thor was a total tool. As the weather started to get warmer (I'm talking like low 70s here) I open the windows to let a nice, cool breeze in. Apparently my roommates were allergic to fresh air and wanted the windows to be closed at all times and have the a/c running 24/7. We didn't pay any utilities so they could care less about what it cost to run it. The bathroom smelled like mildew and there was black mold on the windows when I moved in (I took care of that, as well as a large part of the cockroach infestation.(Endorsement: Check out Advion Bait syringes👌)) So I keep the bathroom window open to air it out. By and by these guys kick me out because I won't keep the windows shut (I think I bruised Thor's ego because he's used to getting his way.) Anyway, I'm told I'll get my deposit back when someone else moves in (smells like BS). I say screw it and go on my merry way. A month later (a few days ago now) I text Thor telling him that I need my deposit. He says tough luck, claiming there are damages (a lie. I did nothing but improve that place.) By CA state law, any deductions from the deposit must be taken out within 21 days of a tenant having moved out, and an itemized list of said damages along with the (reasonable) costs. I never heard anything from my old roommate until I texted him and he refused to return my deposit. In that sense, I have the upper hand..however, I have no contract. No receipt of a deposit (only a PayPal transaction for an amount greater than the deposit), no hard evidence except my recent texts and the check images and deductions from my bank account over the course of my having lived at that apartment. So I sent Thor a request for Deposit Return letter and my next step would be to take this to small claims court..but is it worth it? Do I have a leg to stand on or would it be a waste of time and money?  I only have texts and my check images and PayPal statements directed to him. I don't have a written contract or receipt of deposit, etc.  Should I just accept that there are unscrupulous douches out there and I'm a victim of theft, or is there a way I can fight this? Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice!	No
1896	My gf is moving into a new apartment with me, here is her problem with her OLD apt land lord.  Since it is taking longer to move the gf out than expected, the apt owner told my gf she would allow her to stay in the apt until the 18th of August, and pay the remainder of her rent on the 18th once everything was done and out.  Today, the landlord called the gf demanding the money that is owed to her, while also telling my gf that late fees are stacking up.  To my knowledge, there was nothing in writing, just verbal conversations that my girlfriend repeatedly called to confirm.   Help?	No
1897	So to make it short, I was out late driving on the highway and was pulled over while going slightly over 30 the speed limit, resulting in an over $400 ticket.  The ticket is not the issue, however, as I will pay for it.  The thing i'm worrying about is my parents insurance.  I know what I did was stupid and a giant mistake, and i'm wondering if there is anything I can do to reduce the hit on our insurance, or get it cleared off the record.  I am very unfamiliar with all of this so any help is very appreciated.  I'm 18 for anyone wondering, thank you Reddit in advance!  I've talked to a friend who was in a similar situation, and he suggested pleading not guilty and going to court to apologize to the officer and such.  I'm not sure how much this will help but i'm willing to try anything to remedy this mistake.  There's not a class to take in the county, either so I can't do that.	No
1898	So it all started one sunday morning when me and my family decided to fly to california. My mom is a relatively frugal woman so she tried to get the cheapest tickets for an airline due to us having 6 members including her in the family. So we go to the airport get passed security and find ourselves boarding the plane she boards first due to her having multiple sclerosis. Then the rest of us board. We get a little confused because we got business seating. Theres first class, business then the regular coach. But there we are literally in the back of the plane with no way to push our seats back. And other people start boarding so were literally stuck there for the ride. After that terrible flight were onto another flight to get to cali. My moms bladder is insanely good thank god. Her having no movement of her legs, it gets quite hard as you can imagine. But on this flight she finds herself needing to use he bathroom and what do you know the bathroom isn't handicap accessible they had to hold up a curtain on both sides of the plane so no one could see her and my dad as she used a basic right. I would curse every sentence but im sure thats probably not allowed. So my mom was utterly humiliated and she wants to sue the airline. My question to you lovely people is should she sue? And would it have to be a class action suite of some kind?	No
1899	Yes, i risk being evictooby dooby from my apartamento. all because my landlooby is telling me my doge took a shooty tooty on his lawn. this is obviously untrooby dooby because i have no dogge. do i have any chantootle at staying en el apartameniento, especially when le landlubber is well-connectando con el policia?   Thankoodles!	No
1900	My parked motorcycle was totaled  by a woman last year on July 17th, and the insurance company didn't cut me a check until September 6th. I agreed by phone to the number quoted by the agent and he said he would also be paying the estimate and storage fees at the garage so I could pick the bike up. The check was smaller than the number he originally quoted me (he didn't say on the phone that various deductions would be made), I later saw he greatly undervalued the bike (didn't account for almost $5K in after market parts), and he only paid the $200 estimate but not the $1000 storage fee. I'm still in dispute with the woman's insurance company over the remaining balance.   My question is- seeing as (I've been told) it's the law here that I'm owed loss of use on my vehicle from when it is disabled until I receive a check, but the check didn't reflect the correct value the bike OR to have it released from the garage, am I still only entitled to the cost of a comparable rental between those two dates?	No
1901	Hi r/legaladvice  My roommate and I signed a lease from 5/2017 - 5/2018. In short, we cannot stand the landlord and neighbors, and we are looking at a less expensive place to live.   In the lease, it is stated that we must give a 60 day written notice in the event that we terminate this agreement. There is no mention of a penalty fee.   I've been doing research online on how to properly write a notice, but I encourage the help of others. I have never done this before.   We never received a statement of condition. I'm worried that she will keep the security deposit. Is she legally allowed to do that?  Is there any language that I must include in my statement?   I appreciate any recommendations.  Thank you	No
1902	"Hi there, First time posting here and I'm hoping that it's helpful to my understanding of the system and what the circumstances mean. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible.  Location: CT and NY -CT is where the crime is taking place, NY is where the person responsible lives. Summary: An independent contractor, working for our company in the service industry, has been and continues to plan and execute the theft of at least $25,000. That amount is what we know of so far but it keeps getting larger. He's accepting and reporting (on weekly reports) that money is coming in (to make us think it's being collected and placed into the right account). In reality, he's having clients make out checks to him personally and depositing them into his own bank account. He's also accepting cash from clients for things that aren't being reported and further, he has clients paying for services without reporting that they exist. Again, in total that theft amounts at least $25,000.  The real question: Okay so we spoke to some police officers in CT and they said that once the warrant is out (which will take 4-6 week) they will contact the police in NY and see if they will also issue a warrant. Now, let's say there is a warrant out in CT and NY BUT they also said that they won't actually go and bring him into custody...Huh? There's an unbelievable amount of evidence we've compiled that should be more than enough to go out and bring this person in but what it seems that we're being told is ""he's basically free to be until he makes a mistake."" How can this be correct? I understand that some CT police don't want to go all the way to NY to arrest this person but, what if he's in the state? What if he happens to be in the same town? Will they take a call that says ""Here he is?"" The answer seems to be no, and my mind also seems to be blown that a criminal isn't being brought it and put through our legal system. I don't even know what the charges would be but maybe - grand larceny, fraud, damage to a business, forgery, like what would it take to mobilize and bring this person to justice? Are we just stuck with a warrant waiting for him to get pulled over for running a stop sign? There has to be an easier, more efficient, and just way to have him answer for his transgressions. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"	No
1903	Hello!   I'm a foreign student in the US; I'm on a student visa (F-1) going to art school. I know I can't work/get paid here legally, but can I make a film (me as writer/director) if I don't get paid at all? I will gather producers and crew, and they will get paid with money we raise to make the film, but I won't. Is that legal? I plan on sending the film to festivals in the US and abroad, if that makes a difference.   I went to film school here a couple of years ago and made some short films then, but I don't know if it's different now because my major (fine arts) is different...    Thank you!	No
1904	Small-time punk rock band based in Monmouth NJ here.  So long story short, my band recorded an album a couple months ago with a drummer we'd been running for the past year. 9 out of the 11 songs on the album (yet to be released) were already written before we added him to the lineup, so he would technically have writing credits on those 2 remaining songs.    The issue is that due to a myriad of reasons, we kicked him out a few weeks after recording. It was not very amicable, but he said at the end of the day it was okay to use his studio recordings on the album as long as he got proper credit. But now, on the precipice of this release, he wants his fair claim on the copyright to the album.    Two of the members of our band, which includes me, feel it is not worth the hassle to fight for full ownership of the songs against him. The other two members want to keep him out of the copyright at all costs, but still credit him textually.    I have no legal background and probably phrased some things incorrectly regarding copyrights, but my question is what are the ousted drummer's options for fighting us, and what are our options defending against his claim, if that's what we have to do? Thanks in advance.	No
1905	Hello My wife and I agreed that we need a divorce. We are aiming for uncontested divorce.  We have been married for 4 years - we have reached a point after counseling and therapy  And multiple attempts that our relationship is toxic and we need to end our marriage. This is so overwhelming to me as I am ali dealing with my ill father and finding work which adds up stress. Now we both can't afford a lawyer in the Los Angeles area and need to find legal help to do the paper work properly. Since we neither can't afford at the time to get our own place we will have to live together till divorce is final and also since we have three months on our apartments lease- can we still live together while seeking divorce? Does it really take all 6 months till we get divorce decree? Is it possible to get a Probono lawyer to help us submit the uncontested divorce paperwork?  We only share a car loan debt of 9000$ no assets or property we own and no children. This breaks my heart as I love her and it's days before my birthday as well as my fathers third surgery. I don't know what to do or how to go about this- it will definetly cause me financial hardship now that I am currently unemployed and she works part time  I can use any piece of advice or experience I can get from those who have walked down that line	No
1906	My brother recently saved up for and purchased a 2003 BMW M3. He's mad about cars and this one especially. A few days ago, while parked at a friend's house, someone backs in to his car in the driveway and then flees the scene. An onlooker thought it was something like a Pontiac Grand Prix, a pretty common car for a high schooler. He thinks he knows who it is as the paint scrape matches the color of a friend's Grand Prix. They and their parents denied the accident but I am somewhat skeptical. The person in question was present at the time, paint matches what was left on my brother's car and they drive a Pontiac Grand Prix, apparently very poorly. (As all high schoolers do) The damage done is pretty extensive to the front bumper and lights, would have to replace the entire bumper most likely? (Not sure) Insurance apparently doesn't cover the type of damage done so it would be all out of pocket for our family. Just generally curious on how I should approach the situation and if there is anything I can/should do to hopefully figure out who caused the incident?  -Previously posted in /r/cars   Images of car damage: http://imgur.com/a/e2sm3	No
1907	The house I am renting for college this year in Pennsylvania got a flyer on the door saying that the landlord was late on taxes he owed to the borough for the property. We notified the landlord of it and he said that he would take care of it. Today we got another posting saying that the house was going to a Sheriff's Sale in October. Someone told me that we are protected under tenant protection laws and that the new landlord would have to honor our lease, but I can't find anything on the internet to confirm that. Could anyone offer me insight to what can happen?	No
1908	"Please excuse the length of this post, but I'm trying to be thorough and make sure I don't leave anything out. My (37/M) friend (27/M)'s job has transferred him to my city, and since my current lease was ending, we made the decision to move in together to save money and upgrade to a nicer home. We had both been living in cramped studio apartments in order to save money and were tired of the lack of space, so we looked for homes with decent square footage that suited our needs in our price range. We fell in love with a 4 br, 3 ba, 3000+ sq ft home in a nice, quiet suburban neighborhood not far from where I was living at the time.  We paid our application fees, submitted our forms, and were told by the property managers after their review that everything looked great. We satisfied all of their requirements on paper. Our combined income is more than 3.5 times the rent (they only asked for 2.5 x), we both have good credit, no debts, no criminal history, and solid rental history with no evictions, bankruptcies, or judgements. All of our landlord and employer references are good. We are quiet non-smokers. The only potential issue was that the listing stated that the owner preferred no pets and we have two cats, but the landlord okayed them (in writing) as long as we agreed to a $500 deposit per cat. She emailed the property managers to request that she meet us in person before having us sign a lease, writing to them that she just needed 15 minutes to get a ""quick impression"", and finished the email by saying, ""if the meeting goes well, they can move in this weekend"". This email was forwarded to us by the property managers, and I set a time to meet the landlord through them.  We met at the home a few days later, and I don't think anything about my appearance should have been off-putting (I was well-groomed, wearing smart casual clothes, and my car is extremely clean). She had a negative vibe from the start and I got the impression that she didn't want to rent to us and was looking for me to prove her wrong. She made it clear that she would prefer to rent to a family, and said that she felt the only reason that two single men would want her home was to throw parties (I'm 37, and the landlord is only a year older than I am) or to move in lots of additional tenants. I tried to assuage her fears and explain why we wanted the space and told her what the rooms would be used for (a study, a workout room, a guest room, etc) and she seemed a little more relaxed when we parted ways.  After a few days of hearing nothing, I received an email from the property manager informing me that the homeowner had chosen another applicant to rent the house. I accepted this, but the following day I came across the property listing during my search for another home to rent and saw that it was still active. Out of curiosity, I checked the listing on various broker websites (Zillow, Trulia, etc) as well as the property management company's website every day for the next week, and it stayed up and remained active throughout this time. I know that these websites are sometimes slow to update, but other homes I'd considered during my search were speedily removed when they went off the market so I found this a little odd. At this point, a friend of mine contacted the property manager inquiring about the house and was told that it was still available for rent.  I wonder if some subtle discrimination has occurred here. We are a pair of professional adults, not a group of teens in their first house looking to party. As far as I am aware, it is illegal in California (where we are located) to deny housing to a qualified applicant because of their familial status, marital status, age, or any arbitrary status. I know that small/private landlords may be exempt from fair housing laws at the federal level, but I'm not sure if they are exempt from local and state laws. I am also concerned that some more sinister discrimination might be at play, as my roommate has a Hispanic name and is a legal alien from a South American country. He's lived in the US for most of his life, speaks perfect English, is gainfully employed, and is working on obtaining his citizenship - but I know this is still not enough for some people.  We were told that the home was being held for us until it suddenly wasn't. No offer was made by the property managers to show us other properties or refund our application fees, which they definitely were not obligated to do, but it might have been courteous considering the situation. We're happily in a new home now so I'm no longer interested in renting this property, but I'm still bothered by what happened. Is this a matter that I should pursue further, or do local/state/federal laws entitle a landlord to deny qualified applicants because of their family status and her personal feelings?"	No
1909	I have been living at this property for over a year. My lease was supposed to be ending June 19th but on the 14th I decided it wasn't worth the price of paying for a moving truck, a security deposit for another place, and storage room for holding some of my things. So I decided to renew my lease and went into the leasing office to sign the agreement. On the leasing agreement where the security deposit came up it says that I renewed my lease so I don't owe a new SD, and it was signed by an employee there. I have had no problems until last week when my rent was due for the month August.   My usual rent is $495 but it doubled this past month because my landlord said I owed a new SD. When I questioned them they said they used my old security deposit to renovate the house and common areas, and that I had signed a new lease instead of renewing my last contract.    Thing is there were no damages to the common areas. No holes, no need for carpet changes, etc because no one spent any times in those areas. I also have proof that they knew I was renewing my leased based on the agreement signed by an employee/realtor there.    I am questioning the legality of them charging me for another security deposit even though I renewed my lease.   Any advice is welcome   Tl;dr: landlord says I signed a new lease so I need to pay for another security deposit but I have proof that it is a renewal of the lease	No
1910	Got a memo stating the following:  This memo is to inform you that the soft story retrofit project for the building is going to start on Sept 1st, 2017. It will take approximately three months to finish. The garage will not be accessible during retrofit construction. No parking &amp; no laundry machines will be available for approximately 3 months.  The parking is part of my lease. It doesn't really state if there is any compensation being offered. Is there any I should expect?	No
1911	"I signed a lease to sublet a 2 bedroom and paid a $500 deposit via money order. The sub-letter backed out and refuses to give me my deposit back. I have asked for it and she says ""Ill get it to you Friday"" then it was ""Ill get it to you Tuesday""... now she is saying legally I cant have it back because I backed out of the deal when in reality she refused to rent out. I still have the signed lease. I have the receipt for the money order and I have started a small claim form. Today I received threatening messages from her saying that she knows where I work and live and will have her and ""her boys"" come f me up if there is a problem because I am not getting my money back from her.   Question is: Is this still a small claims case or is this now criminal? Which steps should I take to cover myself?"	No
1912	My mother moved to Indiana to be close to her parents, as they are getting quite old, and they allowed her to move in with them. She's on disability and has several mental disorders (bipolar, depression, and is likely an undiagnosed schizophrenic). They allowed her to move in on the condition that she look for part-time work and a place of her own to move into. There was no written agreement or lease, all verbal.  Her brother wants her out so he can move in with them, and has obtained their dad's power of attorney. He video recorded himself telling her she has 30 days to vacate. Their mother (of whom he does not have PoA) since told her she could continue to stay as long as she continued to look for work. Since then, her brother has continued to try to convince their mother to evict her, and has just recently apparently succeeded.  My mother has been served today, indicating that a hearing has been set to evict her on this coming Tuesday, the 1st. I had informed her that because there is no lease she is considered a month-to-month tenant, and that they need to give her proper notice to vacate before proceeding with an eviction, but her brother claims that his attorney said that because she's a child living with her parents that doesn't apply.  I'm reasonably knowledgeable about tenancy laws, but I'm not a lawyer and I'm out of my depth here. If evicted, my mentally ill mother (who has been hospitalized for suicide attempts) will become homeless, living in her car, halfway across the country from me. If anyone has any input I would appreciate it. I'll try to answer any questions as best I can.	No
1913	My wife and I are both medical marijuana users and have been for years now (before recreational was a thing) and my landlord just sent out an email stating there's no smoking in the community at all including our private patios.  This is NOT stated in our lease anywhere. The only time smoking is mentioned is when it says to not do it in the clubhouse or pool area.  My question is: Can my landlord ban smoking without a lease addendum? I'd like to not be in pain. This was not made known to us before we moved in about a month ago.  Thanks in advance.	No
1914	"Hey, r/legaladvice. First time posting here, thanks in advance for responses and sorry in advance if I'm breaking rules.   My problem is outlined below. My question really boils down to, what can I do about this?  Begin  *****  A couple of my friends have birthdays around the same time and decided that, to celebrate, we should get a group together and go on a sweet looking 90s booze cruise. Tickets were ~$65 and about 15 of us bought ticket, likely in addition to others. I will call the event company that was putting on the cruise EC for short and anonymity. EC sold the tickets through a separate company I will call TC for ticket company. The cruise was scheduled for the night of May 19th, and we bought tickets at least a week in advance. I personally bought 2 tickets.  The day of May 19th comes. It is hours before the planned starting time of the cruise, and I receive the following e-mail from TC on behalf of EC:  &gt; San Diego, &gt; &gt;We are having to postpone tonight's event due to a cancellation of the artist we had planned for you all tonight. we are sorry for the inconvenience. The new date will be on Saturday, July 29. Everyone's tickets for todays event will give you entry to July's event. If you have any questions or concerns or want to inquire about a refund then please contact us at [e-mail address for EC] &gt; &gt;Thank You  I immediately requested a refund, as did many of my friends. On May 21st, I received the following message (again from TC on behalf of 90s EC):  &gt;San Diego, &gt; &gt;People who requested refunds we have received your emails and please allow 5-7 business days to see it back in your account. &gt; &gt;Cheers!  I never got the refund, and most of my friends did not (though one did, strangely). On June 15th I contacted TC support saying:  &gt;Hello, &gt; &gt;I purchased tickets to the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for Friday, May 19th 2017. The day of the event of the cruise an e-mail was sent out informing me and the other customers the cruise was cancelled due to an artist cancellation and will be rescheduled. I requested a refund and was told via a mass e-mail that all refunds would be credited with 5-7 business days. It has been much longer than this time and a refund has not been credited. Friends of mine corroborate this. &gt; &gt;Promptly refund all tickets. Personally, I purchased two and should see a refund in the amount of $131.66 &gt; &gt;[My Name]  TC responded saying:  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;Thanks for reaching out. &gt; &gt;Funds from ticket sales are held for 48 hours after the end of an event to allow time for buyers to dispute the charges. After 48 hours, the funds are paid out to the organizer and any refund requests must be processed by them outside of Universe. Although the organizers seem to have promised refunds, they did not issue those refunds at that time, nor did they reach out to us to issue them on their behalf. &gt; &gt;We have reached out to the organizers of this event to attempt to come to a reasonable solution to issue refunds on the event that was re-scheduled, however, they have not cooperated. Unfortunately as Universe no longer holds the funds for this event, all refund requests must be directed to the organizers of the event who can issue refunds at their discretion. They can be reached at [EC email address] &gt; &gt;We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. &gt; &gt;Cheers, &gt;[EC name] Support  I responded to Universe saying:  &gt;Thank you for the info. Can you please send more contact info for the event managers? Phone number, company name, persons involved, etc.?  I also forwarded my exchange with TC to the contact email for EC and said the following, which they did not respond to:  &gt;Hi [EC name], &gt; &gt;Please see the message below regarding the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for, and canceled, last May. (Insert exchange with TC here) &gt; &gt;I am wondering why refunds have not been credited as promised? Please refund the tickets. &gt; &gt;Thank you,  I then sent TC this email before receiving a reply from my previous e mail:  &gt;Additionally, your service rules make the following points that sellers cannot (taken verbatim from contract on TC website): &gt; &gt;(7) offer, as a Seller, any items that you do not yourself own or have permission to rent (without limiting the foregoing, you will not list items as a Seller if you are serving in the capacity of a broker, rental agent or listing agent for a third party); &gt; &gt;(10) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with any person or entity; &gt; &gt;(13) as a Seller, submit any Listing with a false or misleading price information, or submit any Listing with a price, service or activity that you do not intend to honor. &gt; &gt;These terms are in question of being violated based on the way 90s booze cruise handled the event. There is no evidence they had owned or had permission to rent the service they offered. The fact that they canceled the event hours before the time is highly suspicious and suggestive that they never intended to honor their service. If either of the above is true, it follows that they misrepresented themselves and their affiliation with artists and vendors. &gt; &gt;I trust there will be proper due diligence with regards to these potential breaches of contract and that appropriate legal action will be taken if necessary. &gt; &gt;Please inform me how you plan to proceed.  I received no reply to this as well.  I disputed my charge for the tickets through my credit card and was promptly refunded. While my desire for justice was left unserved, and some of my friends never got their money back, I got my mine back and decided to put the matter to rest. However, I was surprised to get the following e-mail from TC this morning (July 17):  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;We are writing regarding the dispute for $130.00 USD charge to your card ending in XXXX on Monday, July 17, 2017. &gt; &gt;The charge was for 2 tickets to the 90s Booze Cruise- San Diego event. &gt; &gt;The organizer of this event, EC, uses TC to sell their tickets. The event took place on Friday, May 19, 2017. We have attached your tickets and receipt here. &gt; &gt;Please call the number on the back of your card to let your bank know that you understand what this charge is for and reply to let us know when you have done so. &gt; &gt;Best Regards, &gt; &gt;TC Support  I responded with the following lengthy message. My response includes a consolidation of all the communication between myself and Universe, so I have not included that since it has already been posted above. My response:  &gt;Dear TC, &gt; &gt;You are mistaken. &gt; &gt;This event did **not** take place on May 19, 2017. This event was **planned** for that day, however, it was canceled only hours before it was **planned** to start. &gt; &gt;*(Here I copy and paste the messages from Universe regarding the event being cancelled and then the promise to refund tickets).* &gt; &gt;I never received the promised refund, so I followed up with TC support to obtain it as it was promised. This exchange between myself and Universe can be summarized as follows: &gt; &gt;*I asked TC for a refund due to the cancellation and unfulfilled promise for a refund; &gt;*I was told funds were released to 90sbooze cruise and I had to ask them directly; &gt;*I attempted to contact EC and received no reply; &gt;*I provided evidence to TC that EC breached their contract with Universe on multiple grounds and *requested legal action be taken to hold them accountable for what appears to be a scam. This final request received no response from Universe. &gt; &gt;**Here is the full exchange** *(copy/paste of full exchange between myself and TC here)* &gt; &gt;**(end exchange)** &gt; &gt;Now that I have cleared up the apparent lack of communication between departments in your company, I'm sure you understand why I disputed the charge and that I will not be calling my bank. I have already explained to them this situation and they readily agreed to reverse the charge, standard practice when a purchased service has been grossly misrepresented and not rendered.  &gt; &gt;So rather than *me* call *my* bank and explain what the charge is for (I know what the charge is for better than you do, apparently), I suggest *you* call 90s booze cruise and explain to them that the contract they signed with *you* has been violated and that they need to issue refunds to **everyone** who asked for one. If they don't, then *you* should contact your lawyer (or acquire one if you do not have one) since your contract has been broken.   As all evidence points to this ""event"" being a pre-conceived scam, taking the above actions will show that you are not a co-conspirator with 90s booze cruise in what amounts to false marketing and, quite frankly, stealing. Failing to take action (as you did on my last request) shows you are either woefully incompetent, unfortunately apathetic, or outright criminal.   Please take action as I've outlined above, **and reply to let us (us being myself and all other ticket purchases) when you have done so.**  **Best regards,** --  [My Name]  **P.S. Can you confirm that the event has been successfully rescheduled for Saturday, July 29th? If so, please send me all relevant event info.**  **P.P.S. To remedy the lack of communication between departments of your company, might I recommend slack messaging?**   *****  As of now I am awaiting a reply though I expect there will be none. Can anything be done about this? Part of the issue, I believe, is 90s booze cruise is shrouded in mystery. All I have is the e-mail address provided through Universe. I do not know where they are based (I think NY) or have any real contact information, nor, can I connect an actual human to the company. I suspect this is on purpose. It does appear they have advertised this event elsewhere. I am not sure if they followed through with it in these other locations or if it is a systematic scam in multiple locales.   *edit: concealed identifying information and formatting*"	No
1915	"We purchased a new build home under a year ago. We have water damage and mold caused by an AC unit leak. The installer has admitted fault and restoration efforts have begun. I have two questions regarding the matter: 1.	We are concerned about future mold issues. Can we obligate the builder to warranty against mold?  2.	We have lost use of a bedroom, a bathroom, and occasionally lose use of our living room. We are also taking extensive time off for numerous restoration and electrical appointments. Are we able to seek damages for inconvenience/pain/suffering as this is resulting from builder negligence?"	No
1916	"I hired professional, highly recommended photographers for my wedding in January 2017. They gave me a CD with 1,331 photos. There are 3 of the bride (me) and the editing on the rest of the pictures is terrible (they also gave me photos of them drinking, the sky, and selfies with the staff, there are more photos of the sky than me, the bride, alone in my dress). The best photo these professionals took was from their iPhone. When I received the photos I told them right away that I wasn't pleased. The editing is terrible, they just applied filters to most of the photos. I asked them to removed the filters, look for more photos of me, and to find more photos like the cell phone photo they took (the cell phone picture is a stunning full body shot of the bride and groom with the lake and sunset in the background). The professional camera shots of the same image are from the shoulders up and very washed out due to filters. They said they would. A month goes by I hear nothing so I reach out to them and ask how its going. They say we have all the pictures done. I'm thrilled and I go and get them. It's a CD with 7 photos, I told them there was more they said they would fix, they asked for a detailed list. I spent 3 weeks making a ""This is what a professional would do to make these photos great list."" I covered everything from ""Please crop this photo, photoshop food out of bridesmaids teeth in group shots, remove filter etc."" They said that was too much work and they don't use photoshop (not mentioned before booking or anywhere in the contract). I told them to just give me the photos unedited and I would have someone else fix them. Months go by again and they give me 50 photos, they went though the list I gave them and gave me unedited images of things I wanted cropped. They did not remove filters. Then when I brought up that they mentioned they found more photos, the denied that they said that because they gave me all they had (I have the text message from them where they said they found more images). My question is: Is it worth it to take them to small claims for all the photos unedited (raw). I'm not wanting money, though I do have to pay an editor now. Just give me the SD cards from the wedding and let me be on my way. They already gave me a copyright release form stating the photos can be edited by an outside party. It's been months and I really want photos I can show people."	No
1917	A little back round story for you guys to better understand. We're both 19 year olds living in Austin Texas. So back in like mid June my boyfriend and I use to live in an apartment with my mom and another roommate. My mom was due to move out of state on July 15th. The lease ends September 24th. So we decided to find another place to rent out. I told my man to ask around people as his job. He found a co worker who was renting a bed room for $500. Which sounded like a good deal since we currently don't have a car and the guy who lives next door works for the same company and would give them rides to work. We went to see the place, it's located in these run down apartments behind our current apartment but the room was big. And we needed something desperately since we aren't able to get our own apartment in our name. The problem was that the guy wanted us to move in by August instead of September 24th or else he would rent the room to somebody else. He told us to pay him $300 to save the room. And by no means did we want to end up homeless so we took the offer and paid him. We're not on the lease or anything. So Fast forward to mid July. The guy tells us we can move in 2 weeks before August so we did. We spent 2 nights there and that's when we realized the apartment was infested with bed bugs. The guy never told us there was bed bugs. We could handle some roaches but come on bed bugs are on a whole new level of nope. Lucky our old roommate was still living in our old apartment so we packed a few things and moved back into our old apartment after the second night. We spoke to our old roommate and we all agreed to stay at the apartment. We talked to the guy with the bed bugs and he said he would pay us $225 back out of the $300. Ever since than we've only received $40. It's been awhile and we're tired of going after him for the money. He keeps giving us the run around for weeks now. We have a key to his apartment and some of our stuff is still there. We don't have a car to move everything out yet and he said it's okay if we leave some stuff. We totally don't want bed bug infested furniture. I was wondering if there is anything i can do to get our money back. My boyfriend doesn't have a legal status is this country so I don't want to get him involved since it's too risky. I wonder if it's better to just cut our losses and forget about the money despite the fact we really need it to pay off some other bills.	No
1918	"1st floor resturant 2nd and 3rd are 8 apartments.There is an office on the third floor included in the restaurants lease.They let one of their employees live in the office.He is drunk all the time and you can hear him playing acoustic guitar wasted out of his mind in the hall way because he has 0 respect for anyone.He his words ""put a cigg out in a plant and fell asleep (drunk im sure) and when i heard the fire alarm i opened my door to the hallway engulfed in smoke.Services came and put it out (about three hours out side freaking out).How can i get this guy out?"

1919	Signed a 12 month lease for a larger two bedroom apartment floor plan with a move in date of August 12. Was wrongfully (she admitted it) given handicap accessible apartment, which is a HUGE difference in counter height, door frame size and more. She has no more apartments available until October, but is not willing to move anyone who was promised an apartment after me. My lease is up now on August 18, and I don't know what to do? It's not specified on the lease that it was a handicap accessible apartment, and that was not the one I was promised and given a tour for.	No
1920	This is more of a curiosity question; however, it could affect me if the fires affect my area of BC. If the RCMP or Forestry service issue an evacuation order and I believe it is premature or unnecessary do I retain the right to stay on my property which is owned by me? I don't want to leave and stay in some run down hotel or some school gymnasium. So r/legaladvice, can I stay in my home under an evacuation order?	No
1921	"I just opened a letter containing a warrant for not attending the court mandated, ""Mothers Against Drunk Driving"" class. It's not a good excuse, but the deadline slipped my mind as I've been focused on completing my 3 month DUI program (weekly group sessions, 6 weekly education classes, 3 AA meetings). In fact, I'll be done with the program this Friday.  I called a bail bonds place and he said they could put the bail ahead of time or something like that, where they would schedule a court date. But he also mentioned for a misdemeanor warrant, he doesn't expect I would have to do any jail time.   My question: what should I expect going to court tomorrow? The letter states to come in at 8:30 Monday-Friday. If I try to handle it without the bail bond and try to show up at the court and attempt get and extension with a public defender, will I be arrested on the spot? I'm just struggling for cash, so I want to know if paying the bail bonds place ahead of time is absolutely necessary."	No
1922	"Hey, guys.   I live in Newport Beach, CA.   My situation is complex and I will try to explain it to the best of my ability. I was employed by a family owned pizza place in Newport Beach, CA. The business had three locations. As a delivery boy, I would drive pizzas to the person who placed the order and received the money to pay for the pizza along with a cash tip. I would pocket this. If the pizza was paid for through a credit card, I would obtain a signature from the customer. If the customer chose to give me a tip, it was available for them to tip above the signature on the receipt. I was cashed out in full at the end of the night.   This is not problematic.   This is what is problematic.   I never received any cash tips from inside the restaurant (there was a tip jar) and never received any credit tips that were left on a receipt. I have filed a wage claim form, gone through a preliminary conference, and now I am scheduled for a hearing. My ex-boss is claiming the following:   ALL THREE LOCATIONS EARNED $220 IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD OR $440 IN A MONTH     This would mean each store earned around $15 a day just in tips. (keep in mind we are in Newport Beach, CA, there is no way the stores made that little per day).    I almost know for a certainty that the locations earned way more than this amount. How can I make sure he is telling the truth? How can I refute this?   He is also claiming this:   BECAUSE (my name) WAS A DRIVER, (my name) WAS NOT ENTITLED TO IN-STORE TIPS. ONLY SERVERS WERE ENTITLED TO SAID TIPS.   1. My ex-boss never distributed tips to any other employees, if he did, the amount was always $20 and was allocated every month, not every two weeks. From co-workers, I have heard that they claimed to never have been tipped out and never have received any kind of tips (these are the people working as cashiers)   2. On a busy night, as a driver, I would take at most 6 or 7 deliveries that averaged 2 hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes of driving time and delivery of pizzas. Keep in mind this was only on an extremely busy night. Usually, more often than not, I would take 3 to 4 deliveries which would average at about 1 hour to about 1 hour and 20 minutes. My shifts were 4-5 hours long. During the times I was not driving, I was serving guests alongside the cashiers. I would take phone orders, place orders in person, interact with guests, take food to tables, clear tables, clean the restaurant, bathrooms, do dishes, etc etc etc (My point is that I served many many people and my ex-boss is claiming that because my position was a ""driver"" that I was not entitled to any form of tips)   How can I prove that I served food and his logic is flawed and not factual?   I have most if not all of my pay stubs and I have all my W-2s.   Please please please please help.  If more information is needed I will provide whatever....."	No
1923	Seven year old credit card coming back to haunt me!  Ok, I've never posted here before and doing this on my phone, so bear with me please.  I'm in Ohio, today my brother in Oklahoma called me and said someone had called him about needing to send me some documents.  I called the number they gave him, and it's in regard to this credit card, last activity was 2010.  They say they are attempting to serve me with papers to take me court for 2,705.49 plus 1,500 in attorney fees, or I could set up pymt plan and pay them 1,664.39.  My question is, how do I keep them from calling family members?  (He said it was an outside company)  He also said statute of limitations was 12 years in 2010.  The reason this card defaulted is initially I lost my job, then became ill and am now on disability.  Any advice would be appreciated.	No
1924	My brother was driving at 11:30 at night. I was in the passengers seat and had hopped out to help him pull into a spot when he scrapped the neighboring car with his mirror. I did not hear or see this. After he told me it occurred, I told him to leave a note. He left his car parked but didn't leave a note and is now being charged with a hit and run. Since I was the licensed driver in the car, am I going to be charged?	No
1925	"I have unfortunetly rented a pretty bad appartment.  The furniture is old and dirty, and the paint on the walls is cheap and yellowish from smoking. The fridge even had rotten food in it that made it smell really really bad even after cleaning.  However I was in a tight situation and since my financial situation is bleak, and my other rent contract soon ending and being too expensive to prolong, I took the bait.  I signed the contract and placedescription, the latter being made from before I lived there however.  He took both with him to his home, in another province, to make copies and claims he has 30 days to provide me a copy of all three and to register them. So right now I have a copy of neither after about a week of renting it. I am planning to see if this is true. If it is not I will send a written notice asking for both.  I have gotten oral permission to change the furniture and take whatever i bought myself with me after I move out, but since he put all the old furniture in the placedescription, and I need to change basically all of it, I am pretty sure it would be a breach of contract to leave the appartment behind without furniture to replace, and could cost me my safety deposit.  How would I secure a binding legal agreement or notification to the landlord, who is very combative, that I have written permission to paint the walls, and written permission to get rid of the old furniture and take my new furniture with me when I move out?  I asked him about this but he gave only oral permission, as ""the law is logical"" even though he admitted he doesnt know it himself.  I am planning to contact the renter's union for legal advice as soon as possible but as I am employed with very irregular and flexible hours I dont know when I will be able to do so, so I thought it would be worth it to try and ask here as well.  Thanks in advance."	No
1926	Sorry if this seems insignificant in the grand scheme of others problems on this sub, but I was hoping to get a little advice regarding an issue moving out after graduating uni.   TL;DR: Roommate started using my room after I moved out, trashed the common area after I deep cleaned to prevent being charged a ton of cleaning fees, resulting in my family having to pay move out fees we aren't/shouldn't be responsible for.  The situation:  I moved back home with my parents a few days after I graduated. The first thing we did before leaving was deep clean my room (separate leased rooms in shared townhouse), removed every item in the room, and cleaned the common area. My roommate was staying there during the summer, and during a visit during this time when he wasn't there, I found out that not only did he completely trash the common area my family and I deep cleaned, he also helped himself to my room and started using my bathroom because (i am not exaggerating) you literally could not see more than 5% of his floor in his room due to trash and clothes everywhere, and same with the bathroom. Due to this, I am now being charged an item removal fee for items left in my room, as well as the common area because apparently he didn't remove everything when he moved out after me.   The good: I have picture documentation of everything, including how I left my room and bathroom after cleaning before leaving that last day, how we left the common area after deep cleaning, and pictures of his room and bathroom (he left his door open and I felt the need to document his disgusting trash heap of a room). I also took pictures of the townhouse after visiting the random day during the summer of his stuff in my bathroom, the common area trashed, and his still uncleaned room (door was left open).   The bad: His family is much more well off than mine, and because of this he seems to think that he can just not do anything and have his parents pay the fees, which rope me into it because of the shared common area in the lease. My family can afford to pay these fees, but I feel we shouldn't have to, especially given the fact that he used MY bedroom after I moved out.  My question: With all of the documentation my family and I have, what steps can be taken to help prove we were not responsible for some of the charges so we don't end up having to pay hundreds of dollars in fees for stuff my roommate has done in lieu of my being there?  Thanks for your time, sorry for the wall of text!	No
1927	I was billed for damages to a filling cabinet by my University in Pennsylvania. Those damages already existed not only when I moved in to the room this school year (16-17), but also before I moved in to the same room for the last school year (15-16). I found a photo showing the damage to the cabinet already existed at the end of the last school year and filed an appeal (decision pending). Unfortunately I don't have any photos from move-in last school year.  My questions are:  1) Given that we sign a new dorm agreement each school year and move out of the dorms for the summer, could the school still charge me and claim I caused the damage last school year (which I didn't)?    2) What rights do I have? E.g. do normal PA tenant-landlord laws apply if the residence was a dorm administered by a University?  Thanks in advance for any help!	No
1928	I live in a second floor walk up. There are 3 units on each floor. We have a front entrance and a rear entrance. The rear has a balcony, which each floor shares. My neighbor recently started recording the stairs coming up to our unit and some of our balcony to try to catch another one of our neighbors smoking. Even though I know he's not trying to record me, it still creeps me out every time I walk by the camera. Is it legal for him to record?	No
1929	Hi All,  We just moved and have a new landlord. Everything has been great so far - apartment is well kept and landlord is very responsive.  The lease was a general lease (Boston) and had only 1 stipulation, the fireplace isn't to be used.  Now he is emailing me asking me not to mount any TVs to the wall.  My issue is that I am a home theater buff, and have a TV and speakers I plan to mount. Had I known this, we would not have rented the unit.  I e-mailed him back saying The previous tenants had two TVs mounted, and that I hope to be able to do the same and would even hire professional, bonded installers to come if needed.  No reply yet, but I am wondering if I can just do it. I would rather not, and have a good relationship with my landlord. He is in CA and never visits. I am just wondering so I know my options.   I want to stay on good terms but I was planning to mention that this isn't stated in the lease if he replies saying no again.  Thanks	No
1930	I have a friend who has a probation violation warrant out. He skipped out of dwai probation 3 years ago because his life was unstable. This was his first offense. Since then he's kept a steady job almost 2 years, started taking college courses and kept a stable apartment. He's ready to turn himself in and deal with the consequences. His goal is to get bail. Go to court. Hopefully be reinstated. Then comply with all probation rules and complete it. Any advice on to go about that? He has a lawyer who offered a flat rate of 2,000 for help. But he can't afford that and makes too much to qualify for a public defender.	No
1931	"Question #1: Would an e-mail to the owning agency be my best option to get this refund back, or do I need to start with communications that are more official?  Question #2: Should I pursue the $200 punitive damages provided for by state law?  Amplifying information:  - My lease at my former apartment terminated on 30 June.  - I completed the walk-through with the owner's representative on 26 June.  She was very happy with the condition of the apartment.  I gave her my forwarding address at that time.  This walk-through is on video.  - Location is South Dakota.  (SDCL 43-32-24)[http://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&amp;Statute=43-32-24] requires the landlord to refund the deposit within two weeks of termination of the lease, and to provide a written itemization of refund withholdings within 45 days if the lessee requests it.  I have received neither.  - The lease also promises the deposit and withholding itemization within two weeks: ""Refunds, or a written statement showing the specific reason for the withholding of the deposit, will me mailed to the Lessee(s) within two weeks after the termination of the tenancy and the receipt of the tenant's mailing address or delivery instructions as set forth in SDCL 43-32-24.""  - The same state law also provides for complete forfeiture of withholding, and punitive damages:      ""Any lessor of residential premises who fails to comply with this section shall forfeit all rights to withhold any portion of such deposit.      The bad faith retention of a deposit or any portion of a deposit by a lessor of residential premises in violation of this section, including failure to provide the written statement and itemized accounting required by this section, shall subject the lessor to punitive damages not to exceed two hundred dollars.""  - This company is notorious for not answering phone calls, not providing maintenance, entering apartments without notice, etc.  I have some documentation in the form of e-mails to back this up.  Not sure what would meet the criteria to establish ""bad faith"" as a landlord on the whole, let alone ""bad faith"" in refunding my deposit.  Thanks for the help."	No
1932	I'm in Florida.   So I was arrested for failure to appear. While incarcerated the jail didn't give me my medicine and I had a seizure from withdrawal from Zoloft.   I broke my finger and had to had two surgeries, then the wound became infected while again incarcerated for failure to appear.   It's a shit sandwich. But is the county/jail responsible for my seizure, broken finger, two surgeries bill?	No
1933	"Hi!  Thank you in advance for reading!   I currently attend a University of California school. I live on campus with my family in the ""family housing"" section of campus living. The property we live at has been there for 50ish years and the buildings themselves are 70ish years old. The buildings are in serious need of renovation, but the cost to do so versus our subsidized rent made it seem as though it was not financially possible (ignoring upper university admin paychecks...) So a need for change was coming - but we did not expect this.   Rumors had been going on for years that they would be closing and/or relocating family housing but we were always told that nothing was put into motion. In the early summer of 2016, rumors started to surface again and I personally called and asked if anything was up. They assured me that nothing was up and that there were no intimidate plans to do anything. About 2 weeks later they announced that they would be relocating family housing to an apartment complex nearby. The original email stated a large increase to our rent - which given our university employment stipends (most of the community is graduate students) the community collectively panicked. There were two town hall meetings held which were so incredibly hostile as we felt totally blind sighted by this announcement. They told us the property was sold to a third party to develop the area surrounding the university. After the hostile meetings, a committee was formed and we were able to negotiate some of the worst parts of the transition (cost to move, lower rent, safer living conditions for children, etc).   However, the entire process has been like pulling teeth from the university. They have given almost no new information since the summer of 2016. Basically all we know is that they definitely sold the property, and we are definitely going to have to move. But we don't know how, when, or where.   One of the major concerns is the units to be leased. The current situation is 2bd/1ba or 3bd/1ba and the new location only has 2bd/2ba and 1bd/1ba. So many community members are concerned about the living situations for their families. We have only been told that those with children and legal dependents will be given priority to the 2bds - but no information about unit assignment has been given. They have asked us to provide information in Feb 2017 that would supposedly be used to determine which families are eligible for the 2bds (had to give birth certificates of children and marriage certificates). In June 2016 they sent an email saying they would have unit assignments completed and leases ready in July. However, they have not met this expectation. I have asked for an update on this and they say they have no new information to give. Which is so incredibly frustrating. At this point I have not signed a lease - but i was made to agree to move or relinquish my spot in family housing.   Another issue is the moving date. They have been giving us a constantly shifting range for move dates. The most recent date they are saying is ""September."" Basically we are told we must move our families in a month, but we have no idea what the living situation will be. Honestly, I don't even know if it is going to happen in September. Which is also stressful as a graduate student - moving at the start of the quarter.   As we move further into August I am becoming more and more stressed about when, how, and where we will be moving. When I call the university to talk to someone they only state that they are ""working on it"" and will ""follow up"" with me. I have been doing this dance with the university for over a year now. I don't know what else to do and I am wondering if I have any rights? Do I have legal rights as a on-campus tenant? Are they required to give us more warning regarding moving dates and leases? I was expected to agree to live at the new housing without any information regarding the living situation or the moving date. If I did not agree they would have removed me from the list and I would have been ineligible to live at family housing post June 15th. So I agreed to stay in family housing, because we are financially tied to the subsidized rent provided. If I don't have any legal rights to require additional information regarding moving dates or leases - can anyone provide any tips for dealing with the university on this issue?   Thank you so much. If you need me to clarify anything I will."	No
1934	So I submitted my K1 visa petition back near end of May.  It went to California which shows 3.5 month processing time (should get word in September).  The next steps are confusing.  Some say you fill out support information and gather civil documents and pay a fee for consulate interview and should be a fast process.  When I look at NVC website, they are saying copies of documents mentioned above go to NVC for processing before the consulate interview and can take up to 11 weeks to process now!  What is the correct process and is it really 11 weeks to process at NVC before an interview can be arranged (which takes 3 weeks to get that set up)?  If anyone can help me understand the process and timeline, I would appreciate it!	No
1935	1 year lease was signed, clearly states that each month of the one year, rent is due. They’re deciding to move out now, many months before the end of the lease. What’re my options? I’m definitely keeping the deposit since that’ll cover one months rent that should’ve been paid.	No
1936	When serving paperwork of a Notice of Court Hearing to a defendant in the case for a temporary restraining order, it must be done in person.   What happens if the individual has been elusive after numerous attempts? I am aware of the residence, yet the person is never there.   Can Substitute Service and Due Dilligence forms be used in this instance, or is hand-delivery the ONLY option? I would leave the docs with another adult at the residence.  The docs are: CH-100, CH-109, and CH-110.	No
1937	My lease started on the 8th of July and my landlord has yet to install the fridge. When I asked him about it he said because I wasn't currently living there he didn't feel obligated to do it. That can't be a valid reason not to install my fridge right??? Now I AM living in the property fridgeless and my landlord has given me a very vague date for when he plans to install it. What do I do?	No
1938	Recently I've had a terrible living situation which fell through to me leaving. I signed a contract but I read the fine print front to back, so I know what I got myself in.   It first started with her trying to make me pay bills for the previous tenant, then she was trying to get me to pay a TV bill, even though the contract specifically states 50% gas, electric and internet. It's finally coming to an end but she's trying to nickle and dime any little bit of money she can get out of my deposit she owes me.   I did have a girlfriend stay over for 4 nights. The contract specifically says I can have a person over 1 night a weekend and without written consent then it's a breach of the agreement. She knew my girlfriend was going to be there more times than in the contract, she verbally agreed and I have texts of her basically implying that it's okay for her to stay (I.E. I'm gonna love you AND GF so much, I feel you AND GF will be a breath of fresh air).   I see this as two ways, to argue against that but I don't know if that's enough evidence against her for her to get it, but she was very well aware of my GF being there, and she was very okay with it before this hit the fan. She wants me to pay for the 4 nights gf stayed there, which I guess makes sense in terms of the contract.   But now she doesn't want to meet with me in her apartment until her lawyer is free. I want to call her bluff since this woman is unemployed and from her history of how she sounds I'm catching red flags that she is a pathological liar.   My question is when this all rolls around tomorrow, how do I keep my cool when I'm being pressured by her and her (possibly fake) lawyer, and how can I break it down to them that I'm not finagling anything for myself? Also any way for me to see if the guy is a licensed state lawyer? Badge that he might carry, something only a real lawyer can have in their possession?	No
1939	I've resided in California for the last year and I need a dime of advice, PLEASE! I am well aware of the power of contracts and this one was all jacked up. Now in September my lease will end, but I want to renew it, why else would I pay raised rent for 2 months (minor adjustments higher for 'rent control').   Here is where I'm stuck; Will renewing the lease lock in my rent? I'm afraid if I ride along a month to month deal, they are definitely going to raise costs, I believe unreasonably too (they have lawyers on it, I'm sure). They know the Cost of Living in CA is always climbing. Please give me your best take. Maybe somebody who specializes in contract law.   Also, the signed copy of my contract was jacked because instead of terminating 2017, it says it terminated the day I signed 2016 (I don't know how I missed it). Anyways, what can you tell me, PLEASE help me make an informed decision.	No
1940	My mother, who I've been estranged from for several years passed away recently. I'm the only real family she had so I've begun the process to sort through the estate.  She always had some hoarding tendencies but I discovered after going to her house that she had become a full-blown hoarder. Like, rooms so full of junk that you can't access them.  I've run into 3 complications so far that I'm dealing with:  1. Despite an exhaustive search, there doesn't seem to be a will.  2. She was a renter, and the landlord obviously wants the house cleared out.  3. Under what I've read on NC law she would almost certainly qualify under the NC Small Estates law (I seriously doubt that in all that trash there's over $20,000 worth of property.) But under that law I cannot become administrator of the estate until 30 days after she died.  I'm trying to do the right thing by the landlords since they were personal friends of my Mom for over 20 years, and I've found a specialty hoarder cleanout company that can empty the house out.  So here's what my questions are:  1. Is it legally OK for me to clear the house out despite me not actually being the administrator yet? Everyone basically has already been treating me like one since there's nobody else to challenge me on it, but it won't be official for at least a couple more weeks.  2. The cleaners have said that since I'm not actually administrator yet that they want a letter from an attorney stipulating that I'm the only heir. How difficult/expensive would it be for me to get this?  Thanks in advance!	No
1941	So I was randomly home in the middle of the day on Tuesday because my dad was in town. How often or How much the neighbor flys his drone over my house I have no idea, I work 10-12hrs a day 5-6days per week. I live on 1 acre out in the country (unincorporated county) and all the houses are spread out so from no where on my property can you see any other houses at all, very private and secluded which is why I bought it. There is a great expectation of privacy where my home is, this is not cookie cutter track homes in the suburbs. I have a small parcel, but all nighbors are 5-25 acres.   So I know which house it came from as I watched it go back and land, but I had to leave to go back to work immediately and couldn't go talk to him also I was very angry and wanted to cool off first.  He hovers this thing directly over my house and goes down about 25 feet off the ground (10ft above my house). I'm outside with my phone out taking video of him taking video of me.  It was a really nice expensive drone. I wanted to shoot it down (shotgun obviously, rifle is unsafe and travels too far), but can't legally because you have to be 300ft from a property line to legally shoot a gun . The property is perfect square and is 200ft by 200ft.   Can I legally take it down with a sling shot or pellet gun?   Yes he'll come looking for it, but I have a key coded gate with 6 ft privacy fences and he won't be getting in at all. Dude is seriously invading the privacy of me and my wife.   He'll then file a civil lawsuit against me for the cost of the drone? Which he might win?  Can I file a restraining order against him for the drone shit? Should I go talk to him?	No
1942	Can a screenshotted snapchat of a little bit of weed (like maybe an 8th) be enough for police to come do a search? I have been threatened by an ex and I would really like to know if this is possible. He says he will report the photo to the police.	No
1943	I try to make this quick. My friend's car got towed, she called both the police and the local tow agencies and could not find it. Reported it stolen. And about a month later got a letter from the tow company saying that they were in possession of her vehicle. They are now trying to charge for almost $2,000 in fees for a vehicle that's not even worth that much... Anything we can do? The timeline is towed early June. Called the day after to find it, told by police and tow company they didn't have. Received a letter June 23. Called to recover vehicle, and hit with fees dating back to early June.   Located in Southern california fyi.	No
1944	"Need advice due to conflicting info from fam/friends, also /r/personalfinance didn't like my post tagged with Employment.    I am of the opinion that since my former incarceration info is sealed that I may now maintain complete assurances that I have never been convicted of a crime or having been arrested. Anyone who Google searches may find old data, which is why some are telling me I should ""own up"" and be truthful if confronted about these in an interview. This is tantamount to waiving my rights which I think is a horrible idea.  Would an employer not be in gross violation of civil rights act and fair credit reporting act if it was even brought up in an interview?? How would I address this topic strongly and respectfully if confronted?  Wouldn't equal protection also mean my expungement would also apply to an employer for any other state in USA?  I am looking at my first few interviews soon since fully cleaning up my record and also earning my bachelors and I don't want to deal with nonsense."	No
1945	So i have a friend that has some VISA problems and was hoping someone on here could give us some advice.  She lives in MA and her VISA is up in a month. She's been looking for a new job for a while now and now it looks like the awkward timeline between not being able to transfer the visa in time before it expires.  Any thoughts?	No
1946	I requested to use my PTO and sick days instead of short term disability or FMLA after I give birth in a month because I will need to take FMLA later in the year when I will have no family help and therefore need to be at home.  My employer says they have never had this type of request before (taking PTO instead of FMLA) and that they will dock my vacation days since I do not want to take FMLA at this time.  Is this OK to do? I know they can't legally dock my sick time as per NY law you are required to provide 40 hours of sick time but is it OK for them to dock the vacation time they provided me as well?  Seems weird.  My husband is taking parental leave from his company and he gets to take his full PTO (his is accrued). My PTO is not accrued, I get it the first day of the year.	No
1947	My roommates and I leased a place for a year, we since moved out after making sure its clean except a broken window. We even moved out early so that the new tenants can move in ASAP. Its been over a month and we still haven't received our deposits back, we tried calling and emailing, we received an email about a month and a half ago saying that he'll send it mid june, its august now. That was the last we heard from him. We're still attempting to contact him, and no response yet. What should we do?   NOTE: landlord has a rep of not returning deposits and taking a LONG time to response for money related issues.	No
1948	So I am moving to school and living with somebody I met in my school's Facebook group. I was out of state all summer so was unable to look for places to live and trusted this guy with going and doing tours and everything. He ended up signing a 1-year lease at a 2 bedroom place for us and when I got there it was definitely not what I expected. Very loud street right outside my window (which has corners of panes broken off and no screen so at some point bugs will be able to just crawl right in my room. I really don't want to live in this place but don't want to just bail on this guy. Is there anyway for us to break the lease without having to pay the entire year's rent? (We haven't even fully moved in yet)  Thanks	No
1949	As the title suggests, the gas meter stopped working a couple of years ago and my dad never reported it and no one from the gas company ever checked or inquired. I told my dad that he could get into trouble sooner or later but he is too stubborn about this. He believes that it is their duty to check it and correct the issue. So i guess this is how it will go on. What could be the legal consequences of this if they find out later? Will my dad be held accountable?	No
1950	So here's the deal, I was dead set on going to an event in the UK at the end of July, now I can't go for several reasons, both economical as well as the fact that I'll be going to a marriage.   I haven't ordered a flight yet, but I did book and pay for a hotel months ago and it was non-refundable, I'm not sure whether or not I should reach out to the hotel and ask for a refund since it's still weeks left and last year, all hotels were pretty much booked full and they can probably still get it back, but in case of a policy against such things, am I doing anything legally wrong if I were to do a chargeback via the bank? The card I paid with isn't eligible any longer also.	No
1951	My sister and her husband recently were the winning bidders for a home in NJ. Their inspection was yesterday and the results were not good: structural damage and asbestos was found.  1. Can they back out of their bid? What legal rights do they have? 2. Can they ask the current owner to fix all the issues and get it reinspected?	No
1952	So, if I was living in 2 bedroom 1 room apartment with a couple. They have one room I have room and we split the rent three ways. Well one of the couple moved out, but is still on the lease. Now they want me to pay a half of the rent instead of a third, even though the one that moved didn't get removed off the lease. They are saying it's my responsibility to pay half now since the other person isn't living here, but they are still on the lease so is it my responsibility?	No
1953	I thought it would be funny to poke a little at one of the biggest businesses in my city, so I made some stupid page that literally only got 2 likes. The article was obviously a joke, talking about how they were going to purchase a graveyard and charge entry as a new “attraction” in town. It’s kind of an inside joke I new all of the locals would get and find humor in. Apparently one of the owners of said business saw the article and didn’t like it, and said he’s going to send me a cease and desist (like I care, it’s a stupid page I just made yesterday that’s not even popular), and he threatened me with legal action.   So can they do anything? I took the post down out of respect, but was just curious  Thanks!!	No
1954	"Hi everyone,  Not sure if this is the best sub for this question, but this is the best I could find.  Please let me know if it's misplaced, and I'll gladly move it.  Suppose my roommate, whom we'll call ""X,"" and I are living in an apartment.  At the end of the lease term, X will stay in the apartment and renew the lease, but I plan to move out from the apartment and have my roommate's friend, ""Y,"" take over my bedroom in the apartment.  To do this, the management company wants a $50 application fee as well as a $150 ""transfer fee.""  In my mind, the application fee is reasonable because they have to make sure that Y isn't a serial kitten rapist or anything like that.  But besides being a naked cash grab, the $150 transfer fee seems ridiculous because a) they're charging us more than they would charge a completely new applicant, despite the fact that we're saving them from having to deal with turnover, and b) we're not switching people mid-lease, we're switching at the end of the lease term, so I don't see how such a fee would be applicable.  So, my questions are:  a) Is it typical to charge a transfer or replacement fee in this situation?  b) Are they even legally allowed to charge a transfer or replacement fee in this situation, since nobody is transferring within the specified lease period?    This is all I could find in the TAA lease that looks relevant: ****************************************** Replacements 30. Replacements and Subletting. 30.1 When Allowed. Replacing a resident, subletting, or assigning a resident‘s rights is allowed only when we consent in writing. If a departing or remaining resident finds a replacement resident acceptable to us before moving out and we expressly consent to the replacement, subletting, or assignment, then: (a) a reletting charge will not be due; (b) a reasonable administrative (paperwork) fee will be due, and a rekeying fee will be due if rekeying is requested or required; and (c) the departing and remaining residents will remain liable for all Lease obligations for the rest of the original Lease term. 30.2 Procedures for Replacement. If we approve a replacement resident, then, at our option: (A) the replacement resident must sign this Lease with or without an increase in the total security deposit; or (B) the remaining and replacement residents must sign an entirely new Lease. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, the departing resident’s security deposit will automatically transfer to the replacement resident as of the date we approve. The departing resident will no longer have a right to occupancy or to a security deposit refund, but will remain liable for the remainder of the original Lease term unless we agree otherwise in writing—even if a new Lease is signed. ************************************  Thanks in advance!"

1955	Hello!      I am located in Milwaukee, WI.  In July, my apartment was without power for (4) days due to the LL not fixing a simple issue.  I had damages from lost food and the daily rate of the house was uninhabitable.    I want to be reimbursed for the lost food and time the house was uninhabitable. Am I allowed to abate rent to compensate me for my damages?	No
1956	My girlfriend with a mental condition (schizophrenia) has a friend who constantly makes her feel bad until she sends a sexually explicit image to her. If she doesn't respond to him (he lives in New York) then he berates her and curses at her.    This past day there were over 45 missed calls from him while we were spending time together. I didn't know she was doing this until she told me he was yelling again because she hadn't answered today, and I finally snapped and called him out on it. He eluded to having the images which led to my learning she had been doing this, and then spoke of how he got annoyed and mad at how she didn't send these images so he got mad. Today was the first day I learned of this. Once she learned I knew about what she did for him she cut herself so deeply she was in the ER and the other guy was unapologetic at his actions. I'm not sure if this has any legal grounds. Would it be helpful to call the police and report this? We are both 20 so are rather inexperienced. Apologies if this is written badly. I'm a mess.	No
1957	An old man backed into my car today. When he got out of he vehicle it became clear he was high. I was able to get his insurance info, but he couldn't tell me his name or phone number due to slurred speech. When I said I was calling the police because he seemed intoxicated, he fled, almost hitting someone.   I called 911 and reported he was on the road that very moment and high, and then went and filed a police report.   I am not injured, though I had a wild panic attack on the phone with 911. What do I do now? I filed a claim with my insurance and I have the accident report I filed with the police. Do I need a lawyer, even though I'm unharmed? My car's bumper will need to be replaced, and I'd like this guy off the road so he doesn't do this again, potentially fatally.	No
1958	"I am a landlord in Illinois and this is the first time I've run into this problem and am unsure of how to proceed. Here is the background and current situation.   My parents were renting a house out and after my father's death I took over the account. The tenant has been living in my unit for the past year give or take a month. The lease is over end of the month IIRC. I'm not entirely sure on this part as even though they have a lease with me they never returned a signed copy to me even though I have asked for it multiple times (I have the original lease template but not the signed lease with dates and what not). I know they have the lease because I handed it to them personally. The lease states that they must pay the rent at the beginning of the month but he contacted me and said that he and my father had an agreement where he could pay the rent in two separate portions one in the middle of the month and one at the end. Now I was not too thrilled about this arrangement but my mother informed me that such an unorthodox payment scheme was indeed what they had verbally agreed to when my father was alive.   Now this has not been much of a problem for the last year or so as we always received two checks at the beginning of the month, both post dated one for the middle and one for the end. He has always been somewhat bad with his payments because if I deposit the checks even one day late/early they would bounce and I would have to drive over there to pick it up in cash. But this month I didn't receive any checks at all. When I contacted the tenant about this (end of week 1) he said they were in the mail. So I gave it a week to show up in the mail. No checks so I said forget that I'll drive over there and pick them up (it is now week 2 at this point). Then I was informed that he was out of town and no one would be home until week 3. I stupidly waited till week 3 before attempting to collect the checks again. He then stated that his loan officer told him not to spend any money until they were approved for a loan (the f? never heard that one before). I pressed him again drove out there, no one answered the door, no check. I don't want to keep driving out there if no one is going to answer because it's a bit of a drive. I ask him to have the checks ready for Monday of week 4 (last week of the month, it's currently Sunday). I even said he could post date it for the end of the month like he usually does (this time the check is supposed to be for the entire rent plus late fee). He basically said no and that if I showed up either no one would be home or he simply would not give me a check because his hands are ""tied"" until the weekend whatever the hell that's supposed to mean (also the weekend would put us at literally the 29/30th). He also refused to post date it stating that last time he post dated it the check was deposited a day early and he was hit with an overdraft fee (again not really my problem because I'm not the one who can't pay rent). So now it' basically the end of the month, dude's been living there for free all month and is now refusing payment. I'm going to be out in the area tomorrow (Monday) so I'm thinking of serving an eviction notice but am unsure of the legalities behind it. Also because I don't actually have a copy of the signed lease I'm not entirely sure what my options are. I would like to get him out of the house and get paid for the past month.  TL;DR Tenant is refusing to pay rent and has been living for free in rental unit. Can I evict him without a signed copy of the lease and is there a way to still get paid for the month?"	No
1959	So, my girlfriend has been living in an apartment complex that houses primarily college students as it is close to campus. Tonight, she came home and thought her apartment had been broken into but it turns out it was a new roommate she had never heard of. This terrified her and she has no idea what to do. Her roommate is a 30+ year old women whom she's never met and doesn't even know her name. This is obviously extremely uncomfortable for a 19 year old college student. Anyways, the apartment complex didn't notify her about this roommate. She had actually received an email yesterday stating that it would only be her and another girl living there. But, this 3rd women just showed up and moved in without any notice. Is there any law against this? Should the apartment complex give notice of a stranger moving in? Any help would be appreciated.  This happened in Oklahoma.	No
1960	A couple days ago, I found that my social security card was missing. The last time I used it was a about 2 weeks ago when I applied for a job and my employer asked for a photocopy (that i printed at home) for records. I searched the entire house and called mall security (where I work), but to no avail. I think I might have accidentally brought it with me to my job interview and dropped it at the mall. This whole situation has put me and my parents under a lot of stress and I have so many concerns about the safety of my identity. I'm not entirely sure that this is the right subreddit, but I need all the help I can get. I've done some googling on child identity theft, but I still have so many questions. For example, I read about how some thiefs will use false birthdays with my SSN to take advantage of my untouched credit and I should call one of the three big credit unions to place a fraud alert on my account. How do fraud alerts work? Can I place a fraud alert or get a report for credit that I'm not even sure that exists yet? I start college this september so how will this affect my financial aid and loans? Its also recommended that I get a new social security card, but can I get a new SSN? What are the pros and cons of getting a new number and what happens with my old number? Also, how do I prevent someone from applying for jobs using my SSN? What else can someone do with my SSN? Am I too overly-stressed about this? I'm panicking so hard and I really need some guidance.	No
1961	"I work as a delivery driver for an international pizza chain. I make $4.50/hour when i'm on the road, and $8.00/hour when I am in the store. Today while I was still on a delivery, somebody inside the store clocked me into the store (something that managers do in order to make their numbers look better). When my shift ended an hour later, my general manager approached me and told me that I was committing fraud because I had clocked into the store while on a delivery. They told me I wouldn't be fired, but I needed to pay for the pizza that I had delivered (when I got clocked in) and they took $25-$30 dollars out of the tips that I made for the day. I told them that the pizza that they are trying to make me pay for was paid for BY THE CUSTOMER with a credit card. My manager didn't seem to care and said she would ""look into it."""	No
1962	The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	No
1963	My girlfriend and I just recently had our apartment broken into and had several thousand dollars worth of items stolen/damaged. No one was hurt as both of us were at work and we have renters insurance so it's not a huge financial hit to us.   The problem is with the building management being what appears to us as negligent about security issues. After talking to other tenants, burglaries have been a problem in the building since January and nothing about security seemed to change after that. We were never informed about these problems when we signed a lease in May. There are two doors with codes and fab access. The back door to the parking lot doesn't always close completely and needs to be pulled shut by whoever uses it (defeats the purpose of a secure door). I never emailed about this but it's possible that someone else in the building did. The codes on these doors also are always the same. The elevator has a code to access your floor but this code works for every floor and there are always the stairs. Management says there are security cameras but I don't see any.  Management also isn't exactly quick if at all to respond via email on these security topics. The incident happened Monday and we aren't getting a new lock until Thursday morning (2 days, 16 hours later). Called the emergency maintenance # to get a new lock the day of the burglary and no one answered or called back. We had to email again after the first time to get a response the next day.   Wondering if it would be in my best interest to file a civil lawsuit against the building management for negligence of security.	No
1964	To keep things simple, my family and I bought a house in Québec back in May with a closing date of this coming week. We saw the house, loved it, put the offer in with the only inclusions being the air conditioners, dish washer, clothes washer and dryer, and a the hot tub. We went back to Ontario and sold our house and begun the process. The house we bought was listed with a For Sale by Owner type company, the sellers are contractors who build houses and sell them, and built this house to live in, and now sold it to build something new.  We went to 'see' the house today, which was just to drop off our moving truck until Wednesday closing. The house looks like a foreclosure. The grass hasn't been cut in weeks, the entire front of the house is covered in tall weeds and plans, almost obstructing the view from down the street. The backyard is also filled with weeds, un-kept, and the hot sub is almost engulfed in plant-life.   They've also left a children's play set (large wooden thing), large construction tires (I guess as play toys for their kids), a large metal swing, broken wooden shipping pallets, and other garbage around the exterior of the house. The interior looks terrible also, but I give them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they moved the furniture today and will be going back to clean the inside before Wednesday.  We emailed the seller to say we are want the exterior garbage removed, and to state our displeasure with the current abandoned look of the property. Our problem is this, Notaries deal with houses in Québec and don't work on behalf of the buyer (us), so what do we do when Wednesday comes along and the house looks like a bank foreclosure and the cost to remove the trash and re-landscape could cost over $10,000? We've been living in a hotel for a week, all of our belongings are either in a truck or our hotel room. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as we're really feeling like we're being screwed around here because we're out of province buyers and will be stuck with a wreck of a house.	No
1965	From what I understand, they go easier on first-time offenders.  Let's say somebody accidentally rear ends another car.  There are no injuries.  A ticket is issued for failing to stop.  The court reduces his offense to impeding traffic, due to his clean driving record.  Four years later, the same driver commits the same offense.  Is he considered a first-time offender, as the points only stay on record for 3 years?	No
1966	"Edit: sorry that this was mostly structured for the relationships sub, but I'll add that we are both on the lease; her the primary and me the secondary party. Thanks in advance for the advice.  Hi, all. This might be a long one. My ex and I (2 and a half year relationship) broke up a month ago after a fight. I had found out that she was hiding things from me and then continuously lying about it when I realized something was up (she was hiding the fact that she was habitually smoking weed with her friends/coworkers and at home. I don't even have a problem with weed as I smoke too, and we'd smoked together before. (Only reason I found out in the first place was because her coworker spilled the beans to my friend when they went on a date together). The issue I had was with the hiding and the lying, as well as the gaslighting, refusal to acknowledge that she'd done anything wrong by it, and then retraction of admission. It then became an issue of how I ""didn't trust her"" and how things should end because they won't be what they once were/we grew apart. I was nowhere near perfect in the relationship, but this was all pretty eye opening and surprising for me.  Looking back, I also suspect that weed was probably the least if her lies and that there was at least some sort of infidelity as well based on her behavior with her phone and an odd planned night away she had. She texted me while she was at work: ""whoops! Looks like I have to stay at work until 3 tonight!"" She showed up at 7am and I found her packed bag when I woke up. During the argument, she said this was because of edibles and that she covered that up because she didn't think I'd like it. Shit like that and a few other occurrences that just never added up.  Out of the two posts I'd made in this sub before, she dug them up and got mad at me for doing it. So if you're reading this, hi M!  Anyway, I went over the next morning after the breakup. Asked her if this was really what she wanted, told her I was committed to making this relationship work, asked her what we were going to do about the place and the dog. She kept our dog and told me she would assume all financial responsibilities for the apartment, then sent me a text asking me to transfer the utilities to her.  I agreed and moved all of my shit out when the weekend was over, but I made the very naive mistake of saying ""the lease is over after August anyway, just venmo me the amount for the utilities,"" to which she agreed was easier.  Well...bill day comes and I send her a venmo request for the amount. She texts me and says not only can't she pay me, but that I should once again be paying for my share of the rent! ""You're on the lease and I don't care whether you're here or not."" I tell her these were terms that we not only agreed upon, but that she put forth. If she wanted me to pay for rent, I would move back in. She dropped it after that, but still expected me to pay for my half of the utilities until the end of our little text argument.  Now she says to tell her what I owe her in September as she can't afford it just yet, but I know there's no way she's going to pay it. Should I just give her a ten day cancellation notice? I'll be moving into a new place next month and I really don't think I should have to pay for them all things considered. I'd never put her in a position to where she's in trouble, but her parents are very well off and I know they're helping her.  Thanks in advance for any input.  TL;DR: GF broke up with me after a fight about her lying, kept the apartment and wanted all my stuff out. She said she'd assume all payments for it, but then changed her mind and decided I should still pay for half a month later. I told her no, and that the only way I'd pay is if I moved back in/she could move out. Then dropped the rent argument, and said I should still pay for my half of utilities. I refused, but agreed to her paying me back after she moves out. I am afraid she is just going to tell me to fuck off and never pay it, and I can't afford that as I now have a place to pay for as well. Should I set a cancellation date anyway and give her notice?"	No
1967	Hey guys so recently i signed a lease with an apartment complex near my university. prior to signing my lease i made sure to ask about my special circumstances that may have disqualified me of being able to sign a lease with the apartment complex. My special circumstances being that I am a completely independent student who has no guarantors, but receives certain financial aid that if counted as income, would qualify me to be able to sign by myself. Due to me explicitly telling the property manager of this, I was told by the property manager to make up information for the guarantor section of the online application (largely in part because it was a required part of the online application to be able to fill out the entire application) and ensured that he would edit the information later. Fast forward a couple days later and I sign my lease for the apartment complex. Fast forward a couple days more and I receive an email from the property manager reminding me that my 'guarantor' needs to sign his part of the agreement. Just reviewed my lease and it seems he has bamboozled me or maybe he forgot that I talked to him about this? my lease states that financial aid does not qualify as income and i must prove that my income is 3x the amount of the rent for me to qualify without a guarantor and any misrepresentation of information may result in a default. I can currently prove a monthly income of 2x the monthly rent based solely off of my job and my financial aid for the fiscal year would put me over the qualification for income if counted. So my question is did he bamboozle me or is there something that I should do to fix this?	No
1968	"State: CA / City: Los Angeles  Hi, I am a tenant of this apartment in LA area which was recently purchased by a new owner/management. For the past 7 years living in this apartment, I've had some great experience with the management and never had any issues with them. But this time, I am frustrated with this new apartment manager who is not willing to give us what we've initially deserved when we first moved into this apartment.  For the past few months, I've asked the manager on duty to provide us an additional parking space to park our newly purchased car. But, before I go ahead and proceed with anything, here is a little bit of a background story. As a tenant who lives in a 2 bed/bathroom unit, we were initially given 2 parking spaces when we first moved into this apartment. However, since we only had one car, the apartment manager, at the time, has asked us if they can spare one of our parking spaces to our neighbors who were in need of an additional space which we gladly let them use it without any compensation. (My parents and the manager, at the time, got along pretty well.) The manager has promised us (verbally) that we would get the space back whenever we would purchase an additional car and now with this new owner/management, they are not willing to give us another space which was something that we've originally had been granted.  I've spoken with the current apartment manager numerous times in regards to this matter and all I get from her is ""That was something that you have dealt with the previous management. There are no more spaces available and I can't give you additional parking lot for whatever reason."" I have friends and neighbors who live in a unit with 2 bed/bathrooms with 2 parking spaces (same apartment) and when I inquired about them having 2 spaces, the current manager said ""It all depends on how many cars you have."" The manager did not even care to say they would try or would get us a space when something becomes available and our family is very frustrated with this parking situation now. My little brother has been finding parking spaces on the street late at night after his work, walking great deal of a distance, after finding a space blocks away.  From the contract of ours with the apartment, the only section that mentions parking states: ***""Subject to the provisions of this Lease, the Tenant is entitled to the use of parking (the 'Parking') on or about the Premises. Only properly insured motor vehicles may be parked in the Tenant's space.""*** (As it doesn't specify how many parking spaces can be used, I don't know if I can use this statement to back up our request.)  I am about to write a formal request letter to the HQ of the management and try to explain the frustration of the current situation.  Are there anything that I can do to get our initially given space back?  Add: The previous manager who we dealt with has fled back to his country and is no longer available."	No
1969	This happened before states began to outlaw student teacher relationships even if the student was over the age of consent.  Essentially, when I was going through a rough time emotionally, I began receiving a lot of extra attention from a teacher. It started innocently and then progressed to emails, followed my phone calls, then texts, then flirting, some sexting and sending him pictures of me in skimpy negligees. When I graduated high school (he was still my teacher for a summer session) we began to go out on dates. He then came to my college to take control of the department I was majoring in and remained my teacher throughout college (we maintained a relationship during this time).   Now with all of the new legislation and scandals being unearthed (like the choate one) I'm wondering if I have an obligation to report this to someone (the school, his current employer which still has him around students all the time etc). I don't want to get him in trouble because I do still care about him and as far as I'm aware he didn't break any laws (except possession of child porn when I sent the negligee pics (if they count) but they are long gone from all of my electronic devices (this was before the cloud etc).   See the thing is, I don't know if what he did was wrong/ illegal. My therapist (when I was 17 and involved with him) told me to cut ties but never reported him. My guidance counselor at school knew because the man in question didn't have a drivers license so I drove him one on one to the practice he had at another school after ours was over and I once told my guidance counselor I may be late because of driving him and she said it was inappropriate but never followed up. I don't like thinking I was groomed or a victim (though he was emotionally abusive once he had me in the relationship).   I also have proof/know he did this with at least four other students.  So, if it happens in the future and I don't report it am I liable for what happens to any further students he becomes involved with?   Do I have a legal obligation to report it to the schools he works for?  I need to know if there's anything I need (or should) do from a legal standpoint.   I don't want to press charges (I can't he did nothing illegal with me) and I don't want to get him in trouble but I also don't want any other students to go through what I did and I what I know others did because of his narcissism (he's diagnosed) and emotional abuse.  Yes, I am in therapy for this and working through it and I know it's messed up that I care for him but I do. I just need to know what my legal obligations are.	No
1970	"Hi everyone!   I'm posting on behalf of my mother who is having some issues with her landlord and property manager.  My mother moved into a house this past spring in Colorado. The house hadn't been occupied in some time. Since she's moved in there has been multiple things going wrong with the house. Nothing minor. Issues listed below:  Her laundry room is in the basement. She's had recurring issues with tree roots growing into the plumbing. It recently caused overflow of sewage to build up and spill onto her laundry room floor. No permanent fix has been done and they ended up making her clean up the sewage. The owner refusef to fix this or pay anyone to do the clean up.   She has window wells for the basement windows. It's monsoon season in Colorado. We've gotten heavy rain and the window well leaked into the basement. The property manager has taken weeks to get it fixed.  Her upstairs shower leaks into the laundry room underneath. There is water damage to the beam on the laundry room ceiling because of this. She's worried the beams will continue to be soaked and more damage will result, weakening that beam. The owner again refuses to fix this leak.  The owner has asked the property manager to charge her a fee for ""frivolous maintenance requests"". That is in her lease, but it's also in her lease that the owner will have leaks fixed in a reasonable timeframe.  All the while, the owner of the house is complaining about some dead spots in the grass...while human feces was on the laundry room floor and now the support beams have water damage. #priorities  What can she do?  TL;DR My mom has had multiple major issues with her rental in Colorado. The owner refuses to fix all of them and wants to charge a fee for ""frivolous maintenance requests""."	No
1971	I'm living in Indiana. My girlfriend was on seekingarrangements and she met up with this investment banker who said he was making 500k a year and was going to pay her $500 to meet him at a hotel. At the hotel, she gets a bad feeling about him and says that never mind she doesn't want to go through with it. He hadn't paid her anything yet. He got all angry then saying she wasted his time and had to at least suck his dick. He was going to let her leave. So she pulled a gun on him and he was scared and gave her the money. She blocked him on seekingarrangement but he had her number so he texted her and found her address and facebook and is threatening to come over to her house and report her to the police and tell them that he robbed her. But really, can he even do that since what he was doing is against the law too.	No
1972	Seeking some legal advice as well as wondering what to expect for my case.   Im 23, and I was arrested when I was 18 for possession of a controlled substance (one Xanax, a felony) in the state of Florida. I made bail, and didn't show up for my court date. A year and a half later, I turned myself in and three months later was released on probation. I violated my probation a month later and moved across state lines out of fear of going back to jail. This was almost four years ago, and I feel like it's time to go home and deal with my problem. I was a different person back then, and since I've been gone, I've had zero encounters with police and have been a productive member of society, got married, and became a chef. I'm wondering what to expect..   Is my best option to get a lawyer? What is that gonna cost me? I have some money saved, but only around $1,000. Is that enough? I'm hoping since I've completely turned my life around and it's been four years that a lawyer could get it thrown out, or at least get me off with probation/little to no jail time. I support my wife and myself and she wouldn't be able to make ends meet without me around. What should I do? How effective would a lawyer be in my situation? This is my only legal trouble as an adult, I got in trouble when I was 16 but had it dismissed. Any advice is greatly appreciated.   Thanks!	No
1973	Hi guys. First time poster here. Family bought a house about 10 years ago. HOA have been hounding my parents for the previous owner's unpayed HOA fees. They are billing them more than 5,000 . Threatening to put a lean on the house. My family has been paying the HOA fees ever since we moved in to this house. They have tried to settle this long term ago, but management keeps changing and they are very untimely or never reply back. What are my recourses? What documents do I need? . I need to help them. I feel like we are being taken advantage of.	No
1974	I have been offered a job and part of the employment agreement includes a section that states that if I am terminated for cause or resign within the first year of employment I must reimburse the company $750, and $500 if its within the second year.  I believe this training is just on the job training, getting familiar with their system and specific technologies they are using, not a course through an educational institution. The section requires an initial, and it is the only section that requires an initial, so it stood out to me. I don't intend to quit the job but if it just doesn't work out I don't want to be penalized.   Thanks in advance	No
1975	I posted something on Facebook that apparently he is upset about. Is this a threat?  [this is what he said to me](https://imgur.com/gallery/a0LiP)	No
1976	"September of last year my roommate and I signed a lease for an apartment in Bloomfield. Communication with the landlord up to this time has been sparse to nonexistent (he has NEVER responded to a maintenance request and I still do not have a key to my mailbox after sending multiple inquiries), and additionally the apartment was damaged when we moved in (stains on carpet, peeling wallpaper, holes in window screen). Our lease runs until 1PM on August 30th.  In March he asked if we would be renewing our lease and, since we were both deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience, we told him we would be seeking housing elsewhere for the following year, and he began listing and showing the apartment.  We did not hear from him again until May 15th. He told us that he had sold the apartment to renters ""would like to get in earlier, perhaps as much as a month earlier"" (I'm quoting his email to me and my roommate directly). Neither of us had settled on housing yet (we were both actively looking for apartments, but, you know. It's Pittsburgh.) so both told him we couldn't give him a concrete move-out date and would let him know ASAP.  On June 6th, he talked to me in person and I gave him the same answer. He claims he also talked to my roommate, although my roommate cannot recall if this happened for sure. Late last month, my roommate and I had both signed leases for new apartments - the earliest possible move-in date for his August 3rd, mine August 5th. I emailed our landlord with these dates and asked if we could pay only a portion of the rent for August since we would be out in the first week. Much like every other email either of us has sent to him, we never heard a response.  Last week (July 6th), he sent an email demanding that we vacate the apartment entirely by August 1st, as the new renters would be moving in. Obviously this came as a shock to both of us. One of my family members is a lawyer, so I sent her a copy of my lease and screencaps of all relevant email communications with the landlord. She agreed that this was illegal, and sent my landlord an email telling him as much (but in formal legalese). I also got in touch with the renters and explained the situation - they told me they were as shocked as I was, because they didn't want to move in early; rather, the apartment had been *advertised* as being open August 1st, and they had not yet signed a lease. Lawyer relative advised me and my roommate not to have any further communication without her input.  Landlord calls me today angrily demanding an explanation. (As I said my lawyer relative advised I stop communicating, but) I told him what I'd already told him - that I couldn't be out any earlier than August 5th. He gave me the same ultimatum - that I had to be out by August 1st, or he would cut power and service to the apartment. Additionally he says he will keep our security deposit if we are not out.  tl;dr Shitty landlord is trying to force me and my roommate out 30 days before my lease ends; lawyer has confirmed this is illegal and told landlord so, but landlord persists.  These are my questions:  1. Should I be preparing to go to court? Lawyer is family, so she wrote the email to my landlord for free. Should I look into hiring a lawyer?  2. Is it legal for a landlord to retain a security deposit for reasons other than damage to the apartment?  3. If it is illegal for him to retain the deposit (as I said, there was damage to the apartment before we moved in, and I have no doubt he will blame us for it if he can), can I demand receipts from the landlord as proof that the security deposit went toward repairing the apartment?  (edited for formatting)"	No
1977	Florida, if it matters.  I'm helping my Ex with a suit against his HOA. They have not done by right by him or the community that's made his living conditions miserable for the last 5 years. I'm talking toilet water flooding in from upstairs, not repairing it correctly, mold and mildew, constant construction, unprofessional management, not overseeing renovations, and many many other things that are not part of my question. :)  What's the best way for us to prepare our evidence for you? These events took place throughout the 5 years. It will consist of mostly pictures, video, and emails with a few paragraphs explaining what happened.  I looked into some of the software that companies are marketing for you. But the ones that look good cost money for a one-off use and are desktop-only, no cloud or collaboration.  I believe the best method is organized by time and event with everything associated attached. However there is a lot of it and it's easy to get it confused. My first though was to make a Google Slides presentation for each event as it would be a way to easily present the information and can be exported into multiple or a single PDF.   How does that sound? What would you like from a client? I want to make this as easy and possible for the lawyer.	No
1978	"I purchased my home in May of 2017.  The seller was a real estate agent who had flipped the home.  He marketed the home as a ""remodel"" and that it had a ""new bathroom"" referring to the basement bathroom at issue.  I had the home inspected, and while many things came up which were addressed and negotiated, the basement bathroom plumbing was missed on the inspection and never came up.  After closing in May, I moved in the first week of July.  I immediately noticed a smell coming from my basement bathroom.  I assumed it was a dry p-trap and that some water just needed to be ran.  I did so.  Multiple times.  Days go by, smell does not go away.  I finally unscrew the drain cover and find that my PVC shower flange leads to a gap and then into a cast iron p-trap designed for a floor drain, not a shower.  Long story short, the contractor (seller/owner's business partner) added this shower on top of an existing floor drain and installed a ""fake"" shower drain which emptied directly into the old floor drain.  The old floor drain is now emitting sewer gas from a dislodged or rotten cleaning plug which can only be repaired by tearing up the shower and much of the bathroom floor tile and completely replumbed.  I've had it inspected by a licensed plumber and quoted at around $5,000.  Here's the kicker:  I signed a waiver under MN Law 513.60 which waives the sellers duty to disclose.  It does not prevent, however, fraud or ""negligent misrepresentation"" pursuant to 513.57 S3.  Do I have any hope against this flipper?  I've already been in contact with him through my buyer's RE agent and he basically denies liability.  Another question:  The plumber I had inspect the issue made clear that the work could not have been permitted because it didn't come close to meeting code (lacked a vent and other obvious problems).  Is there a government remedy for unpermitted work?  Especially by a non-resident owner looking to sell the home?  Does that give me leverage of any sort?  Finally, on the off chance my inspector has error and omission insurance, do I have a claim against him?  I did not sign a pre-inspection contract, and I paid $550 for the inspection.  The plumber I had inspect the issue said the lack of code meeting was absolutely obvious from the unfinished part of the basement where the bathroom wall is open from the rear.  Vented sink, vented toilet, no vent for the shower, and that should have thrown up red flags to the inspector.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I realize I may be stuck paying for another ""remodel.""  Just trying to see if I have any options.  Thanks in advance.  Quick note:  I am a personal injury attorney in Tennessee.  I know enough about property law to have passed the TN bar, and I know enough MN law to fit in a thimble.  TL;DR - Flipper sold me a house with unpermitted plumbing work that is now causing a major problem in the basement bathroom.  I waived the seller's disclosure requirement (somehow and stupidly), and now I'm wondering if I have a claim against the seller or the inspector who negligently missed the ""obvious"" code violations from the shower."	No
1979	"Hello everyone, please help me out.   My Mom needs to get her insurance done, so I need to report my earnings from Wendy's to her report. The last month I worked at Wendy's was January 2017. Recently, I called and they gave me this site to go to which is called netsecure.adp. This is the site that shows all the times they paid me, and I need it to show it to the insurance people. I put in all my information and when I click ""enter"" it says my account is ""locked"". So I call back my Wendy's place and ask the guy if he can help me. I say, ""Can I have a number to talk to? What can I do to fix this? I really need this for my insurance."" He doesn't give me a number to talk to at all. He says I'm locked out my account because I don't work there anymore. I told him I really need it for my insurance, in which he replies ""I don't care"" with a chuckle. Please, someone help me out. I have contacted the store manager last week but she has not gotten back to me!!!!   Thanks everyone!"	No
1980	"I know someone who complains about their situation a bit, but I do not think they have actually gone to a lawyer about it, so I thought I would google a bit. I can see why they feel hopeless. I have no background in law or ethics, so I thought I would ask your advice. I am hoping that people can educate me so I do not voice stupid brainstorming ideas when it comes up in conversation. It seems like SURELY something can be done, but I ask dumb questions like ""Did you ever consider ___"" and I feel bad. For what it is worth they have owned the property for 10+ years and each live in one half. With a recent career change, it is impossible to pay the mortgage not to mention maintain the 100 year old property.  Advice I saw online: *Convert duplex to condos (not sure the point of this, plus how?). *Convert to tenants in common (how exactly? by converting to a condo?). *Stop paying the mortgage and either the other party will be more interested in buying him out for $0 or it will go into foreclosure. This just sounds like the natural course of things when you do not have enough money to pay your bills. *Even if the other party were willing to buy out for $0, they do not want to and they may not qualify for the mortgage on their own. *Call mortgage company directly and ask what options are, maybe the other person will not need to refinance making it more appealing (but it does not sound like it matters because they do not want to give up on their failed plans). *File a Petition to Partition (which requires talking to a lawyer). *Bankruptcy (sounds like it might ruin both lives). *One of them dies.  Of all these hoping for a tornado sounds best, or maybe a strong fracking earthquake. I know I have hoped for those when dealing with an upside down mortgage in probate.  Thank you for your opinions in advance."	No
1981	"Hello,   My roommate and I put down a $3500 deposit for an apartment a few days ago. As per the process, you pay a deposit equivalent to a month's rent so the apartment goes off-market while they review your application (income, credit). The deposit will be given back to us if they deny our application, but otherwise it will go towards rent.   It was advertised as a 2 bedroom, but room in the apartment it is in the basement. The basement has no windows. The tenant who showed it to us seemed to have no issues with it.   The realty company sent us a lease after we made the deposit, but I didn't read it till today. It says that using the basement space for sleeping is prohibited, and any breach of this and associated fines will be billed to/put on tenant. We didn't know this, but now we have made this deposit and will likely be approved on Tuesday. We can't get our money back, and we're not rolling in cash.   http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/important-safety-issues-illegal-basement-cellar-conversions.page  I found the above link, but it seems to just talk about full basement apartment not a partial one. It seems to be common in NYC to have basement rooms, but I'm concerned of what charges we are risking and can't really find anything online. Also, the people I know in NYC and ask for advice have shrugged off the problem given it's close to Union Square/East Village, roof space, and other amenities. ""That's New York,"" they say.   I'm not sure what I'm asking, but what legal liabilities I would face as a renter that should worry me? Like if the NYC government charged the landlord, they would just bill me? What would the landlord be charged?"	No
1982	"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	No
1983	so I recently signed a year lease on an apartment in Albuquerque, New Mexico  it came with a single phone jack in the wall, so I thought nothing of this at the time. I had Century Link come in today to connect my internet, but now I'm finding there's no phone lines running to this building anywhere!   CentruyLink needs $99 to wire my apartment, plus landlord approval to drill holes etc.   my question is this: am I responsible for paying for this or is the landlord responsible? I read somewhere that having found a phone jack before I moved in is in my favor. My lease also says that the owner is responsible for maintenance of fixtures. I feel like this is a whole lot of grey area, any help would be greatly appreciated!	No
1984	"Hey everybody,  my friend and I are both minors who recently went fishing on a golf corse with no ""no fishing"" or ""private property"" signs. It was pretty late and there only about 5 golfers out.  We were minding our own business, walking through the rough area surrounded by trees and carrying our fishing poles when we were approached by 3 golfers. One brought a golf club with him and told us it was private property and fishing was illegal. The other guy was a little more intense and calling us names.   We said there were was no sign and we've been up here several times. We also asked if they worked there, to which they denied. We wouldn't budge and tried to walk away when Golfer 2 grabbed my friend by the back of his shirt and threatened him to leave. Before things got ugly, we dipped out.  What can we do about this? I managed to get a decent picture of the guy as I was walking away."	No
1985	"Hi Reddit,   I live in Ontario Canada and am moving into the hosue that my BF and his ex wife own. They cannot sell due to market conditions so he has taken on all expenses.   She's insisting I sign a lease agreement outlining its month-to-month. Is this a bad move? My BF and her will be the ""landlord"" and I will be the tenant.

1986	"I just moved into an apartment in Michigan. When I was shown the apartment I noticed there were two AC units, I would not have selected an apartment without AC. Upon moving in neither units are working. One is an electrical problem with the wiring, the other just doesn't make cold air.   Upon talking to the property management they said they would try and repair the units but will not replace them if they are broken and can't be repaired. They said they don't have to as the lease says that AC is not included. The lease says the landlord must maintain the premises and all appliances (without listing which ones are included) and then under a section labeled ""Other Restrictions"" it says ""No Air Conditioners"" listed alongside other things such as ""No pets"", ""No washer/dryer"" and ""No waterbeds"". Obviously I interpreted this to mean no installing or bringing in your own AC unit as I already knew there was AC in the apartment. However they are claiming this means they don't have to replace it.   I'm waiting to see if it can be fixed before making a fuss but I want to know whether or not they legally do not have replace the unit. It's hot and it's frustrating as it just seems like they are trying to weasel their way out of spending the money."	No
1987	"I'll try to make this short.  About a year ago, I, a minor, signed an NDA with an online tech startup based out of California. I cosigned with my parent(s) to do so. I signed my NDA under the presumption that I would be doing work, and getting paid for said work; where the latter was false. It worked out swell for a few months, but my boss started to miss paychecks -- skipping entire months of pay saying that I didn't deserve it because I was ""useless"" and so on. Just a few days ago, a direct competitor offered me a job with them and I decided that I was done with the B.S. that my boss was throwing at me, so I put in my two weeks notice saying that I was going to explore my options at other companies. Instead of working my two weeks, my access was fully removed across all platforms and he told me that in no uncertain terms, he would be suing me if I were to join a competitor. As for what, specifically, he has eluded to the doctrine of ""inevitable disclosure"". Now, I've done my fair share of homework, and there are no clauses in my NDA that prevent me from leaving him and joining a competitor. There are clauses that refer to him being able to apply for an injunction to stop me from revealing his CI in whole or in part, but that's only under the presumption that I have revealed his CI or have threatened to reveal it (which I have done neither).  I've been talking to my parents, and they think that he, for lack of a better way to say it, can't do anything. I'm not joining the competitor to reveal his CI, I'm joining the competitor because they treat me better and pay me more. I never signed a working agreement or contract with him, and it's safe to say that the entirety of the pay that I earned with him was under-the-table. Whenever I alluded to me being his employee (prior this entire ordeal), he'd be very quick to remind me that I am in fact only an 'independent contractor', and not his employee. I don't know if that's relevant to this question, but I thought it may be.  So my question, to you, is the following: What are my options? I have several offers from competitors, offers that I very much want to take, but he's saying if I take any of them w/out his prior written approval (exemption in writing), he'll file suit. Keep in mind, I am a minor from Canada, and he is an adult from California. I am afraid that if I take an offer from a competitor, he will file suit and I'll have to deal with that accordingly. He does have my address, so he can serve me papers (excuse my naivety for the legal process, I'm by no means an expert). My parents think that I am fine, and I can take an offer from the competitor. They've also said (paraphrasing): ""what is he going to do? Extradite you?"", in response to my fears of being sued. They think that if he files suit, I can simply ignore it and let it drift in the water, because what can he do? I'm a minor from Canada, and I haven't even broken his agreement.  Sorry if this post got a little long. I hope I included all relevant details. If you have any questions that I can clarify/expound upon please don't hesitate to ask."	No
1988	So basically, I will be moving in Sept, I signed a lease probably 2 months ago with a landlord and one of my roommates. We completed the paperwork but when she asked for the deposit, we had cash. She said they wouldn't accept cash and only check, since I work a Monday-Fri all day, I wasn't able to get the check to her that day and we would have to schedule for another day. She said that would be fine and to call her in regards to scheduling an appointment to give her the deposit. It's been about a month now and she has not responded to my calls, voicemails, or emails as well as my roommates. The website still gives the same contact info, and we can't reach anybody at management. I'm starting to get worried since again I have to move out in less than a month and I'm not sure where that puts me. We didn't get any of the copy paperwork since she said we would get it once we gave her the deposit. Is there anything I can do or should I start looking for a new place? Thank you!	No
1989	"My 3 roommates and I just moved into a new house. Let's call my them Aaron, Adam, and Matt.   Aaron and Adam found the house. It fit all the criteria and after seeing the place with the landlord they told her that we're 4 room mates. She didn't like this and said the house is for 3 people to live in. It's practically 4 bedroom and 1500 square feet so it made no sense. They said okay thanks but we will keep looking.   Later the landlord calls back Aaron and they talk more about the 4 room mate situation. Aaron tells the landlord that Matt is just a guest and not really a ""roommate"". This part was true. He moved in with us at our old house and was staying as a guest but it looked like he'd move in full time (as the new house was bigger). Lease is signed. Three of us signed the lease (not including Matt).   After moving in this weekend the land lord is saying that she wants a written document with the guest's SSN &amp; the exact date he will leave with all of us signing it. If we fail to do so she said she will use it as grounds to evict. No where on the lease does it say anything about 4 people not being allowed to live in the house. Quite honestly two of the bedrooms are big enough for 2 people to share (for a total of 6). No idea why she's doing this. I should mention that one of the bedrooms is actually a family room but has a separate door and is private. It can be used as a bedroom. She verbally expressed to Aaron and Adam when they were looking at the house that she wouldn't like it to be used as a bedroom. Does she even get a say in this? I'll sleep in the kitchen and cook in the bathroom if I want can't I?  I'm not in love with the house but moving is such a hassle that I do not want to deal with it again. What should we do? Should we write up a document as she requested? Or just not contact her? Is she allowed to come and inspect to see who's living where and how many people? Any help is appreciated!"	No
1990	Nyc here.   I painted my cabinets in my nyc apartment. My super off the books told me that they were renovating the studio into a one bedroom after our tenancy was up, and not to worry about it as they were gutting the place. This is my fault, I know this and I accept this.   These cabinets are clearly quite old, although I'm sure they had many years left. I made sure that the paint was easily able to be scraped away, (not relevant I'm sure).   How much can the landlord charge for these damages? Can they charge for a complete set of new cabinet doors? I've found a source that says that cabinets last 50+ years. If these cabinets were, say, 30 years old, wouldn't the value depreciate?  Thanks for the advice!	No
1991	I was moving into a new apartment building and received an email from management that due to delays in building, I will not be able to move in September 1st as per my lease. Obviously this is frustrating considering not only does one expect a unit when you sign a lease, but they also only gave 1 month's notice when I signed the lease about 6 months ago.  They offered two remedies:  1) Break the lease free of consequence and not live there  2) Move in January 1st and receive $1,500  Luckily, I can stay with my parents who live nearby if I have to so I'm not homeless. The situation seems ridiculous.   Am I owed more than this by the management company? $1,500 is just slightly more than one month's rent and this is a massive inconvenience. Per the lease, if I had been living there and moved out prior to the terms of the lease, I would have owed two months rent, but they're not even offering that. The lease obviously says nothing about them not holding it up, but I'm assuming there's some kind of renter's rights.	No
1992	I am purchasing a new home in Georgia and currently reside in Maryland. I will be doing a mail away closing.

Or can I simply have them witnessed and notarized and then sent to the attorney? Thank you for your help.	No
1993	Back in March, T-Mobile had a promotion where you could add another line to your account completely for free. Naturally, I got on it along with my mom, to be added to my sister's account.   Before this, I had an iPhone 5S, and my mom had a flip phone from TracFone. When we switched to T-Mobile, I received an SE and gave my 5S to my mom. We also got new SIM cards. My mom's number changed back in almost minutes, but my number didn't change. It turned into days, weeks, and now months.   We've tried everything to get my original number back, but it seems that either TracFone or T-Mobile is just refusing. Is there any legal action I can take to demand they give me back my number?	No
1994	Throwaway account. I am a fully insured driver, was driving to church (honestly) this morning and went to make a right turn. There is a bicycle lane on the road I was turning off of. No light at the intersection, it is a suburban area. I passed the bike rider on my right, and went to make a right turn. There was enough time that if I continued my turn without stopping, I would have been gone before the bicyclist got to the intersection.  As I was turning, there was a female waiting to cross, so I stopped and waved her across the intersection. I was stopped in the bike lane while she crossed, and as she was about halfway across the bicyclist hit me in the rear. He immediately said that I hit him, but I don't think that's in dispute since the lady crossing gave a statement that she saw me wave her across and I was stopped when the guy hit me. He got up and walked to the side walk but said his shoulder was hurting. He thinks he hurt his clavicle, but refused an ambulance trip to the ER.  Cops came and took statements, they gave me a ticket for failing to yield the right of way to the cyclist. I am going to fight it in court because I feel I was yielding the right of way to the pedestrian. I also feel that since the guy hit me when I was stopped, he should be at fault for not stopping or avoiding me as I think there was enough time (he hit me in the rear, not the side, so I didnt cut him off with no chance to react). Is there grounds to fight the ticket? If the insurance companies get involved and he tried to sue me for damages, am I already going to be liable since the cops gave me a ticket? Any advice welcome.	No
1995	Our original move in date was August 4. We signed a lease for this. The lease was then voided and we resigned the most current lease to move in on August 1. We went in this morning to get our keys and discussed the money that was due. We wrote them a check for the money due and started moving in. Now they are emailing us and saying that what they accidentally charged us was the prorated rate as if we moved in on August 4, and that we owe them a little over $100 to cover August 1 to August 4. Are we responsible for their accounting error? Thanks!	No
1996	A couple months ago my friend's car was towed. There was another car, same make and model, in the lot which the tower had a lien for. He sold the lien to my friend for cheap (waived the towing/storage fees because they just wanted to make room in the lot) and towed it to his house since it doesn't run well/have a key.  My friend planned to register the car as non-op and use it for parts but found out at the DMV that it's got $700 in fees and can't be registered non-op until the renewal date which is in a few months. To claim the lien (or whatever proper terminology is here) he needs to get the car to pass smog and pay those fees so he decided to temporarily hold off on the registration.  So he's in this catch: can't register the car as non-op yet but there's no way to pass smog with it not running. Can't scrap it because it's not in his name until renewal date. Also the DMV fees are steep and un-anticipated.  Currently, he'd like to swap out a couple parts on the car and be rid of it if possible (and hopefully without huge expense). Any suggestions to this end are appreciated. A few questions: Since the sale isn't recorded with the DMV is it legit? Does the towing company still own the car technically and is there any way to void the sale? Is there a way to junk the car before the renewal date? Is there any way around DMV fees and this catch with the registration?  Thanks in advance for any advice or info!   tl;dr: bought lien of non-running parts-car, hit with fees and a catch with DMV registration, haven’t registered yet, trying to smoothly and legally exit situation	No
1997	"This is in California, USA.   Some of my friends are international students starting school this semester. They found a vacancy (while they are still abroad) and asked me to check if the place matches the floor plan. I went in about two weeks ago, and they couldn't show me the apartment because the it was still occupied by the previous tenants. Due to time constraints, my friends they signed the lease even though no one physically saw the apartment. The lease began on Aug 3. First month's rent, security deposit and other fees have been paid for.   Later, we have another mutual friend check out the apartment. He sends us a video of the walk through. This does not match the floor plan. We demand an exact floor plan, and they provide one. Even that doesn't match. So, they had to agree to rent a different apartment since the classes are starting soon.   One of my friends finally was in the US and we visited the office today. They showed us a new apartment. It was good and they decided to rent the new one, even though it's a bit pricier. Now they slap us with a $500 transfer fee, refund the first month's rent - less the prorated amount for the day of Aug 3 through 9th (~$600). No one moved in yet. The decision to NOT take the older and smaller apartment happened on the 6th of August.   When we confronted that the change was not our choice, but because they lied about the square footage, floor plan and the layout. When this was brought up, they showed the fine print in the lease agreement saying the floor plan would be ""similar, not identical"". We all knew to expect some variance, but it was advertised to be 600+ sq.ft, while it was barely 500 sq.ft in reality. The locations of the doors relative to the walls was not even close. The dimensions are no where near to be called ""close enough"".   How is this legal? What can we do to avoid the fees? The newer apartment is good and they (my friends) want to take it. They also don't want to lose the money (just over $1100) because the real estate agency screwed up. How should we proceed?"	No
1998	Back in December I had a load of expensive books stolen from me and then sold to a used book store. Because they were unique I was able to find them and call the cops, the cops recovered the books and held them for evidence. A few months later they caught the person that stole the books, but it was a different persons that sold them. The Thief was caught with a stolen vehicle  that was stolen from the same parking lot the same night, and the person that sold the books admits to receiving them from the Thief and selling them, thinking that they were legit. (Even though there is no way the Thief plays D&amp;D)   Fast forward to today. The Thief is in jail, and will be for a while, the person that sold the books did not get charged, and I am being told I need to reimburse that business that bought my books.   Is this normal for Nebraska? Is this legal? Should I pay and then take the person that sold them to Small Claims Court?	No

2001	Hi Reddit,  Moving out question about my fridge and annoying roommate. So I am moving out of my 3 bdrm apartment in Indiana when lease ends, July 31 and have utilities set to disconnect then. I and one roomate are moving out, but the third roomate renewed lease and found two new roomates.  She is in a different country for the month, and I believe has not set up utilities after I have told her she needs an account. I emailed management, and they told me she does need an energy account to start Aug 1.  I am worried about leaving the fridge plugged in for a month, which management has told me to do. No one will move into the apartment until August 20, though the lease starts Aug 1. She has a ton of food in there which will spoil if she does not have electricity. I do not want to get charged for damage/rot if she does not set up electricity...I would rather just chuck her food but I'm not sure if I will get in trouble.  I feel it is not my responsibility to make sure she sets up an account.  What should I legally do ?  TL;DR unsure about leaving fridge plugged in when roomate not setting up utilities	No
2002	Our HOA is pursuing a lawsuit against the declarant of our building. The building is an old industrial warehouse/mill that was converted in loft condominiums. Evidently, the municipality inspected the entire building and overlooked several violations, huge structural problems with one facade and the roof. Certificates of occupancy were issued for each individual unit, but not the entire building. Somehow, construction proceeded. Years later, our HOA decided to sue the declarant for failing to remedy these structural issues, seeking funding for repairs. The problem is this: condo fees have increased by 200% in five years, as our HOA continues to levy assessments and fee increases to pay escalating legal costs. We have no transparency or visibility into the status of the case, we are all expected to continue coughing up money to fund an endless lawsuit with no guarantee of success. Potential buyers/investors have been turned away by the excessive condo fees, we have this feedback in writing from our realtor. Additionally, no lender will fund a mortgage for any unit within our building due to the litigation. Homeowners are trapped here, we cannot sell, and the constant fee increases without commensurate added value erodes our competitive advantage. Neighboring communities charge 1/2 our condo fee rate and offer twice the amenities (pool, landscaping, gym, tennis courts, etc). We have hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity, locked away due to the decisions of our HOA. I'll never buy another place in a HOA for as long as I live.	No
2003	I live in Washington state and am having issues with a neighbor. She isn't a nice lady and does what she wants.  So to the issues my house is up on a hill and over looks a pasture and from there the mountains. The issue is my property has a set of covenants where as the property she bought the pasture does not, and when she bought it she had it zoned for residential.  She built her house on the top corner blocking part of the view and a 2 story at that, my ccrs states no more than a story and a half. We have sense got over that but now the kicker she has planted arbavita bushes all along the fence line and in a couple years the view will be completely gone.  So my question is there anything I can do based off of my ccrs or am I sol and just going to have to learn to love the green bush view? Thank you in advance!	No
2004	I recently switched jobs but when I received my last paycheck none of my vacation hours were on it. I assumed, since I've always been paid for my vacation time when I leave a job, that they were supposed to pay for the vacation time I earned. After searching google I found some sites saying that I'm owed and others that says it's up to the company. Does anyone know what the laws are about these things? This happened in Arkansas if that's relevant.	No
2005	"Back in April my ex and I split up shortly after signing a lease together.  I offered her a very reasonable deal to her to pay another month of rent and half a rental credit we received to sign the lease and I would willingly let her out of the lease.  Instead of accepting, she filed a bogus protection order against me in which the worst thing that was insinuated was ""me throwing a drink at her"" and a very vague short description of me one time ""pushing her down"" which never happened. She also claimed she was scared of me cause I have guns (but have never threatened her, i'm just a lawful gun owner).   The judge determined that there was not enough to grant a protection order but instead gave a temporary extension of 90 days to the temporary order (the one that is granted no matter what just by simply filing an order , as a means of precaution).The reason the judge did this was simply because I own a gun, and she used that as a reason to extend the order to keep me away from her. I have no criminal history whatsoever and ironically, my ex has a domestic violence charge against her.  So it's almost been 90 days, she moved almost all her stuff out 2 months ago while I willingly vacated the apartment for a week for her to get her things (which was totally unneccesary. she was dragging her feet and refusing to get her things).  Now I receive a call from my landlord that she is ""excercising her rights to withdraw from the lease under the domestic violence landlord and tenant act"" in wa state. She states I must pay another deposit since apparently my ex was refunded the initial one (which I paid).  Do I have any recourse here or did she just , in my opinion, completely manipulate the law to get out of her legal obligation? I read through the RCW and maybe I'm just angry and not able to focus but It seems as though she can jsut leave, consequence free, even though protection order was not granted."	No
2006	I'm currently in the process of trying to move out of mind and my ex's shared apartment. We both sighed the lease together.   A few days ago he went behind my back and talked to the landlord without me even though I told him a wanted to be there with him, but he refused to let me come.   He lied and told me he was able to take me off the lease. But then I realized that's probably not even possible considering I didn't sign anything and I wasn't made aware of even being taken off and I haven't spoken directly to the landlord at anytime.  He tried to kick me out yesterday because it's the beginning of of the month. He told me I should go sleep in a hotel or in the park.  He threatened to bring his parents over to come talk to me.  He also threatened to call the police for trespassing (Even though I'm still on the lease) and I told him he could because I don't think I did anything wrong here.   I moved to the other side of Canada to come live with him so my family's not here.   I want to know if he could try to get in trouble for me leaving and still being on the lease in the future. This whole thing seems really shady on his behalf.	No
2007	"Hello, here is my situation.   I was at a public beach on the 4th of July in Massachusetts. I was drinking with friends, and we noticed a few cops had appeared on the beach. Naturally, we shied away from said cops as we were already away from our stuff. One of our group members was not with us, and she was near all of the bags, especially mine. She was apparently questioned about the alcohol and such, and they dumped beers out of my bag. They did not stop at the beers, and searched through my entire bag, finding my wallet. They then searched my wallet and found my fake ID. I returned a few minutes later after the police had left, and was told all of this by the friend who had been questioned. Now, a week later, I receive a notice in the mail calling upon me to appear at a hearing in august to defend myself against these charges. The charges were being in possession of a fake ID, and some miscellanious charge that is specific to my municipality and that I figure I need to call in to ask for it to be identified. Was it legal for them to search my wallet? I was under the impression that police require consent or a warrant to search someone's property. I was not even present and therefore not complicit with their search.   To add to all of this, I turned 21 on the 5th......... and although that does not take away from the legal implications of this charge, there is an added ""fuck you"" factor because of that fact."	No
2008	"Long story short, my roommate lost his job a few months ago and I haven't been able to afford the rent. We have been saving all of the money we can for rent for the three months but still came up short around 1500.00$ (have around 2000.00 saved). The apartment complex would not take the partial payment (per our lease agreement) and evicted. I returned to the apartment from being away for the weekend, and the locks had been changed. The bedroom window was unlocked so I went through there. All of my tv's, musical equipment, instruments, and most of my furniture is gone. I contacted the office and apparently the items were ""most likely"" placed on the curb outside, where all of my belongings have now disappeared. Aside from the legal proceedings that will be had for defaulting on my lease, is there any legal recourse/compensation for my, now missing, property? Thank you"	No
2009	"So I'm apartment hunting in MA, specifically Boston, and I have a place almost locked down right now but I need a cosigner. The lease has joint and several liability so my cosigner (father) would be responsible for any or all of my 3 roommates should they trash the apartment or refuse to pay rent. My dad is refusing to cosign because of these provisions, but several people have told me that it's basically impossible to find a lease in Boston as a student without them. Is this a thing? I'm 21, so every level of a legal adult, but I've never had my own apartment or worked full time for longer than a summer. He's willing to cosign for my portion of the rent only, but the realty company told me that they can't get rid of the joint liability because it's ""a legal issue."" Thanks!"	No
2010	"The lease goes from August 1st until July 31st of next year.  The management company said the earliest possible move in date is August 15th due to ""renovations"" which are not mentioned in the lease. They are also still charging a full month's rent for August. When asked, they gave a nonsensical response that effectively said ""we don't pro-rate rent.""   From what I can tell, Indiana law prevents the management company from denying access to the property but doesn't proclude ""upkeep"" (obviously). So, maybe they can't lock me out, but can they render it unusable in practice through renovation for 2 weeks?  TL;DR - title, basically. Seems like the company is trying to have it both ways. Can they charge rent but while doing renovations and prevent me from using it?"	No

2012	I am in the middle of FAFSA, and was about to sign the Master Promissory Note. I filed my FAFSA with my own permanent address. However, when about to sign the Master Promissory Note, I noticed that the pre-filled address is not mine. I have never seen this address in my life. I am assuming that fafsa.ed.gov and studentloans.gov would only have an address if it was given to them before, possibly for a loan? Am I being unnecessarily paranoid?  The Driver's License number is genuinely my own.  I am currently studying postgraduate in the UK and I am not at home in America.  And although this is not concrete, I guess it's worth mentioning that I have been having that intuitive gut feeling that my identity could be stolen. Random intrusive-like thoughts based on nothing.  What the fuck do I do? I don't even know where to begin.  http://imgur.com/VZWT61v	No
2013	There’s a t-shirt company we order from frequently, and back over a year ago they accidentally shipped us 2500 worth of merch in packages with our company name. Products we did not order. We called them to tell them we received some merch in error, and they said they would send someone to pick it up.   Fast forward a few months and long story short, no one ever came to get it, after some fussing back and forth with them about why we weren’t going to be able to drop the merch off at their nearest location (30 mins away), we received an email that said they would send a carrier to get it, and that the carrier would provide their own labels so there was no need to print one off. Stuck them on the porch, came home the next day, they were gone. (We never have problems with things being stolen at that location).   Now six months later, they are saying they never received them back. The carrier never left any kind of notice of pick up on the porch of any kind of info, but they don’t usually do that’s anyways.  They are asking for the tracking info, but we were never provided that. They are saying if we can’t provide it or proof of delivery, then we will be charged for the products.   Remember, we didn’t order these. They were shipped to the wrong place, with our name on the boxes. We were never given any tracking info. I told her that whoever initiated the pick up should have the tracking information, but she said it didn’t work like that. It’s all just a bunch of bullshit, I really want to just say f it.    Is there any kind of legal precedence for saying businesses cant just send you shit and say you owe for it unless you can prove you sent it back?	No
2014	I stopped at a stop sign and checked to see if there was any incoming traffic from the left. After checking, i proceeded to turn right but then I saw a person in front my car, crossing the street. So I quickly pulled over my brake and the person saw me coming at her and she quickly back paddled. Then she walked over to the driver's seat and when I pulled over my window to ask if she was alright, she said she WASN'T alright and asked for my information. So i gave her my phone number and my name and she just walked away after verifying my phone number... She was not on the ground, and from my perspective at the time, the only contact that my car had with her was with her hand at the front hood of my car trying to maybe.. prevent the car from lunging at her?   Is there any charges that I can get from this incident?  I am residing in Washington State.	No
2015	"Rental tenancy dispute over flood damages caused by faulty toilet that clogged and overflowed.  A close friend of mine was renting a downtown vancouver high rise apartment. She lost her job 6 months ago and had to move out since she couldn't make rent.   The landlord - a property development company that owns the entire building - told her that she could not break the lease. She looked for subtenants and found one. Subtenant was approved by the landlord.  The subtenant didn't know if she wanted to stay longer than a month.  But after the month, she really liked the place and decided to stay till the end of my friend's lease - which was the end of last month. My friend didn't have this extension approved by the landlord. They thought she was only staying for a month. (More on this later)  Two weeks before the lease came to a close, the toilet had clogged and flooded. Apparently, the subtenant had flushed the toilet and went to bed. But the toilet tank flapper valve was stuck open and by perfect fucking coincidence, managed to also to be clogged on the drain end.  Water flowing in. Water not draining out. The toilet bowl floods all night. Subtenant wakes up next morning and discovers the water under her feet. She starts putting down towels and attempts to unclog the toilet drain.   Neighbors notify the landlord at this point. They walk in with their emergency repair crews and start ripping out the flooring.  The property manger takes down a statement from the subtenant. The subtenant apparently told her that toilet was always faulty. That it had overflowed and flooded twice prior to this incident. But in those cases, she was able to plunge the toilet out and fix the issue herself. So she didn't think it was necessary to notify my friend or the actual landlord. She fixed the issues herself.  My friend and I were on a business trip far away at the time. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a hold of the subtenant. She was notoriously hard to get a hold of even before. She's an international student with some difficulty with English. At this point, she saw the condition of the suite with the floors ripped out and went and stayed in a hotel. That weekend she went back home to Taiwan.  Landlord is now claiming that my friend is reponsible for the entire damage since the flood was caused by the negligence of the subtenant. Since the toilet had clogged twice before, she should have notified either my friend or the landlord directly and made sure that there was nothing wrong with it. The damages are some $60k since the water went 4 stories down. I find this extremely hard to believe since the pictures the landlord showed us as proof very clearly shows the water didn't even go 6 feet outside the bathroom door.  My friend does not have any form of rental insurance. She is not in a great financial position to pay for this claim. She's a wreck at the moment. She has been living at home the last 6 months with her parents. Her dad is the guarantor on her lease. And now she's terrified that the landlord would go after her dad and force a sale on their house. They're not financially well off either, with major credit lines already racked up. So she's not in a productive state of mind at the moment. I am helping her out by scheduling meetings with lawyers etc.  So far, we've met 3 lawyers. Each have their own position on this.   Lawyer #1: The least sharp professional I've come across. I genuinely thought she was hungover when she met us. She kept insisting that 11:57 AM - which is when the emergency repair crews went into the apartment was in the middle of the night and not almost noon. Even after I pointed this out, she kept saying that no reasonable person would expect the subtenant to be awake ""so late in the night."" She said we had a 50-50 chance nevertheless. She wasn't clear on what is expected from a reasonable person in this situation. Buying a plunger and fixing the clogs herself is not enough to be not negligent? Or was her responsibility very clearly to notify the landlord about this issue that she already fixed herself?  Lawyer #2: He was super-optimistic. We walked out of there and my friend actually was happy enough to respond to a high-5 I gave her. He said we're going to delegate responsibility for this damage on to the subtenant. Since she is in Taiwan now, the landlord will have a hard time going after her. What we needed to prove was that the landlord understood and knew very well that the subtenant was executing the remainder of the lease and not my friend. Unfortuntely, the landlord explicitly stated in an email that when the walked in to do emergency repairs, they had no idea who the person living there was. Later, she responded by saying that she was the subtenant they had approved 6 months ago. But they had only approved her sublease for 1 month as part of her original plan. True. My friend failed to inform the landlord that the subtenant wanted to extend.  What would it take to delegate responsibility towards the subtenant? How can my friend walk away from this and point the finger at this subtenant? I am not sure if it's that feasible. Moreover, I think this lawyer was trying to make a quick sale and lock in the retainer (We paid him at the end of the consult for the retainer). He was super confident that we were going to win. He later emails us asking for basic things like the tenancy agreement. So not inspiring confidence here.  Lawyer #3: This was probably the only person we met who was telling us the full truth as it is. He straight up said we were going to lose on the negligence part. It will be found that the subtenant was indeed negligent. He suggested we ask the landlord for proof that the damages were actually the amounts they claim they are. I suggested the idea of offloading responsibility on the subtenant. He said that wouldn't go so well simply because the plaintiffs already know she's gone home to Taiwan and it would be very hard to get a hold of her, especially not worth it for this sum of money. Makes perfect sense. Why would they not fight with all they have to make sure the cross-hairs are on my friend and her dad.  This happened today. Confused on who to go with. Never hired lawyers before. L3 is expensive. I felt he was too professional and that he would only stick to the absolute proper and morally correct ways of doing things. L2 seemed like he was a conman trying to convince us that we would win easily. Could it be he can play his charm trick on the judge as well and it would work? He is talking about filing a harassement suit against the landlord's lawyer who is calling my friends dad pretty much every day now. If we are going to be found responsible for this if it goes to trial - maybe the strategy we need to apply would be to roadblock them on every single step of the way and make their lives as hard as possible so they won't even go through the effort?   L1 was garbage.   L2 is super sharp and honestly an extremely effective salesman. He is incredibly effective at producing convincing arguments. And not without supporting evidence and case citations, etc. L2 is young, inexperienced (2 years) and works for a no-name law firm in the middle of nowhere.  L3 is very straightforward and honest. I don't know if he is going to exhaust every possible loophole and sink to the level of doing whatever it takes (as long as it is legal, I dont care about morality or appearing to be an asshole). I didn't get the feeling that he is ready to do this. But he's more experienced in litigation cases. He is also part of a prestigious law firm in the region.  Any obvious things I am missing here? Any obvious choice?  There is a 3rd option. The landlord's lawyer spoke to me over the phone. He wanted to get a hold of my friend's dad. But I picked up and blocked it. He did mention that he wanted to see if there was a way to resolve this issue ""in good faith"" instead of resorting to measures that are irreversible. While I am not on the lease or related to my friend, I do have a substantial savings accumulated up over the years. Maybe just calling this lawyer who wants to talk and having a conversation with him directly would help resolve this quickly? My friend, her mom and her dad are all terrified and simply unable to be productive in any capacity since there is the real threat that their house is going away on top of their already exising problem of criping debt.   They want ~$60k for all sort of damage to the suite and to 10 other suites across 4 stories. Most of that is inflated bullshit, I am convinced. They've never provided an invoice or any sort of evidence of substantial damage in the emails. Would there be a reason why they would have all this evidence and not show it up front when they make their claims? My gut feel tells me if I personally write them a cheque for $15k, I can tell them to fuck off forever. Plausible or am I on crack?  Need some advice. Apologies if this is a giant wall of text."	No
2016	"The company that owns my apartment complex decided to do a full patio repair on the patio above me. We got a letter saying the construction would last from March 3rd until March 23rd. The crew came on March 3rd, tore out the balcony, set up large wooden cross braces through the middle of my balcony to support it, covered all of my stuff in dust and wood shavings and pushed it into a corner.    After that, the crew never came back. Everything was left as it is. I contacted my property manager multiple times a month since the end of March, each time being told that there were ""higher priority repairs"" and that he would get to it as soon as he could. The last time I spoke with him (June 25th) he said he has a crew scheduled to come out July 5th and finally fix it. It is July 12th and no one has come out.    I haven't had access to my balcony that I am paying for since March 3rd, which is over 5 months. Am I entitled to compensation or a rent reduction?"	No
2017	Knowing my family, they wouldn't respect my last wishes. So I'm wondering if, legally, there's a way to make sure I don't have a funeral when I die? Maybe leaving a will? If so, how would I go about doing that and what would be the cheapest option?  Even $100 would be difficult for me to come up with.	No
2018	"So it's basically as the title says. My apartment had two light bulbs go out. It's apartment policy that the apartment handles light bulbs so I asked them to repair it. This past weekend, I went away, and when I returned today, the light bulbs were fixed, but there were glass shards all over the floor, seemingly from a broken lightbulb. I received no notification or update, or anything that cautioned against stepping in it, not even a note ""hey, broken glass, will return tomorrow with shop vac"". I am lucky I didn't step in anything and slice my foot open. Is there anything I can do?"	No
2019	I live in California, client is in Europe. We only had email agreements to do a 3k video project. The resulting video was not professional quality. It was so low quality it started going viral a bit since filmmakers were enthusiastically denouncing every aspect of it.  I gave the client a full refund, but now I have this video which to me is a silly (and expensive) reminder of a project gone terribly wrong. Can I make it public on YouTube? I removed all reference to the company in the Title/Description, and note that the client is not affiliated with it and was given a full refund. But the video itself still contains their name/brand.  Is this fine to publish, or can I be sued for liable, brand infringement, or some other offense I'm unaware of. At this point I feel like it's mine, I paid for it, and should be able to publish it. I even refunded the fee for the script, which their whole team had signed off on and already paid for. I had hoped to retain them so was being nice there, and then they bailed.	No
2020	"I had 3 teeth extracted yesterday by a local oral surgeon, and after I got home and the numbness began to wear off, I realized that one of the 3 was not one I had asked them to pull. I had a referral list with x rays from my dentist that reccomended 5 for extraction, but included a note that said ""per patient which ones"". I had opted to only do 3 for now since they were patially broken and painful, was going to ask my dentist about options to save the other 2 since they hadn't been painful. Before they started I was showing the assistant which ones I wanted done, and I opened my mouth and pointed to each one. I explained also that I had no clue which teeth the numbers on the list corresponded to, and my dentist had told me to just show them which ones that they would know the numbers. I thought she seemed to understand which ones I meant, but later I realized they pulled the one in front of one I had asked them to pull. It was on the list, but as I said, I wanted to try to save it. I called the office up, but they were already closed and the best I could do was leave a message with the answering service explaining what happened. What are my options for dealing with this? ""I'm sorry"" clearly won't bring my tooth back, and I'm less interested in money than I am in being able to eat as normally as possible again."	No
2021	Some background information:  My parents were going through a divorce a couple years back and I got into an argument with my dad that escalated and ultimately resulted in me being arrested for simple assault domestic violence charge. I was 17 at the time and was tried as an adult since this was a few years before this 2014 bill had passed:   https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/19/house-raises-juvenile-delinquent-age/VP9KkZXfccwnOJ4EIsNNaN/story.html  The charge was subsequently reduced to an infraction which I plead guilty to. Now that the juvenile delinquent age is 18, are those records from before I was 18 expunged?   I'm thinking about pursuing a medical career in the future and am afraid that the regretful events of my past may become an issue.	No
2022	My mother is a 66 year old disabled manic depressant who survives on welfare. She currently lives in a trailer on a trailer park which she pays rent. She's been here for about 15 years and the landlord has refused to fix things in the park for years. However, this newest refusal I consider to be out of line. My mom recently fainted and broke her foot (about 5 days ago) and this has basically immobilized her. A few days prior to her accident she called me telling me that the toilet and bathtub were broken. Basically when she flushes the toilet it backs up somewhere and in the piping and what she flushed begins to come out of the bathtubs drain. The bathtub itself doesn't want to properly drain. Her and her neighbor discovered a piece of land outside of her home that seemed to be leaking and spewing up sewer waste. They both called the landlord on multiple occasions leaving voicemails that he never returned. She finally got through to the landlord yesterday and told him what was happening. He told her that he'll get to it and she described her injury. Once she told him this he replied by telling her to go to the bathrooms at supermarkets. She replied by telling him again about her broken foot, how she's been using a portable toilet in her living room, and that there was nowhere for her to dispose of the waste. His follow up to her response was to take the portable toilet outside and throw the waste into the vacant lot next to her trailer. My mother hasn't been able to use her toilet in over a week and has resorted to going to the bathroom in bags/pots. She hasn't taken a proper shower or bath in over a week.  She is currently refusing to drink water and eat too much food because it makes her have to go to the bathroom. Is there anything that can be done here?	No
2023	"Hi guys. I have a lot of questions. Thank your for being well versed in insane minutiae. I did a lot of googling about this and found only bits and pieces of answers    **Scenario**   I am a toddler teacher at a daycare with about 70 employees and two locations, NAEYC accredited. Our location is in a very old building. Today we came in to find that the storage facility connected to the designated break area (they share a door) is undergoing asbestos abatement. All proper signage, warnings, and info packets posted. The room was blocked off with a sheet of plastic and some plywood. None of the employees were alerted, nor were the families. We were also not offered alternative locations to eat lunch. This break room stores all of the food for the children, as well as all cleaning supplies, classroom supplies, extra toys, eating utensils, and a fridge where the employees store lunch and some snacks for children are stored. My boss claims the owner of the building told her to ""keep kids out of the break area because work is being done"" but that asbestos was not mentioned.     **Action sequence**   I am on the playground with my children speaking to another toddler teacher. I ask her if my boss is informing the families and she isn't sure. I indicate that I'm going to let them know that they should keep their children out of the designated area, as they are often in there. My boss's sister (this is it's own problem obviously) hears this and immediately texts my boss. Boss storms onto the playground, interrogating me about why I would want to tell parents about these ""chemicals"" and saying I don't know what I'm talking about, etc etc. When I immediately agreed that i would keep it to myself if she so wished, she continued. She said I just like to caused trouble, that I was a gossip, immature, strange thing like that. I mostly ignored her as I was with my kids, and holding one of them. At the end of her ranting she asked me ""Why do you even come here every day?"" I just kind of gave her a blank stare because that question made no sense to me. I reminded her that I'm putting in my two weeks notice on Friday (going to grad school) and She tells me I'm not needed and I should leave that afternoon and not return. So, humiliated and devastated, i did.  *Note: When I say boss, I refer to our assistant director, as our director is out of town. That's why i was waiting to give my notice, as the Director would return friday. The AD indicated that she was in communication with the director the whole time. I have had no luck contacting the director.*   **Questions**    *1* Does a landlord have any obligation to tell the tenants when asbestos removal is being done? Is the presence of children relevant?   *2* Does my boss have an obligation to let employees know that this work is being done? Does she have an obligation to tell the parents?   *3* Does the landlord have the responsibility of having the air tested for asbestos levels after removal?    *3* Is there anything shady about her reasoning for firing me? I understand at will and all that, but does the safety concern change anything?    *4* Will I be able to collect unemployment from them?    *5* Will I find myself in legal trouble if (now that I am no longer an employee there) I let the parents I know/have contact with that there is asbestos work going on?    I know this is a lot so I truly thank you for reading and considering. I am so lost right now and sadly no amount of googling is bringing me solid answers to these questions. Any help or insight would be incredibly appreciated. And if there are legal issues that may arise that I was unaware of, please let me know! This is turned my life right upside down. Help.  **tldr**: Asbestos abatement being done in a daycare, no one was told it was happening. I found out halfway thru the day when my coworker asked what all the cancer signs are about. Boss/acting boss fires me (allegedly with permission from real boss) for indicating that I wanted to tell the parents of the children who attend the daycare."	No
2024	Hey guys it's me again with an update. I wasn't sure how to go about this - please excuse me if this is not correct. Update is at the bottom of the post for those that might remember it (the post was 2 weeks ago).    Hello /r/legaladvice. Please forgive me in advance for any formatting errors that will occur. As well as spelling errors - currently bumming WiFi from my wife's work :)   So now a little info. I live in Arkansas. I'm recently employed at Walmart (Jun. 12) was my hire date. And we went through orientation (by the way we was told we were getting paid for that). I attended orientation I know for sure Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 2-11 with an hour lunch. Walmart pays biweekly so I was hired the Monday before this last pay period (Jun. 15). Today (Jun. 29) was our payday.   Now when you first hire on with Walmart, I was told you're hired as part time. Which I am working 4 days a week 2-11 shift with an hour lunch. There for I should be earning at least 64 hours ( most of the time I clock out +15mins after my shift - since I've been hired I've worked an hour past my shift 3 times and one time I clocked out at 1:05 a.m) every two weeks.   But now here's the thing. My paystub only shows I worked 47.64 hours the past 2 weeks. 17 the first week and 30 the next. Which this is absolutely wrong.   Since I was hired the Monday before payday. Those hours should be added on along with the 2 - 32 hour work week as well as those times I've work past my shift.   Also do part time employs gain over time if they have worked over 40 hours (or 80 hours in my case ?)  I'm not as much as worried about the overtime. I really want to know why I was paid for 64 hours + the hours I attended orientation.   Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I'm working for a corporation like this. I plan on going to personnel in the morning and asking to see the hours I've clocked in. Because it's wrong on my paystub.   Thanks y'all. Have a great one.   [UPDATE]  I received another paycheck via the Wal-Mart money this past Thursday (July 13th). I only had 40 hours the past 2 weeks (according to Wal-Mart). Which I was scheduled for 64 hours the past two weeks. I've been there everyday that I was scheduled. And that's not including the times I've clocked out at 11:30 or later). I'm seriously debating giving them my 2 weeks notice. Something is not adding up.   To be honest, during orientation I over heard some of the salried managers speaking about the overtime workers were getting and that it was costing them too much. Or something to that affect.  My question is now - could they be doing something with my hours to cover that up? I know I'm only part-time but still..  Forgive me if that is a silly question. I've never dealt with this type of stuff. I've farmed all my life and always received a paper check. So all this is pretty new to me.  So can someone (anyone) please give me a little more advice I would greatly appreciate it. As I'm in a tight spot right now. And I don't know what to do.   Thanks yall. Have a good weekend	No
2025	"I was charged with attempted larceny in a building. A 1 year misdemeanor. The prosecutor has said if I do not tale their plea at my pre trial they will make it a larceny in a building charge, a 4 year felony, the charge stems from accusations of me stealing a phone. The only evidence is the police report and the witness testimony from a nurse and a doctor. In neither of the testimonies do they say they saw me take anything, it is all assumption because ""i was the only one in the room"".  At the same time my lawyer is advising me not to take the plea deal because i would then have to lie and say I did take the phone, but at the same time im not gonna face a felony charge for taking it to trial.  Any advice would be great, thanks."	No

2027	My friend's mother is currently being taken care of by hospice and they called her mother's siblings and told them that it is time to make funeral arrangements.  As her mother has been an incredible money pit her whole life and quite the burden on her siblings, they are declining to pay for any part of the funeral arrangements, and are foisting the monetary issues onto my friend (We'll call her Alice).  Alice is a management figure at a food chain, and doesn't make the money to pay completely for the cremation of the body.  Are there any legal footings that Alice can stand on that will compel her next of kin (who are loaded by the way) to pitch in or contribute to the cremation costs and transportation costs?  Is there any financial help that she can garner to complete the burial?  She would like to avoid the state taking the body so I would like to get an answer swiftly since her mother doesn't have much time left.  Thank you in advance for any information or help you may have.  We are located in Brevard County Florida, USA.  If this is the wrong subreddit to post in I am sorry in advance.	No
2028	Below is the section of the lease stating this. Also, does this include costs for an exterminator?  **9. Repairs, alterations** Tenant must keep, and at the end of the term return the Premises and all appliances, equipment, furniture, furnishings and other personal property clean and in good order and repair. Tenant is not responsible for ordinary wear and damage by the elements. If Tenant defaults, Landlord has the right to make repairs and charge Tenant the cost. The cost will be payable by the Tenant within 30 days of the repair. Tenant must not paint, alter, change or add to the premises without permission of the Landlord. If the Tenant receives permission to paint the Premises and does paint the Premises, the Tenant shall restore the Premises to the original white paint before the end of this lease. Tenant shall be responsible for all repairs due to misuse or neglect. Other general repairs shall be the shared responsibility of the Tenant and the Landlord with the Tenant’s obligation being limited to the first $250 per occurrence. Tenant has an obligation to notify Landlord at once if conditions occur that might damage property. Failure to notify Landlord will be considered neglect of property. Tenant will pay for any damage to the Premises or furnishings caused by the Tenant or Tenant’s guests.	No
2029	I am simply seeking information on my rights and the regulations in this scenario.  (Indiana, U.S.)  About 4 days ago myself and a few friends signed a one-year lease on a house in our area. Almost immediately after we began our lease the property owner has put the property up for sale, and we were asked by the property management company to make time today for a showing. My concern is simply to know what my rights are and what the situation is should the property be sold.  We do have a 1 year lease August 1st is the official starting date. There is no early termination clause.   I suppose my more specific questions would be  1. Is there any reason, provided we pay rent on time and obey all terms on the lease, that we can be evicted prior to the end of the lease?  2. Should the new owner, likely an investor, want to make repairs, upgrades, or modifications to the property what authority do they have to do so. (More specifically if it will interrupt our daily lives can we protest these changes?  3. Can the new owner modify the terms of our lease in any way?	No
2030	Yesterday my mother was checked into ICU for multiple complications, most importantly liver cirrhosis. She has recently become somewhat stable and we are continuing to fight for her life. It was brought to my attention that she does not have any health insurance whatsoever. Her current prognosis is 6-12 months and it is quite unlikely she will make it past the year without one of her children giving up a part of their liver. Over the course of the past 24 hours she has had multiple surgeries and what we're estimating is well into the 6 figures of medical expenses. We expect many more expenses in the coming days and likely into the millions of expenses when it's all said and done at this rate. My rough guestimate of what her estate is worth is around $700k-$1000k it could be slightly more, but that is unlikely. My question is will her children end up being liable for the expenses in excess of her estate? She is divorced. All of her children are above the age of 18 (5 of us). I've been looking into Filial responsibility laws(we live in a state that uses these) and I am pretty terrified we might be footing a huge bill by the end of the year if she doesn't make it. Does anyone have any experience with something like this or any advice? Thank you all very much.	No
2031	Hello all, I did something terrible and I hit and run a parked car. What happened was I made a slight dent on someone's bumper while parking. I left a note, parked somewhere else and left. Someone saw me and watched me place the note but didn't make any moves to write my information down or call the police. The next morning, I saw my note on the ground near the car and I made an impulsed decision and decided to trash it. I know what I did was wrong but I'm a poor college student who couldn't afford to fix it right now. The parking area doesn't have any cameras and I believe no one documented the incident at all. Am I okay? If the police somehow found out, how would they contact me?  Location: CA	No
2032	"Hello all,  I read the FAQs and still had a brief question. As the title states, I'm a Wisconsin driver that got a speeding ticket in Georgia.   The ticket is for 20 over the posted limit on an interstate, which qualifies for the ""Super Speeder"" classification in GA, according to the cop. I was not driving a vehicle that I own. I've already learned my lesson and am prepared to deal with the consequences. I have 3 main questions here:  -WI DMV site says ""No points are assessed for convictions from other states, however, the conviction is entered on the Wisconsin driver record."" I already know about the DLC and NRVC (both of which WI is not a part of), but can anyone put into simple terms what this means, mainly in reference to insurance? If it means that my insurance may be able to see this and raise the rates, it may be something that I want to work to get reduced.  -When I go to the website listed to pay and enter the information, I can see the fee. However, it says nothing about the ""Super Speeder"" fee of [I read $200, but that could be incorrect]. It's not really clear whether the additional fee is something that I'll hear about after the fact, or if that's included. Can anyone clarify that by chance?  -Has anyone else from WI gotten an out of state speeding ticket that can comment on whether it was/wasn't worth taking time off from work to go to court in hopes of getting the charge reduced?  I'm leaning towards just paying everything and being done with it, but I want to be sure I'm not setting myself up for other consequences further down the line by doing so. Any *advice* is appreciated, and I fully understand that I am only seeking advice.  Thanks!"	No
2033	Work in a place where traditionally lowest on the totem pole does the hard crap work. It sucks but eventually you earn your stripes someone new comes along and you do less and less of the crap until one day you rarely if ever have to do it.   Here and there over the years I have had managers try to jump someone over me (usually because they are female or older and less capable) pushed it to the main boss and they agreed that was not cool. Couple of times this resulted in the newer employee quitting because the work is that disagreeable      New group of managers has decided the traditional way of doing things (and also the way all similar departments in the company still do it) doesn't matter to them.   So now it seems that the young men no matter seniority get to do all the hard work, while being told that what we do is the top, not the bottom.   Are there and laws that protect us? (CA)  Feels real shitty	No
2034	I'm the property owner of a single-family house in Charlotte, NC. I moved out of state for work and contracted with a realty company that places tenant-buyers in your property. The lease is set to expire October 1st, and the tenants have not provided me with any sort of closing date or indication they started the purchase process besides communicating with me directly that they intend on exercising their option to purchase soon.  I have been calling and emailing the realty agent and the company for over a year without anyone getting back to me. I need to send these tenants a lease renewal contract with their updated rent amount and total due for extending the purchase time another year, since there's no way they'll close before the lease expires. The agent is also the president/founder of the realty company.  I contacted the National Association of Realtors and they told me that my agent is no longer a member. I reached out to the Charlotte Regional Realtor Association and they confirmed this, and also told me that the realty company dissolved in February 2017. She confirmed this on the NC Secretary of State website. He is no longer listed on ncrec.gov.   I'm not a big shot investor. This is my one home and I am in this situation and now live in Oregon. If anyone could provide any advice I would greatly appreciate it.	No
2035	"So I moved to an apartment here a couple of weeks ago. Over these couple of weeks, I've noticed some issues. A broken light in the closet, poor circulation of air flow, a loud ceiling fan in the unit below me, and a cockroach infestation.   I wrote an email to her explaining these problems, and explaining that I tried to handle matters myself first, including hiring an exterminator for a treatment. She immediately texted me and told me to call her.  I should not have called her. She didn't allow me to get a word in. She yelled at me, cussed at me, accused me of calling her a liar and told me that she would not do anything about the roach problem and that she ""doesn't have to."" She stated there was likely no problem anyway as the building was recently renovated and supposedly there were no roaches. She also stated that her nephew who lives in the building would have told her about them if they were there. My friend and I have been in the nephew's apartment and he saw at least 1 cockroach.  I have a recording of my phone call with her. I don't know if I'm allowed to post it, let me know if I can.  What are my options? If this roach problem persists and she won't handle it, what can I do? I can't afford an exterminator every month. And how can I proceed with her flying so off the handle at me at just the mention of some issues? Issues that I tried to fix myself!  I'm just really rundown and I feel really beaten up after that call. What can I even do?"	No
2036	The landlord of my girlfriend's previous apartment is requesting she pay for replacing the carpet (due to a couple dog urine stains) after she moved out. When she moved in, she had to pay $200 for the security deposit along with a $300 pet deposit for each of her two dogs. The total cost to replace the carpet was $600. They used her security deposit to cover part of this but they are insisting that she owes the remaining $400. Shouldn't the pet deposit ($600) be used for the remaining amount? Thanks for your help.	No
2037	I moved into an apartment in Kalamazoo Michigan last June, and this month my job wanted to transfer me to a different city, so I began the process of finding someone to sublease. My landlord made me aware that there had been a fire here and that's why the last tenant left. What they didn't tell me was that the fire marshall had told them that they could not legally rent this apartment because it's too close to the fence next door. There are two large fences, a chain-link and a wooden one running right along the side of the apartment. According to the mire marshall, that can't be that way if they're going to have someone living here.   Right after I renewed my lease back in March, the company that owned the building sold it to an individual, who I assume still has no idea that they/he have been renting this apartment illegally.  Now that I know this, I don't think I can go any further trying to sublease, but I'm moving at the end of the month and need to be done with this place by then.  What are my options for dealing with this?	No
2038	I had a lease with my ex. He was abusive so I moved to get away from him. I'm worried he's going to damage the apartment to get back at me for leaving. How do I get my name off the lease? The lease is up in October I moved away in July, but he still lives there.	No
2039	"I've done coke once with a friend (and their other friend, who brought it) and ever since then that friend has grown very cold about it in front of me and said they were pressured into doing it by their friend who was present. Even though I know they're just saying that to hide it. Cuz I asked them to bring some one day after that and referred to it as ""❄️"" (snowflake emoji) over text and they flipped out on me. I was later told that's dangerous because she could get in trouble for supplying. But I don't get it, it's not like someone's spying on our conversation? (WhatsApp is secure)   Anyway I'm not looking to sell drugs, I just wanted to do it with this friend while we hang out. For recreational purposes. I was thinking of asking them again this time (6 months later) and refer to it as something like ""🔌"" (plug emoji which is common for this) . Basically something like ""hey can u hook up the 🔌"". Could that get someone in trouble?"	No
2040	I decided to lease out my condo that I own when I left the country for 6 months (Ontario, Canada) but before I did I organized to have a property management group look after the property on my behalf and find a tenant. First red flag that I ignored was that it took them over a month and they hadn't secured a tenant yet so on the day before I left I signed a lease for 6 months with a tenant I found. They later claimed that had arranged for someone to view and sign a lease the day after I left, but had failed to communicate this with me (red flag number 2). The following months where a struggle to get in contact with the property management group as the first rent payment was late and in the end it always proved quicker to contact the tenant directly. At one point my boyfriend wanted to remove something from my storage room and we contacted the tenants (property wasn't responding) and the gentleman who had signed the lease admitted he wasn't really living there anymore and gave the contact of his brother who had leased with him (but not officially on the lease). The brother turned out to be impossible to reach and eventually my boyfriend went to the property and was met by complete strangers who said they where living there, i.e subletting the apartment. This fact would later be brought to the property managements attention as it was in violation of the lease and important later. Finally the tenants failed to pay rent and the legal process began to have them removed from the apartment. The sad part was there lease was almost up anyway.  At this point the property group became very defensive and blamed the troubles on us having picked the tenant. In one email they said, we knew they where going to be trouble, when one of our managers went to the apartment it smelled of weed (again a direct violation of the lease which they failed to bring to our attention). We have no idea if the property group did start the legal proceedings for removing them from the property but an understanding was reached that they would leave when the lease expired (the property management had failed to give them the proper 2 month notice that the lease was not going to continue).  We were worried about damage and asked if they would be performing an inspection and handing over the keys to my boyfriend so he could look at the place before I got home. A week before move out they said they performed and inspection and that there where 3 issues, a broken baluster, a broken cupboard hinge (easy to fix it just popped out) and a missing towel rack (which was missing before they moved in). This didn't seem nearly as bad as we expected and where honestly a little relieved. Move out day came and went and the property management group was still not getting back to us about surrendering the keys and the results of the final inspection. It took a visit to their offices to finally get the keys and as the title would suggest when my boyfriend entered the apartment it was a disaster. There was broken and missing furniture. There was significant damage to the hardwood floors and staining in the carpet. There was a broken door and several holes in the drywall. The place was filthy and smelled bad of cigarette smoke. Had we known this we would have immediately pursued legal action against the lease holders and the people illegally subletting but as they moved out before we actually got their contact details, this will now be impossible. So here is my question (sorry for the long story), in our agreement/contract with the management group it says that they cannot be held liable for such claims. However, it also states that they are responsible for ensuring the property remains in good condition and that the terms of the lease are upheld and are responsible for dealing with any legal issues that will arise. Do their actions or lack there off qualify as negligence and would it be possible to take legal action against them to pay for damages as it is also their fault that we are unable to pursue legal action against the people illegally subletting.	No
2041	Hey so my roommate signed a lease with me and is mad that I am dating someone. So he was hoping to leave the place in a few weeks and stick me with the bill. However, he does not realize that he signed the lease WITH me. What are my rights? Is it up to him to find a new tenant? I have animals would that effect his ability to find a replacement? Do I continue to pay the landlord my half of the rent? I'm just very confused as to how I need to handle all of this. It was a one year lease and we are a few months into it. I've paid the dmg/pet deposit in full and he has also been slamming doors around the house and might intentionally cause damage.   Thanks for the help :)	No
2042	"Sorry this is going to be a long post. I'm not sure if this is actionable at all but I thought I'd post here and see what people think. I'm a 30 year old male that lives in British Columbia, Canada.  I have been very sick for the past seven years and have officially been diagnosed with an insulinoma. It is a rare pancreatic tumor on the pancreas. This is my story.  In 2010 I started becoming quite ill and went to my family doctor multiple times for a year.  He misdiagnosed me with celiac disease and then after that was ruled out by a specialist, my GP gave up on me.  I decided to take matters into my own hands and in less than an hour of researching online I discovered that I most likely was having multiple hypoglycemic attacks a day.  I went back to him and got several requisitions for blood work checking my glucose levels, and sure enough I was right.  My blood sugars were ranging from 2.7-4.1 mmol/L after meals and throughout the day, which is dangerously low. The most common form of hypoglycemia is reactive hypoglycemia.  The treatment for this is eating healthy and exercising, which I was already doing.  At the time I was a personal trainer studying kinesiology and extremely fit with about 8% body fat.  Because of this my GP ruled out reactive hypoglycemia and his diagnosis was insulinoma, an insulin secreting tumor on my pancreas which made perfect sense to me.  I was then referred to an endocrinologist for further help.  The endo did standard tests to check my liver and kidney function and to make sure I didn't have cancer, and then diagnosed me with reactive hypoglycemia without doing a single blood glucose test.  I had gone to a dietitian at my local hospital who said my diet was perfect.  I even wrote out my diet for the endo but all he said was to eat better. He said there was no way it could be insulinoma but never really gave a reason why. I then took his advice and ate even healthier by almost eliminating all carbs from my diet except for some veggies, and I got immensely worse and my blood glucose was even lower than before.    I tried to go back to the endo but he refused to see me.  I then went to endo #2 for a second opinion.  Endo #2 saw me for 5 minutes and said it was reactive hypoglycemia, but on the off chance it was an insulinoma he told me to do a 12 hour fasting blood glucose test. The test turned out negative. He told me this would rule out insulinoma, but now that i know more about the condition a 12 hour fast has never been given to diagnose insulinoma. Even when it was first discovered in the early 1900's.  There was always a 48hr supervised fast test in a hospital with strict protocols, which turned into a 72hr fast test, and today basically any blood tests with blood glucose under 3.0 and high insulin, c-peptide or pro insulin is enough to diagnose insulinoma.   Shortly after that I tried every healthy diet i could find, and the only thing I found was that the healthier i ate the worse i got. So I preformed an experiment where I only ate junk food.  The diet was less than 30g of protein a day and over 600 grams of fast acting carbs like pizza, mcdonalds, apple pie, soft drinks, candy, pasta and garlic bread.  For the first time in almost 3 years my blood glucose was normal and i felt relief of all my symptoms for two weeks.  However this was not a reasonable diet, I gained over 10 lbs in a short amount of time and still become hypoglycemic when i exercised.  I demanded endo #1 see me again with this new information and he agreed.  I saw him and told him the healthier i ate the worse i got, but the worse i ate the better my blood sugars were, which is consistent with insulinoma.  He admitted that it made absolutely no sense.  I asked him what do we do now, and he said ""i don't know"".  I asked if he could refer me to someone who could help and he said, no. If i wanted another referral for another opinion i would have to go to my GP and ask him.   Upset and confused by this endo, I returned to my GP and asked for another referral to someone new.  He did so, but endo #3 refused to see me saying that he agreed with endo #1 and there was nothing out of the ordinary about my case. I then luckily got referred to a wonderful internist who saw me right away and told me there was no way this is reactive hypoglycemia. He forced endo #3 to see me.  I then saw endo #3 and he explained to me what reactive hypoglycemia was and how i have it.  He said it couldn't be insulinoma because when my blood sugars were 2.7, my insulin levels weren't high enough.  He was wrong on multiple accounts here.  My insulin level was in fact high enough, and even if it weren't he should have tested my c-peptide during a hypoglycemic event to rule out insulinoma.  C-peptide actually gives a more accurate indicator of how much insulin is being released in the body and is crucial in diagnosing insulinomas. So i asked to go to the diabetes clinic to see if they can help me with my diet, since he was so sure it was reactive hypoglycemia.  I went to the clinic and they immediately said this is not reactive hypoglycemia.  They sent a letter to endo #3 telling him that he has to help me figure out what's going on.  So i go back to my internist who spoke with endo #3 and apparently he reluctantly said there may be something else going on here.  So then I was referred to endo #4 in a different city.  Endo #4 saw me and immediately said that there is no way this is reactive hypoglycemia.  She suspected and confirmed insulinoma after having me induce a hypoglycemic attack and having glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels taken. I saw her in 2015, and the test only took one day.   She then sent me to endo #5 in my own city to do the appropriate image testing to locate the tumor.  Endo #5 decided to do a 72hr fast to confirm that i in fact have insulinoma.  I spoke to endo #4 who said this was unnecessary, but if she wanted to have it done then i had to do it. It took 8 months for her to do the test and get the results and she sent me a letter saying i passed the test and nothing was wrong with me.  So either i'm the first person in recorded history with an insulinoma to pass this test, or she did it incorrectly.     So i go back to endo #4 and she tells me, if she doesn't think i have an insulinoma then she thinks im drugging myself.  She told me that's the only way I could be lowering my blood glucose so low.  So I induced a hypo with high insulin and high c-peptide with a negative drug screen.  After that endo #4 and endo #3 agreed i had an insulinoma.  The interesting thing is that for this test, my insulin was actually lower than the test endo #3 used as evidence to say my insulin wasn't high enough.  This makes no sense to me how he says this confirms insulinoma when previously he said that my insulin levels weren't high enough.   So then after all that I have been undergoing imaging studies and other fun tests for the past several months and they have 100% found the tumor in the tail of my pancreas.  I'm currently waiting for a surgery date to have it removed.    I feel very outraged and angry that it has taken 7 years to figure this out, when my GP and I have told them this is what it was 6 years ago.  Over the past 7 years i've barely been able to work.  I had to quit school and stopped being a personal trainer.  In fact when I saw my internist 2 years ago, he told me my blood sugar levels were way too low to function as a normal human being let alone work, and put me on disability for the past 2 years while we figured this out.  I also ended up having blood sugar readings of less than 2.2 mmol/L, which is considered life threatening.  I don't know if this is worth pursuing legally but I've got time to kill until my surgery so i might as well look into it, thanks!"	No
2043	I rent a room/bathroom in company housing. I have a month-to-month rental agreement which specifies the room I'm staying in, and indicates that they must give 30-days notice to terminate the agreement (unless I fail to pay rent, in which case 14-days).  In a couple weeks, my company is having a big meeting with people from other offices, and needs to provide housing for these people. I've been informed that they want me to move to a smaller room, so they can provide my room for someone. I have one week to move. It's a hassle, as all my belongings are here, and I'd have to make a project of moving twice in as many weeks.  I believe they are not legally required to force me to leave, but I'm concerned that they could terminate my housing contract (or my employment) if I refused. I'm not sure what to do.  My state is one-party consent for recording, so I'm considering recording any future talk I have about this.	No
2044	"Hey all! I've never posted on Reddit before, but my current housing situation is driving me batty and a friend said you might be able to help.   Story time:  I moved into a rental house on Saturday 07/15. When we were done unpacking, I went to take a shower and discovered there was no hot water.   ""No problem,"" I thought, ""I'll just call the landlord to get it fixed.""   Then things started snowballing.   The landlord's maintenance worker looked at the water heater and said the problem was that it's a gas heater, and there was no gas going to the heater. (When signing the lease, the landlord had said everything was electric, so I didn't get the gas turned on). To have hot water, we'd need to get gas services started.   Well that's a little annoying, but at least it's an easy fix.  I called the gas company on Monday, July 17. They informed me that the gas had been off for over 6 months, and because of that a home inspection would need to be conducted before the service could start. I informed my landlord immediately after ending the call.   My landlord's maintenance worker contacted me today, after a week of radio silence, to inform me that the earliest inspection date they could do would be two days from now, on Thursday from 11-4. He also said that I should contact the city's inspector to schedule the inspection.   I have now been living in this house for 11 days without hot water. I have been taking cold showers and boiling water on the stove to wash dishes.   Can y'all please give me some advice on what to do, or at least validation that this is Not Acceptable? I keep calling and texting and am at my wit's end in how to make my living situation, well, livable. Is this even legal?   (I live in Texas, if that helps with state statutes)"	No
2045	I bought my house in 2008 and have not made any changes to the structures other than replacing an existing fence.  There's a shed on my property that based on town records has been there since 1983.  I was looking up my property value and noticed that the shed seems to be partially on my neighbors land. http://i.imgur.com/XqchNA4.png  I have a good relationship with my neighbors and don't want to stir anything up unnecessarily, but I also don't want any surprises when the time comes for me to sell the home or replace the shed.  Are there any actions I should be taking now or is the fact that the shed has been there for so long in my favor?	No
2046	About a year ago, I moved in with my husband, who already lived at the apartment complex he was at for a year with two other roommates by the time I moved in. We recently got our own place, and just received the final invoice from the old apartment.   Unfortunately, the move out process was a bitch. My husband and I somehow got stuck cleaning not just the entire common room, but both of our roommates rooms after they had all of their shit out (vacuuming, dusting, etc). During this, we noticed our one roommate's carpet had a huge black circle from where he sat at his desk with shoes on. We tried to clean it as best as we could, but it was still pretty bad. Lo and behold, the invoice had a $1000 carpet replacement charge. We're still working on contacting the apartment for more details as to what specifically caused that charge, but I'm anticipating it being having to replace our one roommate's apartment, and subsequently replaced all of the carpeting in the apartment.   If the carpet replacement was due to an irreparable stain in one bedroom, how can the other people go about not getting screwed over financially? While I'm referring to my husband and I as well as our other roomie that didn't cause the stain, I'm especially concerned for us since they'll want to split the cost four ways, meaning my husband and I will have to dish out half of the cost of replacement for another roommate's mess, while he only pays 1/4th of the cost.   I have a post-cleaning video of the common area and our bedroom, where the carpets look just fine, but nothing of the other two roommate's rooms.   I'm not sure how to approach this situation. Any advice would be appreciated!	No
2047	I've been living in my current apartment in Chicago since 8/1/2016, and I use People's Gas as my natural gas provider. My monthly gas bill has typically been between $40-50, with a slight increase during the winter months. In mid-June, I received my bill, which came out to an absurd $240, nearly 6x my typical bill. I called the company immediately, and was told that my bill was inaccurate and would be sent to the billing department for revision.   After the first call, I proceeded to call two more times over the next two weeks in hopes of hearing an update, only to be told the bill was still being revised. I never received an update, and so I called again the day before my bill was due. I was told by the customer service rep that 1) I would not have to make a payment for my June bill - my charges would be revised, and would just be added to my bill for July (so I'd essentially be paying for two-months worth of gas use in July), and 2) I would not be penalized for not making a payment in June.  Well, I just received my bill, and not only do I still owe the full $240 from June, but I was penalized with a late payment as well. I just called (for the fifth time), and am now being told that apparently there was an error with my gas meter for the first 10 months at my apartment, it had been adjusted in June and I am now being back-billed for all of the gas usage that the meter did not pick up over that 10-month period.   Does People's Gas have a right to do this? I understand that I was essentially paying for less than what I should have, but that was a direct result of their own error, and I don't see why I should now be financially responsible for the malfunctioning of their meter-reader.   For the record, my gas charges for July came out to $45, which makes this all the more absurd considering the meter is now functioning correctly yet is still spitting out the same readings that I had been getting billed for during the previous 10 months (when it was supposedly malfunctioning).	No
2048	As question says, our Landlord had allowed us to move out early at the beginning of June even though our lease technically ended at the end of the July. In the lease we did agree to allowing up to the maximum 60 days under CO law to return the deposit. We also signed an amendment to the lease in which we agreed to the new move out date of June 4th. However, even though it has been over 60 days since we moved out. The landlord is saying that it doesn't start until the original move out date we agreed to. I have been looking around but have not been able to find any info on this either way. FYI he has had people living in the place since mid-June so not sure if that matters.	No
2049	"I'll try to keep this short.  3/01 boyfriend and I were looking for a way to get out of a crappy townhouse situation. His friend (J) hits him up with a Craigslist post showing a house for rent that his friend (H) and her girlfriend (Z) want, but can't afford it and the landlord wanted it rented out that month. Z and H were the people who wanted it originally, and all of us just kind of fell into place because we needed a place to rent.  And of course everything is too good to be true. Comes to find out that the landlord doesn't approve of so many people in the house, and is questioning how many animals there are. So Z and H haven't been honest to the landlord about the situation. I'm not sure what her lease says.  All I know is that my boyfriend and I are now fucked if/when something happens, because we own three cats and a dog and have no savings.  What sort of situation are we looking at? 30-day eviction? An immediate ""gtfo""?  The situation was just brought to our attention today. My boyfriend and I are more than willing to pay pet deposits, carpet out of pocket, fucking anything - just to make sure that we have a place that we can call home when we're trying to get on our feet.  Boyfriend is currently talking to Z and H about options and what can/should they do. My boyfriend wants to make everything right but it's not in our control."	No
2050	I work for a Fortune 500 company in California.  I accepted an offer in the fall of 2016.  The offer did not explicitly list my PTO days, but it had a link to the current benefits site.  The current benefits site detailed that PTO days for employees in my range would be X, and a footnote that said the schedule would change on 1 Jan 2017.  My hiring was delayed by the company until 2017, and now I make X-16 hours of PTO, according to the new schedule.    I believe this has happened to numerous other employees as well, since my hiring class was around 100, and all had offers accepted in 2016.  Do I have any recourse for the company changing the terms of employment?	No
2051	Had a bad interaction with an employee. Attempted to 1 star review the company saying that some staff are not very welcoming to new community members. It was replied to by the owner who explained I have been trying to contact most of his employees outside of work hours for things not related to work(turns out this part was true, but he left out the part that I had no idea they worked there, and they it was through either dating apps or fetlife). I replied to defend myself from the accusation and the review was deleted. I bough a bunch of dislikes because im petty and it was cheap, how much if any trouble can I get in	No
2052	My father gave me an old car when I was 16-ish. Had different issues where I couldn't drive it. Father gave me a different car that was drivable and I signed the title back over to the one I had no use of. Now 10 years down the Rd my sister's moved my dad to a senior care center in Miami and his old house was foreclosed on by the bank and purchased by someone else. The new owner of the home reported several abandoned vehicles on the property to the police department. One of them being the one I signed over to my father but he never changed the title. The police department then contacted me to notify me. What should I do? They said my sister's refused to act on the other vehicles. I don't live near there and the one car isn't technically mine. I'm afraid of being fined or sued because the car is still in my name legally, but on the other hand if I do something to it, like sell or have it junked, I don't want it to turn into a possible theft situation from the perspective of my family). (My father isn't there mentally and my sister's don't care for me in the least).	No
2053	Hello guys. Im a dual diploma student. I was a student in the US, was going to sell my car but i couldnt(couldnt find a customer who didnt look like a weirdo from craigslist), so i gave a friend power of attorney to gift/sell my car. I allowed him to gift it because there was a family friend to arrive that year so he could take it if he wanted it. I forgot to turn the license plates over before i returned to my country.  Turns out the guy i gave power of attorney got pulled over driving it(which i in no way allowed him to do) after the insurance expired. The police took the license plates and towed the car. He took it back after paying some fine.   I immediately made him sell the car for really cheap as i didnt want it giving me any more trouble than it already did.  Now the question. Im still not done with my university in NY. When i return to the US, is there any chance i might not be allowed into the country? :(	No
2054	"I am male, and I recently had several job interviews at a company that is ""WBE certified"" and several of the questions were in line with the one above.  ""If a female co-worker was promoted ahead of you, how would that make you feel?""  ""Can you work in an office where most of your co-workers are female?""  I didn't get the job, and I kinda feel like I'm lucky since so much concern was front-loaded about gender. But I felt like most of these questions about gender were invalid in the least. For example, I see no reason why gender has to play any role in being a good manager.  Anyway, did these questions cross a line?"	No
2055	The apartment complex I've lived in for two years is requiring that I have a screen door installed, despite the fact that I don't want one. No big deal.   However, according to them, my failure to report a missing screen when I moved in places the responsibility of paying for it on me. We were told to do a thorough walkthrough the first time we entered the apartment to report damages, but if I wasn't informed that there was supposed to be a screen, how could I have known to report the absence of one? We were not told to compare our apartment to the others in the complex, or given the opportunity to enter another one for reference.  There are cameras in the parking lot that would probably prove that there was never a screen, but they say they don't keep the footage from that long ago.  Can they fault me for not reporting something missing if I was never told of its existence?	No
2056	Hello Reddit,    Thank you for reading my post. This is a throwaway account. I’ve been renting from a 60-year old retired man for a bit over 4 months now. August is my last month in town (I’m moving to a different town for college in September). Yesterday he got extremely angry (details are included 2 paragraphs later) and started an argument with me, yelling, cussing and insulting me before telling me “You are bugging the sh*t out of me, I want you out of my f****** house by Sunday.” When I told him he couldn’t do that even though we don’t have an official lease, he said “this is my house, I can kick you out whenever the hell I want. All we have is a handshake”, before he pointed at my face and yelled “F*** you, and f*** whoever wants to f*** with me like that, you can lawyer up and you’re gonna get f***ed.”     That was about 14 hours ago. I don’t think I want to be around him anymore, but I’m not sure whether he can actually screw me over completely. I have already paid full rent for my remaining time here (Aug 1 - Sep 15, 1.5 months’ rent) in cash. He did say he’d give me my money back, but I don’t know if I can trust him. Also it feels like the way he treats me is almost harrasment -- the reason he got so angry is because I was cooking in the kitchen instead of on the grill in the yard, which “heats up the house”. The next paragraphs are a more detailed description of his reasoning.       Starting from the first day he’s been coming up with random rules. The first week he told me whenever I cook meat I have to wrap the meat packaging in a plastic bag and put it in the trash can outside of the house, because he doesn’t want the meat wrappers attracting mice and bugs. Then he complained about me not being social with him: he “didn’t like the way I set up my room as an efficient apartment”, because he wanted “someone to have casual conversations with”. I have a computer desk set up in my room. I’m not home that much -- I get off work at 5 and am usually out and about until 8pm. I’ll get home, make food and go to my room to eat / play video games. He complained about me not sitting down at the dining table with him to eat my food and not making enough small talks with him (which I do whenever I run into him in the house). He also complained about having my girlfriend over -- I used to have my ex-girlfriend over before we broke up, and now he’s saying I should have talked to him before I started to bring over my current girlfriend, even though I asked him if I could have overnight guests before I moved in and he said yes. Last week when I asked him to help me with a landlord’s reference for a rental application I’m filling out for my new place, he told me he did’t have time for my personal issues and got very upset.     The worst of it all is the kitchen access restriction. Early July he told me to stop using the kitchen inside the house and instead use the stove on the grill in the backyard, to “keep the house cool through the summer”. So I got a pressure cooker thinking it’d be a good alternative. He still repeatedly yelled at me whenever I do the minimum amount of cooking in the kitchen, like frying an egg in the morning. After a week he told me to stop using the pressure cooker and rice cooker inside the hosue and take them outside whenever I use them. And that’s what triggered him yesterday. I had the pressure cooker running in the kitchen around 7 pm and he just flipped out. He was cussing, yelling and flipping me off for about an hour. I even thought about calling the police on him because I felt harrassed and threatened.     If you’ve made it this far, thank you for your time. Any input is appreciated.	No
2057	So originally two other people and i signed a lease for a year for a 2 bedroom appartment. Everyone was moving in but day one x roomate decided they were not living there. The door had accidentally become locked overnight while they were moving in and they werent able to get in the first night. I fixed the issue the following morning and made fresh keys for everyone. X roomate stated they no longer wished to stay there. I had recieved their secirity deposit and first months rent. However there is a clause stating that any roomate that leaves needs to one: give 2 months notice and two: find a suitable replacement for their vacant position. X roomate is trying to claim their bedroom isnt a legal living space and therefor doesnt need to pay rent anymore. They havnt been to the building since day one. This roomate had ample time to inspect and see the space and still signed the lease and knew what they were getting into. The room itself is a finished attic room with stairs however they might not be up to code. Any advice is incredibly appreciated. I was planning on taking them to small claims court if i have a legal right to.	No
2058	"First off, I realise I most likely will not find any lawyers from my country here, but I wanted to hear some advice from people with more legal experience than me.  My fiancée and I have rented an apartment from our landlord since September 2016. Recently we signed a lease on a new apartment, but the same landlord. We are supposed to move into the new apartment tomorrow (Monday). I am 26 years old and my fiancée is 23, if that's at all relevant.  Today, we returned home to find a new TV, in its box, in our living room. We didn't buy the TV, and it's obvious he entered the apartment and put it in here while we were away for the weekend.  He did not notify us beforehand (apparently it's for the next tenants). After talking to him on the phone, he claims that he's done this (entered without notification) many times before and that he will continue to do so, because it's written in the lease agreement that he can. After the conversation, I went over the contract again.  The lease reads, roughly translated, ""The landlord will be authorised to visit the apartment during the week, at reasonable hours, in order to check on the status of the unit. This must be done with the renter's agreement beforehand. In addition, each year starting from July 1, the landlord will be authorised to enter the apartment with potential new tenants (to show them around). This can be done with no alert beforehand.""  So from what I understand from the contract, by entering and leaving the TV without notifying us first, he broke the contract. I know he wasn't showing the apartment to new tenants because he already signed a lease with new tenants about a month ago.  Am I reading the situation correctly? The dude is kind of a scumbag, but the apartments are nice so we kept on for another year with him, and the new contract is the same as the old, just a different address. This all happened less than an hour ago, and I wanted to get some advice before I do anything. I think in the next apartment I will set up a security camera. Also, our contract has no clause concerning a TV, and suddenly we have a TV in our apartment, can we keep it? (I wouldn't imagine so, but still...)  Anyways, I would appreciate any advice you guys have to give. The next lease we sign will be read through more thoroughly than this one was."	No
2059	About five years ago my ex fiance and I had an emergency housing situation that resulted in us moving into my Great Aunts extra house. Long story short my ex is not a good person and the police removed him from our house. He was living on the streets and im a dumbass so I spoke with my Aunt and he signed a separate lease from mine. He moved back about 5 months after leaving.  When we first moved in our house had burnt down and we literally had nothing. It took a long time but I started paying rent as soon as I could. He would try all sorts of sob stories why he didn't have rent. Worse came to worse and one day I woke up and they were just gone. Together we owed about 10,000. My aunt wants me to sign a statement verifying we owe the money for court. I dont understand how they can be sued without me being implicated. I have paid about 4,000 of this debt off. I cant tell if my Aunt is just gathering evidence to take me to court as well or is genuinely trying to help.   Questions: If the total debt is 10,000+ can we both separately be sued for 10,000+ or is it 5,000 each?   When the new lease was made there money was on top of the original rent I paid. How does this work? Rent 1000 for me and then 400 for then buy when we first moved it was 1000 total. Am i also liable for that?   My auntie alluded to my ability to sue my ex myself if the case is lost?  What role will domestic violence play into this?   Am I responsible for anyone else who signs a separate lease at the same property? Thank you ! I want to be prepaid without causing a family blow out.   Location NY	No
2060	Hello everyone, I just received a letter from the DMV about an accident I was in where I lost my fiancée and where I was injured myself pretty badly. I admit, I was at fault for failing to yield on a left turn. I was in an area I wasn't familiar with and I thought it was a four way stop and it wasn't. To make matters worst the pick-up I hit was speeding and my car went flying and flipped 3-4 times according to witnesses. I was in the hospital for 3-4 days after emergency surgery on my left arm, I was unable to eat the entire time I was in the hospital and I was very weak when I was finally discharged. I was unable to walk on my own for days and was in therapy for months to recover the use of my left arm. In midst of this mess I didn't know I was required to submit MV-104. I am now summoned to court for failure to submit this form and may have my license suspended. I already had my license suspended for 6 months from the ticket I received at the time of the accident. I have no idea what to do, I checked the NY DMV website and apparently neither of us submitted one, there is only a MV-104A on file. The accident was on 8/15/15. What should I do?	No
2061	Hi - I just created this account. I am hoping someone here can help me.  To make a long story short: the police allege I hit a telephone pole and then abandoned the vehicle on the side of the road. There was no collision with any other vehicle, nobody was injured, and there were no witnesses.  The police came to the scene, found my vehicle pulled off to the side of the road with the hazard lights on.  They waited about an hour, then had my vehicle towed - is what they told me.  Note: The vehicle is actually owned by my dad, but he gave me permission to drive it.  Anyway, the next day I called around and found out where my vehicle was towed.  I went there to pick it up, and the towing place said that the police have a 'hold' on it and that they aren't permitted to release it, unless the 'hold' is lifted.  I went to the police and asked them to release the hold, and they said they are investigating it.  I left.  Today, they called and said that they want to speak to my father (since he is the owner of the vehicle) in order to release it.  My father called and asked if he comes in, will they release it. The police said no, because they still have to do investigating.  I was not charged with anything, nor was my father. This happened last week.  As far as I know, the police are saying that 'they have all of this evidence that I hit a telephone pole and committed a hit-and-run'.   Can they keep my vehicle at the tow yard without a search warrant and without having pressed charges? It seems extremely unfair, especially since I am accumulating towing costs each day it sits there.  They won't release it, because they said the vehicle was 'abandoned'. Clearly it wasn't, provided that I called the next day to retrieve it.  Any advice?  Thanks!	No
2062	"I am going to give all the details and I need as much insight or advice as one can provide, because I felt like I was done wrong, but I'm not really sure what to do.  It's Friday and I am a Guest Services Manager/Training Coordinator for a car dealership in Atlanta, GA.  My General Sales Manager(GSM) called me 3 times in the morning, once at 8:58 AM, 9:00 AM, and 9:32 AM. I called him back at 10:03 AM apologizing for missing his calls. He said it was fine, but my co-worker/team member needed to remove her 'du-rag' as he called it, and said it wasn't professional for her to have it on. I told him I apologize if she looks unprofessional and I would address it when I got in at 12.  In the meantime, on my way to work, I reached out to another co-worker to express my discomfort with his request. I am a latina/caucasian woman and my co-worker is a black woman. I am very aware of the hair culture and especially to her, how important he hair is to her. I knew it was a delicate situation and I didn't agree with him asking her to remove it because I assumed it was simply a head wrap and/or scarf. I knew it wasn't against dress code and she's never been anything but professional. She told me to just express my discomfort to him and it shouldn't be a problem.  A side note: She wore a multi-printed scarf just the day before and no one said anything, including my GSM, and so I assumed she was wearing the same one or just a different color and so I figured it would be no problem to talk to him once I arrived.  He called me once more at 11:13 asking if I was at work yet and told me she was still wearing it. He asked me why I didn't have the discussion with her yet? I told him I wanted to wait to arrive to work.  When I got to work we went straight into a staff meeting at which when I walked in he asked me in front of everyone ""Did you have that discussion yet?"" and pointed to her. I just nodded and immediately started texting my female co-worker I called earlier to ask for advice.   I said: ""Pussy ass R** has been hounding me all morning about telling **** to remove her ""du-rag"" as he calls it. You can clearly see it's a scarf  and I don't see the big deal. It's not that fucking serious.""  Well, I accidentally sent it to him. Shortly after he pulled me out of the staff meeting to address it. He showed me the text and asked what was going on? He was pissed, and understandably so, I insulted him.  I told him I didn't agree with his opinion of her head scarf and I didn't want to tell her to take it off. He said if I didn't agree with how they do things then we could part ways, I said I agree. He paused and then took me into a cubical to talk.  At that point he said he didn't understand where this was coming from, he said he did so much for me by giving me my $1,000 bonus for the job I was doing for the last 6 weeks (He laughed in my face when I accepted he position and asked for a raise). He said he never tells me to cover my tattoos, but makes the guy's cover theirs.  I told him that was a double standard, wrong, and I didn't agree with that either. I told him that what he was trying to make me do was discrimination against her and I told him it was not a du-rag. He then proceeded to tell me that it was in fact a du-rag and I could ask anyone else in the building, he insisted it was and it was against dress code.  ***Keep in mind*** NO where on our dress code/handbook manual specifies or even mentions that employees cannot wear hats, head pieces, scarves, accessories,  wraps, or headbands, etc.  So, I'm not sure where he got the ""dress code violation from"". When I tried to explain to him that he was being prejudice and discriminating my co-worker and trying to use me to do his dirty work he got even more upset with me. I told him of other instances where he did some questionably discriminatory/sexist and racist things. I even told him it sounded like a personal problem that he needed to address with her personally and I wanted no part in it.  He had nothing to say and ended it with ""If you don't like how we do things here then we can part ways."" and then he sent me home.  He later told my co-workers I walked and then just today he asked my co-worker (the one he wanted to remove the head piece) if she wanted my job.  Keep in mind, I never got officially fired or resigned.  Do I have some sort of case of injustice going on or is this sort of thing totally normal/acceptable?  I just really hate that this happened. I did so much for my job and I truly cared about the work I put into it."	No
2063	My father fell at work (construction) in November 2016, tripping over a tarp on the ground. At the time he was sore but no severe or lasting pain. Two weeks later, he was laid off for the winter season, starting back to work in April. In early December he was casting a fishing rod and his shoulder dislocated. He was able to pop it back in and has been fine until the last few months. He has had his shoulder dislocate a number of times since April and more recently 3 times over the last week. These dislocations are severely painful for him, to the point that the pain is unbearable for him. A doctor's appointment with xray results showed that there was an past (healed) fracture and new liesions, most likely as a result of repeated dislocations. I am wondering if this is a workmans comp issue since the only fall that could have caused a fracture was at work last November, or if this would not qualify for workman's comp.	No
2064	I exchanged nude photos with a girl online, her profile listed that she was 20 years old. After exchanging photos she said she was 16, I immediately stopped talking to her, she told her father, her father has threatened legal action. What is the precedent for something like this?	No
2065	I've just spent the last month in and out of the hospital due to black mold being in the house. I've told the landlord about it several times over the past year, and he refuses to do anything. He finally came in after medics found me unresponsive and sprayed the baseboards, but we won't check to see how far into the wall it's gone. So I'm currently out of the house, and will not be back until I'm positive it's the mold making me sick. I told the landlord I put a stop payment on the rent check until he decides to properly look at the wall and deal with the mold issue, and he gave me an official 3 days eviction notice. With the house not being habitable, can he do this? Is there anything I can do to not be evicted?	No
2066	Hey Legal Advice! First time poster... This advice isn't for me but for my Sister in Law.   She and her friend rented an apartment. Leased it for a year. Both of their names are on the lease.  Her friend ended up losing her job and could not afford her end of the rent. So my very wise SIL decided she wouldn't pay her half and they just agreed to live it out until they got evicted.   Now they have finally been evicted and both have moved home.   My question is what kind of legal issues will my SIL run into? She seems to think that once she is evicted that's the end of that and life moves on. Front what i've heard from a Co-worker is that the Landlord can sue for the rent owed and potentially get wages garnished.   In all honesty this is for mostly my curiosity, however if there is any actual good advice I will pass it on. I just like to sit back and watch the show  This is in Alberta, Canada.	No
2067	Hello,  Odd scenario synopsis - I lease a home which I live in. I sublease some of the bedrooms (with permission from the landlord). I rented one of the bedrooms to a new tenant and had him sign a standard 6 month lease and had him pay first months rent along with a security deposit. I called him a week later (3 weeks before move in) to arrange a move-in time and his phone was off. I have tried calling him everyday since then and his phone has remained off. The move-in date has come and gone and he has not returned to the premises nor contacted me. I don't have an emergency contact or alternate number. He also has a very common name so it is seemingly impossible to track him down on Facebook or other social media.   What are my options here? It's clear something has either happened to him or he does not want to be contacted/found. This is a unique situation because he has not taken possession of the property.

2068	So i met this girl at a club in Berlin and we instantly hit it off. I invited her to take a drink with me at the bar, she agreed and we drank the first sip together at the bar. She then introduced me to her brother, who was 15 years old, and all three of us started dancing. She started holding my hand and moving me closer to her. So i moved and she started dancing dirty with me. After a while i kissed her on the forehead and she just went mad, she took my to another area and we started kissing. She then just suddenly stop and told me she needs to look for her brother. I said okay and thought nothing of it. I returned to the dance floor and started dancing, and she then just found me, came up to me and started kissing me. I thought okay she must have found her brother and told him something so we went to the bathroom and started having sex, she gave me various sexual acts and never once said, implied, nor showed that she was not consenting to this, and told me explicitly to put it in. After we finished i went to take a drink and came back to check up on her. I found her still naked with vomit all over her. I went in cleaned and dressed her up and found her brother to take her home. After a couple of days i got arrested and now accused of a rape charge. She claims that i drugged her drink and went in on her in the bathroom and she started pushing me way and shouting at me. None of which has happened! I dont know anyone who was in the club so i dont have any witnesses who could testify that we were just kissing with her full consent. This is a nightmare i am living and could ruin my whole life. Just the accusation of rape has serious repercussions. What can i do to prove she was consenting, and how can i move forward ? Please help me r/legaladvice	No
2069	"Hello,  My lease is from 2016-09-01 to 2017-08-31.  There is a section that states a 60 day notice is required or else it will automatically renew per diem.  I have a signed document from the landlord dated 2017-08-01 that states 60 day notice is required and therefore I am responsible for rent through 2017/09/30.  Ohio code [5321.17 Termination of tenancy](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/5321.17) states:    &gt; (B) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, the landlord or the tenant may terminate or fail to renew a month-to-month tenancy by notice given the other at least thirty days prior to the periodic rental date.    Does the ""at least thirty days"" from Ohio code supersede the 60 day notice in my lease?  In other words, am I legally responsible for September rent given that I provided 30 day notice?  If I am not legally bound to extend my lease due to automatic renewal, how should I notify my landlord that I will not be renewing the lease and will proceed with leaving at the end of my current leasing term?    Thank you so much for any feedback!  I have no experience in this and your help is greatly appreciated."	No
2070	12/01/2017: Applied for LLC with name &lt;X&gt; with the Arizona Commerce Commision  12/27/2017: LLC was approved as &lt;X&gt;  01/08/2018: Signed first contract work as &lt;My Own Name&gt;  01/16/2018: Received letter that LLC was approved  When I signed the contract I was not aware the LLC was approvied. Did I at that time do business as a Sole Proprietorship or as the LLC even though I did not specify?  I talked to my City and they said I should only apply for a LLC with the city not for a Sole Proprietorship because of the contract.  I'm trying to figure out if I should have the contract corrected to include the LLC or if I can just let everything go as is. Am I going to run into any complications come tax time? Opinions?	No
2071	"My wife and I have been threatened multiple times by the same woman in our apartment complex. She banged on our door and bedroom window at 7am, she banged on our door and screamed curse words at 10pm, threatened my wife that was telling her son to not make barking noises and intimidate our dog, and finally threatened to kill my dogs, my wife and I, if our dogs ever touched her son.  My wife is scared and worried that she might do something. We talked with the leasing office, they stated that they are in the process of making sure this does not happen again and ""unfortunately"" my wife and I will be an example to current residents and future residents. The office told me that for our safety, the only thing we can do is file a police report and work from there. Is it true that all we can do is file a police report and live in fear?  What confuses me is, this crazy woman is threatening us and making us feel unsafe, yet, she gets to do whatever she wants and live comfortably in her apartment while I take my wife to my parents' house and stay there on my days off. My rent is not cheap. I pay $2000+ for a one bedroom apartment...and it infuriates me that we cannot live comfortably and that we will be spending basically half the month at my parents' house due to this woman WHILE paying $2000+ for an apartment that cannot even be called home.  TL;DR - Threatened multiple times by a resident. We do not feel safe at our apartment. What can we do?"	No
2072	"Hi LegalAdvice  A section in my lease contains the following: ""Lessee shall not at anytime allow local/municipal inspection or inspectors on lessors property. Any housing violation, fine, or fee associated with this type of inspection is the responsibility of the lessee.  Any fee or repairs not done or paid in a timely manner within 20 days is grounds for termination of the lease.""   This doesn't seem legal; if a building inspector shows up, I'm supposed to tell him he can't inspect the property?  And if I do, I am held liable for any fees, even for situations where the lessor refused to make repairs to the building (water leak creating rotten flooring).   Looks like this [Link](http://petriepettit.com/blog/landlord-tenant/so-are-illegal-provisions-in-wisconsin-residential-rental-agreements-severable-or-not) says our lease is void, but I'm trying to understand if I have ground to stand on before paying a lawyer to write a letter.  Any insight is appreciated.  Thanks all!"	No
2073	Several years ago I received a REALLY racist email from a business in Louisiana that was intended for somebody else. It was sent from a work address, so I forwarded it to the sender's management. Management sent a very weak apology, and that was the end of it.  A few days ago, I was telling somebody about it, and found out while Googling that the person who sent the message is still employed there, and has apparently been promoted.  I'd like to go on a few review sites like Yelp and and tell this story, so that potential customers will know what sort of business/people they are dealing with. I have two concerns:  - Will the fact that this is all veritably true going to keep me out of legal trouble?  - Is the confidentiality threat at the bottom of their emails as hollow as I think it is?  Also, if it matters, the business is in Louisiana but I am in Massachusetts.	No
2074	"So about half a year ago I noticed a $200 ish charge on my credit card that I had not made. Looked up the company in question and found many complaints about continued charges after cancelling the service this company provides (online dating). I then called my bank and got them to mark the charge as fraud and they sent me a new card. Yesterday I received a letter from a credit services company. The letter begins by saying this is a 72 hour demand. It goes on tell me it has been sent in accordance with provincial legislation and that the credit service has attempted to find a solution with me, though this is the first time I have heard anything from this company since a had to get a new credit card. Then it says the debt is past due and IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION may be the only way to resolve the matter. It tells me after obtaining a provincial court order they may garnish my wages, attach real estate or property I own, seize money in my accounts, seize and sell assets and have my finances examined in court. ""There is still time to deal with the matter"" it goes on to say but if no reply is received in 72 hours they will make a referral back to the client for IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION with no further notice to me. What should I do?"	No
2075	"Hi, I am A server at a locally owned Chinese restaurant. Pretty regularly the owners will ""punish"" us for not doing a good enough job by taking money off our paychecks. Our base pay is only 25 dollars for a full 12 hour shift (with no breaks). I generally end up making around 16 an hour here after tips, but these deductions are making me worried.

2076	"Marina del Rey, California.  I know that certain appliances are in the unit as a ""courtesy"" and landlord takes no responsibility for repair. This applies to my washer/dryer. However, upon moving in, I discovered the washer leaks water everywhere and was not in working condition when we entered into the lease.  For more background, I rented a condo from an individual landlord. It's a nice place with high rent, and I deliberately looked for a place with an in-unit washer/dryer after not having one at my old place. I would not have signed the lease had I known the washer wasn't in working condition. Part of me thinks it's my fault for not checking, but part of me thinks there's no way to check...it's not like you can run a load of laundry in the ~15-20 minutes you see the unit!  Am I SOL here?"	No
2077	I'm not entirely sure if this is a fixable problem, but any advice would be much appreciated!  I had a baby three weeks ago, and we found out that there is something in our apartment that makes it hard for him to breathe. We tried everything: cleaning, laundry, air purifiers, humidifiers, etc. think it's smoke from another apartment, but don't know how to prove it. My husband and I have been staying with the baby at my parents' house for a few days, and he hasn't had any trouble breathing. We took him back to the apartment for a few hours last night, and he started to have trouble breathing again. Whatever is bothering him, it was on all of the clothes we brought back with us until we washed them.   Would it be possible to break our lease without penalty, if we can't live there? We need to find somewhere else to live, but that's not an option if we're stuck paying for this apartment. Our lease isn't up until December, and I can't seem to find anything definitive about options for breaking it. It looks like the management needs to make a good effort to lease out the apartment, if we say we don't want to stay, but I don't know how that will work out.  Thank you so much for your help and advice!	No
2078	This takes place in housing located Port Arthur Texas. It's a section 8 lease.  We've been staying at my parents house partly because it is so nasty. There have been roaches since day one but it didn't seem overtly bad. We've been out of this place for the past 4 weeks. We went back there to clean things out yesterday...  There are roaches everywhere. We have filed several requests for people to come by and spray, even before it was this bad.  Supposedly people have come by but the roaches are still literally everywhere. Mold is covering a decently expensive couch and chair to the point of it not being  even worth salvaging. There's mold on the kitchen counters and table. There is a fee for not removing all belongings before the lease is up. Should we be required to pay the fee and is there any way we could be compensated for damages to said couch and chair? Clothes have to be washed as well, like 20 plus loads.	No
2079	"My apartment complex had a document they wanted me to sign when renewing my lease.  The complex would not acknowledge or deny if the document was a lease addendum and required me to agree to energy use inspections (it was a copy of a notice they sent to all residents earlier in the year, only this time with a signature line).  I sought the advice of an attorney, who advised me to assert my legal tenant rights in a signing statement along with my signature.     The complex responded by issuing me a notice to quit eviction and that they will not renew my lease, their attorney stating I was an at will tenant citing MI law (how dare I question their authority!)  Obviously, I brought this to my lawyer because I know this was a government regulated complex, a tax credit property, and it's illegal without ""good cause"" to refuse to renew a lease or evict (I confirmed this through my own legal research and it was affirmed by my lawyer).   After my lawyer refuted their lawyer's eviction reasoning, he then turned around and claimed it was a mistake on his part and that their ""good cause"" was because I refused to sign the document unaltered, and they refused to agree to my so-called terms.  This was clearly not the case.  After the two attorneys went back and forth, the complex dropped the eviction.  I agreed I would sign the document with no statements in exchange with a legally binding statement from their attorney outlining the intent of the agreement, and that it will not be exploited in ways I feared (if they had just stated this stuff in the agreement along with calling it a lease addendum it would have never been a problem).    Had it gone to court and the judge ruled in my favor, we would have requested to recoup attorney fees.  The matter has been resolved, and I now expect to owe my attorney ~$600.  Would I have any chance in small claims in getting some or all of this money back?  I feel I shouldn't be responsible for asserting my legal rights as a tenant and be on the hook for the time spent over the eviction attempt and want them to pay every last penny for this circus."	No
2080	I'm 15 and got caught stealing at Walmart I know I'm really dumb so don't bother commenting saying I'm dumb i know I am for this but in all honesty I need to know What my options are here . I stole under $30 worth of merchandise (2 iPhone chargers) and they caught me and took me to a room and officers came and wrote me a ticket or whatever . I gave them my first and last name as well as the first initial to my middle name but keep in mind this happened in Texas and I live in Florida. I gave the officers my old house address which is a rental house and they said I have until august 7th to go to court and pay a fine or they will put out a warrant for my arrest. So the question is should I tell my parents or just leave it alone and don't worry about them trying to find me back in Florida ? since they don't have my real address. Will they be able to put a warrant for my arrest in Only Texas since this all happened in Texas or Florida too ? or would they still be able to find me? can I pay this over the phone without showing up to court since I leave Texas tomorrow ?	No
2081	"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_mealperiods.htm For reference.  The law, as I interpret it: If I don't get a lunch within the 1st 5 hours of work, they need to pay me an extra hour's worth of pay. So if I get to work at 6 AM, work until 1 PM, get a 30 minute lunch then, then keep working till 5:30, they need to pay(All numbers pre-tax):  1) 6 AM to 1 PM - 7 hours of straight pay. Say $20/hour for a total of $140   2) Nothing from 1 PM to 1:30 PM - Unpaid lunch   3) 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM - 1 hour of straight pay. Another $20/hour, total of $20   4) 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM - 3 hours of overtime @$30/hour  - Total of $90   5) Since I didn't get my lunch at the correct hour, one more hour of pay at regular time - $20    I learned about point 5 recently, and did the math - it ties out to within the dollar on pre-tax amounts if 1-4 are included, but 5 is nowhere to be seen. Am I correct in thinking that they're missing that pay?  Additional details, since so much about labor law is in the details:  1) I work for a bank   2) I'm salary non-exempt   3) I'm in an operations position   4) I don't oversee anyone   5) I'm not in the entertainment industry     Standard: If correct, the usual advice seems to be ""Go file a complaint with the labor board, be prepared for retaliation."" My current plan is this: I have a mentor who's midway up the food chain without a dog in the fight. I'd like to give the company a chance to fix it themselves. I figure I can talk with him, see if he can get a review of pay going, and hopefully everything will be fixed without needing to go to the labor board. Else, off to the labor board I go, most likely.   Is anything wrong about my reasoning? Have I made any fatal mistakes anywhere? Is my interpretation of the law incorrect? (The law in question I'm looking at is also on the break room board)  Thank you!"	No
2082	"My girlfriend and I moved into our new place last weekend, and we had the movers before we had the key.  It was agreed between all parties that the unit would be suitable for move-in on 7/7.  When we obtained the key, we immediately realized that the entire apartment smelled of smoke, the hardwood floors were covered with dirt, the carpet was filthy, the dishwasher was falling out of the carpentry, there was rat feces behind the fridge and on the back of the fridge, the bathroom sink was broken, there was mold on the ceiling of the living room and bathroom, and the piping for the tub needed to be replaced (this was not found out until the next day).  Since we were in a hurry, we did not get a copy of our lease.  And since the movers had arrived and were being paid by the hour, we started moving items into a dirty apartment.  When we went into the office, we are told that we cannot look at any lease until the Apartment Manager returns from vacation (next tuesday).  This is our first issue about the situation.  A plumber came last night and opened the walls to see that there was a non-lethal methane leak that was taking place and that the pipes from the top down needed to be replaced.  The lady quoted the maintenance guy for $500, and the leasing office refused to pay the amount; they stated that they could fix it themselves.  We went up to the office within 3 days after moving in to request to terminate the lease and the lady behind the counter chuckled at my girlfriend and replied with a sarcastic, ""mmmkay"".    I realize that we made some serious poor decisions, but I want to know what my best moves would be here.  Thank you in advance for your assistance."	No
2083	I bought my home about 3 years ago.  I had seen that the FHA was changing their rules for cancelling PMI, I made sure I got a conventional loan and could cancel the PMI when I had 80% LTV, which I double checked on the mortgage papers I signed.  About 6 months after I bought the home, I was informed that Fannie Mae was buying my mortgage and BlahBank would service it.  The letter they sent informed me nothing would change except where I sent my payments.  Now, I've reached an 80% LTV through a combination of my payments and the house appreciating.  I called BlahBank to remove the PMI.  They researched my mortgage and sent me a letter saying that I have to meet Fannie Mae's standards to remove the PMI, which are stricter than my mortgage documents.  I spoke to another representative from BlahBank told me that because Fannie Mae owns the mortgage, they have to follow those policies.  He's said he would look into it and send me some paperwork, but I'm dubious they'll send me anything besides a restatement of my last letter.  Waiting until I qualify to remove my PMI under Fannie Mae will cost me around $5-6K.  That's enough to hurt, but likely not enough to justify hiring an attorney.  Isn't the mortgage I signed a contract?  Can Fannie Mae unilaterally change the terms just because they bought the debt?  If the next letter comes with the same information, I'm planning on sending a QWR.  Is this the kind of situation those letters are used for?	No
2084	"Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, and also- throwaway because I'm paranoid.  I had an appointment with my regular podiatrist back in June. I've been a patient for years and have never missed an appointment. The doctor is very well-respected in our area and is booked out months in advance.   On Thursday, June 8th, I got an email at 4:45 PM stating I had an appointment on Monday, June 12th at 1:45 PM. There was not an option to cancel the appointment from the email, so I called the next day, June 9th to cancel my appointment. The time of my call was 1:52 PM. When I spoke with the woman on the phone, I told her I had to cancel my appointment for Monday. She went ahead and cancelled it.  A couple of weeks ago, I received a bill from the doctors office for $35 for a ""missed appointment fee"". I called the office to remind them that I did in fact call, and I would be happy to being in a copy of my phone records to show I spoke with someone. The lady said because I called at 1:52 and not 1:45, I was outside of the 24-hour business day window so I had to be assessed a fee.   There was absolutely nothing in writing saying that I had to cancel 24 hours in advance, Not only that, but the same woman who I've been speaking with on the phone didn't inform me on Friday (when I called to cancel) that I would have to pay a fee regardless because I was outside of that window. Why would by bill say missed appointment fee instead of late-cancellation fee? The only conclusion I could come up with is that she dropped the ball on her end and now I'm left   The office wont budge and I fear that this will end up in collections. It's a small amount, but it's twice what my copay would have been and I literally live paycheck to paycheck, on the penny. I don't know what else I can do from here. Is there a way to dispute it without going through the office?"	No
2085	Hi,      Here's a quick overview of my problem :      I'm French, my girlfriend is American, we've been together for 2 years (she came to France for a year, and i went 2 times to the US for 3 months).      We want to get married and live together in the US, but i currently don't have any visa except for the ESTA 3-months tourist visa.      I came to the US 2 weeks ago with the intent to stay for 3 months, get married, and figure something out to stay here legally.      I ran into some trouble at the border with the officer telling me that i can't apply for any visa after getting married, as this would be illegal.      Fair enough, i explained i just wanted to get married, go back to france after the 3 months and come back again right after to do the visa, at which point he got angry and told me i couldn't even get married on US soil (which is total bullshit based on my researches)      We're not really sure what to do at this point.   Apparently getting married and acquiring a visa are not seen as a good thing, so maybe i should find a way to get a visa without getting married, and get married afterwards ?      From what i saw there's only 2 visa i could apply for : K-1 and CR1.      For now my gf makes enough money to support both of us, but eventually i'd like to work as well.   No rush though, for now we simply want to be together, even if i can't work.      Here's my plan for now : Get married, go back to France once my current 3-months visa is expired, apply for a long term tourist visa, go back to the US whenever the tourist visa is approved, apply for a K-1 visa once i'm in the US.   I'm worried i might run into trouble because of the marriage.      What do you think ? Any better idea ?	No
2086	I was asked from my insurance to show proof of my citizenship so I sent in my I-94A. A couple days later they said they needed the hard copy. When I told them I didn't know what that was, they explained it was a form that I should have received the same time I got the I-94A. I'm just curious as to what it looks like or what information it has on it because I have a lot documents to go through and I'm not sure which one it could be. And if I don't have it, how would I go on my way to obtaining it?	No

These appear to be of no concern to the HOA president and my best bet, is they will stay.   I'm not looking to ""punish"" my other neighbors, in fact we all get along great.  But with the overwhelming sense of being singled out, burdened and forced to sell my belongings or incur storage costs, I would find it reasonable to ensure continuity and compliance with rest of the neighborhood.   Otherwise yeah, just me.   Do I become ""that neighbor"" that keeps writing letters to the HOA, or can I ensure the others are being equally notified?  I can drop it too."	No
2088	Currently my roommate and I are renting an apartment for 1010 a month and have a year long lease. Since fall semester is coming up apartment companies are marketing like crazy and we found out that our management is now offering our same exact style of two bedroom apartments for only 700 a month. We contacted them and inquired about the price decline and they said that we are locked into the above 1010 price. Anything we can do?	No
2089	I currently work in Minnesota. I have both personal and vacation hours that can be used for whatever reason. I recently accepted a position at a different company and was told by my current employer that I owed $870.00 in overused vacation hours.   What I realized was that even though we have access to the entire year's vacation as of January 1st each year, we earn them by accruing them throughout the year. I currently have gone over in vacation from what I have earned at this point in the year by 35 hours. I am a non-exempt employee.  The frustrating part is that I currently have 89 hours of unused personal time that will just be lost. My employer has informed me that our payroll system does not allow personal and vacation days to be switched after being processed. I have been asked to initial a document to allow me last paycheck to be garnished for the $870.00. If I do not sign it, the company has the right to take legal action to recoup the funds.   Is this common? If I do not sign it is it likely that legal action will occur? I understand that I should have researched the company policies beforehand, I am just disappointed that I have so many personal hours that I could have used instead. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
2090	Hi so my mom has an interview with TD bank Wednesday regarding a $600 fee on her line of credit because it was increased without her knowing. I'm wondering what she should say for them to remove the fee from her account. I believe this happened a while ago and she has just noticed now. She states TD told her line of credit has been increased to $200000 and she has to pay $600 for having this. She said she never made the increase. Any help is obviously appreciated as we gave until Wednesday for clarification as TD isn't helping her worth shit. Hoping I can get something here :) thx	No
2091	So as started above my SO and I put a deposit down on an apartment and signed a price agreement.   The tenant that lives there has now stated that he has no intention of leaving anymore. Is there anything we can do?   Also the apartment complex is now offering us a smaller apartment (roughly 50sq ft smaller) and is asking for more a month then we agreed on for the previous unit that we reserved. Or offering us our deposit back.   We're a week and a half away from our move in date.   We're also 2 weeks away from having to leave our current place because there is a tenant moving in after us.   The market for apartment is extremely competitive in utah and doesn't allow for an impromptu move. We would need atleast a month for somthing to open up and be able to move into it.   Is there any action or advice you all have. Litterally anything would help.	No
2092	"I've been honorably discharged from the military. Under the military clause in my lease it says that with proof of orders (in this case, it's ""separation orders"") and rent for 30 days I am able to break my lease.

2093	"Typical preface of, if this isn't in the right subreddit please let me know:  We have asked the Leasing Manager at our apartment if we could talk about some sort of compensation/etc. on our rent this month to offset the increased cost of our electric bill this month.(Dehumidifier/Fans/AC) We're told ""we're glad you have renters insurance, they will gladly replace what was damaged"". In response we said ""renters insurance isn't going to reimburse our increased energy bill, time off work, and general inconvenience of being forced to live in a room for a week."" To that the director said, ""A water heater breaking is not our responsibility. We (the complex) didn't cause it to break, but if you (my husband and I) would like to e-mail a formal request for this I will gladly forward it to the corporate offices."" To add insult to injury, our ceiling collapsing came the day after my husband's car had been broken into for the THIRD time while living here and the same manager saying ""it's not our responsibility"" when I asked for increased security on property to prevent this from happening again.  Now, long story short, we understand if that representative doesn't have the authority to authorize anything like that, but we would still like to plead our case to them the best we can. We would like some advice on how best to word this e-mail to effectively communicate our frustration and show them how awful this entire situation has been, and their lack of empathy hasn't helped at all. *bonus* if possible, advice on how to terminate our lease(without penalty) 2 months early would also be appreciated as we no longer feel safe living in this complex, and the entire thing has left a sour taste in our mouths.  Thank you in advanced."	No
2094	In my apartment, maintenance has been out a few times to fix the AC. As it stands, midwest summer has kicked into full gear and it's not unusual for my apartment to exceed 80 degrees, occasionally getting to the upper eighties at peak heat. While I work in hot environments and so have built up a resistance to the heat, I have a 10 month old who is having more trouble with it. A quick googling shows that most experts say infants should be kept at about 72 degrees when sleeping, so getting above eighty seems to be not recommended. It's especially bad at night, when he is sleeping, as even then the apartment stays around eighty and keeps him fairly restless.  My question is, under Kansas law, when does this become an unlivable residence and I can lawfully break the lease? My research is showing these things to be a bit obtuse, and I'm not sure if having a young child in the apartment makes any difference. I've been more or less told that the AC is working as hard as it can and that there's just not much more that can be done. Am in good standing with the landlord, if that helps the legal situation at all.  Thanks guys.	No
2095	All of the following events took place within the last week. I live in a gated student living apartment complex for university kids. From the end of July to August is move out and in. I was moving out of one house to another in the same gated complex. I got permission to move into my new house one day early (Thursday) from one of the ladies who works in our front office (I'm not quite sure her official position but she basically deals with the kids and obviously has some authority, I will call her Sam just to help keep track. Sam gave me permission but said I'd be working around cleaners, I was fine with that. So I move some of my stuff in early, approximately one fourth, not seeing anybody at all. I left a note saying this was my stuff and I had permission to move in early. The next day, Friday, I return and all of my things have been moved into the bathroom and new carpets put in. I didn't end up moving much more stuff Friday because I thought they might've wanted the stuff left there to finish cleaning. Early Saturday, I drove by and saw Mexican cleaning ladies going in and out, I decided to wait to move my stuff so I wouldn't be in their way. When I finally returned Saturday, all of my things had been moved downstairs by the door and several valuables were missing (unopened basketball shoes, gear vr, old phone, my girlfriend's dog bet etc.. basically just things that were obvious you would take to make money on or keep for yourself). I contacted Sam immediately and she came over, apologized and promised to get a hold of the cleaning company. Sunday morning I emailed Sam and told her I was going to file a police report. She showed up at my old house with one of the people that would be moving in (there are several per house, I was the only one in my new house so far though). She told me that basically she had been trying to get a hold of the cleaning company all that time (Saturday-Approximately Noon Sunday) and that they didn't want me to file a report because the cleaning ladies were illegals. I was understanding and she said the guy who they worked for would move some money around and have it to me by Wednesday (today). Come today I email and ask about my money, instead of Sam replying, it is another lady in the office and she tells me to come in to talk to her. I go in and they basically blind side, me tell me to file a report, tell me they won't give me names of employees who were in my apartment that day (I'll have to get them from the company, who they hired independantly), and take me on a legal roundabout basically just trying to cover their butt. I got a bit upset and obviously when I brought up the fact that they knowing hired illegals she ignored it. I'm not sure if I can make an insurance claim because I hadn't switched the address yet, but frankly I don't want to. What is my legal recourse against the apartment complex. I have a friend who was in the room when Sam said they were illegals and he is willing to testify. Getting my money back for my things would be nice, but I would much prefer revenge for how they handled the whole situation and lied to me.	No
2096	For me this is very unusual, candidate want rent reduced in $200.00 dollars a month. The second year, six month in advance. Is there any legal or extra tax fees for receiving a lump sum for advance rent?  Thanks for the help.	No
2097	So I was out at 1am with friends, and I had 2 oz of weed in my bag. Cops were called by the neighbor, they showed up detained us and kept me bc of my weed I also had a scale but they gave it back. I'm 16 this is my first offense. What's going to happen at court ?	No
2098	I received a move-out invoice from my former landlord to the tune of my entire $1700 security deposit to replace and repair a garbage disposal and a refrigerator ice maker unit. Thing is, I never used these during my two-year tenancy and would've had no idea if they were or were not in working condition.  On top of this, he is charging me $400 for repainting one room (said he deducted $200 for normal wear-and-tear, so really $600) for some black marks on the wall. We're talking a room that is probably 10'x10' and all solid off-white. I just painted my entire 3200 sq. ft. house for less than that.  Am I on the hook for these exorbitant charges? I feel like I am being fleeced. Unfortunately, I have no pictures from move out as I didn't think there would be any issues. Any repairs I've needed in the past were taken care of and handled properly by both parties.  Thanks for any advice.	No
2099	My rent is $1200 a month. I recently requested the apartment install a washer and dryer in my unit, which according to them, is $40 a month added to rent. It took them a month to get the washer and dryer installed, and I ever signed a new lease or any paperwork indicating that I agree to pay for the washer and dryer. The last rent bill included the cost for the washer and dryer. Can they arbitrarily increase the billable amount of my rent without me ever signing anything agreeing to pay for it? I get that I requested the washer and dryer, but they forgot to send me a new lease to sign (their mistake, not mine).	No
2100	I'm the victim here, I have not acquired a lawyer yet. I just discovered more info for the prosecution to use in my favor but the trial date is probably in the next few weeks. How likely am I able to postpone the trial? Thanks in advance.	No
2101	I'm not exactly sure if this is the right thread for this, but I need some insight and don't know where else to go. My boyfriend and I went to hard summer this weekend, and on Saturday he got caught selling ecstasy pills and I got caught in the cross fire. Before entering the event he asking if I could bring in his ecstasy pills ( 7 pills , Oreos and jacks) for him, I said sure. We made it through security with the pills. About 15 mins later he asks for me to give him the pills , so I hand him the pills, and he walks towards the guy he was going to sell to. They do the sale and my boyfriend gets handcuffed immediately and seconds later I get handcuffed.  We got the exact same charges. Poss of controlled substance, transportation of controlled substance and conspiracy( 3 felonies). Now the only possible charge that is actually reasonable for me is possession because I did have his pills on me. The other 2 are complete BS because I was unaware of the sale and everything else. I literally just brought his pills inside the venue.  I really need some advice here on what to do. Does anyone know any good public defenders in San Bernardino ?   P.s. This was my first time in jail and ever getting arrested, I'm a full time college student and work full time Also please do not lecture me, I know I shouldn't even been around him if he was selling, I just didn't think about all the repercussions.  This is in San Bernardino California	No
2102	I was backing out of my driveway and I stupid stupid stupidly was distracted and hit my neighbor's van. They were parked across the street. There's a dent in it now and I just drove off (it was around 9 pm). I later saw that they parked the van on their driveway from the street. I don't have insurance yet, and I feel bad making my parents pay for it because we're having a lot of financial troubles. I just feel so so so guilty because they're such good and nice people. :( and my car doesn't have any dents on it - just a scruff. I know I fucked up massively and I know I'm a huge fuckup for doing this.	No
2103	Hello!  I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.  This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.  When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?  Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.  Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.  I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.  I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.  At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.  I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)  It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.  **tl:dr University won't accept payment via an AmeriCorps award, won't release transcript, how do I negotiate with them?**	No
2104	A work colleague is moving here from France in August 2017. He will eventually be purchasing my car, but can not get a state driver's license or registration until he has a social security number. This can apparently take up to 6 weeks. The US midwest in a small town is difficult to navigate without a car.  I want to help him out, but dont want to be liable for any accidents.  What is my best option to stay legally safe but still help him?	No
2105	Location: Pennsylvania, US.  Short version: I want to know whether [this section of my lease](http://imgur.com/a/onNqz) would actually hold up in court, because a lot of my property was damaged as a result of water seeping into my basement room.  Longer version:  I rented out a bedroom in the basement of an old duplex. The duplex and the others in its complex were new acquisitions by the property group that I'm renting from, and are kind of fixer-uppers, to put it nicely. I understand that the property group likely doesn't have the money to fix everything immediately after buying these properties, and have asked little of them in terms of maintenance - I try not to bug them unless something is a big problem.  There are two rooms in the basement, my room and a laundry room. The laundry room leaks whenever someone on the ground floor takes a shower, and that is pretty much the only thing that I asked my landlords to address. They sent someone to try to fix it a couple of times, but to no avail. They also placed a dehumidifier in the laundry room. In contrast, my room surprisingly did not have any moisture problems for much of the year, despite the floor being warped from what looked like water damage (which I noted in my security deposit form). That is, until a month or so ago, when I began to notice that the top of my bed would occasionally feel very slightly damp. I didn't think much of it, and didn't mention it to my landlords; it wasn't a big enough of a problem that I didn't mind living with it for the two months remaining on my lease, and I doubted that they would be able to do anything about it anyway. Fast forward to about a week ago, when I happened to look under my bed, and I discovered that there had formed a pretty significant mold problem. It had infested my bed frame, my mattress, and the bottoms of all of my dressers, as well as some clothes that were in the bottom drawers of the dressers, and some other smaller odds and ends.  I filed a claim with my renter's insurance about a week ago, informed my landlords of the situation, and spoke with the renter's insurance agency again today, and they said that they don't cover that sort of damage, and that generally this sort of thing would be my landlords' responsibility. I looked over my lease, and found [this section](http://imgur.com/a/onNqz) of it that specifically indemnifies them of responsibility for this kind of damage. Is that something that would hold up in court? It seems to me like it shouldn't, since they rented an apartment to me that clearly had had a history of water seepage based on the damage to the floor. I estimate that there's about $1500 in damage to my property, and would very much like to avoid all of that falling on me.  As a follow-up question: I signed another lease with the same property group for another duplex in the same complex for next year starting this month, before all of this started unfolding. It's for another basement room, and I'm worried about the same thing happening. If I discover moisture in the next room, is that enough legal ground to declare the room uninhabitable and get out of the lease?  Thank you very much for your time and expertise.	No
2106	I just rented a two floor apartment in NYC, the top floor is the ground floor level and the lower floor is below ground - this floor has three doors out of the apartment, but no windows. My landlord told us when we signed the lease that the basement is intended for recreational use only, but not to be used as a bedroom. Is this something they're allowed to legally enforce?	No
2107	Baltimore, MD  We moved out of our last apartment at the beginning of June. Since then we've been trying to get into contact with our old landlord, trying to get some sort of response re: our security deposit ($800+interest-damages). He never sent us a list of damages or the cost of those damages. He hasn't responded to any of our emails (we've emailed at least twice).  The thing is... the last time we saw him (in April or May), he said he had been in (basic?) training and was heading off for deployment. Based on his linkdin profile, it looks like he's been with the military for several years. It seems that he's in some sort of abroad training program, not quite active duty. I'm not really sure I understand the technicalities, but I feel like he must have some sort of way he can communicate. He never gave us a phone number or email address or anything for someone to contact while he's away who can act on his behalf regarding the property.  I'm just really stumped on what to do here. I think I read that after 45 days if the landlord doesn't send a list of damages/repair costs, they forfeit the security deposit and any interest it accrued.  So I'm hoping to get some input on this. I'd really love to avoid having to get a lawyer... it doesn't seem worth it if it's going to end up costing me more than $800. But we also could really use that money because our wedding is next year.  Thanks reddit.	No
2108	"throwaway account, I'm a guy.    Saskatchewan, Canada--I have had troubles with the tenants above me since October 2016 when I moved in, have had to request repeatedly in writing they stop harassing my family and so forth. The landlord can't do anything, he's not doing anything wrong himself and is an excellent guy. Other tenants and neighbors are flawless.    The people upstairs have gotten themselves some sort of heat-sensitive camera and are following my every move, down to my every little hand gesture. I can 'control' them from below by putting on a show. They follow me around. If I use the range or oven they react, if I light a lighter they all run over and see what's up.    Previous to their new toy, they would send their little 4-year-old girl out to try and see me naked when I got out of the shower. They would listen for the water to stop, then as soon as I stepped out of the tub they'd send her out to look in my window. My landlord said to 'get it on tape' but I don't want to be filming some little girl outside my window either.    Now I can't be myself in my home, they watch when I pee, when I jerk off (and the little girl squeals ""Ewww!"" when I do), then she gets all excited and runs outside and runs around to my window again. The tenants upstairs are abusing their little girl but I just want peace and quiet, quiet enjoyment of my suite, etc.    Is what they're doing legal? Is it child abuse if they're only watching a high-resolution heat signature? I am in a province where child abuse is swept under the rug, Social Services does nothing, police do nothing. I don't even know how to comprehend what is going on but they are disgusting, perverted people.    It's all-women upstairs and they come and go on schedule like employees. There's the retarded mom (fat with a mustache), her screetchy autistic perverted/abused daughter, and 2 or 3 big fat care workers ladies who rotate on a fixed schedule, arrive in taxis, leave on schedule. I think the single mom isn't allowed to be alone with her daughter but you get that much crazy all in one spot, no men, and the bored catty bitches amuse themselves by harassing the downstairs tenants.    The Landlord has done all he can, to the point where he said if we can't all get along he would evict the entire dwelling and start again, which is an empty threat--I have done nothing but avoid and react to this continued crazyness and I replied to him in writing saying I'd fight it and win because ""getting harassed by other tenants"" won't be grounds for eviction.    I want to build a heated faraday cage to block them out or take apart toasters and use the elements to create a heat shield or something, I mean... what can I even do? Are they breaking the law? If so, how can I even prove it? I don't know what to do, how would I even call the police to report it without sounding like a crazy person?"	No
2109	"7 of my friends went camping on a Monday night, I had work unfortunately. They were camping at a site where camping isn't allowed but many people camp there anyways. After being there for a few hours, a man and woman came to the camp site and held a gun(later revealed to probably be a pellet gun) to the back of my friends head. He started saying things like, ""Are you prepared to die?"" And remained there pointing the gun from person to person for about 10 minutes. From this I have found out his name and I am wondering what sort of action, preferably legal, we should take against him. Is there anything we can do considering they were camping illegally?"	No
2110	"[Colorado] Hi /r/legaladvice! This is my first time posting as I really haven't needed legal advice before. That being said, below is the jist of what is happening:  * We rented back a home we had just purchased to the sellers * We had a post-occupancy agreement stating that the sellers had to maintain the house (including landscaping and cleanliness) as it was when we closed. * The agreement stated that if anything broke (i.e. irrigation etc it was on our dime, but neglect was on them). * They claimed the sprinklers worked in the disclosure and on the inspection resolution and even had a company turn it on and write that it was operational, but 1 of the 4 valves did not work when we moved in and a large number of the sprinkler heads didn't work. They did not inform us of this during the rent-back period. We didn't check the irrigation system during the closing process as they hadn't turned it on and we said it was fine if they did it when they saw fit as the lawn was in great shape when we bought it and they said it would be operational. * They neglected the landscaping (by either lying about the sprinklers working, or not telling us they broke) killing about 1/4 of the lawn on a 1/3 acre lot.  * They did not cut back trees which had overgrown to the point you couldn't walk to the front door without ducking. * They allowed their moving truck to park on the front lawn killed a big patch * They left the interior dirty * I have pictures of what the house looked like at closing and what it looked like when we moved in and it is pretty obvious they didn't take care of the exterior. * We paid a pro to fix the sprinklers ($350) and did the rest ourselves (around 30 hours of work to restore it to how it was at closing) * We sent a letter stating we were keeping the security deposit ($1,000) and listed the reasons why (I screwed up and forgot to mention the interior being dirty) * They responded to the letter vaguely threatening us that they would take further action if we did not return the funds. They also said they had been driven by on multiple occasions because they ""have fond memories of the house"" and that we hadn't done any maintenance which is both untrue and disturbing to me.  Questions:  1. Are we in the right to keep the funds? 2. If they take me to (what I assume would be small claims court) should I get an attorney or handle it myself?"	No
2111	"We asked our landlord to end the lease early, fought back and forth and she agreed, then dropped off a dated and signed letter saying ""I have found new tenants I am letting you out of the lease early"" then wrote a bunch of other demands that she has saying we need to meet and agree and sign to these demands she wants, pay for the gardener for the rest of the year for the new tenants, pay for cleaning services that aren't in our lease, she actually went ahead and hand wrote them into her lease, without our signatures and is trying to say see its in my lease you have to do it lol. Because the 30 day notice is coming up on Tuesday shes telling us that if we don't come sign this paper tomorrow saying we agree to her demands that she is going to go cancel the new lease with the new tenants, and hold us accountable for the remainder of the years rent. What should we do?"	No
2112	Allegheny and beaver courts, PA. So I've finished my dui suspension length and have satisfied all my requirements, aside from paying off all my court fines. Under act 122 the court will not release my completion of treatment to the DMV until I have paid all court cost/restitution. I went back to school shortly after my duis (3 almost 4 years ago). Since then I haven't been in any trouble legally but I haven't been working because of school. So my license would be very helpful with travel requirements for work/internship. I've made regular payments over this time, but they aren't enough to cover all of my costs. Is there a way to petition for certification of my completion to be transferred to the DMV from courts, without paying all of my fines?? Thanks for any advice!	No
2113	Hello LegalAdvice,  I live in Michigan, and I have been renting an apartment with my girlfriend for 6 months. During this 6 month period, we have been having nothing but problems with our upstairs neighbors. They have been terrorizing the entire apartment complex.   They've been pounding on the neighbor's door across the hall late at night, and barking at their door to mess with their dog. They've been excessively stomping on the floor to disturb us at all times of the day, including late at night. Additionally, about 2 months ago, they've started dropping fire crackers from their bedroom window and having them explode feet away from ours, waking us up at 10, 11, 2, and 4 am. I have had to call the police on them 4 times.  The landlord has not done anything about it. He's stated that there's nothing he can do. It's almost like he doesn't read his lease agreement. How he can evict someone for 3+ police visits, and continual nuance compaints. (I am not the only one that has complained about them).   The landlord just doesn't want to lose residents, so he wont evict. But I guess he fails to see that he will lose residents over them?   Anyway, we're wanting to terminate our own lease because the landlord isn't following any of his tenant policies, and he isn't guaranteeing a peaceful living situation.  Are we able to do this without paying the rest of the years rent? I do not want to stay here for 6 more months dealing with constant stomping, pointless police visits, and firecrackers at my windows in the middle of the night. It's driving my girlfriend and I insane.   Please help!	No
2114	I am looking for advice on how to proceed with my outstanding debts from the last decade or so, and have not found a good place to get advice so figured I would try here since Credit Counselors only want to run your credit report and clean that up for you...my questions go back further than that.  So, I have been on the run from my debts for about 10 years.  Most of my debt has fallen off of my credit report, but I have a lot of money (for me...I would guess about $15-20K) still owed on these accounts that are no longer on my credit report and sold to various collection agencies.  I have moved multiple times and avoided requesting credit unless absolutely necessary (utilities, etc) to try and fall off the collection radar.  I never intended on getting credit again or buying a house, was young, and needless to say lacking foresight.  Now, it's 10 years since I ran from my debt, I have been married a few years to a woman who had a mortgage already.  We applied for a credit card 3 years ago and got approved.  It makes me nervous to have credit, and we have already managed to get ourselves into 4k worth of debt in just a few years.  We collectively also owe about 3K to the IRS we are paying off in installments as a result of our witholding being wrong for a few years but not being able to afford to correct the error.  We are no longer being undertaxed so we should work out closer to 0 this year and not go further into debt to the IRS.  My wife would like to look at selling our house and moving closer to work, but we don't qualify for good interest rates unless my income is included, but I have dings on my credit report and I don't end up helping.  I am nervous because I feel once I get assets on paper, someone might get the idea to accumulate my debt and sue me for the full amount once I have something worth taking like a house.  As of now, the house is in my wife's name.  Bottom line, what is my recourse for these old debts?  How should I go about getting them taken care of?  Is bankruptcy an option, can I do it individually, or would I take my wife down with me?  Credit counseling only wants to talk about what's on my credit report and can't answer anything about these old debts, and I would like to find out how these old demons will affect my future.    Any advice anyone has for me would be greatly appreciated.	No
2115	At least once per month, we get a knock on the door from individuals saying they're from Comcast or CenturyLink and they request to go into our backyard. We've heard from our neighbors that they've attempted to access our backyard when we are not home. We have two dogs that have access to a doggie door that could potentially bite if someone accesses the backyard.   I expressed my frustration to the contractor that came to the door today and he said that there are easement rights they have so I cannot refuse access. Is this correct?	No
2116	So at my job, we make deliveries and my employer pools and distributes our delivery tips based on the number of hours we work. We share a company car for these deliveries, and one of my coworkers got caught by an automated speed enforcement camera and the $100 ticket was sent to our boss. Apparently we have received a ticket before (I, along with a couple of my other corkers, have no knowledge of this) and it was paid for by the company. This time, our boss is upset about it and wants to pay for the ticket out of our pooled tips. This can't be legal, can it?  Additional info: * We have never been informed about this policy (until now), nor have we signed any sort of agreement. * We can tell exactly who was in the car when we got the ticket based on the ticket's timestamp and info on our delivery service's app, which shows delivery times and the driver...so a lot of us find it unfair that we are all paying for it, even though it isn't a huge sum of money split amongst us.	No
2117	So roommate slumped on rent and of course late fees and posting fees had stacked. We got this letter posted on the door yesterday saying we had 3 days to rectify the problem or else (I’m not really to sure since the lease ends Monday next week) he’s since paid his portion of the rent and like $50 of the late fees but there’s still ~$150 of fees left needing to be paid. I was curious if this would have any effect on my credit/ability to rent in the future. Could they evict or continue forward with an eviction after the lease has expired? Was this a threat to pay so they could avoid deducting from the security deposit? I’m at a loss really and can’t afford anything going to collections or any of that if it would even escalate that much. I have never had this happen so I’m kinda nervous. What would be the best recourse? If he just leaves the pending debt me and my other roommate are left footing that which is shitty and would just absolve the friendship	No
2118	"I received a notice on my door yesterday, ostensibly from my landlord but with the logo of the new cable provider, stating that within a little more than a week, this new provider would become the ""exclusive provider"" for my complex and my old provider would be disconnected. I pay for cable (only internet) directly, the connection is in my name and not the landlord's. When I moved in a few months ago, the apartment already had the proper hookups for my current provider and I didn't need to have anybody come out for installation.  I've read plenty about the FCC's prohibition on exclusive contracts, but there seems to be an awful lot of loopholes. I called them and really didn't get much help. Regardless of the exclusivity question, is my landlord permitted to disconnect a cable connection that I pay for? If they do so, would I be able to ask my current provider to reconnect me, and forward any charges to the landlord? What I presume is the cable junction box is outside the building, so my current provider would not need to enter any part of the building to reach it."	No
2119	"The ""tenant"" is actually my dad and my mom is kicking him out of our house. They thought they could make it work after the divorce but obviously not. This is her house 100% (bought after the divorce) and we're in Iowa.  Is there anything she can do to make sure he doesn't take anything he's not suppose to? She's already noticed some of her antiques missing.  Dad plays dirty.  Please help ease my poor mother's mind."	No
2120	"So I currently live with two other people, one of them, ""Abby"", is pregnant and recently revealed to my other roommate, ""Brianna"", and I that she has decided to stay living there and doesn't want to move out. Obviously Brianna and I do not want to live with a screaming, crying newborn so we decided to get our own two bedroom.  We were able to find something very quickly and want to move asap since Abby is due early September and we are worried about it coming sooner. We are on a month to month lease and both gave our 30 day notice. Ideally we would have liked to move out mid August and get half the last months rent back but landlord said no so we decided to just eat it.  Yesterday the landlord (who is also a lawyer) emailed us the following: ""Please be advised that you both have given your notice but this does not remove you from your obligation to pay rent should the monthly amount not be paid.  You will remain jointly and severally liable for any rent owed until a new lease is signed.""  So he's saying that if Abby doesn't find someone to move in by September first we still owe the rent??? How is that legal? Abby should be the one that has to pay our rent since she couldn't find anyone to move in, right? Please someone help me make sense of this...  We are in Massachusetts btw if that changes anything"	No
2121	I am a social media employee for a venue in northern California. Normally, we have cheap local bands come in and perform. All our concerts are free, used to gather the community together. Recently we had a singer who is actually signed to a label come and perform. Nothing big, but I want to use his performance in an ad. He performed both his own songs and more popular songs. Legally speaking, what music copyrights might I be breaking?	No
2122	My roommate is French. She signed a sub-lease for January through August. She has now informed me that she will be returning home to France in the first few days of August and will not be paying last month's rent. What recourse do I have in this situation? She intends to come back to the US after reapplying for a visa so is there any leverage there? Is there anyway to make it more difficult for her reentry because of this?	No
2123	"we both signed the lease, but she left abruptly and Left a lot of trash that I ended up having to clean to get the full deposit back. on the day of the ""walkthrough"" the landlord said they know their rights and  they would reimburse whoever showed up. I was the only one that showed up so i was the only one who got a check. do i have to pay her anything?"	No
2124	Hello, this is a follow-up to my earlier post (I deleted it though). Basically, the story starts last week on the 24th when I signed a lease with a student apartment complex. I signed it electronically at 12:07 p.m. and I have a copy of it.    At 1:06 p.m. that same day, about an hour later, I get a call from one of their staff saying they ran out of units and I would have to be put on a wait list. I missed the call and called right back, unaware that he had left a voicemail. After that, I signed with another apartment complex so that I would have a place to stay for the semester, as I have less than a month before the term begins.    When I tried to explain to one of their managers what happened, they refused to terminate my lease. They said that I was told I was the last unit, and I have one now, so I have to pay the rent. I told them someone from their office called me an hour later and told me they had ran out and that I was going to be put on a wait list. I missed the call at first, but I called right back and I asked to be put on the wait list.    The manager told me they cannot cancel leases and that I had to pay. He said they don't know who told me there was no spots left, but I was not on the wait list at all. Not only that, he told me I was told I was the last unit even though there is no record of this at all. No voicemail, no email, nothing. Only a rent reminder after the person had told me there was no spots left, and I had not been assigned a unit then. When I made a fuss about this is when they told me I had gotten the last unit, not before. I couldn't remember the guy's name, so obviously they thought I was lying and just wanting to get out of my lease. I didn't know he had left a voicemail, so I resigned myself to the fact I had no proof.    Earlier today, though, I guess my notifications for my voicemail started working again. I got the name of the community member who told me they were out of spots and that I could be put on the waiting list. I also have a screenshot of when the voicemail was sent (on the 24th, at 1:06 after I had signed my lease).    The only reason I signed another lease is because they told me they were out of spots to put me in. Am I still obligated to pay rent even though they told me that?    Thank you.	No
2125	We live in a more remote region of Canada that has a full sized hospital. Our family doctor routinely cancels appointments on us and wait times to see them are upwards of 6-8 weeks. My wife was victim of a massive infection after the birth of our child that was apparently very easily treated had she been seen 3 months after the birth as intended. Her doctor cancelled and rescheduled every 3 months for a full year, causing the infection to grow to the point where she was bleeding for a month straight.  Our doctors have cancelled and rescheduled almost every single appointment we've made for the last 2 years often resulting in wait times of 2-18 months to be seen for potentially time sensitive issues.  I was told to wait 2 months to see my family doctor for surgery follow up while I was actively bleeding from my jewels. Do we have any kind of legal recourse here? We're tired of getting constantly dicked around by the terrible healthcare services here.  Do we have any recourse? Is there anything we can do short of contacting elected representatives who are actively slashing healthcare budgets in our province and likely not to care about this anyways?	No
2126	Last year i went into the hospital and was misdiagnosed with the stomach flu, i went home and a week later ended up taking myself back to the emergency room after my appendix ruptured. I ended up needing emergency surgery after the drains didn't work and spent three weeks as an inpatient. I had to drop out of school for the semester and am still having problems. is this worth a law suit? or even a consultation?	No
2127	Hi there, so I'm kinda at a loss here. My mom's apartment management just gave her an eviction notice last Friday and she doesn't know if she should pay rent or not. Apparently ESCROW needs a 30 day notice to put rent money in there, but she is waiting until the courts get involved before leaving. What should I do? State is Ohio by the way.	No
2128	Hi all,  I met with an escort at a hotel she was residing in. I went to her room and she met me in a towel, as I requested, and then she kissed me following me entering the room. She asked for her money and I told her I had none. She then proceeded to kick me out. As I was driving away she texted me my licence plate and told me she would call the police. I told her I would contact the hotel she was staying in and she told me to kiss goodbye to my car.  Any legal advice?  Extra Info: I texted her the day before asking for a 30min meet. I intended to meet her at this point. In the morning she didnt reply and I assumed it was off, it was only an hour before she confirmed. I requested a certain outfit from her but I didn't intend to carry out any services because I felt I was doing something wrong, so I brought no money. I do not know what brought me to her residence.  Truthfully guys, I'm kinda scared of this getting out and she has my licence plate for my car.  - I am new to this sub, so please help me if I have made a mistake anywhere, thank you.	No
2129	I've lived in 3 different apartments with the same 3 roommates (4 of us total) over our last few years of college. Since we are students, each of our parents cosign and supply the money for rent and the initial security deposit. The last two places did not have deposits, only move-in fees. We all put in for the security deposit equal to one month's rent.  One roommate, we'll call him Dan, is the one who writes all the checks because his parents have the most capacity to pay the sum of money on a monthly basis. On top of that, none of us own personal banking checks besides him. He's also kind of a neat-freak and by far does the most chores to improve the state of the house because the rest of us are pretty messy and careless about it.  Our lease ended and we all moved out recently, and yesterday I asked Dan if he had received the deposit money, and he wrote back to me saying that I'm not getting my portion of the deposit because I didn't put any effort into keeping the apartment clean while we lived there or before the time we moved out. Dan says he's the only one out of all of us who tried to keep and leave the apartment in a clean state, therefore is withholding my portion and a majority of the other two roommates' security deposits. While he's kinda right, I still feel like because our name is on the lease papers then we should at least get some of our deposit back, right? Is there any action I can take to get my money back?	No
2130	Back in January 2017 my 5 roommates and I signed a lease that would be from May 1st 2017- April 30th 2018. 4 other roommates and I paid the first and last months rent as a deposit. I did not know that the 6th roommate had not paid his deposit until in April I got an email from our landlord saying there is outstanding payments from him. After asking for him to pay he informed me he no longer wants to move out from home and wants to back out of the contract. I told him he would need to find someone to replace him in the lease or he would need to pay every months rent as he signed the contract. He paid the first and last months rent and said he would find someone replace him, while in the meantime pay the rent. However in June we received another email from our landlord saying he has not paid rent in the last two months and this is where they usually start the eviction process. I spoke with the landlord about legally forcing my 6th roommate to pay his rent and he said that as we signed together it is our responsibility. Yesterday my other 4 roommates and I decided to just allow the eviction and find a new 5 person house and cut our losses. When we told our landlord this he said he will send a collection letter and not let us terminate our lease, we either have to pay the difference of our 6th roommates rent between us or he will send a collection letter.   Can i go to small claims court and get our 6th roommate to pay his share of the rent? We all signed a contract to pay $2700 a month but we also signed saying we'd pay $450 each. What are the next steps I can take so I don't get evicted?	No
2131	I work for a large, national corporation.   Our local labor union which represents more than 400 local employees has tentatively agreed to a contract this week. They have set a date to vote on the contract, which is this weekend (under 7 days notice).  The union is refusing to let any of the union members read the contract prior to the days of the vote.   I am looking for a legal basis to force them to give us the contract or to extend/block the vote.	No
2132	From my understanding he plans on renting the place out. I've spoken to him and he says the trees are all on my side of the property line (they're not). Currently there's my fence, then a three or four feet gap which contains the trees, then a brand new fence he had installed - it's like something from an 80s movie.   I'm concerned with a tree/branch falling on my house in a storm as the house has been dormant for a while and the trees haven't been trimmed in forever - smaller branches are already falling regularly, and a big on could take out half my roof. Yes I know I could sue once that happens, but I have a baby in the house and I'm not taking chances.  What can I do here?	No
2133	I run at night because it's summer and can't afford to get a gym membership and I'm not a morning person. Because it's night, I run with pepper spray in one hand and a box cutter in the other. The blade on it isn't any longer than two inches-- very short. But im wondering if I would get in trouble if I got caught running around with an open box cutter, even if its only meant to (maybe) scare off predators while I try to scare off calories	No
2134	Texas - I am representing my self in a small claims lawsuit brought by a former landlord who is suing me for damages in excess of my security deposit. I also have a counter claim against him for failing to act in a timely manner (No contact for close to 90 days after vacating the property). Last week I was notified that he has requested a Jury Trial which means our next court appearance will be a pre-trial hearing. The landlord does have an attorney representing him in court but for the amount we are being sued for, I'd likely spend more on an attorney if I went that route than I'd avoid paying if I lose the lawsuit, so I am sticking to representing myself. What should I expect to happen and what can I do to be prepared?  Thanks in advance for all of your help.	No
2135	I'm a US citizen (land living in the US) and also a partner of a company based in Australia.   What is the best way to handle distributions in my case -- would it make the most sense to create a subsidiary in the USA for tax purposes, or is there a better option?   While we have a few customers in the USA, we don't plan to pursue the market here and will not open any offices in the US. We'd like to remain focused on the Australian market. If we did open a subsidiary company in the US in order to pay distributions, would that open us up to US law and liabilities? We'd prefer to remain under Australian law since most of our customers are there.  I plan to speak to a lawyer about this, but thought it would be nice to get a few different opinions to prepare in case anyone else has dealt with a similar situation. Thanks in advance for your help!	No
2136	Location: North Carolina  I have searched everywhere trying to find a similar situation, with no luck. I am at the end of my current one-year lease this month (7/15/16-7/31/17). Back in May, I reached out to the rental agency (manages property for the owner of my condo) to see if the owner would be interested in renewing my lease for a shorter term, ideally 6 months. I have to move for school next semester, so I was hoping to end sometime between Dec-Feb, but was willing to pay an extra month or so to avoid the hassle of moving twice in the year. The rental agency went back and forth with the landlord, and they said (by email) the landlord agreed to a lease ending 4/3/18. I agreed to this at the time.  I didn't hear anything until two weeks ago (7/10), when they asked if I was still interested in renewing the lease. I said yes, and asked for confirmation that the new lease would run 8/1/17-4/3/18. This was also confirmed (by email). Two weeks later (7/25), I wrote to them asking about a new lease, since I hadn't received one. They sent one via Docusign with a lease from 8/1/17-4/30/17. I asked them to change the date of the lease to the terms we had previously agreed to (and included copies of both emails). They said that it was a typo and the owner agreed to 4/30 and have refused to send me an updated lease.   My current lease includes a clause stating that in the event that 45 days' notice is not given before the end of the current lease, the lease will be automatically renewed for three months at a 3% rent increase. At this point, I'm assuming my options are to sign the new lease or pay the increased rent and be out by the end of October (8/1-10/31). Is this correct? I intended to sign a new lease, but just can't stomach paying an extra month's rent due to their mistake. If they had sent a new lease prior to 5 days ago, I could have given notice and found a new place to live.	No
2137	Is there any ways I can fight this in court? They didnt find any actual pot but the pipe itself was dirty. Does that actually count as possession of marijuana in virginia? And if I Wasnt distributing the bowl to anyone and only had it for personal use, what would the correct charge and penalty be? Having trouble finding this information online.  I was given Asap and a 500$ fine but if theres any way I can get this reverted to a different charge and a lesser fine that would be really helpful.	No
2138	"Hi r/legaladvice!   I live in a multi unit apartment complex in California. There is a cockroach infestation in our building. There are cockroaches in our bed, refrigerator, toilet, all counters, drawers, our furniture, and more. Our neighbors below and next to us also have infestations.  We sent written notice to the office of the complex June 28 for the cockroaches to be eradicated. We also requested either separate accommodations or to mutually end our lease due to the level of infestation. The office refused our request and said they would send out pest control to spray for 3 or more weeks to remove the cockroaches, and we would have to live in the apartment throughout treatment.  We have not been living at the apartment since June 28 due to being unable to store food, cook, or sleep without cockroaches crawling on us. As of Tuesday, they have sprayed the apartment 4 times. We visited the apartment today and the cockroaches are still (alive) everywhere. The pest control only sprays the kitchen, bathroom, and cabinets in the hallway. They have made no effort to spray the bedroom (where a lot of the cockroaches are) and the entire living room.  We have continued to pay rent.  The complex is aware that we haven't been living in the apartment. From research, I've seen that 30 days in CA is ""reasonable time"" to fix an issue. I wanted to know what next steps we could take to solve this issue. Pest control told our next door neighbor that they recommend tenting the complex, but the management refuses ""due to turnover"". We have already had Code Enforcement come to the complex and issue a violation to the office. We have also given letters to all of our neighbors in the building with Code Enforcements info/contact information for the officer assigned to the case for them to call and complain.  I'm wondering what time frame would be required for us to be able to break the lease without penalty. The conditions are uninhabitable (and we haven't lived there in almost a month) and we do not want to continue playing rent on an apartment that is not healthy to live in."	No
2139	I was involved in a self defense shooting recently. It was a domestic issue. I do not have a lawyer. They took my pistol &amp; the investigation is still open.   The detective arrived on scene shortly after &amp; preceded to ask me questions. I decided to tell my side of the story without a lawyer present. I do not have one.  I took a recorded statement at the precinct &amp; was released. No charges were filed. The aggressor was rushed to intensive care. He did not die.   My questions are: Was it bad for me to speak without a lawyer present, despite the fact that I was released. Do I need to get one? And who do I contact in regards to remaining anonymous with the press?	No
2140	Hi all!  I moved into this apartment at the start of the summer after dorms closed at my college nearby. I answered an ad on a Facebook housing group for our college posted by a girl I knew, Vanessa. She was looking for a roommate so we both moved in together. Vanessa left after about three weeks for her graduate program, so I've been here alone. This is fine since it's a one bedroom and Vanessa was sleeping on the couch until it was time for her to leave. I knew that Vanessa was going to leave and that I would be here alone, which is why I agreed to have a roommate in a one bedroom.  I was just told by the person who is on the lease, Julie, that she is having someone move in to the apartment I am subletting. I pay rent to someone else, so I guess Julie sublet to Lacy who sublet to Vanessa and me.  Julie might be having this random person move in I guess a week? I told her that I was under the impression I was living here alone for the summer.  I do not feel comfortable with living with a stranger. There was no formal agreement which is why I feel like she could just have this person move on in. What are my rights and what do I do?  Thanks!	No
2141	* The actual house. Worth ~200K, in CA (where I live, my official residence is at the house). What deed makes the most sense for transferring into my name? From what I can tell, Quitclaim deed's are the easiest, but I don't understand the drawbacks to it.  * Does it make more sense to transfer the money into my accounts before their death so it doesn't have to go through any legal stuff?   Tl;Dr When they actually do die, I get everything. What are the processes that have to be gone through, and what do I need to do. I have power of attorney, and I'm the executor.  I don't know what I'm doing with all of this.	No
2142	I'm a college student at a school in Ohio. I signed a lease and put down a deposit for off-campus housing and everything was fine until I ran into issues with my guarantor. The issue wasn't getting the guarantor, but she issue apartment leasing office and their, frankly petty, requirements. It was no issue for me though. I talked to the office workers and they said I could get a credit check ran for myself. I passed. Then they said I needed to either put down two months rent or show proof that I made 3x the monthly rent.   I talk to the office workers again, tell them that I don't have two months rent and don't make 3x, but will have more than enough money to pay the entire year with my refund. They tell me this is OK. A day later they ask me where this money is coming from. I remind them it's from a refund. They tell me that it isn't enough and that they need proof. I show them proof. They say it's not enough and I still need to make 3x the monthly rent. By this time i'm just tired of them so I inform them I don't want to lease their anymore. That was 4 days ago. Today they inform me that that's not how leases work and i'm still required to pay. However, I already signed another lease at a different apartment and plan on moving in soon.   So, did I screw myself over or is there anyway to get out of this? I haven't been assigned a room, haven't payed any rent, don't have the means of paying them and feel as if they led me astray. So, advice?	No
2143	As stated I'm having to go in tomorrow at 5 am for an emergency procedure. I had today off, and just left the doctors where I found out. I haven't told my job yet. I'm a front office manager at a hotel.   Normally I wouldn't be too worried, but I'm concerned due to the fact we've just gotten a new general manager, who for lack of better words is a complete idiot. He can't do ANYTHING by himself. He's only been at our property for less than a week. No one on the property really knows how to do what I do on a daily basis. This is what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned since I will be out for a minimum of two weeks- they will replace me. Especially seeing as this is going to make everyone's lives really difficult.  How should I handle this situation with my employer and do I have any rights? All our handbook states is if you require more than three days off you need a doctors note.	No
2144	I paid my rent earlier this month and a few weeks ago we got an email saying that we had to be out by the 24th at 10:00 a.m. I am probably int eh minority but I already have somewhere else to go but two of my roommates are from out of state and are finishing up their summer school courses which don't end until the end of the month. So in short is what they're doing here legal? Other territories of this complex leave at the end of the month just not ours. I'm in MS if that helps. They're also stating that they're going to charge 100 or 200 bucks per day that we aren't out.	No
2145	This is a follow-up to a post I previously made here but have since deleted. Basically, I signed a lease with a student apartment electronically last week. Someone from their office called me an hour later and told me they ran out of spots and that he would add me to a wait list. I received a rent reminder later that day and I called after that to ask them why I was going to be held accountable for paying rent when they said they ran out of spots. The girl who answered told me they don't cancel leases and I would need to fill out a relet form. I explained that I signed another lease because their office told me they ran out of spots, and I was not going to pay for a unit I don't have. She asked me my name and confirmed that I had not been assigned a unit. She said to call the next day at noon and speak to a manager about the situation, because she was new and didn't know what else to tell me.    So I called the following day and asked for a manager. I explain the situation to him and ask to terminate my lease. He say they don't cancel leases and I need to fill out a relet form, and that he'd email me one. I try to explain the situation again, reiterating that I was not going to pay for something I don't have, but he said there was nothing he could do. So I got off the phone. I explained the situation later to my dad and he called up there himself. After making a big fuss, the leasing manager sent him a relet form as well, because she said they can't cancel leases, but said she'd waive the fee if they found someone.    I email the first manager and ask why I was put on the wait list if there was a spot available for me. He says that I was told I was the last unit when I signed (which there is no evidence of, no phone calls, emails, or voicemails BUT I do have a voicemail of the guy from their office that told me there was no spots left). I also signed the lease electronically, so how was I told this when I signed? Either way, I send in the relet form and have been trying ever since to find someone to relet/sublease my apartment to in case they don't find anyone.    Today is the day my rent would have been due so I know I'm not late in paying them, had they not found someone. But an hour or so ago I get a message from Adobe sign (what I used to electronically sign the lease) that said:    &gt; Lease from [Apartment Complex] Agreement Exchange Cancelled. I have cancelled the agreement exchange for Lease from [Apartment Complex] even though you have already completed and returned it. This transaction has been terminated by Adobe Sign and the document has been removed from our Adobe Sign accounts. No further steps are required on your part.    I emailed the apartment complex to get an explanation because I'm not sure what this means, but I haven't gotten an answer yet. So now I'm just trying to figure out if my lease has been terminated or not, and if they're still going to hold me accountable for my rent? I don't think this was cancelled because I didn't pay yet, because the rent is due on the 1st and isn't considered late until the 4th. But they haven't given me any notification of any sort before this that they intended to cancel the lease, only that they would try and replace me with someone and if not, I was responsible for the lease.    Sorry that this is so long but this has been giving me a lot of anxiety this past week. And I have to make sure this is finished, because I explained the situation to the other apartment complex and they are willing to let me sublease in case I am held accountable by the other apartment complex but they need to know ASAP if I need to sublease or not.	No
2146	I was hired as a full time worker, receiving benefits such as PTO, vacation, and holiday pay. When i was hired i was working 32 hours a week (which is considered full time to the corporation). about 6-7 months ago my manager cut a day of work and my hours fell under 30 hours, but i still accumulated benefits and maintained full time status. I have always been available to work 30+ hours but the former manager scheduled me less. Now there is a change in management that noticed this, we worked out a schedule where i went back to working 30+ hours (i have this conversation recorded on my phone). Corporate HR rejected the idea of me working those hours and changed my status to part time, took away my benefits and are asking me to pay back the benefits i had accumulated (holiday pay, PTO , vacation) on full time status, totaling to over $1700. I came into work when i was told to come in, and no one mentioned anything to me about loss of benefits or meeting 30 hours in the last 6 - 7 months. i get paid biweekly so thats at least 12 pay periods that this went unnoticed and was never notified to me. Now they want me to pay them back because i worked under 30 hours at the request of my former manager, even though i was available to work 30 + hours. if it means anything, the former manager has left the company and moved to the other side of the country from us.	No
2147	"i signed a two month sublease contract with a girl living in a independent student housing complex. their buildings policy is that you may sublet, but the person who sublets the room and pays the lease has to pay the building 500 dollars.  i didn't know this and signed a contract directly with the girl who leases from the independent student housing building. the key to the apartment broke and when i asked them to fix it, i was told to leave premise immediately. i showed them the contract i signed and nothing was on file. she had told me ""they are not cool"" with people subleasing, but i didn't know it was illegal/i'd get evicted. i am in california and from NJ so i have no place to live.  i asked for 1 months rent plus security deposit of 1000 dollars which would be 2800 total. she is offering 2000 dollars. do i file a police report or go to a lawyer? am i just an idiot?"	No
2148	"I'm living in California and moving out of my current apartment after the lease ends on september 30. I also have a roommate. I just issued my 30 day notice to not renew my lease but my roommate wants to stay and renew with a new roommate. I don't want to trust him to pay me for my share of the deposit because he has been very sketchy with money so I opted to officially end the lease so the landlord can do a walk through and give me back what they legally owe me. The landlord says they since my roommate wants to renew and someone is still going to be there, this can't happen, even though I issued a notice to end my contract. They said, ""this is just how we do it here"". Who is in the right here and what should I do?"	No
2149	My parents deposit was around $1600 I believe. We have recently moved and just received a deposit of $700 back.  Two of the charges were around $300 each.   * Carpet Cleaning * Termite damage repairs on window seals  We washed the carpet before we left, it was in good shape outside of basic wear and tear. The carpet is at least 8-10+ years old.  Some window seals had major termite damage. Floor boards around those window seals also had damage. We contacted the owners several times about the issues and they had exterminators come out and remedy the situation. They also had 'handy men' come out and ghetto fix the window seal. Aka, they literally stickied some cheap tile material on top of it and called it a day.  I don't believe we're liable for termite damage we reported several times. I would appreciate legal information on what can be done, etc.   Thanks.	No
2150	"My lease just ended earlier this month, the way I pay rent is online through a 3rd party system that didn't know that my lease was ending and I got charged ~$1100+. Currently living in North Carolina. I contacted my bank, however, they haven't done anything about it (yet?), and I came back to my apartment to give them the key before I left. I told the person at the front office that I accidentally paid an additional month and was wondering if I was capable of getting that back. They said I would be getting my deposit back once they remove the furniture from my place and would be charged for that, which is totally fair and fine (assuming it's $100-$200 which might be over doing it, but whatever it's okay). In total, I had one bed, one desk, and one dresser that I left there. A few days later I received a letter that I was charged basically the entire additional deposit to replace the carpet of that apartment that was supposedly ""damaged and had pet urine"" on it. My cat lived with me, and has always used the litter box in the bathroom the entire duration of my time being there. I will admit, there was one stain of some drink next to my bed that I scrubbed a handful of times before I finally left that apartment and it honestly wasn't too bad at all. I don't believe in the slightest that that would warrant over a grand of the money I didn't even have to give them in the first place. My current living situation is not going well as a result of this, I have emailed the front office about this letter and have not gotten any response many days later. What should be the next step from this? A few people have just told me ""that's life, life is garbage, that's how it is"" but I can't just lose a thousand dollars and be okay with that."	No
2151	Should I get a lawyer for this? Is it expensive?  Can I handle it on my own?  I have the letter they sent me with the offer, is that enough or do I need to ask them for a contract of some kind?  I heard the forgiven part of the debt counts as income for taxe purposes.  Is that true.  My debt is about 22k, they are offering a 10% settlement.  I looked at lawyers in the area but all the financial ones I found were bankruptcy  / credit card debt lawyers.  I didn't find anything about student loans.  Please help.  I have about a week to figure this out before I am out of town.	No
2152	Given that in my 23 years as their son, they've hated each other for just about every waking second. And me and my siblings have had to obviously put up with it. But for some unknown reason they just won't cut ties and get apart from each other. So I ask again: Is there some way I can force them to just end it?	No
2153	He freaked out on her and then tried to cover it up saying he was giving the cards back to the respective customers in an effort to get them a better deal on their phones/plans. Shady as fuuuuck. I am certainly not a lawyer, but this smacks of fraud to me.   Question: legally, what specifically is this considered? I'm telling her to seek legal advice, but I need her to understand the gravity of the situation (if there is indeed gravity).  Thanks in advance.	No
2154	"We got a letter telling us about the deductions from our deposit. Most of the stuff made sense but one item was ""Cleaning of unit 36 hrs @ $35/hr."" Is that normal? The rest of the list was   Replacement of broken door on northwest bedroom - $200.00   Cleaning of uniy 36 hrs @ 35.00/hr - $1,260.00  Carpet cleaning - $250.00  Replacement of broken glass at covered carport - $75.00  Reparing of patched holes on sheet rock walls and painting of same areas after patching. 3 hrs @ 35.00/hr - $105.00  Disposal of items left in house (this one we previously discussed) - $550.00  Replacement of broken blind - $40.00  Reparing of garage overhead door. - $150.00  My main question is is the cleaning hrs just the total from all the other listed cleaning and thats just the pay for labor?"	No
2155	I grew up in this house and have lived here for 19 years. After my parents divorced when I was 18 my dad moved and I moved with him. My mom stayed. Now I'm coming back and she took me to court and evicted me. The judge says the rental agreement I have with my dad (the owner of the same property) doesn't matter and I have to pay my mom $670 and leave in 1 week. How is that even possible if it's a joint property?	No
2156	"My friend was talking about non-competes and brought this question up...""Is a non-compete valid if you sign it but you physically haven't started working for them yet?"" Basically, they're asking is if you sign a non-compete but haven't started can you switch to a different job without any legal ramifications.   We couldn't find any answers online.  Cheers also the location is Massachusetts"	No
2157	Alberta, Canada. My landlords accepted him as a new tenant about 2 weeks ago, and now he tells me he has MRSA. I feel this is an immediate health concern, since we share a bathroom, laundry, and common living space. He is not taking reasonable precautions, his sores are open and he even admits to picking at them. I've found blood in the bathroom on various surfaces several times.   I don't expect it to be likely for him to be able to be evicted for not making it clear that he has this disease? The landlords say that they are legally required to give him 3 months notice.  My main question is, can I legally terminate my lease due to this?	No
2158	I need advice concerning an apartment I rented with a 10-month fixed lease in Idaho.  The move-in and move-out date was clearly stated in the lease I signed.  I gave the landlord 9 days of notice prior to moving out.  Now, as I try to get my security deposit back, I am told that since I didn’t give 30 days of notice - which is not stated as a requirement in the lease - they are keeping the deposit and charging me for an additional month's rent.    The question is - in Idaho, is one required to give 30 days notice prior to moving out at the end of a fixed term lease?  In addition, I did not receive an itemized list of deductions within 21 days of moving out per Idaho law.  Only after contacting management (with a security deposit demand letter) did I get any information concerning my security deposit.  Is legal action the next step?	No
2159	"So I just was told by by my neighbor that their dog was attacked (badly apparently) by mine, in my backyard. It is not fenced, but has an electric fence. My dog will not leave but it doesn't prevent anything else from coming in obviously. If this is true, am I liable for any injuries? Does homeowners cover this?  Also part 2 of the question: my dog has never shown any aggression to other dogs, she has no scratches or cuts, there is no blood on her at all(she has white fur so it would be super easy to see). Frankly, I'm not convinced she did this at all. But if I didn't see the ""incident"" is it basically just his word against nothing? I took pictures of my dog as soon as he told me but other than that I don't have any proof of anything."	No
2160	"I live in King County, WA and have been casually informed that a part of my property will need to be taken for a large public project.  Fortunately, it is the part of my property furthest from my house. I have yet to be officially notified (have spoken with a ""Community Outreach Specialist"") nor have I received the final area of land that will be taken.   &amp;nbsp; I have two questions:   1) I am currently improving the general area that will be taken.  Some landscaping, some plants, etc.  At any point will I have a duty to stop improving my property that may/will be taken away?   2) I bought the house in late 2014.  I was recently informed by a neighbor that they were initially contacted in 2008 about this project and the potential for eminent domain. Should the owner at that time (who sold the house in 2011) have notified the previous owner, who could have notified me?"	No
2161	Landlady lives above me. Her apartment flooded due to her toilet overflowing which spilled into my unit while I wasn't home. ~$500 in damage to my personal property. I have renter's insurance, but the deductible for personal property damage is $500 and I'm moving out in around two months already. Am I just out $500? What do I do?	No
2162	I need some help here. (All events/transactions occurred in CA where I am also living with a valid CA address.)  I purchased a new car on 5/27/17. My credit is poor but my income is high so I qualified for a loan with a high down payment and a trade in. After being approved, I worked a better deal with the dealership to simply put more money down and not use the trade in. We agreed, signed all the paperwork, I drove off the lot with a brand new car.  My first payment is due 7/11/17. I've been trying for the last few days to enroll online and pay my loan but had no luck. Kind of panicked, I emailed my dealership for some help and then called the financeer who tells me that I have two loan open - one that's expired and one that's declined.  I called the dealership immediately who tell me, 'We've been trying to get a hold of you, we need the car back immediately. The financeer sent back the contract when the trade-in was pulled from the table. Bring the car back today or tomorrow. By boss just told me about this this weekend and said we need to get the car back from you.'  I responded with, 'No one has attempted to contact me about this. I have emails from my salesperson asking me how my car is over the last few weeks but no emails, calls, texts, or postal mail regarding the contract or financing. I will not turn in the car until I speak with the Director of Finance.'  They told me the Director will be in in the morning and will call me first thing.  I'm not really sure what to do here. This happened to me last year when trying to purchase a new Mazda and that dealership had mailed certified letter rescinding the contract on the 10th day so I was obligated to return the car. Need some help.  tl;dr - Dealership could not find financing 30 days after signing the contract and is asking for the car to be returned. Do I have any rights?	No
2163	Housemates' friend got kicked out so they want to house them for a while. I am OK for them to live here for a little bit but I don't think this person is responsible and if I give them a time of how long they can actually stay they will stay longer.  I'm willing to let this person live at our place for up to two weeks but if they don't leave what can I possibly do to kick them out?  I am the only person that is on the lease.	No
2164	What should i do about this?  I got pulled over doing 100 mph in a 65 mph zone in New jersey.   I'm 17 years old.   I have court in 6 days ON MY BIRTHDAY. Fuck my life.	No
2165	"So, our neighbor recently had plumbing done. Her plumber apparently unhooked our sewage line during the process, and left it unhooked. He is stating it was illegally connected to her pipes, which then ran to the city sewage as a common connection. We have no idea about that, we did not install the pipes. The house was built in 1890 and it seems the last time pipes were installed was 1977. Anyway, he disconnected our sewage pipeline, which means if we use our sinks, shower, washing machine, or toilets, that raw sewage is leaking into her back yard. Because of this we shut our water off to avoid an environmental bio hazard. He is refusing to reconnect the pipe and has ""graciously"" offered to run a new line, prices to be determine, of course. If the pipe was illegally connected against our knowledge, why the heck would he disconnected it and allow raw sewage to leak everywhere. It makes absolutely no sense.   Obviously we need to get this fixed so that we can have water again, since he's now may our house unlivable  We contacted the city and an investigator said the pipes are on private property so there's nothing they can do. He's advised me to talk to the city engineers who should have drawings listing if this was an existing approved common connection. Our neighbor has now filed a complaint with the housing code, however, according to the city investigator, since she approved the work, any citation should go to her.  Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."	No
2166	How does an employer prove that they have informed an employee of tip credits? Can the agreement be verbal or does it have to be written? Working in a restaurant, Tip credits and credit card processing fees are being taken from my wages. I was uninformed of this upon the start of my employment. I noticed these deductions after reading the server sales report at the end of the night. I am fully aware that the employer may take these credits, but should they be informing or providing notice to an employee about the exact numbers and percentages at the time of hire or during the training?	No
2167	This morning, I found a notice that eviction had been filed on my door. I immediately went to my apartment office with the letter and showed her my bank statement where the rent was paid. She immediately determined that this was in error, contacted the law firm that files evictions for them and will have them dismiss the case. I am relatively comfortable that this will be done. She seemed panicked that it happened.   My questions is, should I be looking for something other than a dismissal? At this point I feel like having an eviction filed then dismissed could be an issue for future background checks. Also, I would assume it appears as if I failed to pay rent, then paid it as a result of the eviction.  Am I being too passive by allowing them to dismiss it? Should I be looking for a different resolution?	No
2168	I left a large chain retail to work for a start up as a pharmaceutical rep on march 20th. Unfortunately on July 10th I was let go . The reasons were  1) a doctor in an office that I was in charge of but never met started prescribing less. Ironically it's not even a doctor of mine.  2) my prescription count wasn't going up fast enough. I was given a brand new area where a majority of insurances are not being covered with our particular product.  3) due to the fact I don't drive, I wasn't given a company car and had to be on foot. This resulted in me dragging a small suitcase on wheels around. A portion of the job required me to pick up hard copies before I bring it to the office. I generally kept hard copies at home because I was afraid of being a target and having someone steal the suitcase. This according to my boss was a HIPPA violation.   My question is if I file for unemployment, should I expect some sort of retaliation?  What can I do if I get some sort of legal document in the mail? My former boss is currently suing former employees for violating our contracts. So I'm very worried about getting anything from him.   Thank you for any and all advice.	No
2169	Hi everybody, I'm in need of some advice/guidance. I'm about to release an app, which is basically based on seeing people in your area (through an interactive map) and then being able to message them and ultimately meet up. Unfortunately, that can obviously lead to somebody getting hurt or robbed. My question is, would I be considered liable or get into any kind of trouble if that did happen (seeing as how they used my app)? And, if so, is there any way I can protect myself from that? Sorry if that sounds unethical or something  I'm in Houston, TX, btw	No
2170	"I moved out March 14th and signed off on the lease that day. I gave the landlord my forwarding address to send the end lease and security deposit ($600)  to. Then, I packed up, moved out, cleaned up, and left town. I wrote this address into his folder with the lease.  In May, I still hadn't received anything, so I text him to ask. He says he ""lost"" the address, and to please give it to again, so I do. I ask specifically again for a copy of the end lease/sign off.  Still nothing in early June, so I ask again. He says he sent it but will send it again. Ok. I'm getting leery at this point.   Still nothing two weeks ago (mid-July), so I ask again. Again, he says he sent it. I ask if I can pick it up in person instead, since we seem to be having bad mail issues or something. Says he won't be around,  but he says he will send it certified this time. Now I'm pretty sure something is up.  A week later, he lets me know he's finally sent it and I can expect to receive it this weekend. Which I do, now 4.5 months after moving out. Except he not only didn't send a copy of the end lease, and no security deposit -- he sent a list of charges, and saying I owe HIM another $192.  Not only is this the most bullshit list of rambling ""fixes"" -- charging me for days of rent for AFTER the lease ended, for burned out lightbulbs,  for the blinds in living room being too short (HIS blinds that were there when we moved in and never changed out), this ""fixup""/checkout list being done after I'm moved out and out of town, etc. -- I'm pretty sure that none of it matters because, by law,  he had 45 days to send me this list of damages and/or deposit. He admitted to receiving the address but ""lost"" it (and never bothered trying to ask me for it again). And keeps avoiding giving me my own copy of the end lease! I know he owes me double the deposit by law, and I need my end lease to sue for it. Maybe he was just hoping I'd forget about the lease and money if he waited long enough.  I think he is avoiding giving me the lease because I wrote the forwarding address on it, which shows he had it, and it also shows when I actually moved out. This seems insane that he is trying to pull a stunt like this. How can I take him to small claims without my copy of the end lease?? Or how can I  force him to give me a copy??"	No
2171	So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them.   For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.  I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?  My business is in Pennsylvania and they are located in New York.   Thanks for your assistance.	No
2172	My partner co-owns a popular restaurant in our city, and I tend to deal with the general complaints and inquiries that we recieve.   Recently, a woman contacted us over Facebook complaining that she and her friends got food poisoning from our restaurant. [Here's an album of our conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/1OIvv)   In order to prove food poisoning, you must first provide evidence that the food you ate was contaminated, and that this contamination caused you to fall ill. Typically a customer would call their local health committee in order to have an inspection done, which she hasn't. We issued an inspection ourselves, regardless of always having an incredibly clean restaurant with quality produce and staff. We've always passed our inspections.  I actually used to work at the newspaper company she said she talked to, so I contacted the director of the newsroom to confirm that she was in touch with them. The director has yet to get back to me, but I find it odd that a customer would contact the media prior to contacting the restaurant itself. It feels threatening from our end.   I should note that neither of our servers from that afternoon remember ever seeing her, but we can't rely on their memory. I also eat at our restaurant often and have never felt sick afterwards.  Is there anything we can do about this lady?  **TL;DR: A woman contacted us over Facebook to say we gave her and her friends food poisoning. We've never received claims like this before, and our restaurant consistently passes health inspections.	No
2173	"So, our contractor completely abandoned us on Saturday, and we don't know what to do. We hired these three guys who gave us an incredibly low price to remodel a condo that we purchased in May. They started work on our place on June 1 and were supposed to be done on June 30. He told us that he would remodel our place for a certain amount: $13,500. These same guys did renovation work for our neighbor in the same condo community, so we made a huge mistake and simply made everything verbal instead of writing it down. I asked him to write it down, but he never actually did even though he promised to do so.  So, the first week, the lead contractor bailed on us and went on vacation while the other two guys started sound demolition work. Everything was fine, until he came back a week later and started asking for more money to do other things. We thought, ""okay, we are asking him to move some walls around and some things are more expensive,"" so we just allowed it and paid extra. This became a common occurrence as things progressed; he started telling us that we had to pay for faucets, for light fixtures, for shower doors, etc., and we had no recourse because we didn't write anything down  Two weeks later, after there was not a ton of work done, the lead guy tells us that his wife's grandmother was in an accident in Mexico. He left the country for two weeks, and his other guys did work. He came back last Friday, and we didn't even know what to say to him because we are paying for rent in our old place while waiting for our new place to become livable. He didn't say too much to us either, and they left and took all of their tools on Friday.  They were supposed to come back on Saturday, but never showed up. I blew up this guy's phone, and he finally answered and said that he wasn't going to work for us anymore because we ""disrespected him by ignoring him.""  In total, we paid them around $12k, and there isn't a single room completely finished. If anyone has had a similar experience or knows some options, we are all ears. We have called our homeowner's insurance, and my wife thinks we may have some luck there, but otherwise we are nearly broke and can't afford to pay for another contractor on top of it.   Hoping there is someone out there who can help! Thanks in advance!"	No
2174	I'm mobile so I apologize in advance. So, after this post, things got worse.  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6fui41/tx_contractor_not_completing_work/  The contractor and crew stopped showing up completely, after a torn down deck and dock. $12,000 was paid in total. The 'contractor' kept leading my FIL on basically, saying he had an investor who was going to loan the money to him so my FIL could be paid back $9,000 plus lumber. Well, that didn't happen. He called FIL yesterday, said he sold off all his assets (truck, cell phone, handguns) and was filing bankruptcy, so FIL would get nothing if he tried to sue him. Obviously, get a lawyer, right? My FIL feels like it'll just be more expensive to get a lawyer since there's a good chance he'll never see his money again.	No
2175	This past week we have noticed people selling one of our t-shirt designs through some online print on demand platforms. These companies are the sort where anyone can submit artwork and get it printed. I believe these companies are in the US. One company we contacted and they have removed the listing, and the other we are contacting right now. Between both listings, these people have earned a few thousand dollars from my design. Since it's relatively a low amount I understand that it might not be worth dragging lawyers into the situation...but it annoys me that there are US companies that are aiding these a$$holes and profiting from stealing my design.   I can post more specific information if it would be helpful.	No
2176	Within the past month (sometime between July 7th and now), the cost of housing in my dorm listed on the ASU website was increased by $69 a semester. The amount listed, before and after the change, was explicitly listed as the cost for the 2017-2018 school year. This change in price was well after a late cancellation fee of $500 was in effect (the fee slowly ramped up, reaching the full $500 on June 20th).  At the end of the previous school year, to sign up for housing, we had to agree to [this](https://housing.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2017-2018_license_agreement_-_ftf-ret-upp.pdf) housing agreement. Part of this agreement does say  &gt; The Arizona Board of Regents, ASU, and/or designated facility management companies reserve the right to change room rates and other charges and fees if circumstances require adjustments.  Is it legal for ASU to change the amount they charge for housing after a cancellation fee is in effect?	No
2177	Preface, we live in Vancouver BC.  For seven months my ex and I had lived together with my sister in a townhouse that we were renting. Unfortunately, it was a dumb decision to move in together as we ended up splitting up two months ago... we didn't want to live together anymore, but that meant we'd have to break our lease since (another bad decision) the place was fairly expensive and we couldn't afford it with only one roommate. There are more reasons why we had to break the lease, but I won't get into it.  We gave our landlords notice of ending tenancy and did it as legally as we could. In writing, a full month before, etc. They said that it was okay and that they'd find someone else to take the place, and my ex and I volunteered to help find applicants as well.   Now, we live in Vancouver BC where the vacancy rates are very low, and it's very hard to find sufficient housing because of the high rates/few available apartments. We assumed the apartment would gather a lot of interest because it's in a fantastic area with a gym, fireplace, rooftop patio, etc... which it did, and there were many showings over the last two months. We recently heard from the landlords that they still haven't found someone qualified, and will require us to both pay more rent for a second month in a row even though we both live in different apartments now.  Obviously we were in the wrong for breaking the lease, I understand that, but we both are finding it very unlikely that they haven't found someone yet due to the housing situation in Vancouver. Is there any way for us to dispute paying rent for the second month in a row of us not living there, due to them being too picky with new tenants? Is that even a thing? They've received many applicants according to them but just haven't accepted anyone yet. I'm not sure what the legality of any of this is. If we can't dispute it I will suck it up and pay the rent since it was our fault this situation happened in the first place... but I just want to make sure they're not just keeping us on the hook for an empty apartment that they're still getting rent for, since it's easier (?).	No
2178	I rent an ensuite in the attic of a student house In the UK. It was discovered the shower was leaking, the landlords 'fixed it', however forgot to reattach any of the pipes. This meant that evening when I used it water went through the floor and the carpet soaked up a lot.  A few days ago I was vacuuming the room (I usually use a car vacuum as its smaller and easier to carry up the stairs) with a Dyson and where it's more powerful, the part of carpet that got soaked (I did tell them about the damage) has unraveled in about a 2 cm by 10 cm patch. As it was damaged through vacuuming will I be liable for the damage? Thank you!	No
2179	I am currently on a study abroad trip with a US based provider ( supplied through my school ).  I was suppost to on a week long trip to Thailand with this company but they canceled it with two weeks notice.  They are giving me a refund for the program fee but I am now stranded in Thailand all alone for a week as I already have my flights and can't afford a flight home.  Is there anything I can do to get them to pay for part of my flight?  Unfortunately I signed no paperwork for anything.  I simply paid the extra fee on top of my study abroad fee	No
2180	I wasn't really sure where to ask this so well try here. My roommate has a gf that moved in with us a couple of months back. She has been trying to convince me to allow her cousin to live with us. I have always said no. The gf has mental health issues and voluntarily admitted herself to a psychiatric ward. She was released the next day. She is claiming she had to sign a contract stating that the cousin had to be with her 24/7 until a further date with another doctor. If they are not they will be faced with jail time. This seems fishy to me but I dont even know where to start. Is there any truth to this? I feel like shes very manipulative to get her own way. If I say no to this she is moving and making my roommate, who is also good friend, leave with her.	No
2181	"Essentially in the title. But to explain, LL = Landlord.   On Sunday afternoon I saw a room I'd be renting in a house. Someone was renting the house herself, I think, and was then renting out the room to me. The place looked great and I informed her I would be interested. She said she would get back to me and a couple of hours later, a 2 hour long phone call occurred in which she said that everything seemed great and to come over the next day with the forms to sign. At this point I had informed her I was on disability and I was gay, not sure if relevant but meh. She said that she had only rented to people who were working before so she wasn't sure how to go about this. I explained I had to get her to sign a rental agreement thing and a form for a program that I'm in locally called THAP (basically they (the city) pay a portion of my rent to the landlord). She said okay but seemed slightly offput. Didn't think anything of it at the time. A lot I didn't think anything of at the time but I'm going to include it simply because it may be relevant.   I go over to her place with the forms and she reads them over and signs it. She makes a couple of notes outloud, such as ""Oh that means you'll have to take care of my flowers"" which isn't outlined quite like she made it seem. She circles and underlines a few things, strikes out an area where it says I gave her money for the month until I put it in myself with her watching. She signs the agreement, I give her the money, we both agree that the rest of the funds for first/last months rent would be given when I move in or at the end of the month. She states she will not deposit the funds just in case anything goes wrong. She asks me to text her after my surgery this morning. I agree, I bid her farewell and go home.   Blah blah wisdom teeth extraction blah, I wake up and send her a text saying my tongue felt enormous. She said it was normal but would wear off in a few days, and then the snore emoticon. I didn't notice and texted her back a few hours later. Within 30-45 minutes of me texting her, she sends me the following email.  &gt;Hi &lt;my name&gt;,    &gt;I know this is bad timing but after careful review with my lawyer-we are not comfortable with the doccuments..i would be held liable for tons and that isn't good so I have your money as stated yesterday June 17 2017 and you can get at anytime but this situation will not work out   &gt;regards, &lt;landlords name&gt;    I'm now looking for new places. I'm stressed to all hell and feeling overwhelmingly depressed. Which, I forgot to mention, she did ask what my disability was and I said that I had PTSD and depression. So, fuck her a bit. Anyway, thoughts?"	No
2182	In short: --Widowed mother's assets consist of an HECM* (reverse-mortgaged home) and just enough cash/savings to cover current bills: utilities, trash, monthly Visa/medical bills etc. _(*house is worth more than HECM balance)_  --There are also 2 life insurance policies worth &lt;$10,000 designating the same beneficiaries as the estate.    --In addition to HECM, known liabilities = medical bills + CC debt slightly &gt;$11,000.   --We'll sell the house as soon as we're able (6 months) and distribute those proceeds (minus estate liabilities) ASAP.  Our issue is that among the beneficiaries, some don't need the life insurance money and want it all applied to claims on the estate, while others have real, immediate need for any/all funds available to them. While we expect there to be _some_ additional money to split in 6-8 months, the life insurance should  pay out in a matter of weeks.  Hence the question: are we _required_ to apply life insurance $ to the estate's  existing debt, or can/should it be disbursed directly to beneficiaries when it's paid?  Once we understand what we can do legally, we can sort out what we should do ethically, and according to our Mom's wishes...  Thanks for the help. We're talking a fairly simple estate and not much money overall, but it's a lot to some of the heirs. We want to handle these matters legally and correctly to everyone's benefit, but hopefully without spending down the estate's assets on professional legal help.    That's where you good people come in...	No
2183	"Hi everyone. Quick question for a situation that I could see happening in the near future-  My roommate/landlord in Dover Delaware has a German Shepard. When he is not home, the dog runs and hides from me and stays in her kennel. When my roommate/landlord is home, she becomes very aggressive towards me. She will bark and growl as I come down the stairs, but usually runs away as I pass through the living room into the kitchen.   Last night, I was making my way from the kitchen through the living room heading toward the stairs, and she followed behind me and tried to bite my ankle. I shouted a ""Woah!"" as I saw her coming and she turned and ran. I figure it's only a matter of time before the dog bites me.   What legal course of action do I have if this happens?"	No
2184	A little bit of information: I just bought a condo this spring, my neighbor above me is a housing inspector, so I know it's not terrible. But the buildings are in bad shape. The climate is not ideal for such stucco buildings and over the last couple years it's apparent that the winter maintenance people were over salting and rusting the stairways, discoloring walls, etc.. The buildings are 1980's stucco on frame, practically falling apart. There are floating board walks that are rotting, and walls that are cracking, holes in dry wall covered parking(fire code offense). There is just a general lack of maintenance that has this place practically falling apart.  The budget has me really shaking my head. My monthly HOA just went up 10% from $220 to $230.  I really want to post a photo of the budget, cause it seems really fishy. I will if anyone requests it.  Some examples: $500 for telephone and internet, yet that's all paid for by tenants... So why are they charging us, and for what??  $5k for pool maintenance plus $500 for chemicals and another $800 for repairs. Why would the HOA have to pay for chemicals if they are contracting out the pool maintenance?  And $14k in electrical, yet residents pay their own electricity... What the hell is that for? $29k for sewage? I don't know what I'm talking about but isn't all that paid for with Taxes?  The HOA president owns a couple condos and rents them out and his dad works for the HOA with a grounds management contract. Something just doesn't feel right here. Should I get umbrella home insurance to cover this place falling apart? What can I/should I do without pissing them off too much and going after me?	No
2185	I don't know if there's any recourse here. I forgot to get insurance so I don't have anyone to cover a hotel for a month. I don't have $3000 extra for a hotel for a month (cheapest I could find with a pet is $100 a month). It's estimated apartment repairs will take a month and then I'll be allowed back into my apartment. Thankfully nothing in my unit was destroyed and I did talk to insurance about getting a policy as soon as I do move back in. I understand it was a mistake to not purchase and I usually do. I don't know why I forgot. I don't know what my options are except to be a wilderness man (go camping) as I don't have family in the area.	No
2186	Friend signed a lease a few months ago for this school year (starts mid-August), then changed her mind but didn't inform the landlord. Recently, the landlord sent her a second lease which included the assigned room, which she refused to sign. Is it too late to get out? How fucked is she if she leaves and gets sued? Thanks.	No
2187	I'm moving out of my place in DC this weekend. The landlord emailed me asking whether I'd scheduled the house to be professionally defleaed and deticked as well as professionally cleaned because of my service animal. I was caught off guard by this and checked my lease. Tucked away was a clause that backs up what my landlord is requesting:   &gt; If Tenant has a service pet, Tenant agrees to pay the cost of having the property defleaed and deticked by a professional exterminator, and if carpeted, the carpeting shampooed and deodorized by a professional cleaner, at the termination of occupancy    This is the first place I've ever rented and it is entirely my fault for not reading my lease in detail.   That being said, I looked up [DC statute] (https://beta.code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/7-1006.html) to see whether what he was requesting is legal. Under my interpretation of § 7–1006, landlords can't charge any extra fees for service animals beyond property damage. Am I mistaken in interpreting this?    Beyond that, though, I did some [google searching](http://www.realpropertymgt.com/landlord-center/tenants-pets/) and found multiple landlord/tenant sites that say that landlords cannot charge for cleaning fees for service animals beyond property damage.    Considering my dog did not have fleas or ticks during my stay at the house (which I have vet records to prove) nor does the house have carpeting, I don't believe I should be obligated to pay for extermination or cleaning. Am I wrong? Any advice would be great. Thanks.	No
2188	Recently (a month) I accepted a job that I am very unhappy at and know will not work out for me in the long run. I am an at will employee and both the offer letter and the employee handbook mentions that management requires 14 days notice in case of quitting. Now would i be in any legal trouble if I quit immediately?	No
2189	"I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...  tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.  Full story: I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail).   The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.  I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.  A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.  I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.  So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.  So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily."	No
2190	"I rent an apartment in Tennessee. My lease is set to end on July 31st, 2017. The leasing office is now requiring that all residents be moved out by 9 am on the 31st, or face an additional fine. Is that allowed? Because my lease just says ""until July 31st 2017"""	No
2191	So I saw something on Facebook about a cop that died.   I stupidly posted that I hope more cops die and that they deserve it because of the way they treat other people/ inmates ect   In my closing line I wrote   A bullet for a cop is a bullet for freedom   I was referring to dirty cops or the ones who abuse there power.   After that I posted   For clarity  I do not wish to kill any cops myself and I'm personally against killing cops.   But I wouldn't be sad if other people did kill cops.   Some butt hurt idiot said they screen capped the post and sent it to my local police department Facebook messages.   Honestly  I'm not going to or have I ever disrespected or killed a cop.    But I honestly thought I had the right to say how I feel about a situation.   I know it was a stupid post.  But I clearly stated I didn't want to kill anybody myself.   So at worst it could be a hate crime???   Honestly don't feel like going to jail over some stupid post on Facebook	No
2192	Last week myself and two other employees were riding from one part of our employers property to where our store is located. The drive is less than quarter of a mile. Our work truck is a regular cab Ford F350. My two other employees hopped in the cab. Seeing as though it's a bit cramped with junk in the cab + two employees I decided to hop in the uncovered bed of the truck. On our very short trip back to our store a NYS Trooper saw us and pulled a U-turn. I knew he was coming to stop us, but didn't think it was anything serious. Just a warning. I ended up hopping out of truck and headed inside as did the passenger of the truck. The driver went to park our work truck and the Trooper followed him into our parking lot. Turns out our employee was driving unlicensed(lost due to DUI) and without a seat belt. Originally we were stopped because I was in the bed of the truck. The police officer spoke with me, asked for all of my info and explain why I was stopped, but was not ticketed. He ended up speaking to our other employee for well over 20 minutes and later gave him a ticket for driving without a seat belt and without a license. Am I liable for paying half of this ticket when it has nothing to do with me? I'd understand if he was ticketed due to me being in the bed of the truck, but from what I read about our law I'm above the age where it's illegal and we were traveling less than the illegal distance.	No
2193	"Background: 31 male living with 2 other housemates renting a house since February 2016.    Issue(s)  Landlord was notified via text message on June 23, 2017 that the house has little to no water pressure. after finding out from a plumber on June 24, 2017 that the issue was large and involved repiping the entire house, the Landlord allowed the plumber to repair a small valve that allowed a very negligible change in water pressure to the house, and considered it solved even though our kitchen faucet still provides little to no water pressure. Also of note is that due to improper installation of both the front and back screen doors (wouldn't actually latch shut), have been removed due to them being totaled by a storm and have not been replaced after several months notice. Just looking for thoughts on if they are violating [ORS 90.368](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.368) and [90.320](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.320)  Along with that there have been several instances where the landlord and the landlord's mother have come onto the property to place signage(some of which has partially blocked are front door) and for his mother to ""garden"" or otherwise just wander onto the property.  Never once has he provided any sort of notice, 24 hours, or otherwise prior to these actions and has been informed several times that we never consented to their invasion and have photographed their trespass. looking at  [ORS 90.322](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.322) it appears they are both in violation.  Basically just looking to see if this was something to lawyer up for and if so, if anyone share their thoughts on which type of legal counsel to seek.  Thanks!"	No
2194	Just recently transferred a car from my dad to me and they copied my address down wrong and my new title should be 2700 my street address but it is 2706 my street address. Does this really matter, and if so are they going to try and charge me for their mistake?   Don't know if it makes a difference but the address they put on it does not technically exist.	No
2195	Kankakee, Illinois   Me and my fiance lived here for 3 months, the roof was leaking also the ceiling was leaking into the stove, which would smoke when turned on the oven part of it so we're scared to use it. The porch is also water damaged along with me almost falling through it.  The wall at the part of the house thats leaking is taking in water also, i put my hand on it one day to walk down the 1 foot apart death trap steps to the water leaking basement only to have the wall cave in a bit and i could hear stuff falling down it, the house wasn't inspected or anything before we moved in, we had to buy a steam cleaner and clean the nasty carpet, also painted the bedroom and re-did the flooring as well.  They never fixed anything other than putting a tarp on the roof, and has never done anything about it for a month now.   Every time we have asked our landlord (daughter) about anything she just told us to talk to her dad about it, and then he woudn't want to do anything. We were promised gutters and a back fence that never got put up, not worried about the fence but the gutters would prevent all the water leaking into the basement and the chance for mold and whatnot, we can't use the entire house as it is and they haven't fixed anything.  We've decided not to pay rent this month and have a lease being printed out for us on the new place and are using that to put down on the deposit and rent for the new place.  They just showed up asking for the rent and we told them we didn't feel we should have to pay this month being that i can't even use the entire house and that we're moving out soon around the end of the month.   I have taken pictures of everything and have tried to also save any conversations me and my fiance have had with this guy and his daughter.  Are we in the wrong? Should we pay rent, even though nothing got done?  My fiance is scared about going to court because they're saying they're going to put up a 5 day notice on our house and then start the eviction prosess, i mean we're gonna be gone by then but we will still have to deal with them in court.  Do we have a case or should we pay the rent and then move out?  Any help, advice, and/or information about this would be absolutely appreciated please and thank you.	No

2197	Family law cases, including domestic violence and child custody, represent the largest category of cases closed by LSC grantees each year. Millions of women, men, and children experience domestic violence in the U.S. every year. Legal aid is essential to protect domestic violence victims and their families and to help them overcome many associated problems that can endanger their safety and stability.   In 2016 LSC grantees closed 115,977 domestic violence cases involving nearly 282,014 victims and their families. This represents nearly 16% of all cases closed by grantees nationwide.  Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. On average, nearly **20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States.** During one year, this equates to more than 10 million individuals.   Often survivors face additional legal problems. Ninety-seven percent of low-income households with survivors of recent domestic violence or sexual assault experienced at least one other civil legal problem in the past year, including 67% that have experienced 6+ problems.   A study by the Institute for Policy Integrity found that civil legal aid is more effective than access to shelters or counseling services in reducing domestic violence—by as much as 21%. Increasing a woman’s chances of obtaining a protective order is the most effective way that legal assistance can reduce domestic violence. Survivors of domestic violence rate the filing of a protective order as one of their two most effective tools for stopping domestic violence, second only to leaving the abuser. Representation is critical in these cases as **83% of victims represented by an attorney successfully obtained a protective order, compared to only 32% of victims without an attorney.**  LSC grantees help clients [provide safe, stable environments for their children](http://www.lsc.gov/legal-aid-helps-domestic-violence-survivor-save-her-home), [build violence-free lives](http://www.lsc.gov/protecting-mother-six-domestic-violence-alaska), and [reunite with their families](http://www.lsc.gov/helping-father-reunite-his-children).

2198	This is a lenghty read ... Spoiler, no TL;DR at the end  :(  Some context - the company that my husband works for is based in Ohio. They have offices in many different states as well as Canada. So my husband and I moved to Mississippi from Oklahoma in October due to this employer relocating him. He has worked for this same company since March of 2017. We both work in Tennessee, but we live in Mississippi. We have switched our licenses, car tags, we have a lease on our rental house, etc. We are permanent, legal residents of Mississippi, and no longer have any legal ties in Oklahoma.  So, the company - until November - was still taking out Oklahoma state witholding on the income tax on his paychecks. He called and asked them to change it to Mississippi- which I thought fixed it. No. From then until present they are taking out Tennessee State taxes. ??? We don't live in Tennessee so we will not file Tennessee State taxes - and Tennessee does not have state tax anyway.  Other than that, Mississippi has the stupid Employees Witholding Exemption Certificate that works as the state's W-4 (at least that's how my employer explained it). I had to fill one out for my job, and I told him to submit one for his when we first moved here. They refused it and said it is useless to them because they do not have an office in Mississippi.  So I did the only thing I could think of and submitted a new W-4 for his company where he withholds more on federal so we can make up the difference when tax time next year rolls around. However, when he submitted it, we noticed his paychecks are different but still more than they should be with the extra taxes taken out. They still are not taking out the extra witholding! He sent in an actual signed form that had our witholding amount on it, and the one they're showing on file is an electronically filled out one with no extra witholding form and it is e-signed. They also had him listed as a D.D.S. (yes, Doctor of Dental Surgery) on his paychecks. I can guarantee if he was a DDS, he wouldn't be working for this bass ackwards company!!  I'm beyond frustrated. I just don't know if I have any ground to stand on with getting an attorney/lawyer. If I do I'm more than willing to hire one. I know that this won't affect our taxes that we are about to file much, if at all, it's next year's that I'm worried about. With our extra witholding, do I even need to really be worried about it, or am I thinking way too much about this?? Thanks in advance for any and all advice!!	No
2199	I moved into my apartment in March. The complex is designed so each unit is accessed from the outside. The stairways are covered, but are open on all sides. When I was viewing the apartment, I noticed a number of bird's nests in the stairwells, several of which were directly outside the door of the unit I am now renting. I was assured by the lady showing the place that the bird's nests would be removed before the spring. I was a bit desperate for a place, so I believed them and moved in.   Of course, the nests were not moved, and are now full of little baby birds. I think they are swallows, but I'm not certain. I didn't mind them at first, but they've quickly started to cause some problems. First, they are filthy. There is bird shit everywhere. I can't set foot outside my front door without stepping in a huge pile of bird shit. My indoor cat got a tapeworm. She has never set foot outdoors and I can't imagine the flea that gave it to her came from anywhere other than the birds. The mother birds are entirely unafraid of people and are becoming more and more territorial. They swoop at me when I try to access my apartment. They've even hit me a few times. They will hang out on my door frame. They don't fly away no matter what I do. If they wanted to enter the apartment when I open the door, I would not be able to stop them. Perhaps worst of all, they are so *loud.* From about 2am until sunrise, they ***scream.*** I have no idea why. It keeps me up all night and freaks out my cat. Last night was the worst instance. Between the avian shrieking and my cat running all over and howling, I didn't sleep at all. I'm working a full day on less than a half hour's rest.   I figure the first step is to contact the main office about them. I didn't think too much about moving the nests before the birds came back for the spring, but now that they are there, I don't know what can be done. I'm really afraid that they will just destroy the nests and kill the babies. Can I call animal control or maybe a bird sanctuary and have them safely relocated? Are there laws that would prevent that? As a tenant, am I legally allowed to handle this myself? Any and all advice would be appreciated. I understand and respect if they are protected by wildlife laws. But damn, I need some sleep.	No
2200	My current landlord isn't great, in fact he's a slumlord. My partner and I are moving out of his building, code enforcement has been contacted, etc...  But I have a bad feeling that he does not actually have our security deposit.   Thankfully, in Maine he legally has to provide me with the account information in which my deposit is held at my request.  When I reached out to the bank with that information today, I was informed that it was not a landlord-tennant account but instead my landlord's personal savings account, meaning I am not able to get any account information from the bank regarding if my money is in it.   I tried looking through our statues and could find nothing about if he is able to keep this money in his personal account and before I make a big deal out of this I want to make sure I'm actually in the right.	No
2201	The landlord says that they're waiting to hear back from the fire chief (they have been waiting for days) when we were able to call the city and get an answer in just one minute. It's absolutely required by law where we see that the landlord provide one. We had bought one after landlord told us to get one and we'd be reimbursed but now they're saying they're not going to (yet) because they're not sure that it is actually required.  Now, it's only a ~$30 detector, but the point is the months that we didn't have one due to their incompetence of replacing our CO detector with a smoke detector. Would there be a point of pursuing legal action beyond just getting the CO detector paid for?   Also, who tf knows how many other tenants they're endangering.	No
2202	"So I have a slightly convoluted and problematic issue regarding my (and friend's) security deposit. Before I go on, we understand a lot of things were done incorrectly and are willing to concede that this may just have to be a costly life lesson. I should note that the landlord was a former coworker so we put up with a lot of things since he was a ""friend."" He's entered our property multiple times without notice or with very minimal notice - i.e. texting us that he'll be at the house in 10 minutes, etc. So we didn't really do anything by the book at all unfortunately. He also tried guilt tripping us multiple times when we signed the original lease saying that ""there were tons of people who wanted this place and offered him more money per month."" We told him that we already signed the agreed upon price of $2600/month and if he really had offers of $3.5k+, we'd be happy to cancel the lease and move on. He always backed down when we called his bluffs.   Anyway, my friend and I signed a lease with our landlord back in 2015 for a ~15 month lease that was suppose to end in February of 2017. The agreed upon terms were $2600/month for 3 people, upped to $2900 if 4 people moved in and a security deposit of $3500. We had a friend move in a bit later as an unofficial subletter with nothing signed (landlord was okay with this). My roommate and I are the only people on the official signed lease so we continued to just make payments in our names. We had no issues until I decided to move out last July with permission from both landlord and roommate. We had a friend come in and unofficially sublet my room and my original roommate continued to make payments. We're all very good friends so I decided to wait to get my original security deposit after the lease was terminated (we're all childhood friends with no money problems so trust isn't an issue).   Then things got a little messed up. The landlord owns 2 properties next to each other. The tenants from his other property decided to move into our place and ""break"" their current lease (our lease wasn't affected by this at all). However the landlord used this opportunity to raise the rent for EVERYONE. There was no new lease signed or anything. Again he quoted that the original lease was below market price and that he'd like to make it fair for him (yes, bullshit I know). They all agreed and it was all verbal since they viewed him as a friend and that he was pretty flexible given the chaotic change that just occurred. So he raised the rent to $3600 without any documentation, no new leases or anything. I thought they all had signed a new lease when this happened but it seems that the only signed lease that exist is the on from 2015.  Regardless, rent gets paid every month on time without issue. Now fast forward to this year and my former roommates wanted to extend the lease for a few months. They notified the landlord (verbally) that they intend to vacate the property by July (they let him know in June). However they didn't give an official 30 day notice in writing (yes, I told them to but they didn't listen for some reason). That's when the landlord notified them that he had spent/didn't have our security deposit and would return the deposit to us as soon as new tenants came and occupied the rooms they vacated. He would just take their deposits and give it to us.   So on paper, there's only one lease that ends Feb 2017 and switches to month-to-month. Then my ex-roommates verbally notified the landlord they'd like to stay a little longer. They give a verbal notice to vacate the premise in June with intent to leave in July. They move out in July but paid the full month's rent just in case. Now the landlord says the money is gone and won't have it for us until new tenants come in. He's demanded we find new tenants to cover the vacated premise even though they already gave him an verbal 30 day notice (and they paid him July rent as a goodwill gesture).   Sorry if this is super confusing as it's been pretty much a disaster since I moved out. I realize this would've been a slam dunk had my roommates just documented everything but it gets messy since they didn't. Any advice on how to proceed? Thanks!"	No

2204	"I live in an apartment in Lansing, MI and I've recently been having issues with cigarette smoke. To preface, my girlfriend and I both have asthma and are sensitive to smoke. My building manager and assistant manager are both smokers, and they have set up smoking areas with chairs and ash trays in both the attached parking garage (about 10 feet from the entrance door) and on the 2nd floor pool terrace (about 15 feet from the entrance door). I've talked to them multiple times about getting rid of these smoking areas, and they basically say ""people are going to smoke there anyways, if we get rid of the ash trays there will just be butts on the ground,"" which is a bullshit excuse because there are butts all over the ground right next to the ash trays anyways (fuck smokers).  There is a section in our lease that says smoking is not allowed within 50 feet of building entrances, and I believe the Michigan Smoke Free Air law says the same thing.  My question is, who can I contact the rectify this situation? Is there some kind of inspector or something who deals with/ enforces stuff like this? Thanks!"	No
2205	So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
2206	A friend of mine used to live in an apartment complex in a college town. This was about 3 years ago - when he left, the apartment sent a bill for $2,100 for repairs and damages after balancing out the deposit. My friendly firmly believes that there is no way the damages have been that much. Recently, they filed a lawsuit in the county court and he has to appear. He is thinking about hiring a lawyer and was planning to start a petition. Any suggestion(s) would help.	No
2207	Okay, so here is the story, my neighbor drinks heavy and is a heavy drug user. Due to this she gets very violent and is always running outside and pondering on different doors. I have called the police multiple times and told me apartment manger about it each time. Nothing is done, and has gotten to the point I don't free safe walking my dog at night and on top of that I have my elderly mother living with me and she is scared to even leave the place for a second. My question is at this point can I break my lease without paying the huge fees? I still have 10 months left otherwise.	No

The buyer has used two different phone numbers.  * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment.   * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.  * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.  * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.  * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.  Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.  Aside from not cashing the check what is my legal obligation at this point?  I've googled the credit union in GA and am considering calling them tomorrow to alert them.  In addition should I take the check to the police? Right now all i have is the check, the LetGo user information, and the two phone numbers the scammer used."	No
2209	"Due to various circumstances the ground rent and service charge on my flat didn't get paid and it got passed to a solicitor after 30 days.  The service charge was £724 but they have added on £490 legal and administration costs.  No where in my lease does it say I have to pay legal costs for late payment but they are being very aggressive with me and saying they will write to my mortgage company and I will incurr more legal fees on top.  I can't pay those fees, I just dont have the money.  I offered to pay the property management company the outstanding balance minus fees and they refused, saying that once it's passed to solicitors it is out of their hands and I have to pay them.  The solicitors said I must pay them or they will write to my mortgage company and it will get added onto my mortgage and they will put on further legals fees of £350.  I do not want to pay £490 &amp; £350 for ""legal fees"" which basically amount to writing a letter (even if I could).  They are not my solicitors and there is no wording in my lease mentioning legal fees.  I have the property management companies bank details on record so I just made the transfer of £724 direct into their account and told them it was for the outstanding fee and I do not give my consent for these funds to be drawn against any additional administration or legal costs.  I also have a ground rent that has an online payment system but they disabled this.  They won't let me pay it or tell me how much is outstanding, they just refer me to the same solicitor that charged £490 on the service charge.  I am waiting to hear back how much they have added on for this but i assume its about the same.  All in all it will be over a thousand pounds of legal fees for a couple of late payments.  Am I getting myself into trouble here?  If I send them a cheque for the ground rent minus legal fees will I be getting myself into trouble?  Are they allowed to refuse my payment and just write to my mortgage comapny and claim whatever they want?  This seems like madness.  Why charge me £350, why not £3,000 if they can just make up any fees they want?  It seems extremely unfair that they can just make up legal fees and then get it added on to my mortgage.  It's very stressful, can anyone provide any advice?"	No
2210	I'm wondering if any employment attorneys can help me identify the basic criteria for a successful hostile work environment claim. Specifically, suppose an employer has acted negligently, but perhaps not intentionally so, in a fashion that adversely impacts an employees career or mental health, is that sufficient for a hostile workplace claim?   As an example, say you work for a company where you need special licensure and that company screws up the process, keeping you from working. Is there a claim there?   What if your company prevents you from working for an extended period, which results in problems for you elsewhere? Say for example an 18 wheeler driver has a bunch of cocaine discovered in his trailer shipment. He has nothing to do with the coke smuggling but gets suspended for 6 months by his company anyway. Is this a hostile work environment?  What if an employee is excessively drug tested or scrutinized at work?   What if an employee is pressured to accept unfavorable workplace evaluations as a condition of returning to work?	No
2211	"I involved a car accident last September 5th. since then I had Dr. visited almost every other week. My auto insurance paid some medical bill, but deny other. I consider hire an attorney to file a lawsuit. I want to clarify the ""1 year anniversary"" thing.  Let's say I have a treatment 12/1/2016 which auto insurance deny the payment, I must file lawsuit before 11/30/2017, or 9/4/2017?  Second question, what's the threshold to hire an attorney. Let's say if unpaid bill is $1000, I probably just go with my medical insurance (I still need to pay about $1000 for the deductible). But if it's $10k, I definitely want to hire an attorney. But how about the figure is in between? Last time I review my bill, it's about $3000.  I wonder if it's wise to go with attorney route?"	No
2212	I've been on probation for the last three years. I got caught with a fair amount of weed a couple years ago and got put on 2 years deferred adjudication. I violated once last year, but got re-instated with one year added. Today I saw my probation which he said would be the last time. So my question is will I go before my judge before I'm off or what exactly happens now. My official off date is August 22.	No
2213	I live in Washington. I have bipolar disorder and I had a severe manic episode that started around the 20th of June. On June 28th, I bought a 2013 Subaru WRX STI. I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k.    Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership.   I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price). They took the other route and had their lawyer send an email basically just saying there's no 3 day grace period or anything like that in Washington.   I know I'm definitely knee-deep in shit for this, but does anyone have any suggestions? I'm debating just leaving it there and taking the credit hit from a default. I make pretty good money for my age but I don't want to be stuck with those ridiculous payments. Even just seeing the car gives me anxiety and reminds me of all the bad decisions I made during that manic episode.	No
2214	The person whose trailer I hit wasn't present, but I left a note.  I'm trying to figure out whether it would be my boat insurance or Auto insurance?  I'm assuming auto, since the neither boat was present at the time.  Will my auto insurance cover damages to their trailer? (I have full coverage) and will I pay a deductible for that?  Its about $2400 in damages, and I'd rather not tell my insurance company and have my rates go up if I end up having to pay $1000 for the deductible when I can try to scrape up the money for the full amount.	No
2215	"Ok, so I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I recently found out that an ex of mine had called the police on me multiple times during our relationship and after it. He had claimed I was stalking him. I don't know how he convinced the police not to speak to me, or maybe he gave them my incorrect information, who knows.. But I never spoke to an officer. I only found out, well, I found out the first bit one day when I looked at his phone and saw him repeat dialing this number. When I called it, it was a sargents number. I woke him up and confronted him about it. That's when I found out he had called the police on me for accidentally breaking his window. He never set his buzzer up on his apartment, and when I'd come over, since he didn't want me to yell, I'd have to throw something at his window to get his attention to let him know I was there. One time it cracked the very edge of the glass, a tiny hairline fracture. (If I were intentionally breaking his window, I'd probably throw a brick through it, not my set of keys like I always did). Mind you, when he called the police he was texting wiith me saying he wanted to move in with me, etc... And he had called the woman he was cheating on me with.. right before calling the police (lol). Anyway, much later, I come to find out he called and made stalking claims against me when I'd be somehwere he was and I'd almost bust him cheating.. He'd then like.. stop communicating with the police about it, so it would never go anywhere. Anyway, I have printed off the proof that he's full of crap, he told me to do everything he subsquently called the police on me for, and that while telling the police I was ""stalking him and harasassing him"".. he was actually stalking and harassing me because I didn't want to be with him and he wouldn't stop bothering me. I mean, he messaged me on valentines day and I didn't read it for two weeks.. And I find out, recently, in that two weeks in took me to respond he was on here posting about how he ""just wants to be left alone"" and how I ""won't stop stalking him"".. He got meaner and meaner the further time went on and I didn't answer. Crazy ass behavior. Anyway.. is there a law against this? There freaking has to be?"	No
2216	We are in Ontario Canada and have been looking at places in Toronto, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario.  We signed one buyers representation agreement with an agent in the Toronto area when we were looking to lease a place in Toronto. We just moved to Toronto on July 1st and ended up finding a place without the agent.  The agent marked on file that he is helping us out for the Toronto central, east and west area. He says he only works in the Toronto area and Windsor is about 4 to 5 hours drive away.  In Windsor we are signing with another agent and purchased offer was accepted yesterday evening.  Today we are planning to send acknowledgment forms, sign buyer representation with the Windsor agent and so on.  I am wondering if there will be any problem with the previous agent trying to take the new ones commission or anything.  Any info helps!   ** TL;DR: Signing buyers representation with two different agents in two two different cities about 4 to 5 hours away from each other.  Neither of them work in the others duristiction but are in the same province. Any problems here?  **	No
2217	So last night my friend and I were riding home from a concert and were pulled over for speeding. Both my friend and I had sobered up to drive home, so we were not really worried about any DUI or alcohol charges. My friend stated immediately that this was a rental vehicle only he was authorized to drive, and that even if I had to drive I could not. The officer breathalyzed my friend and he was under the limit to continue driving home. The officer proceeds to breathalyze me and apparentely I still had alcohol in my system. Why I was even questioned is confusing to me considering I was only a passenger and had brought no suspicion. So my friend got a speeding ticket and I received an underage for literately sitting in a vehicle driving home. Worth noting this is my second underage charge, even though I participated in a program to have the charge reduced to a disorderly conduct. I also turn 21 in about 20 days so this is a huge and unexpected incovenience. I plan on speaking to an attorney tomorrow regarding this issue, but for now do I have enough to build a case and try to fight this charge? I really do feel wronged and that I should have never been questioned.   Thank you for your help.	No
2218	I'm just curious if I have any recourse against them. They charged me for blind replacement (cited reason was broken) and i know for a fact it wasn't broken because I never once opened my window or touched my blinds. Do I have any recourse? Anything I could throw at them to make them prove that the stuff was broken before charging me for it? I know it's a long shot but they're trying to rape me for ever dollar I have it seems like and I don't have much. I was very meticulous and diligent about cleaning and checking everything when I left. Nothing was broken and everything was clean.	No
2219	Long story short.... Brand New Apartment 8/12 months completed of lease.  Rain Storm 6/17- Caused water to come in through window damaging walls, floors, and bedding wet. Call apartment complex, said they would send someone out from the onsite contractors.   7/12- Another storm- same result. Once again contacted property management said they were not sure what to do, and would be fixed within the week. Dropped off a $50 gift card.  7/22- Another storm- Same result however I was not home to move things out of the way, and my bed has been damaged along with floor, walls.  I am concerned with the growth of mold because I have severe asthma. I have looked at the tenant handbook from the state, not much help.   I have spoken with executive leaders of the property management and they could care less.  What are options in terms of course of action to get out of lease and pursue damages?	No
2220	So long story short: My parents have owned/lived in a 4plex for about 25 years. My dad came down with dementia recently, and my mom isn't really up to running it herself, so I've been managing the day to day stuff without pay. I do not have POA and am not otherwise legally entangled in this other than getting things fixed and telling tenants to talk to me about complaints/problems rather than my dad (nothing is in writing for this, if that matters). But legally speaking everything is in their name.  So one tenant recently has a tendency to sometimes play loud music, which by itself isn't really a problem, but he is also definitely smoking weed. One of the other tenants has complained about the scent in the hallway in a text message, and I've noticed it as well.  Now I personally don't really care about this, but I'd like to know if there's any legal repercussions that could happen to my parents here. They were never involved in any of that stuff and definitely wouldn't know what the smell was from (and I've never heard them mention it anyway). The tenant pays every month and otherwise isn't a bother, and quite frankly since I don't have POA trying to do an eviction would be a massive pain in the ass. Unfortunately I know Indiana has been regressive with their drug laws and I'm worried that this could somehow end up as a forfeiture or something.  Is there anything I can or should do here?	No
2221	I just got caught going 108 in a 75 on a deserted highway in Colorado; just under the 40mph cutoff. I read that it carries a six point penalty on the license, which is fine, but being unfamiliar with the law in Colorado I was wondering if anyone knew what I could expect at my court date in Burlington; or if there is any way I can avoid traveling back to appear (I'm from the east coast). Are they typically lenient with out of state drivers? Is there anything specific I should say to the judge? Where I'm from the court will virtually always plea it down to something else. Is that how it works out here as well? Do I face jail time? I have some money, but not a lot, and the plane fare both ways is going to kill me this year.	No
2222	I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	No
2223	"Hey guys. I have posted before about this issue and have done research, but I do not understand the law very well.   So, I have been having a sewer gas issue in my bathroom for about three months. Even after a major sewer pipe was fixed (upstairs neighbors clogged the pipes with wipes and sewage ended up in my kitchen and living room) and the toilet ""repaired"", the smell is now more frequent than ever.  This is driving me nuts. I can't even use my bathroom without a mask. Sewer gas is dangerous and can be bad for my health, as well as flammable. I have called many times, and the landlord sends maintenance, but nothing is fixed. Two days later, the smell comes back.   I have sent my official notice to move out three weeks ago, but the new place won't be ready until late August/early September. I have to stay at my SO's place at least once a week because of this problem (I am in a basement apartment where ventilation is not the best).  Even though the landlord is trying to fix it, am I still able to try the ""Repair and Deduct"" tactic?  Is my apartment still safe according to the law? I am at a loss; I am almost tempted to move in with someone else until I move out completely."	No
2224	So I'm from Missouri, and I went to Alaska for a couple years as a missionary for my church and had to get an Alaska driver's license (DL). Returned home, then went straight to school out of state without giving it a second thought (I mean, I probably actually look at the DL no more than once every 3 months)  My Alaska DL is going to expire in a couple of months, but I have no plans (or money for that matter) to return home just to get a new one, but I'm also not sure that I should get one in my school state, as I'll most likely only be here for another 8ish months.  I really don't like the idea of trying to live off of an expired license, so should I just get one here, even though I won't be here that long? Or is there a way to remotely get one from home (my research so far says no though)?	No
2225	So long story short, I was awarded this scholarship by a university to complete a Master's programme with them. However, I ended up not getting admitted to the course, and hence would have to forfeit my scholarship.   But the scholarship department transferred the money to my bank account (due to a lack of communication between departments) but is now asking for it back.  Aside from moral dubiousness, how legal would it be for me to just block the email and keep the money to pay for a Master's programme at another university? I never signed any legal document (I think) apart from the below acceptance form but I'm not sure if it's legally binding. I'm still wrestling with the moral dilemma but I'd still like to know whether or not it would be legal. Any help would be appreciated!   Picture of form: http://imgur.com/a/vOpo4	No
2226	I bought a home 6 or 7 years ago. When we bought the home, everything was newly renovated and beautiful. Fast Forward to today and the house is falling apart because the contractors cut corners. To make matters worse, the renovators redid a room that was an unpermitted addition to our home. The structure is going to require upwards of 40k to make it livable again. I don't have the money to fix it. What do I do? Can I get out of my mortgage? Can I go through a foreclosure without declaring bankruptcy? What does that mean?	No
2227	Hi r/legaladvice! This is my first post! I was hoping to gain some clarity on this issue, and haven't had much luck so far in my interweb search.    I live in a rent controlled duplex in Oakland, California, in my sixth year. I had a lease the first year and it has been month to month since then. The lease says I have a parking spot, and the landlord has gone out of his way to park his car there (he lives ten miles away) so that I cannot. I have three questions:  1. Can the landlord amend the lease to change a detail such as where I park my car? The landlord wants to give my parking spot to another unit that is currently unoccupied, but when occupied will pay more rent (which is why he wants to give them my foot taking spot). Do I have to agree to the change?  2. The other unit is unoccupied, but to discourage me from parking in the spot that he wants the lower unit to now have, he parked his car there. My lease (which is now month to month) explicitly states I have this spot, and that only I can park there. Legally, could I tow his car? What about this qualifying for “loss of service”?  3. There is a shared laundry room that both units use. It is not stated that I get to use it on the lease, but I have a written request from him a few years ago asking for ten bucks a month for increased water usage for using the laundry room. In other words its kind of a verbal agreement that I can use the laundry room. Legally can he take that away from me?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Reddit!	No
2228	We had a rental company perform a background check, and it came back with 3 evictions for my wife in NC a year before we even lived in NC. There is no way the evictions are correct, and we have no idea who to contact.  We had them validate it was my wife's social, but they won't email us the full report.  1. Who do we contact to figure out why the evictions are showing up? 2. Is it possible the background check was wrong and we could see different results if we did our own background check?	No
2229	I am located in Riverside, CA.  I have now been moved out of my old house for 4 weeks and a day. In California the law is that the security deposit as well as deduction recipe must be returned in three weeks.  My landlord even stated this in a text to me so he is well aware of the fact.  I haven't received anything back and recently contacted my other two roommates, one who moved out in December and got his deposit back last month, and the other who moved out at the same time as me and hasn't received anything as well. What should I do? Should I sue for the full deposit+more because the landlord has a history and seems to be acting in bad faith.  Especially since he has demonstrated he is well aware of the law.

2231	I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother.   Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.  I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge.   Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three? Im just wondering if this is worth doing or if I am going to be doing the same thing wether i manage to get the weed charge off or not.  All input is appreciated, Thanks	No
2232	"Company A provided service to two appliances in my rental house in 2013 and 2015. My tenants put in a maintenance request on one of the appliances a few days ago and the company I hired for this service reported that there was evidence of improper work on the appliance in question. They checked the other appliance in the house and found that the same evidence was there for that one as well. The certified technician reported that both appliances are in need of being replaced and gave me an $8k estimate for the work. He said he could possibly ""put a bandaid on them for the short term"" but put it in writing that in his professional opinion, they need to be replaced. The bandaid costs $1600 and he said he cannot warranty the work. He told me outright that he could perform the service, charge me $1600, and an hour later tell me it didn't work costing me the $8000 to have them replaced.   I asked the technician for some details about why he thought it was the previous company, and he gave me some jargony information. I have evidence that Company A serviced both appliances.   I spoke to a lawyer who said it sounds like an open and shut case. That he'd work on a contingency fee, submit the paperwork, and expect to hear back from their insurance company for a settlement (he said that's what typically happens). I know for a fact Company A has liability insurance.   I'm not sure if it matters or not, but the two appliances have been serviced 9 times in five years by Company A, and there's always been some problem with the work. I don't think one of the 9 times featured them fixing an issue the first time out. It always warranted a second call. One of the appliances was installed brand new by Company A in 2013 and a major part of the other appliance was installed brand new in 2015. Typical lifetime of each produce is 10-20 years.   Do I really have a case?   The biggest issue for me is that I have tenants that I have to take care of immediately. I can't wait for the courts to go through, and my lawyer advised that I go ahead and get the appliances replaced because I have tenants. This is really costly as a landlord, and I only became a landlord after my job transferred me unexpectedly. I wasn't able to sell my house (thanks housing market crash!), so I got renters. I can pay for the $8k, but it's going to put me in a bit of a bind if anything else comes up.  If it were me living in the house, I'd probably try to tough it out until I get more clarity from my lawyer and see how the court case was going to go. I might even just try the $1600 fix and see if it keeps me well for a few months for me to get some extra funds together if anything else occurs. But again, my tenants have to come first here.   Thanks for any advice you can give!"	No

2234	relevant to australian law.  Long, exhausting series of events kept as short as possible.  My car was incorrectly repossessed. During the repossession the car was damaged (as per the marks in the road), I was belittled and insulted by the repo agent as well as the tow truck operator.  I was provided no documentation and no identification.  Upon calling the leasing company, they've said it was incorrectly repossessed. I've requested documentation regarding how and why this happened and they send me an email saying the vehicle can be picked up. 3 hours away in a different state.  I've called them again today and asked for a follow up - they've acknowledged they've received my email and I asked him to get me a response by the end of the day as it's now been a week i've been without transport.  He said hes not going to guarantee something he cant follow through on, as he's busy with other work.  I also asked for an update on the time taken to get the car back to me, they said i have to keep waiting or organise a truck myself.  So i call the company thats currently holding the vehicle, and they tell me they will call me back.   In between all of this, i've been in touch with varying states of legal aid, and compensation aid and i've had no help - i get told to call someone else, who tells me to call someone else, who loops me back to the first person.  I'm frustrated, defeated and still carless.   This has made a terrible impression at my new workplace and I'm fear of losing my job if im unable to keep asking friends and family for help getting to and from work.   I'm backed into a corner and dont know what to do next.   someone please help me.	No
2235	A few months ago my boyfriend bought an apartment. When seeing it for the first time it looked okay apart from some minor finishing touches that had to be done, so my BF bought it. We were especially happy about the bathroom, since it was installed just two years ago and we wouldn't have to do anything about it in regard to (re)installing anything.  When we moved in we noticed that there was a lot of water on the threshold of the bathroom, but at first we wrote it off as condensation. A few months later we wanted to put the finishing touches on the bathroom (before we mainly focused on new outlets, wallpaper and wooden panels which we had installed on the floor against the wall), which included putting on some silicone stuff on the edges of the tiles. The silicone stuff wouldn't stick and we noticed that the water wasn't condensation as we thought, but it seemed to come from underneath the tiles of the bathroom. We immediately called a plumber company and they came by to check for leaks. He had to remove some floor tiles and the tiles that are placed against the built-in bathtub.  Long story short: the plumbers discovered that the bathtub was improperly installed; the construction on which the bathtub should be resting was not installed properly. Large parts of of the wooden beams were rotten due to water slipping through the silicone. This was only possible because the tub had no proper construction to rest on, causing the silicon between the tub and the wall tiles to slowly detach over time. Also the drainage pipes weren't properly installed, one of them was even broken, presumably from installing the bathtub.  So, the leakage and water damage which came from that were caused by the work of the previous owners, who installed the bathroom incorrectly. We had to replace the tiles, the whole bath plus installation and drainage and the drainage of the sink. You can imagine that this was quite costly (±3000eu,-).  We already sent a registered letter to inform the previous owner we hold them accountable for the sustained damages, but they haven't responded.  What can we do now? I've heard it's very hard to prove that the previous owner had to know about the leakage, and that a legal case depends on proving this since this is one of the exceptions of the 'we bought the apartment with all its visible and hidden defects' thing in the contract (because the leakage wouldn't classify the apartment as 'unlivable').  I hope someone can give us advice on how to proceed. We both just finished school so we don't have a lot of money saved, and €3000,- is a lot of money for us. Especially since we didn't expect to have to redo parts of the bathroom. We live in the Netherlands by the way.  Thanks in advance :-)	No
2236	I was involved in a road rage incident in which someone fired shots directly at my vehicle as I was driving down the road- one of the rounds hit my car, less than a foot away from me. The perpetrator was arrested immediately and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. It is a cut and clear case and I believe that this person will be convicted.  I am far from what you would call a proponent of pursuing damages in court, but I believe this individual intended to harm me (or worse). I was extremely shaken up directly after everything happened, but went on about my business as usual after providing my statement to the police, etc. It scared the hell out of me, naturally, but I never expected to have any further problems. Unfortunately, ever since the incident occurred, I have had persistent nightmares and experience panic attacks almost daily. I have missed nearly two weeks of work. I think most people would consider me to be a fairly realistic and level-headed person, but there have been times where I've been afraid to even leave my house due to the admittedly paranoid misapprehension of my assailant stalking me with the intention of harming me. I get anxious every time I see the same kind of vehicle the assailant was driving or if I hear a car backfire, etc.  Basically, I am dealing with quite a lot of unexpected mental woes stemming from an event that was more traumatic than I initially realized. I've given this a lot of thought and I have yet to come to a final decision, but I'd like to know what steps I should take in the event that I do elect to take legal action against my assailant.	No
2237	"Good Morning /r/LegalAdvice  First and foremost, the person in question does have a Reddit account, and does know my username, but attempts at contact with him have failed so I need advice.  What I thought was one of my best friends moved in with me after I got him a job working as a Sales Rep in my office. I'm not here to discuss our friendship, but what happened when he quit/was let go and moved out all within 12 hours.  On June 29th, at 11p, while my Roommate was drunk and upset, he sprung on me that he had been looking for jobs in Dallas and ""had a line on a job"".This was very shocking to me because 1) told me at 11p on the first night of the first PTO I'd taken from work since I started working there. 2) He was drunk 3) My life had just started to come together, so I was also a bit emotional. We argued a bit, and it came down to that he hated Houston because all of his friends were in a town where we went to college together, and he was used to the bar life of getting up at 4p, going to work at 6p, partying while working, and then going to bed at 6a. The M-F/8-5 life was not ideal for him.  We had both agreed I would talk to my boss in the morning to see if there was something that could be done about getting him more training. But in the morning when my boss agreed to more resources and training to make him feel more confident, my roommate said he'd made up his mind and he wasn't invested anymore. That's his right, but since he had no clients and no ties to the company, we did not want to pay him for work he had told us he wouldn't be doing. So his last day was made on June 30th, and he was told this at 11a.   Since I was still on PTO, I was home when he got home from the office. He spoke no words to me, and instead packed. I thought he was packing to go to Dallas (since he was gone every weekend), but instead he packed all of his things. The only communication came when I called him and told him I needed him to leave his company issued phone. He said he was fixing his personal phone, and that he would be back. I had plans that evening so I told him to leave the phone on the table.  I returned home later and most of his things were gone, and the phone was on the table. He had left his bed frame, mattress, desk, chair, dressers, couch, and TV stand, along with other smaller items. I just had to put two-and-two together and realized that he was not leaving for the weekend, but that he had moved out.  I have not heard from him since, except for when he inquired about his last check. He has not responded to my attempts to contact him via email.  I spoke with our leasing agent about the situation (we signed on a townhome that is individually owned in an HOA community). She said because he walked off, he will not get his half of the deposit back (which was agreed upon in the lease), and that we will need to sign a new lease, but that this will not go on my renter's history or credit.  Now it's also worth mentioning that when I got the company phone back, no messages had been deleted. While there were some hurtful messages not appropriate for this post, He did mention in the texts that he would ""probably leave the furniture if [I'm] ok with it"".  I emailed him two days ago the following:  &gt; Good Evening, &gt;  &gt; I need to know what your plan is for your things, rent, and the light bill in June.  &gt;  &gt; Options: &gt;  &gt; - Come get your things by the 7/26 and pay rent for their storage. Also pay half of electric bill for June. Leave your keys. &gt;  &gt; - Leave your things and consider them paying for rent. Also pay half of electric bill for June. Mail back your keys. &gt;  &gt; I need to have everything squared away by the 26th as I will be out of town from the 27th to the end of the month. I would prefer that you do not come here while I am not here for security reasons. I will have the place armed and have taken your code off of the alarm system.  &gt;  &gt; Please reply back by the end of the day Friday. No response will indicate that you have abandoned the property and will not be paying rent, but instead your items will be collateral for rent.  &gt;  &gt; I do however expect payment for the light bill in June. Nit the past due, that has been paid. The current charges. I am not asking for payment for the internet or cable, although you did use them, which I think is a fair trade off. If you would like to pay for them and square away any debts, I'm open to discussion.  &gt;  &gt; I'm open to other options, but I will not budge on the end date of 7/26. &gt;  &gt; Thank you, &gt;  &gt; - [redacted]  And a follow up email:  &gt; Please respond by 11:59 p.m. July 21 with your intentions, so I can arrange to be in the apartment, should you choose to come for your things.  I have not heard anything, and he has until tomorrow at midnight, but I guess my question or need for advice, is if I don't hear from him, what do I need to do? We didn't sign any agreements, other than the lease.  I have an abusive ex with a standing restraining order, and thus I am very anxious about the security of my place. My roommate is aware of this.  I would like to start finding another roommate, but I am unable to because of his things in the room. His things are hindering my ability to figure out rent and my new living situation, because I don't want to touch them and then be blamed for something.  What should my next step be? Do I have ground to stand on, or am I just screwed in all directions?  Quick Note: The electric bill I'm asking for payment for is for the month of June, while he was here, not for the month of July when he wasn't here."	No
2238	"I live in a small apartment complex west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin with only six units, so there's only one washer and one dryer in the basement (coin operated). The dryer broke in early spring, so I had to drag my laundry and bedding to a local laundromat, which is not an easy task since I have to park my car in a municipal ramp a block and a half away.  I have emailed my landlord four times: 6/9, 6/30, 7/12, and today (7/19). The first response I got was ""...that dryer doesn't belong to us and we have to call the responsible party to pick it up. New dryers should be installed in the near future."" The second response I got was ""we apologize for your inconvenience and will follow up with the vending company as to when the new machines will be installed."" I never got a response from my third email; I just sent the fourth one about 15 minutes ago.  Although the washer and dryer are not explicitly noted in my lease, there is a part that says ""pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 704.07, Landlord shall keep the structure of the building in which the Premises are located and those portions of the building and equipment under Landlord's control in a reasonable state of repair.""  **TL;DR:** Landlord will not replace the lone dryer on site and has only responded to two of my four emails. Help!"	No
2239	I'm trying to enroll my child in kindergarten. I attended pre-reg in April and provided my lease and copy of utilities. All utilities are in my name. On lease my name is listed under occupants, but my step mother is the primary lease holder. (She signed for me 2 years ago when I first got back to the US because of the employment gap.)    Received letter stating that I am required to appear with the primary lease holder in person on a specific date/hours next week for her to sign an affidavit saying I live there. Apparently this is a new county wide requirement put in place specifically to [irrelevant opinion.] She cannot be here for it. She can't leave work and she lives out of state. They said she can't have it signed and notarized not in person. (She has never lived in the apartment and signed online. Basically my guarantor or whatever.)  I called the school board and they said a wordier version of too bad and that she has to come. Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated. I'm assuming I have to miss work and show up alone, but do I have any leg to stand on to get her enrolled?  Don't they have to enroll even homeless kids?	No
2240	This is gonna be a long one, feel free to skip to the TL;DR.  I don't know where to turn with this, so I'm trying here. I'm a woman in my thirties living in Norway with mental health problems. I've been trying to seek help for the past six months with several rejections and I wonder if anyone can tell me if there is something I can do to get help here.  In November 2013 I tried to commit suicide. For 1.5 years after that I received one-on-one therapy sessions where I was diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder. The therapy was concluded in July 2015 because the therapist felt we had gotten as far as we were going to get in my current situation. I was put into group therapy in late October the same year and while I tried my best for 6 weeks I ultimately failed at completing the 'course'.   Since then I was in a work placement program for approximately 1 year. I started struggling with attendance after about 6 months and after several bouts of depression and suicidal tendencies I was committed to a clinic in January 2017 and concluded from the work placement.  I was in the clinic for a total of 10 days. The first therapist I spoke to at the hospital I was at first talked about thinking I would benefit from trauma therapy. It was also mentioned that I could get assistance at home to help me keep things neat and tidy as I find myself unable to keep on top of housework myself. Once I was transferred to a clinic all that was talked about was me returning to work placement. I was concluded there once I was released from the clinic, so that never happened. The psychiatrist at the clinic referred me to an in-house program where you're in the clinic for 6 weeks receiving cognitive treatment, going home in the weekends.  I never received any follow-up calls or check ups from the clinic after being discharged. I was rejected from the in-house treatment because they felt I needed more individual therapy and further progress.  Since I was discharged, my GP/doctor has been helping me send referrals to various psychiatric institutions. I was rejected from the district psychiatric clinic (DPS) in both Indre Østfold and Akershus based on something my former therapist wrote in my file: that I would likely not benefit from further treatment.   Two private psychiatrists have also been attempted but have received either rejection or no response.   Two years have passed since I was in active treatment and my psyche is in a much worse state than it was after 1.5 years of steady treatment. I've gone through painful things and continue to go through painful mental things that I need help to handle. I am desperate for a therapist to talk to, to help set my head straight. At this stage I'm in such a deep depression that I barely can get out of bed. Nothing is enjoyable. I go through the day only so that I can sleep again. Sleep is the only peace I know.   Now, my question is whether there is anything I can do to make that statement either stricken from my record or asked to be disregarded? This one thing seems to keep me from getting the help I seriously need and I'm just really terrified of my future if this continues. Is there ANYTHING I can do to get help based on only my current situation? Is it legally sound to reject my referrals based on a two year old assessment?    TL;DR: I struggle with mental health issues including depression and recurring suicidal thoughts. A former shrink has written in my records that she doesn't think I will benefit from more treatment and now I'm being rejected for treatment everywhere I turn. What can I do?	No
2241	"I live in an area which includes some very nice mobile homes, we've got a few elderly and a few young people with kids.   The landlord for a long time has relied on trying to drive us all apart, they've lied to us dozens of times and actively badmouthed each of us so we wouldn't talk to one another.   In recent years we've discovered that there has been a significant buildup of water under the properties. Our foundations have cracked, and our homes have begun to break apart. The landlord insists this is a ""new"" development, but it's been steadily building up over the last few years. They keep saying it would cost a lot of money to put in a pipe, and that they need to be sure it's not a leak from one of the houses. We found out that the landlord was told by the town many times about the water saturation, and yet they still put new mobile homes on the trouble areas in an attempt at avoiding any installatiion costs.  The landlord only owns the land and foundations, not the mobile homes and there's nothing in the contracts we sign that exonerates them from upkeep of the property and such. There's also a set of power lines owned by eversource which have a 100 year lease agreement with the landlord on the condition that none of the houses are within 10ft of the furthest line, from above that is....my house is right under it.  They also have a series of employees, one who acts as a real estate agent, selling defective or near uninhabitable homes to people without pointing out the many damages. Others who have direct ties to the landlord and act as the scapegoat and hand of said landlord when dirty work needs to be done. They keep insisting that they're working on the problem, and hire completely inept non professionals to work alongside their ""handy man"" who knows nothing and has done damage to our property in the past.   We have evidence, we've got a few people and are building up on more evidence as I type this. Should we go for a lawyer for this case? if so what kind should we look for, most hang up when they hear mobile home neighborhood."	No
2242	First time posting on anything, I apologize if i am doing this wrong.  On July 9th at 9 PM the ceiling of my bathroom in my apartment collapsed after significant water damage from a leaking roof. I was aware of a drip in the bathroom on Friday July 7th and noticed the ceiling drywall was sagging downward a little and notified my building manager of the issue and they told me they would take a look on the following Tuesday. when Sunday the 9th came we had some rain and i saw the paint was splitting apart from the weight of the drywall and insulation coming through and immediately notified the building manager again and she told me she would be there on Monday instead. Unfortunately it did not make it till then and fell through. After it was all done the solution I was given was to move into the apartment downstairs and sign a new lease agreement after they go through the apartment and decide what needs to be taken out of my security deposit minus any bathroom damage and then i would pay the new security deposit as well as an increase in rent. I did not like that solution so i spoke with an attorney and was told that they have to provide me with temporary placement while they fix the bathroom. I relayed that information to my building manager and they did agree to it. It has now been a full week since the ceiling fell through and we have had three storms come through and they did not bother to cover the hole or even fix the roof and water has poured through the hole each time. As of right now the building owners do not fell that i am owed any of my rent back for the month of July and I want to know what are my rights and what can i reasonably expect to get back for the hassle of having to move my stuff to another apartment. I also took pictures of the ceiling before and after it fell through and a video of the water pouring through to the bathroom.  I apologize again if this is an incorrect format and if I left any important information out	No
2243	I live in Wisconsin.  A coworker of mine is at the breaking point. She is a single mom with an 18 yr old son. Their relationship has gotten to the point where he is verbally abusive and extremely aggressive towards her.  She has had to call the police multiple times due to the severity of their arguments and his aggression. At this point, there has been no physical violence.  Most of the arguments stem from him smoking pot in the house and keeping it there. She recently found a freezer bag full of pot which freaked her out because she’s wondering if he’s dealing out of her house.  Again, he is 18 &amp; for eviction discussion, he does not pay any rent. On multiple occasions she has been told by the Police (in front of her son) that he is a legal resident of the house; therefore she cannot kick him out and that if she wants him to leave she will need to take him to court and have him evicted.  She is worried about the time (missing work, only 1 income) and money (court costs) that this will take.  Is there any advice or shortcuts that anyone can offer?	No
2244	Background: I've lived at my apartment for 10+ years now. The original lease agreement signed over a decade ago had me as an occupant, while a relative of mine was the tenant. It was my understanding that it was more of a guarantor type situation as I had no credit at the time. Until now, we have been renewing our lease with no issue.   Problem: However, a few years back another company bought the complex. Now, they want me to sign a new lease completely, but the new lease has the previous tenant as a resident on the lease. If I inform them that the guarantor/tenant is no longer required as I have been the one paying rent on time the past decade, would they be able to increase my rent a ridiculous amount? Are there repercussions to not saying anything about it?	No
2245	"I can't seem to find an attorney to speak to in my area until after they would be needed (which I get,no argument about that). I've been evicted. Tried to fight it myself but was unsuccessful. I was reading up on some things, and I wasn't sure how accurate they are.  Here's my issue(s): 1)Landlord took rent after the 3 day notice.  He only accepted money order and checks, so that's easy to prove because I paid with check. 2)I was never ""red tagged"" or served a notice for the bailiffs that are (I'm being told) going to show up today to ""throw my shit out onto the lawn"" (his words, not mine).  Is there anything I can do? Any help would be appreciated."	No
2246	I'm designing a product which moves a bed out of the way to enhance a small room space.   It uses motors and a controller. Unless the CRAZY happens 4(1500lb) cables breaking it will be safe.   It will not allow anyone to be on the bed when moving and will move slowly as not to injure. It will also stop the motor if there is an obstruction.  I'm unfamiliar with liability law/insurance so I'm wondering how to go about getting this started.   I understand developing an LLC to separate the company liabilty from my personal assets but I don't understand how much coverage I should get when taking costs into account.   Thanks R	No
2247	I'm subletting in NYC. The original lease has the following conditions for landlord entry for inspection for showings to future tenants:  Any time between 9am and 8pm, 7 days of the week.  However, [this website](http://streeteasy.com/guides/renters-guide/can-your-landlord-enter-your-apartment-at-any-time/) claims this is in contradiction with NYC tenant/landlord regulations (I haven't verified by searching legal text): **9am to 5pm only, and Monday to Friday only, except holidays.**  1. Where / how can I verify the regulations?  2. Which trumps which?  3. What should I do?	No
2248	I am paid up with rent through August, I have never been late or broken any part of our agreement. I left for work this morning and locked my door and when I came home the lock was entirely different. All my things are locked inside.   I had been emailing my landlord about some wet spots in my carpet after coming home from a few days away and she said she would send someone in to check but she never got back to me and now this. No phone calls, no note or notice, no email. What is my recourse?	No
2249	After returning from a long weekend trip, I discovered a small patch of mold growing on the wall near my A/C intake vent. After reporting the small patch, maintenance came in, ripped up the carpet corner, sprayed a fungicide, and setup a fan. This fan has been running 24/7 since Wednesday morning.  The place smells like fishy, wet dog. I am unable to reside in the property. They are also unwilling to move me temporarily.   Can I turn in my keys and walk safely?

2250	"Hey there! Throwaway, of course, because little bro reddits and I'm not giving up my real account. (Hi, D!)   I own my own home in small town Virginia and I've got a big problem with a neighbor who is renting the property next door.   A little backstory. We bought this place about a year ago and met the neighbors soon after. One side is a lovely young lady who works in some government capacity and is never home. The best neighbor. The other side, though, is quickly becoming a nightmare. Nightmare lady is home all the time. Her husband is a trucker who is gone for weeks at a time. I've met him a handful of times and he seems...off. I witnessed her lying right in front of him and he just puts on a shit eating grin and nods along. Whatever. So it's her that I'm dealing with. Her and her dog.  When we first met her, she seemed pleasant enough. A little more talkative than I'd be with someone I just met but whatever. (This has now turned into hours-at-a-time instances of listening to her rant about people stealing things out of her yard, conspiracy theories, her self-diagnoses of many different mental illnesses, her Christianity, how she's not afraid of anyone because she has a gun, and her landlord.) Her dog is friendly enough, but it's now constantly coming into our yard as soon as we come outside. The dog is enormous, smells awful, has fleas, and doesn't know to not jump on people. We've talked to her over and over about not letting the dog over.   Things are starting to become more shitty.   She asked us once about taking a bit of wire off of the old fence between the properties for an art project. We said okay, and now there's a huge hole where her dog comes over. Not cool. We've now had fleas brought inside the house and have spent additional $$$ treating our house and our three cats.   Two weeks ago she spent four hours outside our living room windows, grunting and talking to herself. We paid no attention. The next day, she banged on the door and insisted that we come outside because she had something to show us. She'd cleaned out an entire flower bed - weeds and planted stuff - and then said ""I was thinking about planting something there"". That was our flowerbed. It's right up against the house.  I stammered out a ""Uh, thanks, but please don't do that again. We actually have lawn care that comes and takes care of that stuff. And no, we don't want you planting things there."" That same day, she also asked if she could mix up some extra cement she had laying around and cement our mailbox in. I told her ""No...it's a temporary mailbox until I find one that I really like. That's why it's not cemented in."" I've told her this before. This is when she walked me down there and said she'd ""just noticed"" that the mailbox was hanging off of the post and that the door wasn't closing. WTF? We'd gotten the mail that afternoon and it wasn't like that. She has a history of ruining things so that she can fix them in the way that she likes. I don't have proof, of course, but I strongly suspect she did the damage.  A week later, I come home from running errands and she's cleaned out the second flower bed on the same side of the house, and was hacking at/removing the tree roots of one of my trees. She claims she was tripping on it. (She wouldn't trip on it if she stayed out of my yard...). I was aghast! I don't know much about trees, but I'm pretty sure that hacking out the roots causes...death? Again, I said that wasn't asked for and I didn't want them touching that tree. Her husband said something about not touching it, because I'd notice a chainsaw if he was and that the tree was diseased and needed to come down. They've been after me since we moved in to pay for a survey, put up a fence ON the line (as opposed to offset on our side), tear down the row of trees, and they've graciously offered to pay for half of the fence so long as it's a ""ranch style barb wired fence"". Um, no.   This woman has come over in a panic because she swears people are stealing bolts out of her lawn equipment, stalking her from across the street, prancing around in her backyard ""meowing"" at her to ""lure"" her back there. She corners my kids and tells them how she's OCD, NPD, ADD, and ""in general mentally ill"". No shit. Honestly, I think she might be a paranoid schizophrenic.   She's now threatening/suggesting that she'd like to come over and fill in some of the masonry on my house. I've told her emphatically ""NO"" but I don't trust that she won't. I have outside cameras ordered. I have pictures taken of the outside of the house, especially on the side next to hers. I have multiple calls out to surveyors for someone to come ASAP and find my property markers so I can literally mark the boundaries. The town manager is calling me on Monday to let me know if a privacy fence can be put up. I have plans to speak to her landlord first thing on Monday and if she touches anything this weekend, as I fear, I will be calling the town police.   My thoughts so far are to go through both the town police and the landlord. Reporting any trespassing and dog issues to the police, while sending a courtesy letter to the landlord at the same time. My hope is that the landlord gives them 30 days to find someplace else.   Guys, what else can I do? A ""No Trespassing"" sign? Should I speak to her landlord in person, or just mail them a letter as a ""courtesy"" before speaking to the police? Should I mention to the landlord my concerns about her mental health? How can I avoid a legal battle? For those of you here who are landlords, what could I say (truthfully) about this situation that would make you want to end your month-to-month lease with a tenant like this? What should I do about the tree?  Thanks!"	No
2251	Hi, not sure if this is the right sub. So long story less long we have had this builder coming round door to door around our neighbourhood looking for the odd couple of jobs - tree trimming, tiling etc. He's fairly young [23M] so my mother just tasked him with trimming our evergreen's out in the front which needed to be cut as they were at risk of touching the telephone line. He did what you could describe as 'the job' by literally just chopping off the tops of the trees (think Gandalf with a buzz cut), but it did the job so when he came by this month and my mother mentioned we were looking for a new shed and to have the patio tiles evened out. He agreed to do it and quoted us £1300 (£500 for the shed, £250 building materials, £350 for labour and £200 leveling patio) for an 8x8 Overlap Shed and concrete foundation, with £150 to destroy and dispose of the shed (as he reasoned, it would be more expensive to hire a tip). He also took a £750 deposit to buy materials (yes i know -_-).  That leads us to now, I would begin to describe how crap it looks but the gist of it is;  * uneven foundation * the shed floor soaks up water when it rains * cement for foundation is, well, not sure how to describe it. Pebble-y. Like the cement mixer had had corn on the cob for dinner. There are large pebbles across some parts of the surface and none at other parts.  The problem is my mother has none of this in writing, no contract, not even a last name. What's worse is the 8x8 shed my mother asked to be build is actually an 8x6. I looked up the price and it only costs £241, the 8x8 being @380. THE BLOODY THING IS A RECTANGLE FOR GOD SAKES! I am absolutely livid at how my mother has let this happen, this is the sort of crap that you hear about on Watchdog or bs Pro Revenge stories...  My question is basically to any UK builders out there or anyone with knowledge of UK Trading standards, in your field of work, what evidence would I need to tie the guy to this job i.e. a text regarding the agreement of the job, a recording if I would be able to get him back to the property. All I currently have is 4 witnesses of him working on the property, a business card with no last name and possible link to an ad on a local website. It has been a week since the guy last spoke with us, I have not tried contacting him yet, but I would like to get my ducks in a row just in case of the event that he decides to just refuse to come back and run off with the £750. Also a little side note, the £150 for the shed disposal. He still hasn't done that either.  TDLR; Builder did a bad job, no contract linking him to job. Wondering what evidence I would need in case I need to report him.	No
2252	"My roommates are trying to get me to move out because they are all quiet people who feel ""tension"" because my girlfriend comes over once or twice a week and we talk and hangout at normal conversational level. There's no lease, I've lived there for 6 months and been a model roommate otherwise. Disregarding that insanity, I have two questions:  1. Am I allowed to put a lock on my door? I feel like one of them might throw my stuff out while I'm not home.  2. They keep telling me they want their other friend to move into my room and I need to leave because of the ""tension."" One of the roommates gives all our check to the landlord whom I have no contact with. What do I do if they decide to just ignore my check and give the landlord a check from their friend and try to make a case around that?  Thank you!"	No
2253	About a month ago, the apartment next to mine and the one below it were shot at while I was sitting outside. The shots came from another building in my complex. Apparently someone had a couple people over, there was a conflict, and someone started firing at random. The tenants were evicted but I'm still scared for my safety. It's made me afraid to take my dog out at night. I jump every time someone makes a noise outside. I've stayed with friends and family because I don't want to be in the apartment alone.   Is this grounds for breaking my lease early? I can't afford a lawyer and I'd rather not lose my security deposit but I want to move. Please help!	No
2254	I'm currently in a halfway house in West Des Moines, IA and I need to find an apartment or someplace to live soon. I'm having trouble because I have a Felony in my record that's a couple years old. Any advie?	No
2255	I am a college student living in Pittsburgh for the summer.  My lease for the school year starts on August 1st, but I have been here for two months on a short lease, working for the summer.  When I found the place, I signed the lease (the landlord had told the current tenant that he could feel free to find other people to sign the lease to make the cost cheaper if he wanted), and then a week or so later, the landlord contacted me asking for me to fill out a rental application, as well as submit $25 for a background check.  I was confused as to why this was necessary, and asked him why I needed to pay more money if I'd already signed the lease.  He responded a little while later, in an email I didn't even see until just now, telling me this:   &gt;Having a rental application on file is a matter of protocol for anyone living in our apartments, and it is mandatory that i raun [sic] a background and credit check in case you are wanted in any of the fifty states or on some kind of terrorr [sic] watch list or something.  You have signed Manuael's [sic] lease, but as owner I hold the primary lease to the place, and if you have anything in your background untoward or a potential threat, I am obliged to know that.  &gt;As for a complaint about the processing cost, you are summer subletting a semi-furnished place for about $350-400 that this fall will rent for $750, so I would hope you would appreciate that rather than making such a strident complaint about a VERY minor sum.  We do our best to provide quality housing, but at the same time there are rules Ihave [sic] to follow.  The guy is, as you might have been able to tell, a bit of a condescending asshole.  Earlier in the month, we had our ceiling falling apart due to rain, and he couldn't be bothered to care about the fact that plaster was falling down in our living room, and wouldn't get it fixed for the longest time, but that's a whole separate matter entirely.  **Ultimately, my question is:**  Am I under any sort of legal obligation to fill out a rental application and pay for a background check if I have already signed the lease and will be moving out in nine days? $25 is not a lot of money at all, but at this point, with how our landlord has treated us during the past month and a half, I'd really prefer not to pay anything extra if I don't have to.  This was a bit of a long-winded post for such a simple question, but if anyone knows the PA laws about this, I'd appreciate an answer. Thanks!	No
2256	I pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia and reckless driving in 2015 in North Dakota. Misdemeanor A and C respectively.   Today i received  mail from the court judge saying I got deferred imposition of the  sentences and my case has been dismissed, and records sealed.    If an employer asks if I've ever had a conviction should I say no? Do i  need to explain all this in my future interviews?	No
2257	Until recently I worked for a large bank and knew before leaving that I had used up more holidays than I was entitled for the amount of the year so far. I was told it would be deducted from my wages but it wasn't. They've now written to me asking me to repay the £400 I owe. Am I legally obliged to repay it?	No
2258	"I've lived in my apartment complex for 2 years, there's no security deposit. I've kept the place in extremely good condition. I've even been a live in model for the complex.   I'm moving out in two weeks and my property manager dropped off a packet for move out procedures. My manager wants me to repaint the house, get the carpets professionally cleaned, pressure wash the outside, and so on my own dollar.   My place is VERY clean. I completely understand not leaving the place a mess! But to redo the entire place for the next tenants doesn't seem like a job I'm supposed to be doing. We have onsite maintenance teams and they always are outsourcing renovators for other units. I don't recall ever reading this in my lease (I'm going to go through it again though).   They are offering a wildly expensive ""express check out bundle"" where I can pay $500 for them to do it all for me. That is nearly my monthly rent. This doesn't seem like it's my responsibility to be doing. Obviously I was going to clean the place, but to paint and pay a professional to pressure wash?   I feel like my complex is ripping me off because I'm a student and ""don't know better"". Is this a normal procedure for moving out of a rental unit?  **TLDR;** My property manager is making me redo my already nice apartment on my own dollar. Am I being played to do the work they're supposed to be doing?"	No
2259	I'm unsure if there would be any drawbacks of just paying the ticket as I was not given a court date. A lawyer explained that I can plea not guilty, show up to community court, and be able to do community services and it will be cleared from my record. I'm not sure how true it is so I need all the info and advice I can get. I heard it can affect my financial aid too which I'm mostly worried about	No
2260	So I am here asking on the behalf of my Grandmother for some advice. The situation is this, a small property was bought in 2009 by my grandmother in Portland OR while she resided in Washington State, she then sold the property in 2012 to a man in a private sale, with her acting as the mortgage collecting bank. The man recently missed a payment, then immediately after declared Personal Bankruptcy. The collections agencies for his now null and void $500,000 debt are attempting to seize his house and sell it to pay some of the debt off, while my Grandmother wants to foreclose on the property herself so that she can re-sell it as the property's value has increased by about 30% during the last 5 years.   My question is, how would my grandmother go about foreclosing on his house before the collection agency(/or IRS, she isn't sure) does so themselves. It is written into the contract that the sale may be declared null and void if a payment is missed by more than 9 days, it has since been about 20, and about 15 since he filed for bankruptcy.  Thanks for any help, my grandmother is 81 so this is all extremely confusing for her.	No
2261	"I am 30 years old. I have Autism, Gastritis, IBS, Crohn's, UC, have a permanent lower spine injury and need a cane to be mobile.  I also live in Indiana.  I live with my father, because I cannot get a job. My only income is Social Security Disability. I pay a majority of the bills in this house. Electric, TV, Internet, help with groceries, help with chores, i've bailed my father out of financial troubles several times.  He and I are fighting, and he keeps threatening to make us ""part ways,"" or kick me out of the only home I've known on a regular basis and I believe this time he's serious. The man is ex-military and has intimate knowledge of unarmed combat techniques, and therefore i am in a real and present fear of him getting physical with me instead of the verbal abuse i usually get.  This man expects me, a person who can hardly be on his feet for longer than 20 minutes at a time to do ALL the housework and refuses to clean up after himself, even though he has a job, that is no fucking excuse to refuse to help with your own living space.   I have a very sensitive digestive system and have to eat different food than him to prevent flareups of my gastric diseases that can leave me bedridden for a day or more, screaming in agony. That means I also have to buy separate food from him.  I only get $730 a month, and by the time my share of the bills are paid, i hardly have any money for myself.  My cousin recently moved out and left behind his things because he had nowhere to store them, and my father has attempted to sell them off for money. I informed my cousin over the phone about this bullshit, and he went off on him, and now i feel I am at risk for retribution for doing the right thing by telling my cousin of this treachery and attempted thievery.  I've got nobody I can turn to, so I'm asking r/legaladvice for assistance in what I can do to protect myself from a vengeful asshole dad. I need to know what kind of laws are on the books to protect myself with from him and his bullshit. I have nowhere I can go. I have nobody I can go to for help."	No
2262	"http://m.imgur.com/a/IiDrC  About $100 worth of Pokemon cards. The boxes were kicked and scattered all across the ground. There were twelve damage counter dice and two larger dice, and I only have two damage counters left. Both coins I had were also lost. The large stack of unsleeved cards to the right are the disfigured and frayed cards, and the stack to the left are the sleeved cards that survived.  She refuses to reimburse me for the destruction of my property, as I ""left them there"" after she kicked them, because the 911 dispatch told me to separate myself from her, and I should be lucky my mother even bothered to pick them up.  Additionally, I've paid my rent for July and August already. She's agreed to repay the $250 frpm August's rent, but, seeing how July is only half over, I'd like half of the rent from July, if at all possible. What can I do, Reddit?"	No
2263	Family is breaking rental agreement with landlord which dated from Oct 2016 - Oct 2017. They negotiated with landlord and agreed to part with $1000 of the original security deposit ($2400). Family rented the property for $2175/mo but the landlord is advertising property as $2500/mo, much higher than they or any neighbors pay in this area. Family is still responsible for rent until new tenant is found, but the new asking price seems unreasonable and only prolongs the time that my family is responsible for the rent.   Is there any justification for such a drastic increase in rent, or are the landlords trying to milk my family for as much as they can?	No
2264	"We are currently in an apartment through a rental company in Iowa. A few months ago we decided to move to a larger property through the same company, we decided on a new unit and we excited to move. A few weeks go by and we see there was not much progress on the new unit so we went in and asked if our original move ind date was still okay (August 1st). We had already signed a lease for this property to move in on the 1st, but it simply wasn't going to happen.   We then decided on a new unit that was to be done on August 1st, and signed a lease for that. All was good until we went to set up our utilities like a good tenant would, and we couldn't because the water and the electric company had not had any work orders done to install meters.   We then went into our rental office and asked if we were still able to move in on the 1st (at this time it was late July about a week before we were supposed to move). They had not contacted us and told us anything so we assumed we were good to move on August 1st. We went into the office and they stated ""the property will not be done until the 14th"" so here we are now on the 9th expecting to move there on Monday. We went in AGAIN And they stated we do not have it done and we have no idea when it will be done. You can't move until we get it done. Here is where our issue is, we have a new lease signed for the 1st of August and we still do not live there.   The main guy that runs said company basically told me to stop coming in and asking about it and they will tell us when it is done. They have made no efforts to contact us in any way and the only way we get updates is to go in and ask.  NOW.. what is our standing in this situation. We have a contract stating ""The duration of this Rental Agreement shall be for a term beginning at 12:00 pm on the 08/01/2017, and continuing until 6:00 pm on 07/24/2018.""  They have basically told us to screw off and here we are with new furniture ready to be delivered, a u haul reserved, and everything ready to go. Except the house.   What are our options here? We feel as though we are being taken advantage of."	No
