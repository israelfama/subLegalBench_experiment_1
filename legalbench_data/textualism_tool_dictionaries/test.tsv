0	for one thing, the word crime does not necessarily mean a single act or specific incident constituting an offense punishable by law, as the government suggests. depending on how the word is used, crime means such acts collectively, websters new world college dictionary 328 (3d ed. 1997), or criminal activity in general, random house dictionary of the english language 476 (2d unabridged ed. 1987); see also american heritage dictionary of the english language 313 (new college ed. 1978) (defining crime as [u]nlawful activity in general). one might say, for example, that [t]he profits of crime are untaxed, crime, oxford english dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (accessed online) (defining crime as criminal acts collectively), or that efforts to fight crime too often go unrewarded, crime, merriam-webster.com dictionary, https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/crime (last visited april 27, 2021) (defining crime as criminal activity); see also random house dictionary of the english language, supra, at 476 (noting the same usage). in those sentences, the word crime does not mean a specific act or incident punishable by law, but criminal activity in general	Yes
1	to understand damage, we consult both the statutory text and ordinary usage. under the cfaa, any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information qualifies as damage. id. 1030(e)(8). because the statute includes no definition for three key terms impairment, integrity, and availability we look to the ordinary meanings of these words. see united states v. plavcak, 411 f.3d 655, 660-61 (6th cir.2005). impairment means a deterioration or an injurious lessening or weakening. 7 oxford english dictionary 696 (2d ed.1989) [hereinafter oed], the definition of integrity includes an uncorrupted condition, an original perfect state, and soundness. id. at 1066. and availability is the capability of being employed or made use of. 1 oed, supra, at 812. applying these ordinary usages, we conclude that a transmission that weakens a sound computer system or, similarly, one that diminishes a plaintiffs ability to use data or a system causes damage.	Yes
2	returning to the district courts use of the canons of statutory construction, we find its reliance on the canon ejusdem generis to lead to an erroneous interpretation of the statute. according to that canon, where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words. united states v. weadon, 145 f.3d 158, 160 (3d cir.1998). nevertheless, the district courts attempt to render forfeiture a more general term than penalty is strained and unconvincing. the alternative dictionary definitions of forfeiture which the district court cites span varying degrees of generality. although blacks dictionary characterizes forfeiture as a comprehensive term, it also defines it as a divestiture of specific propertylanguage which resembles that dictionarys alternative definitions of penalty in both its broadness and its specificity; penalty is an elastic term with many different shades of meaning but is nevertheless generally confined to pecuniary punishment. blacics law dictionary 650,1133 (6th ed. 1990).

3	the majority then relies on a number of inapposite citations in support of its theory that article 7s lapse of time language is most naturally read to refer only to a fixed statutory limitations period. the difficulty is that, with the exception of yapp v. reno, 26 f.3d 1562 (11th cir. 1994), and a handful of unpublished district court cases from california, none of the multitude of cases, treaties, or texts cited by the majority considers, much less rejects, the possibility that a clause incorporating lapse of time defenses in an extradition treaty may include constitutional speedy trial protections. instead, most of these citations merely point to the use of the term lapse of time in some proximity to the statute of limitations. see, e.g., extradition treaty, u.s.-arg., art. 7, june 10, 1997, t.i.a.s. no. 12,866 (providing, in an article titled lapse of time that [ejxtradition shall not be denied on the ground that the prosecution or the penalty would be barred under the statute of limitations in the requested state.); blacks law dictionary 1321 (10th ed. 2014) (referring to the lapse of time in defining a period of prescription, but in no way equating the two as synonymous); canadian n. ry. co. v. eggen, 252 u.s. 553, 40 s.ct. 402, 64 l.ed. 713 (1920) (interpreting the term lapse of time to incorporate statutes of limitation in a civil maritime context).	Yes
4	based on the record, the district court found persua[sive] evidence that appellant carried a weapon within the meaning of section 924(c)(1). although it could not apply the latest supreme court pronouncement on the meaning of carry, see muscarello v. united states, 524 u.s. 125, 118 s.ct. 1911, 141 l.ed.2d 111 (1998), the district court probably reached the correct conclusion. in muscarello, the supreme court cited blacks law dictionary (6th ed.1990) which defined the phrase carry arms or weapons as: to wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of conflict with another person. id. at 130, 118 s.ct. 1911. thus, appellant most likely carried the pistol in violation of 18 u.s.c. 924(c)(1) by simply bearfing] arms on his person. id.	Yes
5	". the district court found that the acts requirement that the physician certify, ""to the best of his ability, that the patient ""understands the information provided, 7(2)(d), could be read to criminalize any attempt by the physician to disassociate from the disclosure required by the state. the district court appeared to interpret the term ""understands as requiring physicians to bring about the patient's agreement with, rather than understanding of, the information required by the state. this definition of ""understands is foreign to the law of informed consent. for example, if this standard applied to informed consent to receive an experimental medicine that might cause an increased risk of bleeding, a physician would need to certify, to the best of his or her ability, that the patient understands what is meant by the phrase ""increased risk of bleeding. the physician would not, on the other hand, need to certify that the patient actually agrees with the stated risk level something about which patients are entitled to form their own judgments. in short, the goal of the certification appears to be simply to ensure that the patient reads and grasp[s] the meaning of the information provided, rather than to ensure that the patient adopts those views as her own. see merriam-websters collegiate dictionary (11th ed.) (defining ""understand"")."	Yes
6	the cda does not define the term development. accusearch would construe the word narrowly. it relies on two dictionary definitions, correctly noting that develop can mean to [m]ake something new and [c]ome into existence. aplts. am. br. at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted). because the information provided to its customers came originally from the telecommunications carriers, it argues, it made nothing new nor brought anything into existence. but the cda uses the phrase creation or development of information, 47 u.s.c. 230(f)(3), and if the meaning of the word develop were limited to the two senses relied upon by aecusearch, the word development would add nothing not already conveyed by the word creation. under a long-standing canon of statutory interpretation, one should avoid construing a statute so as to render statutory language superfluous. mccloy v. u.s. dept. of agric., 351 f.3d 447, 451 (10th cir.2003); see roommates.com, 521 f.3d at 1168. we therefore examine whether we can reasonably construe development more broadly.	Yes
7	our primary area of concern with the district courts determination is its confident assertion that the language of 326(a) is unambiguous. see lan assocs., 237 b.r. at 56-57. in this day and age when we exchange by a keystroke or series of keystrokes what we used to handle only in cash, we do not think that the term moneys is so clear as the district court indicated. in fact, one of the definitions cited by the district court refers to money as a measure of value, see id. at 55-56 (citing websters third new intl dictionary 1458 (1986)), which surely is a concept that evolves along with and is dependent upon changing cultural, social, and economic practices and institutions. for example, in todays society the term money could easily encompass the concept of credit, which increasing numbers of people use as a method of payment. the term money might also encompass property, especially when property is used as a method of payment or a measure of wealth. see websters ii new college dictionary 707 (defining money as [a] medium that can be exchanged for goods and services and is used as a measure of their values on the market and as [p]roperty and assets considered in terms of monetary value); supra note 5 (describing the nabts argument that an exchange of property involves an exchange of value). but see in re brigantine beach hotel corp., 197 f.2d 296, 299 (3d cir.1952) (referring to precode statute governing receiver compensation and stating that [i]t is clear that the word moneys in the clause ... upon all moneys disbursed or turned over ... is not the equivalent of property.). these reasonable interpretations of the term moneys render it ambiguous for purposes of our interpretation of 326(a). see taylor v. continental group change in control severance pay plan, 933 f.2d 1227, 1232 (3d cir.1991) (a term is ambiguous if it is subject to reasonable alternative interpretations.); accord united states v. gibbens, 25 f.3d 28, 34 (1st cir.1994) (a statute is ambiguous if it reasonably can be read in more than one way.).

9	the quantum of deference due is not negligible: [t]he construction of a statute by those charged with its execution should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong. red lion broadcasting co. v. federal communications commn, 395 u.s. 367, 381, 89 s.ct. 1794, 1802, 23 l.ed.2d 371 (1969). however, the weight accorded to administrative interpretations may vary, as the supreme court has explained:	No
10	the lanham act prohibits the use of any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark where such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. 15 u.s.c. 1114(l)(a). to state a claim under this section, a plaintiff must show a likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question. mushroom makers, inc. v. r.g. barry corp., 580 f.2d 44, 47 (2d cir.1978) (per curiam) (citing cases), cert. denied, 439 u.s. 1116, 99 s.ct. 1022, 59 l.ed.2d 75 (1979). a nonexclusive list of eight factors, articulated by judge friendly in polaroid, supra, 287 f.2d at 495, helps guide this inquiry: (1) the strength of the plaintiffs mark: (2) the degree of similarity between the two marks; (3) the competitive proximity of the products or services; (4) the existence of actual confusion; (5) the likelihood that the plaintiff will bridge the gap between the two markets; (6) the defendants good faith in adopting its mark; (7) the quality of the defendants product; and (8) the sophistication of the purchasers. we agree with both the district courts determination of each of the polaroid factors and its balancing of those factors to arrive at its conclusion that pe gasus petroleum infringed upon mobils senior mark the flying horse.	No
11	finally, without challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, mahender suggests that his conviction for harboring illegal aliens should be vacated because the harboring statute, 8 u.s.c. 1324(a)(1)(a), was not designed to cover a situation in which a defendant forces an alien who wishes to leave the country to remain here. such conduct is outside the scope of the statute, which was only intended to criminalize conduct facilitating an aliens illegal presence in the united states. mahenders br. 64-65. suffice it to say that the text of the statute cannot support such limitations. the statute renders guilty of a crime any person who, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the united states in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation. 8 u.s.c. 1324(a)(1)(a)(iii). the statute does not attempt to distinguish among various reasons why an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the country illegally, nor does it distinguish among various motives a defendant might have for concealing, harboring, or shielding the alien. [section] 1324, on its face, does not restrict the persons within its reach. united states v. kim, 193 f.3d 567, 573 (2d cir.1999). we decline mahenders invitation to read words into the statute that are not there.	No
12	disposable income under section 1325 is to be interpreted broadly in this circuit. in this case, as a factual matter, the debtor had specifically identified that tax refunds should go to the plan and made no argument that the funds were needed for maintenance and support of the debtor or her dependents. the income therefore qualifies as projected disposable income under section 1325. situations may arise where a debtor did not specifically list tax refunds for inclusion in the plan and those situations would need to be examined on a case-by-ease basis to decide whether a tax refund arising from pre-petition income qualified as projected disposable income.	No
13	butchka called murphy on september 4, and they eventually agreed to meet on september 18 at the hyatt regency hotel in cambridge. the meeting was videotaped. butchka confronted murphy with macdonalds reservation that murphy could not do business. murphy attempted to reassure him, saying that i found you bill, they didnt find you ... see youre talking about an organization ... that is operating in a closed enemy environment, all around it. murphy said he no longer wanted macdonald involved, telling him to look at me as your rep.... i can get into them and no one else around here can. butch-ka offered a direct delivery to ireland, and murphy responded that you, i mean, youre too good to be true, bill, essentially. that might be, the, ah, factor that could turn the whole deal. they also discussed the weapons, m-16s and mp-5s. murphy expressed his fear that butchka could be a fucking fed. butchka responded that if you say t dont think anything can be done, i want you to be honest with me. fine. lets just say see you later? ok? butchka agreed to meet with murphy in october, and from then on macdonald left the scenario.

15	plaintiffs, however, seem to take the position that at the time of such layoff under subsection 8.2 means something other than the time in which an employee initially takes layoff status. subsection 8.2 states that, any employee ... who is initially laid off or physically disabled beyond the accumulation limits of 17.2c of the basic agreement and who, at the time of... such layoff... had at least 15 years of continuous service and whose age and continuous service totaled 75 or more years ... is entitled to an immediate pension. (emphasis added.) the plaintiffs apparent position is that at the time of such layoff refers to the time in which the layoff exceeded the accumulation limits under 17.-2(c).	No
16	arguably, guerreros strongest argument is that we should adopt the dissents position in pacheco, 225 f.3d at 155-61. the difficulty with the dissents approach is that it focuses upon the plain meaning of the term aggravated felony, by exploring the ordinary, common sense meaning of each of these words. the statute, however, includes more than these two words: the term aggravated felony means ... 8 u.s.c. 1101(a)(43). the dissent does not address the word means, and instead concentrates on the term aggravated felony, and thus concludes that it is difficult to conceive of how a misdemeanor could be a felony, let alone an aggravated felony. while this approach to the issue is not without a certain logic, it places a heavy emphasis upon the two words -that is, aggravated and felony without discussing the full statute in which these two words appear. consequently, the dissents analysis operates in a type of vacuum, and as a result, does not grapple with either the structure and context of the complete statute or congress intent when it enacted the aggravated felony provision, 8 u.s.c. 1227(a)(2)(a)(iii), and its attendant meaning, 8 u.s.c. 1101(a)(43).

18	state courts, not federal courts, are the final expositors of state law. see, e.g., england v. louisiana medical examiners, 375 u.s. 411, 415, 84 s.ct. 461, 464, 11 l.ed.2d 440 (1964) (federal abstention doctrine recognizes the role of state courts as the final expositors of state law); united gas pipe line co. v. ideal cement co., 369 u.s. 134, 135, 82 s.ct. 676, 677, 7 l.ed.2d 623 (1962) (per curiam) (the interpretation of state law by the court of appeals, in an opinion by its alabama member, was rendered in advance of construction of the [statute] by the courts of the state, which alone, of course, can define its authoritative meaning.).

19	. malice aforethought is a concept that originated with the common law and is used in 18 u.s.c. 1111(a) in its common law sense. see stevenson, supra, 162 u.s. at 320, 16 s.ct. at 841. the statutes terms, since known to and derived from the common law, are referable to it for interpretation. united states v. pardee, 368 f.2d 368, 374 (4 cir.1966). accordingly, we do not confine our consideration of the precedents to decisions of federal courts interpreting the federal statute, but rather consider other sources which may shed light on the issues of this case.

20	the present case, however, is distinguishable from drake. in drake, [t]he aiding and abetting theory was prominent throughout the trial. 762 f.2d at 1456. the indictment included a charge for aiding and abetting. both the prosecutors and defense counsels opening and closing statements referred explicitly to the theory: the prosecutor in fact began his closing argument by reading from the georgia accomplice liability statute and quoting an aiding and abetting case. the trial court charged the jury on that theory, and as we noted, the choice to convict drake of armed robbery and murder solely on the basis of drakes aiding and abetting the crimes committed ... was squarely before the jury. id. moreover, the district court found that the state had in fact proceeded on an aiding and abetting theory. id. n. 8.

21	dutcher urges in the alternate that 871(a)s mens rea of knowingly and willfully requires a defendant to know that her conduct is illegal. there is force to the argument that when a statute uses both terms, it is asking for something more than either term would require on its own. thus, in united states v. bates, 96 f.3d 964, 970 (7th cir. 1996), aff'd on other grounds, 522 u.s. 23, 118 s.ct. 285, 139 l.ed.2d 215 (1997), we read the same phrase in a student loan fraud statute to require proof of a defendants knowledge that her intentional conduct was unlawful. see also united states v. wheeler, 540 f.3d 683, 690 (7th cir. 2008) (expressing sympathy for the argument in dicta).	No
22	we are unable to accept the eeocs conceptual leap. although the eeoc is clearly correct to the extent it asserts that the agreement purports to deny wastak a right he actually had, it has not offered a .convincing rationale as to how that misstatement renders the agreement not understandable. we can find nothing at all inherently incomprehensible about the language of the release, and, indeed, wastak admitted that he generally understood the terms of the release. during a deposition, wastak testified that, a few days after his termination, he was able to calm down and read the relevant documents, and that he understood that he was agreeing not to sue lehigh valley in exchange for thirty-six weeks of salary continuation and outplacement services. further, neither wastak nor the eeoc has pointed to anything in the language, structure, or legislative history of the owbpa that supports the proposition that the releases misstatement of wastaks legal rights on this issue renders the entire waiver unknowing or involuntary under the statute. the eeocs argument would incorporate the provisions of 626(f)(4) into the minimum requirements for a knowing and voluntary waiver listed in 626(f)(1) by way of the sections general mandate that waivers be written in an understandable fashion. absent some compelling justification, we will not read the statute in a way that disturbs its meaning.

23	we look to the text of a statute to determine congressional intent, and look to legislative history only if the text is ambiguous. new rock asset partners, l.p. v. preferred entity advancements, inc., 101 f.3d 1492 (3d cir.1996). where statutory language is plain and unambiguous, the sole function of the court is to enforce it according to its terms. id. at 1498 (quoting united states v. ron pair enters., inc., 489 u.s. 235, 241, 109 s.ct. 1026, 103 l.ed.2d 290 (1989)). plain meaning is therefore conclusive, except in the rare cases [in which] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters. id.

24	the defendants argue, however, that venue could not possibly' lie in the eastern district of virginia, which the claims only passed through. in support of their position, the defendants rely heavily on travis v. united states, 364 u.s. 631, 81 s.ct. 358, 5 l.ed.2d 340 (1961), and reass v. united states, 99 f.2d 752 (4th cir. 1938). the courts in both these cases restricted venue solely to the district in which a false statement was actually submitted to or filed with a governmental agency. travis, 364 u.s. at 635-37, 81 s.ct. at 361-62 (venue restricted to district of columbia in which union official required to file affidavit with nlrb declaring that he was not a communist pursuant to 29 u.s.c. 159(h)); reass, 99 f.2d at 753-55 (venue restricted to east ern district of pennsylvania in which defendant hand delivered false statement for purpose of influencing action of federal home loan bank in violation of 12 u.s.c. 1441(a)). however, the courts have narrowly construed travis to apply only in the context of the unique statutory language dealt with in that case, see, e. g., united states v. natelli, 527 f.2d 311, 326 (2d cir. 1975), and in reass we expressly refused to pass on the question whether the offense would have been cognizable in west virginia, if the defendant had entrusted the application to the mails in wheeling for delivery to the bank in pittsburgh, reass, 99 f.2d at 755.

27	my review of subsequent cases construing california law fails to reveal any case extending morillion to cover rutti situation. in overton v. walt disney co., 136 cal.app.4th 263, 271, 38 cal.rptr.3d 693 (2006), the court held that time spent by an employee on an employer-provided shuttle bus from the employer-provided parking lot to the job site was not compensable because employees were not required to use the parking lot or to take the shuttle. in burnside v. kiewit pacific corp., 491 f.3d 1053 (9th cir.2007), we read morillion as covering employees for time spent traveling from designated meeting points to their job sites and back in company provided vehicles. id. at 1070. there was no suggestion that the employees were entitled to compensation for commuting to the designated meeting points. the decision in ghazaryan v. diva limousine ltd., 169 cal.app.4th 1524, 87 cal. rptr.3d 518 (2008), similarly concerned time spent by limousine drivers between calls, not the time spent commuting from home to their first assignments. furthermore, our reading of morillion is consistent with california labor code 510(b), which provides that [t]ime spent commuting to and from the first place at which an employees presence is required by the employer shall not be considered to be a part of a days work, when the employee commutes in a vehicle that is owned, leased, or subsidized by the employer and is used for the purpose of ridesharing.

29	employers could emasculate the plaintiffs interpretation of the primary activity provision by placing the locker rooms in the work stations, for then there would be no post-primary-activity travel time. there is something amiss with an interpretation that implies that the location of the locker room, rather than the amount of time involved in walking to ones work station, determines ones statutory entitlement to compensation. suppose it is 100 yards from the plant entrance to the locker room and another 100 yards to the work station. on the plaintiffs view, traversing the second 100 yards is compensable, though traversing the first 100 yards is not, but if the locker room were adjacent to the work station none of the workers travel time would be compensable even though the amount of walking theyd be doing would be identical. what sense could that make?

30	additionally, the travelers court noted that because pre-emption claims turn on congressional intent, it is necessary, as with any exercise of statutory construction, to begin with the text of the provision in question, and move on, as need be, to the structure and purpose of the act.... travelers, 514 u.s. at 655, 115 s.ct. 1671. in addressing the clearly expansive text of 1144(a), the court concluded that if the statutes words of limitation i.e., relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course, for really, universally, relations stop nowhere. id.

[f]or the same reasons that infinite relations cannot be the measure of pre-emption, neither can infinite connections. travelers, 514 u.s. at 656, 115 s.ct. 1671. for this reason, the court in travelers decided to add another layer to its erisa preemption analysis, holding that, for purposes of 1144(a), a federal courts evaluation of a state laws relation to an employee benefit plan must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive. id.

35	we pause to note that even if congress sought, through the csra, to regulate the nonuse of interstate channels, it would still be within its constitutional command to do so. the supreme court has often held, in several contexts, that the defendants nonuse of interstate channels alone does not shield him from federal purview under the commerce clause. in heart of atlanta motel, inc. v. united states, 379 u.s. 241, 250, 85 s.ct. 348, 353, 13 l.ed.2d 258 (1964), the court upheld commerce clause jurisdiction over a local motel that failed to engage in interstate commerce when it refused to rent rooms to black guests. the court held that by failing to rent the rooms, the hotel inhibited black travelers from crossing state lines and thus obstructed interstate commerce that otherwise would have occurred. id. at 253, 85 s.ct. at 356. in standard oil co. v. united states, 221 u.s. 1, 68, 31 s.ct. 502, 518, 55 l.ed. 619 (1911), the court upheld the sherman act, 15 u.s.c. 1, 2, as permissible congressional action under the commerce clause. the sherman act prohibits restraints of trade and obstructions of interstate commerce in order to facilitate commerce that otherwise would occur absent the defendants monopolistic behavior. finally, in united states v. green, 350 u.s. 415, 420, 76 s.ct. 522, 525, 100 l.ed. 494 (1956), the court found constitutional the hobbs act, 18 u.s.c. 1951, which punishes interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence [by] ... outlaw[ing] such interference in any way or degree. to accept baileys nonuse argument would mean, as emphasized by the second circuit, that congress would have no power to prohibit a monopoly so complete as to thwart all other interstate commerce in a line of trade[;] or to punish under the hobbs act someone who successfully prevented interstate trade by extortion and murder. sage, 92 f.3d at 105.

37	it is irrelevant because it assumes that a legislative belief, divorced from an enacted text, has legal effect. we must separate two questions: (1) what did congress think the words of 92 meant? (assume for the moment that a collective body can think or intend anything at all.) (2) how did congress expect things to turn out in a world governed by the new statute? the former question concerns the interpretation of the law; legislative intent is relevant in the sense that it shows how the legal community understood these words at the time. the latter question rarely assists the interpretive enterprise, because intent is useful only to the extent it helps illuminate the meaning of the enacted statute. it does not matter what congress intended in the abstract; the question is what it meant by what it enacted.

41	on the other hand, however, the plain language of rule 6(e)(2) does not support that part of jeters contention that this rule somehow forbids punishment of unjustified grand jury disclosures under any other statutory rule. rule 6(e)(2) states: no obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with this rule. the surrounding language clearly supports the view that this limitation refers only to action against the aforementioned class of individuals who owe a formal and on-going obligation of secrecy due to their connection with the grand jury [a] grand juror, an interpreter, a stenographer, an operator of a recording device, a typist who transcribes recorded testimony, an attorney for the government, or any person to whom disclosure is made under paragraph (3)(a)(ii) of this subdivision [i.e., other necessary governmental personnel] [emphasis added]. it is simply illogical to attempt to construe rule 6(e)(2) as mandating that all other classes of individuals can act to destroy the secrecy of grand jury proceedings without criminal sanction.

45	the above analysis is consistent with the indiana supreme courts construction of section 5 of the indiana product liability act in dague. there, the indiana supreme court noted, the clear intention of the legislature in section five was to limit the time within which product liability actions can be brought. 418 n.e.2d at 210. the court also stated, the product liability act expressly applies to all product liability actions sounding in tort, including those based upon the theory of negligence, and the legislature clearly intended that no cause of action would exist on any such product liability theory after ten years. id. at 212. (emphasis in original). indiana has thus adopted an enlightened approach to the law of products liability in limiting a manufacturers prospective liability. in contrast to indianas enlightened approach, other states have refused to enact a similar statute of limitations and thus subject manufacturers to open-ended product liability. such open-ended liability places an unreasonable financial and insurance and non-competitive burden upon manufacturers who may be held liable for injuries caused by products manufactured and sold 40 to 50 years ago despite the constant improvement in design and increasingly hazard-proof nature of each succeeding product model within that 40 to 50 year period.

47	the plan asserts that evidence of a delegation of authority to partners can be found in a 2005 document entitled partllers healthcare system, inc. health and welfare plan document (the partners plan document), which the plan characterizes as a summary plan description (spd). the document, published under partners name, purports to be a wraparound plan document that contains the definitions, participation and administration provisions of the various partners health and welfare plans, which includes the plan at issue here as well as over forty others, and incorporates by reference the various benefit contracts associated with the plan to form a complete plan document. the language supposedly effecting the delegation, located in section ii, article ix of the partners plan document, simply states, partners acts as the plan administrator for erisa purposes of the plans. the partners plan document further provides that, as plan administrator, partners has the discretion to determine all matters relating to eligibility, coverage and benefits under each plan and has the full power to interpret each plan and is responsible for the operation of each plan.

50	in our view, the ordinary meaning of the language used by this statute demonstrates that it requires the offense to be calculated, i.e., committed with the specific intent, to retaliate against government conduct, objectively defined. we reach this conclusion for two reasons. first, and chiefly, the statute expressly specifies that it is government conduct that the offense must be calculated to retaliate against. 18 u.s.c. 2332b(g)(5)(a) (emphasis added). we think the term government conduct, in conjunction with the rest of the statute, is most naturally read to mean conduct by government in the objective sense rather than to mean any kind of conducteven non-government conductthat a defendant believes to be conduct by government. 11 see united states v. black, 773 f.3d 1113, 1115 (10th cir	No
51	appellant in this case is a city of philadelphia police officer who seeks to have this court reverse an order of the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania remanding this case to the state court in which the complaint was originally filed. the appellant, police officer ton-kinson, is a third-party defendant brought into this action through a joinder complaint filed in state court by one of the original defendants below, john palko. because the district court interpreted the removal statutes, 28 u.s.c. 1441, et seq., to prohibit third-party defendants like police officer tonkinson from removing cases to federal court, the district court concluded that the removal was improper under 1441, and remanded the case to state court. because we lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a remand order entered on the basis of any defect, 28 u.s.c. 1447(c) (supp.2002), we will dismiss the appeal.

52	nevertheless, plaintiffs make a number of conclusory arguments about the allegedly arbitrary nature of the committees decision. the gist of these arguments is that the phrase employed by an employer is used in erisa, and has already been conclusively interpreted by the supreme court in dar-den. plaintiffs argue that because darden applied the test for common law employees to that phrase, it was arbitrary and capricious for the committee to interpret the phrase differently. plaintiffs argument misses the mark for a number of reasons. first, there is no requirement that the phrase carry the same meaning under the cragin plan that the supreme court has afforded a similar phrase in the statute. the phrase employed by an employer as used in the plan contains a defined term, and cragin is free to define the terms in its plan however it wishes. those terms or phrases may be given different meanings than those we have ascribed to similar language in the statute. second, plaintiffs misapprehend the significance of a determination that they are employees of cragin. it is not enough to determine that they are common law employees of cragin because cragin need not extend this benefits plan to all employees. as the district court correctly noted, darden construed the term employee for the purposes of determining who has standing to sue under erisa. nothing in erisa, however, compels a plan to use the term employee in the same way it is used in the statute. indeed, because a plan governed by erisa need not include all categories of employees, there is no reason to expect that it would. memorandum opinion and order, january 17, 1996, at p. 9. furthermore, as discussed above, the committee considered whether plaintiffs were common law employees and determined that they were not.

55	nehf, rent-to-own contracts, 52 ohio st. l.j. at 766. while ortiz argues that the boards interpretation is presumptively unreasonable because it does not have the effect of protecting consumers, we find no authority for the proposition that the board must decide every conceivable question, even detailed and technical ones, in favor of expanding the scope of the tila. rather, the board has broad discretion to draw the lines necessary to effectuate the act. we therefore cannot say that the boards adoption of one of two plausible interpretations of the gap in the statute is demonstrably irrational.

56	finally, defendant argues that the statute is ambiguous and that, under those circumstances, the rule of lenity should apply. we disagree. we see nothing ambiguous in the statute; it is clearly aimed at punishing recidivist aliens who reenter this country illegally. defendant would have us rewrite the statute to limit the consideration of aggravated felonies to only those convictions which immediately precede the deportation in question. we reject this approach for two reasons. first, we agree with appellee that this would be an absurd result because a felony-recidivist whose conviction preceding deportation was merely a misdemeanor would escape the enhancement penalties for aggravated felonies merely because of the timing of the conviction. as appellee notes, [cjourts must guard against interpretations that might defeat a statutes purpose as reflected by its text. aplee. br. at 12 (citing united states v. cowan, 116 f.3d 1360, 1362-63 (10th cir.1997)). second, any reworking of this statute is a legislative function, not one for the courts.

67	metropolitan lacks standing to prosecute its cross-appeal, since it is aggrieved neither in its relationship with the parties to this case nor with respect to any other potential future litigant. first, metropolitan is not aggrieved against the hospitals. as this court has stated, the party aggrieved concept must be given a practical rather than hypertechnical meaning. department of defense, office of dependent sch. v. federal labor relations auth., 879 f.2d 1220, 1222 (4th cir.1989) (citing aetna casualty and sur. co. v. cunnin ham, 224 f.2d 478 (5th cir.1955)). in aet-na, aetna was aggrieved in, its relationship with its party opponent even though, by prevailing on one claim, it recovered the full amount of money it sought at trial. the court allowed aetna to appeal on a-second alternative claim that would give aetna greater rights against the opposing party (the partys debts would be dis-chargeable in bankruptcy under the second claim). 224 f.2d at 480-81. in the case at bar, metropolitan argues that the district court should have reached the erisa preemption issue prior to interpreting the virginia statute. because the district court decided only that metropolitan met the requirements of the virginia statute at the time of this suit, this argument runs, the hospitals can potentially bring a similar suit against metropolitan at a later time; had the court correctly reached the erisa question first and decided that erisa did preempt the portion of the statute at issue, then the hospitals would have been precluded from bringing the later suit. metropolitan argues that this possibility of a later suit by the hospitals cannot be discounted, and because of the considerable expenses metropolitan has incurred in defending this case and prosecuting its appeal, it suffices to make metropolitan an aggrieved party able to bring its cross-appeal action.

70	the attorneys have failed to establish that local rule 1.31 conflicts with any federal statute or rule of court. their reliance on 1920 in this respect is misplaced. although that statute sets forth the items that may be taxed in the usual course of litigation, there is no indication that congress, in enacting the legislation, intended to restrict the authority of the courts to fashion by rule remedial and disciplinary devices for a broad range of situations that may confront a district court in the course of litigation. our decision in kiefel v. las vegas hacienda, inc., 404 f.2d 1163, 1170 (7th cir.1968), cert. denied, 395 u.s. 908, 89 s.ct. 1750, 23 l.ed.2d 221 (1969), upon which the attorneys rely, is not to the contrary. in kiefel, this court dealt with the imposition of sanctions under 1927; and it is well established that, under that section of the judicial code, the only costs that may be imposed are those set forth in 1920. excess costs recoverable under 28 u.s.c. 1927 include only those enumerated in 28 u.s.c. 1920. united states v. austin, 749 f.2d 1407, 1409 (9th cir.1984); see also roadway, 447 u.s. at 759-61, 100 s.ct. at 2460-61 define costs under 1927 according to civil rights statute because history suggests that 1920 and 1927 should be read together). however, the instant case does not involve the imposition of costs under 1927 but rather under a local rule promulgated under the independent statutory authority of 2071(a). thus, kiefel and austin, as well as another case cited by the attorneys, united states v. ross, 535 f.2d 346, 350-51 (6th cir.1976), are not helpful to the attorneys.

71	of course, the dissent is correct that [w]hen the supreme court has issued a statutory decision and congress then acts to change the relevant law, it flouts congressional will for a lower court to ignore the new statute and rely reflexively on the result of the old supreme court case. dissenting op. at 12. but this principle has no application here because congress never change[d] the relevant law. as we have shown above, irca neither explicitly nor implicitly amended the nlra. thus, this case is nothing like the examples the dissent cites in which the supreme court interpreted a statute and congress later amended that statute. see id. at 12. in those examples, congress obviously overturned the supreme courts decisions it expressly changed the statutory provision the court had interpreted to achieve the opposite result. by contrast, after the sure-tan court read the plain language of the nlras definition of employee to cover undocumented aliens, congress did not change the nlra to expressly exempt! ] undocumented aliens from its coverage. sure-tan, 467 u.s. at 892, 104 s.ct. 2803. instead, congress changed immigration law, never even hinting it intended to amend the nlra. congresss decision not to amend the nlras definition of employee is all the more striking given that it has previously amended that definition when it disagreed with the supreme courts interpretation of the act. see labor management relations act, 1947, pub.l. no. 80-101, 2(3), 61 stat. 136, 137-38 (amending the nlras definition of employee to exclude independent contractors and supervisors, whom the supreme court had held covered under the original version of the act in nlrb v. hearst publications, inc., 322 u.s. 111, 131-32, 64 s.ct. 851, 88 l.ed. 1170 (1944), and packard motor car co. v. nlrb, 330 u.s. 485, 488-90, 67 s.ct. 789, 91 l.ed. 1040 (1947), respectively); see also kimbrough v. united states, u.s. -, 128 s.ct. 558, 571, 169 l.ed.2d 481 (2007) (drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, for congress has shown that it knows how to [address the question at issue] in express terms.).

72	likewise, the eleventh circuit holds that prepetition bad faith is cause to dismiss a chapter 7 petition. see piazza, 719 f.3d at 1262. in piazza, the court affirmed dismissal of the chapter 7 of a debtor who sought to discharge a debt owed to a single judgment creditor who was gaining traction in an effort to collect via the florida state court system. id. at 1258-59. the debtor had also failed to adjust his lifestyle in order to pay his judgment creditor, but had made payments to certain insider creditors. id. at 1273-74. the eleventh circuit rejected all of the statutory interpretation arguments that krueger raises here and turned aside the idea that 707(a)s for cause standard is limited by more specific code provisions. id. at 1267-68. instead, the court endorsed finding cause under a totality of the circumstances approach, because [b]ad faith does not lend itself to a strict formula but encompasses atypical conduct that falls short of the honest and forthright invocation of the codes protections. id. at 1271 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration omitted).

73	we could imagine saying that bad faith is an ambiguous phrase whose meaning may be illuminated by legislative his- tory, but none of the legislative documents behind 25(b)(4) equates bad faith with negligence. the relevant commidee reports say that bad faith is being used as a limitation to prevent the right of action implied in curran from doing dam- age to the futures exchanges and their regulatory apparatus. see, e.g., h.r. rep. no. 97-565, part 1, at 56 (1982). bosco did not discuss the statutory text, context, or history. instead it drew a negligence standard from decisions under judicially created private rights of action. the job of a court interpreting a statute, however, is to interpret the statute rather than the work of other judgesespecially when the statutory text is designed to displace the judiciarys handiwork. the second circuit, which has jurisdiction over the other principal futures exchanges in this nation, understands bad faith in 25(b)(4) in the traditional way. sam wong & son, inc. v. new york mercantile exchange, 735 f.2d 653, 670 (2d cir. 1984) (friendly, j.), dealt with an exchanges asserted failure to enforce rules against price distortions. the second circuit thoroughly explored the meaning of bad faith under 25(b)(4), concluding that a plainti_ su_ciently pleads a vio- lation if it alleges that self-interest or other ulterior motive unrelated to proper regulatory concerns constitute[s] the sole or the dominant reason for the exchange action. see also ryder energy distribution corp. v. merrill lynch commodities inc., 748 f.2d 774, 780 (2d cir. 1984) (a claim of bad faith must be supported by two allegations: rst, that the exchange acted or failed to act with knowledge; and second, that the exchanges action or inaction was the result of an ulterior mo- tive.) bosco cited sam wong but did not analyze its holding 10 no. 20-1843	No

76	niederstadt argues the missouri supreme courts determination that he used forcible compulsion sufficient to violate the sodomy statute violated his right to due process because, contrary to prior reported decisions, the court ruled that the forcible coercion element is satisfied by the force inherent in a sex offense committed on a sleeping victim, who cannot resist. this ruling was unexpected and indefensible, he argues, because it rendered the forcible coercion element surplusage, eliminated the statutory requirement that the defendant use forcible coercion, and im-permissibly equated sodomy with lesser uncharged sex crimes that did not require proof of forcible coercion. the supreme court of missouri concluded that its interpretation of the sodomy statute did not conflict with the narrow due process restriction of bouie and rogers. the task of a federal habeas court is to determine whether that conclusion was an unreasonable application of ... clearly established federal law, as determined by the supreme court. 28 u.s.c. 2254(d)(1).

79	applying the principles previously stated, we have little difficulty in rejecting as without merit all but the first of the asserted grounds for the nullification of ellards parole. the alabama parole statute nowhere instructs the parole board to consider public opposition in determining whether a particular inmate is entitled to parole. the failure of the board to consider public opposition in this case thus could not constitute a deviation from established parole guidelines. similarly without foundation is the conclusion by the alabama court of criminal appeals that the parole board improperly failed to ensure that ellard would be employed. the alabama parole statute prohibits granting a parole unless a majority of the parole board determines that the parole candidate will be suitably employed ... or will not become a public charge. ala.code 15-22-28(d) (emphasis added). consequently, the parole could be deemed invalid only if incarceration in another state constituted a public charge under the terms of the parole statute. such a construction of the statute, however, effectively would preclude parole into the custody of another state. as previously noted, the alabama supreme court, in assuming that ellard was granted a parole, implicitly rejected such a construction.

82	in zepkin, we adopted a flexible approach to the continuity inquiry not unlike that enunciated by the seventh circuit in morgan. we agreed that the mere fact that the predicate acts alleged can properly be characterized as part of a single ongoing scheme should not automatically prevent them from constituting a pattern. 812 f.2d at 155. on the other hand, we recognized that a single, limited scheme designed to perpetrate a single fraud should not be transformed into a rico violation simply because the frauds commission required several acts of mail or wire fraud; such an interpretation would, we thought, virtually read the pattern requirement out of the statute, for it is the unusual fraud that does not enlist the mails and wires in its service at least twice. id. at 154-55. we did not attempt to identify a range of factors relevant to the continuity inquiry, as had the seventh circuit in morgan. but we did indicate that the inquiry ought to focus on whether the related predicate acts suggested ongoing unlawful activities whose scope and persistence pose a special threat to social well-being. id. at 155.

85	this is the second time jamaal williams has challenged the sentence imposed as a result of his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 u.s.c. 922(g). in his first appeal, united states v. williams (williams i), 627 f.3d 324 (8th cir.2010), williams challenged the district courts determination that his prior 2002 conviction under the nebraska escape statute, neb.rev.stat. 28-912(1), constituted a crime of violence warranting imposition of the u.s.s.g. 2k2.1(a)(3) sentencing enhancement. the nebraska escape statute criminalizes both escape from custody (where a defendant unlawfully removes himself from official detention, neb.rev. stat. 28-912(1)), a crime of violence, see united states v. pearson, 553 f.3d 1183, 1186 (8th cir.2009), and failure to report (where a defendant fails to return to official detention following temporary leave, neb.rev.stat. 28-912(1)), which is not a crime of violence, see chambers v. united states, 555 u.s. 122, 127-28, 129 s.ct. 687, 172 l.ed.2d 484 (2009). in williams i, we vacated williamss sentence and remanded for resentencing because the district court erred in its modified categorical analysis of williamss conviction. 627 f.3d at 329. in particular, the district court erred by relying on the facts from the police report as incorporated into williamss presentence investigation report to see how the particular crime at issue was committed on this occasion, as opposed to determining which part of the statute the defendant violated. id. at 328 (quoting united states v. howell, 531 f.3d 621, 622-23 (8th cir.2008)). we directed the district court to determine, if possible, under which part of the nebraska escape statute williams was convicted based on records that are acceptable under taylor v. united states, 495 u.s. 575, 110 s.ct. 2143, 109 l.ed.2d 607 (1990), and shepard v. united states, 544 u.s. 13, 125 s.ct. 1254, 161 l.ed.2d 205 (2005). id. at 329. at resentencing, the district court reviewed the charging documents and the transcript of williamss 2002 change-of-plea hearing, found that williams was convicted under the unlawful-removal part of the statute, and held that violation of this part of the statute constituted a crime of violence in the ordinary case. the district court, therefore, applied the 2k2.1(a)(3) sentencing enhancement in its guidelines calculation and resentenced williams to 70 months imprisonment. williams again appeals the district courts application of the 2k2.1(a)(3) sentencing enhancement, arguing that his no-contest plea rendered the factual basis for his plea recited by the prosecutor during his change-of-plea hearing unusable for taylor and shepard purposes. we affirm.

86	the bia concluded that section 1182(a)(2)(b) made ramos inadmissible due to his multiple convictions. thus, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 1229b(b). see in re garcia-hernandez, 23 i. & n. dec. 590, 594 (2003). the bia rejected ramoss argument that the reference in section 1229b(b) to all of section 1182(a)(2) was a clerical error. ramos argued that congress intended to refer only to the crimes described in section 1182(a)(2)(a) because those were crimes of moral turpitude or involving controlled substances. in part, that argument is based on another statutory provision that an alien must have good moral character in order to have cancellation of his removal. id. 1229b(b)(l)(b). however, congress has twice amended section 1229b(b)(l)(c) without changing the statutory reference that ramos alleges is erroneous. see 8 u.s.c. 1229b(b)(l)(c) (west supp.2008). relying in part on that apparent acceptance of the provision by congress, the bia interpreted section 1229b(b) to bar the cancellation of the removal of an alien who has been convicted of multiple offenses with an aggregate sentence of five years or more under section 1182(a)(2)(b).

87	the court began its analysis of the preemption question with the following aphorisms (1) the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute expresses congressional intent, (2) unless the statute explicitly and clearly states otherwise, congress does not intend to preempt areas which states traditionally have regulated, (3) federal statutes are not presumed to preempt state laws, and (4) courts should not read limitations into a statute to enlarge the statutes preemptive scope. the opinion then noted that the massachusetts statute appeared to be a law that regulated insurance and therefore would fall squarely within the saving clause. the court proceeded to analyze the statute and its legislative history and found nothing in either supporting a narrowing of the saving clause. the court led itself to conclude that the insurers interpretation of the statute would render the saving clause meaningless.

91	as can be discerned from a reading of the statutory definitions, a burglary conviction in florida has a far broader reach than that captured by taylors generic definition of burglary. indeed, stealing a car or stealing apples from a neighbors backyard would be counted as a burglary under floridas statute. consequently, floridas burglary statute is of the non-generic variety. see united states v. adams, 91 f.3d 114, 115 (11th cir.1996) (describing floridas burglary statute as non-generic for purposes of the armed career criminal enhancement). because pluta was convicted under floridas burglary statute, the district court was permitted to look beyond the mere fact of conviction and consider the charging documents to determine whether plutas convictions were, in essence, for generic burglary.

96	a municipal ordinance may constitute a bill of attainder. see e.g., crain v. city of mountain home, 611 f.2d 726 (8th cir. 1979). nevertheless, the municipal legislation in question was in the form of resolution. the supreme courts definition of a bill of attainder in selective service system specifically states that the first element required to be present is a law. selective service system, 468 u.s. at 846, 104 s.ct. at 3352. florida law explicitly provides that an ordinance, and not a resolution is enforceable as a local law. fla. stat. 166.041(l)(a) (west supp.1985). a resolution is defined as an expression of a governing body concerning matters of administration, an expression of a temporary character, or a provision for the disposition of a particular item of the administrative business of the governing body. fla.stat. 166.041(1)(b) (west supp.1985). legal actions which are required to be accomplished by ordinance may not be accomplished by resolution. carlton v. jones, 158 so. 170, 170 (1934); see brown v. city of st. petersburg, 153 so. 141, 142 (1933). here, the resolution is not a regulation of a general and permanent nature_en-forceable as a local law as it represents little more than the city councils opinion regarding the propriety of appellants activities. fla.stat. 166.041(1)(a) (west supp. 1985).

97	the facts here are undisputed and we face only questions of law. like the bankruptcy appellate panel, we review the bankruptcy courts interpretation of the bankruptcy code de novo. in re farmland indus., inc., 397 f.3d 647, 650 (8th cir .2005).	No
98	"havis objected to the increase. he argued that delivering cocaine does not qualify as a ""controlled substance offense"" and that it was unclear whether his state conviction was for delivery or sale. the district court found this argument unavailing on account of this court's decision in united states v. alexander , which held that any violation of the tennessee statute at issue is a controlled substance offense. 686 f. app'x 326, 327-28 (6th cir. 2017) (per curiam). the district court thus reasoned that it did not matter whether havis was convicted of selling or delivering cocaine since both qualified as a basis to increase his sentence. havis now appeals, and we review the district court's decision de novo. united states v. evans , 699 f.3d 858, 862 (6th cir. 2012)."

99	similar to the generic federal crime, the north carolina breaking and entering offense is committed when a person [1] breaks or enters [2] any building [3] with intent to commit any felony or larceny therein. n.c. gen. stat. 14-54(a). the north carolina statute, however, includes a definition of building to mean any dwelling, dwelling house, uninhabited house, building under construction, building within the curtilage of a dwelling house, and any other structure designed to house or secure within it any activity or property. id. 14-54(c)	No
100	a decision not to depart downward would be in violation of law under 3742(a)(1) if it was based upon constitutionally impermissible considerations or an erroneous interpretation of law, such as a sentencing courts mistaken conclusion that it lacked the statutory authority to depart. see colon, 884 f.2d at 1552-53. it would be an incorrect application under 3742(a)(2) if it was incorrectly calculated or was based on clearly erroneous factual findings concerning offender/offense levels, characteristics or adjustments. id. at 1554 (emphasis added). neither of these exceptions is present herein. consistent with the holdings in colon and solimn, under the circumstances presented herein, we may not review the district courts refusal to depart from the applicable guidelines range.

101	but the borrowers-to-be rationale and the ministers interpretation of brazilian law are not one and the same, and the courts refusal to call one an act of state in no way implies rejection of the other. the ministers private letter ruling has three parts: the bare imperative, the borrowers-to-be rationale, and a broader discussion of the central banks legal situation in various types of financial transactions. the last of these is the likely antecedent for riggs iis reference to an interpretation of brazilian law which makes good sense when one notices that the borrowers-to-be rationale is not an interpretation of law at all. far from rejecting the borrowers-to-be logic, riggs ii in fact repeated that rationale indeed, restated the ministers order in such a way as to incorporate it immediately after disclaiming the ministers interpretation of brazilian law as an act of state: [wjhether or not it can be said that the brazilian minister of finances interpretation of brazilian law qualifies as an act of state ... [t]he minister ... ordered that the central bank must, in substitution of the ... [borrowers-to-be], pay the income tax.... id. (internal quotation marks omitted).	No

103	the supreme court affirmed, although no opinion commanded a majority of the court. in the four justice plurality opinion, justice scalia held that because proceeds, as then defined under section 1956, could fairly be interpreted to mean either profits or receipts, the rule of lenity meant that the tie [went] to the defendants. id. at 514-15, 128 s.ct. 2020. in santos, accepting the governments proffered interpretation that proceeds meant receipts would yield a peculiar result every person who operated an illegal lottery would, by default, simultaneously commit money laundering because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts. id. at 515-16,128 s.ct. 2020. this created a merger problem. id. at 516, 128 s.ct. 2020. the plurality went on to note that this merger problem was not limited to transactions in furtherance of an illegal lottery and noted that [f]or a host of predicate crimes, merger would depend on the manner and timing of payment for the expenses associated with the commission of the crime. id. justice scalia highlighted that [t]he government suggests no explanation for why congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the criminal code to radically increase the sentence for that crime. id. at 517, 128 s.ct. 2020.

104	we also find persuasive a series of new york cases. in essentially identical language to californias uniform act, new yorks version of the act requires new york courts to recognize a foreign-country judgment where the defendant voluntarily appeared in the proceeding, other than for the purpose of protecting property seized or threatened with seizure in the proceeding or of contesting the jurisdiction of the court over the defendant. n.y. c.p.l.r. 5305. the new york cases read the uniform act to foreclose a defendant from contesting a foreign judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction once the defendant has done anything more than it had to do to preserve its jurisdictional objection. cibc mellon trust co. v. moral hotel corp., 100 n.y. 2d 215, 225 (2003) (holding that defendants application to set aside the english judgments and to defend on the merits constitutes a voluntary appearance in the foreign proceeding and waiver of their personal jurisdiction challenge under the uniform act); s.c. chimexim s.a. v. volco enters. ltd., 36 f. supp. 2d 206, 210, 215 (s.d.n.y. 1999) (holding that the defendant waived its personal jurisdiction challenge after appealing a default judgment in romanian court, even though the defendant raised the personal jurisdiction defense in its foreign appeal, because the appeal also presented arguments on the merits); nippon emo-trans co., ltd. v. emo-trans, inc., 744 f. supp. 1215, 1226 (e.d.n.y. 1990) (concluding that the defendant was precluded from challenging the jurisdiction of a japanese 12 in re rejuvi laboratory	No
