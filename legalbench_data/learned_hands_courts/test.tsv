0	"Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18.  - What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?  According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case. - Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?  So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
1	"After a bit of digging I found out my lawyer did not have a license to practice in Texas, only in Kansas also found out some of the money orders that my parents gave him weren't even cashed in yet so I was able to retrieve half of the money they had spent! There were a few others involved in this case out of the many he screwed over as well.   I followed some of the advice some of y'all gave me and am really glad the letters and calls I gave helped out on this case in the end.  Here's what the final letter they sent to me said.  ""This letter is to advise you that Uchechi. N was disbarred by the Kansas Supreme Court on July 7,2017. I am enclosing a copy of the order disbarring Mr.N  The discipline of disbarment imposed by the Court was effective on the date of the Courts order pursuant of Rule 212(g) of the Supreme Court  Thank you for your support and cooperation in this matter.""   Again I can't thank you guys enough for this, couldn't have done it without y'all!"	Yes
2	From what I understand, they go easier on first-time offenders.  Let's say somebody accidentally rear ends another car.  There are no injuries.  A ticket is issued for failing to stop.  The court reduces his offense to impeding traffic, due to his clean driving record.  Four years later, the same driver commits the same offense.  Is he considered a first-time offender, as the points only stay on record for 3 years?	Yes
3	I was charged with a few serious but meritless crimes. I did the whole song and dance for over a year and finally everything has been np and now expunged.    I wanted to know how long does the final(?) step of expungement take? I have copies of the signed Expungement Orders from the judge which have been filed (last week) and sent to the state police.    Different attorneys I spoke to in passing gave me answers ranging from 48 hours to 6 months. Does anyone know when these charges will disappear?	Yes
4	"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	Yes
5	Home state: MA New state: NJ  Hello.  I am trying to divorce my husband. He is emotionally and financially abusive. I have proof that he had an affair with a 16 year old girl while we lived in Boston. I am going on vacation to my family's home in NJ. Would I be able to stay and begin the divorce process from there? I have a daughter so I am prepared for the reality that that may not be possible. I am just asking out of desperation because being here with him is driving me into a deep depression.    Here are the facts:   * Married for 4 years * He is a green card holder/non citizen * I have picture proof of his adultery and abuse in text form * Daughter, age 3, was born in NJ * We lived in Boston for almost 2 years * He doesn't want me to divorce him and has made marriage counseling appointments  * I have 0 support system in Boston * I have no job, he works under the table     I know this is a shot in the dark question, as I feel like I definitely have to return to Boston to divorce because of custody reason. But I am asking anyway. I just wish to get out of here as soon as possible. I am numb right now but want to make the smartest decisions possible before I break down.	Yes
6	10 years ago I traveled to a far away state I didn't live in and was caught with a small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia. Of course the court date for the charge was months after I was caught, and by that time I had already returned to my home state. I was also very poor at the time and could afford neither a lawyer, court fees and fines, or the money it would have cost to travel back to the state. Over the years I had forgotten about it, but now I have remembered and I am wondering what will happen if I hire a lawyer to deal with the charges. Lets say I hire a lawyer and go to court to deal with the charge. When they convict me, how will that conviction look on my record? Will it show up as a conviction in 2017? How will this impact background checks for jobs? I know most checks only look to see convictions that have have occurred in the past 5/7/10/etc years. Will the fact that I waited this long to deal with it make it look like a crime that was recently committed, and hurt my chances to pass background checks? I have had background checks done since I was originally charged with possession, and had the warrant issued against me, but these never showed up on any of the checks.	Yes
7	I need to file a small claims proceedings against a large national chain. The location I dealt with is now closed permanently (part of why I am suing). How do I determine who exactly I file the action against? The main corporate office (national)? A state or regional office if i can find that? How does that work?	Yes
8	I'll keep this vague, to prevent doxxing.   So let's say, my Dad is a local business owner and he's being bullied by a lot of people in my hometown for basically nothing - cutting ~~good~~ the best deals with people the next town over. People are whiney babies but that's besides the point. Now, people get bored of attacking him with false accusations, so they start coming after me with some heavy stuff. Now let's say a local news anchor calls me up and let's me know that they're about to do a story on some pretty bad things that I may or may not have done, and want to see if I would like to comment.   To nip this all in the bud, I dump everything I have to prove them wrong but now it looks like what they were saying was actually maybe not entirely completely false, so I might have maybe kind have proven a little bit of what they were saying true.   Theoretically, if you supply evidence to your own crime, you can essentially plead the 5th and then they can't use that evidence so you're golden right?	Yes
9	i can't seem to find it in the handbook...i find every other form and how it needs to be served  https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/guides/Guide_to_Serving_Documents_EN.html	Yes
10	Last July I was sentenced to two years supervised probation, an alcohol awareness class, and 100 hours of community service. Since then I have completed my hours and class. My probation officer said I am able, after the one year mark, to reappear in front of my judge to have my charges dropped. Although it is not a guarantee that the judge will agree to do so. I do not want to hire an attorney and put myself in (more of) a financial hole based on chance. Any advice or experiences that may help me as I go forward besides dress nice, be polite?  TLDR: Reappearing in court to have probation dropped, need advice on appearing in court by myself in front of judge.	Yes
11	Quick question for everyone here. I just got a speeding ticket via photo enforcement in Washington DC. I was going 16 over so it's a 150 dollar fine.   I have two questions for everyone here.    1) If I go to contest the penalty is there a judge that I speak with or is it a random person behind a desk? I ask this because it looks like the address is just a suite and not a court house.   2) What are the odds that the judge lowers the fine if I've never had a moving violation before? (Been driving for over 6 years) Is it even worth me going in? Or should I just pay it.    I am obviously guilty of speeding. I'm not contesting the ticket itself. I am wondering if the fine can be reduced though.	Yes
12	Abusive husband knows i wont report him to the police because due to reasons CPS gave us two strikes. (first time was during the time after i gave birth, he lied to the doctor and told her tht i didnt feed him- had to be investigated by the CPS; the second time one of my kids told her teacher that she was hit - she was talking about when you slap a kids hit for trying to touch a hot stove- but she didnt understand that scolding =/= abuse) and so we have 2 strikes on our house.   I finally decided to go through with the divorce but my husband wants to keep up with his abuse (he left the house for 2 weeks taking his stuff, now he is threatening to call the police if he isnt let in) He knows fully well that if his domestic abuse is reported or if the police get involved the kids will be investigated and there is a highchance of them being taken away.... i have 6 kids under the age of 16.  Any advice on what to do when he calls the police? how to handle CPS? the divorce process hasnt fully began cause im still waiting on legal aid.... plz any suggestions are appreciated.	Yes
13	"Got in an accident a while back.  Sought legal assistance.  The lawyer I found dropped my case after a month and I felt they wasted my time.  I left them a single negative review online containing hard facts, all of which were true. I can back up any of my claims with evidence from multiple sources.  I settled with the driver on my own and figured it was time to move on.  The lawyer felt otherwise.  Since our ""falling out,"" the lawyer has taken the following actions:  * Called me to threaten legal action against me if I do not take down my factual review * Called my employer to try to convince them to fire me, saying he knows their business partners etc. * Called various family members of mine and made them feel harassed. * Has emailed me countless times threatening multiple lawsuits. * Has emailed me threatening to employ a private investigator for the situation. * Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false. * Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer) * Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident * Is threatening me with lawsuits, again  I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.  what do you think?  1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment? 2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since. 3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?"	Yes
14	A friend of mine is facing a serious felony assault charge, his lawyer told him he may be able to plead down to a lesser assault but it could go to jury where he is risking 2-8 year prison term. He asked the lawyer about if a person leaves the state for the coast since he hasn't been served a warrant. The lawyer said if he did he would never be extradited but would spend 30 days in jail and released basically any time he got a ticket. He also said that once this happens a clock starts and that after seven years there would be a statute of limitations. This doesn't sound correct to me, but if that's true it honestly seems better than risking his life being ruined. Any legal experts here that can verify this? Thanks. He is from Ohio.	Yes
15	He has an attorney. There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her. Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	Yes
16	I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	Yes
17	As the title says, my girlfriend made a huge error in judgement the  other day and tried to  only pay for some of the makeup she had gotten off the shelf. She has a spotless record and is even hoping to  work for a very well known animation company and park. She immediately knew she'd made an awful and idiotic mistake and is completely remorseful. I'm trying my best  to help her through this with as little damage as possible to her employ-ability and record. What steps should I take, should I be out looking for an attorney? Any questions  I should know to ask? Any help is appreciated, thank you all for your time.	Yes
18	"Hello reddit!   So basically my friend needed to find out some regulations regarding a certain immigration topic in Belgium. She sent an email to a  belgian lawyer asking for help and she wrote ""please let me know how much your help would cost"".   After they exchanged 2-3 more emails(the lawyer completely ignored the request for a fee). In the latest email he just wrote saying he'd like 275 euros for the information his given so far.  So my question is can a lawyer ask for payment over this? With no written contract or agreement to pay? My friend is willing to pay but she feels that the lawyer was shady over his fee discussion and does not want to pay 275 but since this is a lawyer she is afraid of maybe some loophole she might be caught in Belgium laws."	Yes
19	Seeking some legal advice as well as wondering what to expect for my case.   Im 23, and I was arrested when I was 18 for possession of a controlled substance (one Xanax, a felony) in the state of Florida. I made bail, and didn't show up for my court date. A year and a half later, I turned myself in and three months later was released on probation. I violated my probation a month later and moved across state lines out of fear of going back to jail. This was almost four years ago, and I feel like it's time to go home and deal with my problem. I was a different person back then, and since I've been gone, I've had zero encounters with police and have been a productive member of society, got married, and became a chef. I'm wondering what to expect..   Is my best option to get a lawyer? What is that gonna cost me? I have some money saved, but only around $1,000. Is that enough? I'm hoping since I've completely turned my life around and it's been four years that a lawyer could get it thrown out, or at least get me off with probation/little to no jail time. I support my wife and myself and she wouldn't be able to make ends meet without me around. What should I do? How effective would a lawyer be in my situation? This is my only legal trouble as an adult, I got in trouble when I was 16 but had it dismissed. Any advice is greatly appreciated.   Thanks!	Yes
20	I was the victim of a discrimination suit several years ago in the US. Due to the organization being so high profile they were able to shut down the case in summary judgement and spread misinformation (the judges admitted that they didn't understand the nuances of the case, and had very strong ties to organization in question).  I don't understand it 100% but I was told that I would be responsible for some legal fees if I lost. They tried to cut a deal with me by asking me not to appeal the case and then they wouldn't charge it but I appealed anyway. From what I understand the fees are capped to bare basics like filing fees etc so I wouldn't be responsible for something like 200k+ but more like 700-800 dollars. This is a drop in the bucket for them but very costly for me.  I understand that I am legally responsible for these fees, however as a direct result of this case and the emotional trauma I suffered at the hands of this organization, I lost that job, became almost unemployable due to Googling my name shows this failed court case, had to move in with family because I was desperate to have somewhere to live, had to flee that situation because of domestic abuse at the hands of my family, and have been homeless since the beginning of the year. For some reason they are deciding to try to contact me regarding those fees now of all times when I am literally homeless.  This has really reopened my trauma and I think it's deeply inappropriate for them to try to do this at this time especially when they had a part in creating this situation. I understand that legally I promised to pay those fees. I wanted to ask a) can I appeal to a judge about my situation or did I already promise all that time ago? and b) can I tell them that I will go public with this story and create negative PR for them if they decide to move forward?  This whole time I went the legal route instead of the press route because I didn't want to be in the spotlight but I wonder if things would have turned out differently because there would have been pressure for them to be held accountable. If they are choosing to really push to get those fees after all this time when I have hit rock bottom I don't see why I shouldn't reveal what they are doing to the press.  Also please be kind with this post and don't put down and disrespect my situation or my trauma. I understand this is just one side of the story but please take it at face value without judging or victim blaming. I have been through a lot with this and I will report and flag comments that are cruel and unhelpful. Please just answer the question as asked, I do understand that I agreed to this, but is there any leverage I can use with the judge or with the organization itself to pressure them to drop it?	Yes
21	In 1996 I was stopped and ticketed for speeding in Oregon and never paid the fine. Last week when I tried to get a License in Washington, I was told that I couldn't because of this 20 year old citation. Does anyone know what the Statute of limitations on a traffic ticket is in the state of Oregon?	Yes
22	"I've been searching google for the answer and am having difficulty finding the answer.  I only found one website that directly addresses this but don't know if it's accurate:  ""The parties’ property settlement agreement, while completely enforceable as a contract, is not filed with the court."" http://www.divorceforgrownups.net/karins-blog/2011/9/13/keeping-your-divorce-information-private  I'm trying to help my mom by getting her divorce property settlement, but I don't know if it was filed with the court.  My mom's divorce took place about 13 years ago.  I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question so I don't waste an entire day going down to the family law courthouse which is far from my home and finding out that the divorce property settlement is not there."	Yes
23	Hi r/legaladvice,  I have a question regarding the enforcement of a judge's ruling, and provincial jurisdictions in Canadian courts for small claims.    So to give some short background info, I want to file a case in Small Claims Court against an ex-girlfriend who I lent a lump sum of money to for a week. It's been years and she refuses to pay me back, so I want to go the legal route to get my money back from her.    The issue is that I live in Ontario (whereas she now lives in Alberta) and would like to file the case here, in an Ontario court. The incident also happened in Ontario, so the courts here will accept the case. The problem is that if a judge rules in my favour and she must pay me back, they can't enforce the ruling in Alberta where she lives now, because it's out of their jurisdiction.    So the person I spoke to for information in the Ontario Small Claims Court said I should find out if Alberta courts will enforce rulings made by Ontario courts? I did a lot of online research and couldn't find an answer, so would anyone here know if they would?	Yes
24	Hi all, got arrested for possession of marijuana under 50g. I requested discovery including the dash cam footage, (what they sent me isnt even video from my arrest, it's of some other traffic stop that isn't me) and of course lab results. I am hoping that the lab results will take a long time to come back and eventually the court will be pressed to dismiss the case.  It is actually a significant prejudice to me having to take off of work for the morning only court and drive 1.5 hours away to this courthouse.  In addition to all this, I also received a ticket in the mail for possession of CDS in a vehicle, signed 34 days after the initial arrest. It is my understanding that there is a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic violations , therefore I am submitting a motion to dismiss that ticket.   I am representing myself pro se, and would like to know basically how long is reasonable enough to wait for lab results before I ask for dismissal, and is there in fact a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic tickets?   Thank you all in advanced!	Yes
25	"I am in the process of gathering information to find an attorney to bring this up with, and I can't figure out what type of firm this fall under.  I am located in Oklahoma, the company I have an issue with is located in Pittsburg, PA, and has servers located in Costa Rica.  The developer in question I believe is also located in the new england area.  The issue involves an online game that has a MLM type incentive structure, you get returns based on the people under you. It also has a vibrant economy that has real world implications as to results of some games/minigames which are promised to be ""fair"" and ""random"".   Issue 1: The lead developer changed the incentive structure and cut the earnings from downstream in half.  He justified this as saying it prevents people trying to steal downstreams by profit sharing, as now he ""automatically"" gives the profit sharing back to the downstream. Even though some people did not profit share and so realized a very real 50% or more cut in income.  Issue 2: Over the past few years the developer has made many statements of things he would ""never do/wont happen"" that were then used to make economic choices, but then he does them a few months/a year later to the economic detriment of those who took actions based on his statements. Given that the lead developer and employees have not changed in this time period, it's felt he's still liable for the contradiction.  Issue 3: The lead developer has made several statements about the fairness/programming of some of the minigames in this game, that are either provably false, or probabilisticaly unlikely to be true, that has similar economic damage. While randomness is hard to prove/disprove, deviations can be shown on results in-game vs an out of game programmed simulation with the same ""rules"".  So my questions are:   1. What type of firm should i be looking for?  Civil litigation? Fraud?    2. What jurisdiction am I looking at/will i need to get a national/out of state firm or is it not an entire waste of time to check in-state consultations first?  Sorry if this just seems so basic, I just don't want to be wasting peoples time barking up the wrong tree. Thank you for the help!"	Yes
26	Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
27	Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	Yes
28	My friend was/is on probation for a DWI. He had a month left and he got violated because he tested positive for alcohol twice in a row.  He is currently in county jail and they haven't given him a court date yet. He's been there almost a week. My question is how long can they make him stay and can they sentence him with a full prison sentence even if he paid his restitution and has been on probation for 5 1/2 years.   We reside in New York State.	Yes
29	Went to a court hearing, where it was vital that the doctor send the medical records to prove my case, but the clinic sends a blank disc to the court.  I was give the blank disc from the court that day.  I was told in court that because the disc was blank with no records on it that I was going to lose my case in court that day. I was to recover no reward for my case.  So the doctor or the clinic messed me out of thousands.  No justice for me at that time.  Well I haven't given up hope that I will fix this.	Yes
30	In early May, I got a speeding ticket in Magnolia, Texas. According to the ticket, I'm entitled to the evidence against me. I also could not make my assigned court date due to work conflicts. I sent the Municipal court a letter requesting evidence and a court date conflict. Never heard back. Court says letter never arrived, and now my ticket is in 'default' cause I didn't showed up for my date.      I sent a second letter, certified, via USPS. Tracking number says it made it the Magnolia post office, but after being 'out for delivery' for ten days, the post office opens an investigation. They tell me that because of the huge volume of mail going to the court, not all of it gets scanned.  A clerk at the court cannot locate the letter. They tell me to get a DVD of my ticketing incident, I have to submit a written claim in order for them to send me the form to request the evidence. They cannot accept the request over the phone.       I call a lawyer for help at the end of June. He tells me I may have a warrant out for my arrest now, and that my fines may have gone up. Offers to call the court on my behalf to see what's going on, and to see if they'll accept a fax instead. Is unable to get a hold of them for three days. Oh, and he keeps forgetting to call me back.  I've given up on him.      I sent a third letter via UPS earlier in July, which *was* filed as delivered. I've been calling the Court three-four times a day for four days now, and I cannot get anyone on the phone to confirm they actually have it.       It's now been two months since my ticket. I'm going insane, and I don't know what to do. I haven't received any mail from the Court. I feel the ticket was predatory, and I don't want to spend $250 for allegedly going 51 miles per hour from a stopped position in less than one mile of travel time. I don't live in Texas, which makes my options limited.      Can I file a complaint against the court? Because this is a fairly rural area, ticket lawyers are really hard to find.	Yes
31	So 4 of us are trying to rent a house together. 1 applicant was living with his relatives when they were evicted, his siblings were counted as unknown tennants while it was counted that he was  evicted twice, the renter said we just need it signed by a judge that he's not liable. We have no idea what's required to start the process, do we need to set up a court date? Or contact the renter? Or is it just something you can go up before a judge and knock it out? How long would the process take?	Yes
32	"I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.    My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?  What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?"	Yes
33	First I'd like to say how much I hate Atlanta police department and their court.   July 7th got a ticket coming straight off the highway onto a 35mph zone in Atlanta Georgia. It's a speed trap, they had so many ppl pulled over using a lidar gun. It's not fair that we get no time to slow down coming off a ramp, but whatever. I get the ticket and it's only 10days away from court date. Is that even legal? They say even on their website it can take up to 2 weeks (10 business days) to process. That would be passed my court date.   I called the municipal court. This lady insisted I was reading the wrong date. I'm not. Even the cop was like 'call if 10days is too soon'. Uh yeah. So I check every day to see if it's processed. I asked the lady what do I do and she just responds with 'uuh, I guess you're just gonna have to wait til it's processed'   I have a feeling it still won't be processed by the court date. I wanted to sign up for the Pre-Trial Intervention to maybe get the ticket dismissed or lowered, but even that you have to sign up before court. I cant even request to postpone court date without it being processed! I can't even pay it if I wanted to avoid court.  What can or should I do? I'd like this to be dismissed.	Yes
34	How can I be treated as if I'm on probation, have to report every 2 weeks, and take random drug tests, If I haven't even been convicted of a crime or sentenced probation?  Also does an adac assessment count as a drug test? My probation officer said in court under oath that I received and failed a drug test, when in fact I've never received one and could have passed one at any point. When I asked him about it he said that since I said I had smoked weed in my adac assessment it's the same thing. I call bullshit. If he commited perjury by saying I failed a drug test, I'd really need/like to know.	Yes
35	Hi /r/legaladvice, throwaway here.  I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options. On my separation agreement, they extended my exercise period from 90 days to 2 years, which made me not buy the shares and wait for an exit or something like that. Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.  Around 10 months after the separation agreement, my options were cancelled, and the CEO said this was because the extension wasn't allowed under the stock option agreement. A few lawyers went through the agreements and said this was BS. Despite this, she (the CEO) tried to make a monetary agreement for a fraction of what the shares are worth for me to give them up.  I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.  Should I try emailing the directors explaining my story, or go straight to a lawyer and send a letter of demand?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
36	I've been on probation for the last three years. I got caught with a fair amount of weed a couple years ago and got put on 2 years deferred adjudication. I violated once last year, but got re-instated with one year added. Today I saw my probation which he said would be the last time. So my question is will I go before my judge before I'm off or what exactly happens now. My official off date is August 22.	Yes
37	"I own a property in New Orleans that has 4 units near Bourbon Street. I had issues with two tenants who would rented two units. They would rent one unit out on AirBnB, and then stay in the other unit. This was not an issue until damage occurred and the City of NOLA started fines for unlicensed AirBnB rentals similar to Denver.  After removing the tenants, the city received an ""anonymous"" tip that my units were being rented on AirBnB. During the hearing, the lawyer that represented these previous tenants happened to be at court, and mentioned that he heard the owner (myself) planned on renting the units via AirBnB directly.  I ended up getting fined $3500. I never said this, nor did I ever intent to rent via AirBnB. I obviously plan on appealing, but I did manage to find a previous AirBnB listing for my property that was removed here: http://airbnb.com/rooms/12874458  I'm honestly wanting a little justice, and was curious what you all might recommend.  Their attorney obviously sticks out for malpractice, but if I can get this listing info from AirBnB, then I can show the previous tenants were renting the apartment and not me. I just emailed AirBnB to try and get this basic info like the listing, description, who rented it, and the reviews.  I'm not sure what else they would disclose without law enforcement etc.  Any advice what to do?"	Yes
38	So we sub leased a room and the landlord was only aware that one of us was living there (my gf and i so 2) everyone moved out over the weekend without notice. We were gonna take over the lease then we got kicked out too. And the landlord Said she was given $800 (what we were told our deposit was) from the sub leaser but not told it was for our room.    How should I go about taking it to small claims court when I don't know where he moved to? We signed papers when we first moved in (don't have copies, stupid I know) and the paper said it would be refunded. Also I have a picture of our rent+deposit (cash) in an envelope with our names and date. We have texts from him saying to sign the contracts when we first moved. We just don't have the Craigslist ad that said $800 deposit otherwise we have it all in our favor.   What should we do next?	Yes
39	"Hi guys, sorry if this takes a while to read. I thank you for your patience.  To make a long story short: two months ago, someone messaged me asking for help with an investment fund. He said that he had spend 13 years working on an software trading program that accurately predicts the foreign exchange market. I realized that he was woefully unprepared to run or manage a fund and consulted him on how to set up a fund. He likely was not going to pay me but that's fine, I wanted him to succeed as accomplish his goals. I later realized that it was very unlikely he had programmed an worthwhile arbitrage code, as he claimed to have, because he showed a lack of understanding for basic macroeconomic concepts. Furthermore, his trading policies involve SEC violations and using boiler room tactics for obtaining funding. Additionally, he nonchalantly expressed that he could choose however much to give back to investors, whenever--indicating a ponzi scheme like distribution. When I expressed my disagreements, he commanded me to get back in line and told me to get him ""operating capital"" for his fund. He had also mentioned knowing cartel members (with implied threat), and saying that he wanted to work with them, thus signaling a money laundering scheme. I requested that he stop what he was doing and told him that I will not be providing him with operating capital. He then told me that he had recorded all of our conversations and will release all my information public (where I work, live, etc.). He will then call my workplace and pretend to be a client being harass by me, as well as actively seek out my clients and harass them. The gist of his intent is that it'd be easier for me to bribe him to stop, then to file all the legal proceedings to sue him. Furthermore, he is seeking out attorneys to assist him in harassing me as well as file a lawsuit for having called what he was doing a ponzi scheme.  --- My question is this: Assuming that he finds a corrupt attorney willing to assist him, do I have the grounds to sue this attorney for morality clause violations?"	Yes
40	Allegheny and beaver courts, PA. So I've finished my dui suspension length and have satisfied all my requirements, aside from paying off all my court fines. Under act 122 the court will not release my completion of treatment to the DMV until I have paid all court cost/restitution. I went back to school shortly after my duis (3 almost 4 years ago). Since then I haven't been in any trouble legally but I haven't been working because of school. So my license would be very helpful with travel requirements for work/internship. I've made regular payments over this time, but they aren't enough to cover all of my costs. Is there a way to petition for certification of my completion to be transferred to the DMV from courts, without paying all of my fines?? Thanks for any advice!	Yes
41	I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	Yes
42	* There were (2) periods of time where he was unresponsive * One instance was being unresponsive for (4) weeks where I was asking for an update multiple times via email/phone * The second time was when I was asking for a financial statement for the services, he took (3) weeks to respond.  After he sent the statement, I terminated his counsel and then he made another statement and used up the retainer. * Are these complaints worthy of getting the bar involved?	Yes
43	"A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.  State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.  The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.  Now this is where it gets really shady. Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.  So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!"	Yes
44	So I am wanted for a pretty serious crime, like probably the first or second biggest one. There is a international warrant for my arrest. I want to look at my options with a lawyer and see what the best way to approach this is. Say I meet up with one, and tell him my situation, can he tell the police.. Lets say I dont pick him, can he call the police and say hes in this state.. etc.	Yes
45	"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
46	I am in Oregon, sister in trouble is in WA. Her public defender is terrible. Our family is kind of shitty, and I have no money for an attorney. She has been waiting for trial for a very complicated case for 2 years. Her court-appointed attorney has ignored all of the resources and advocate options as well as contact info for expert witnesses I have provided. He has condescended to me, yelled at me over the phone. I told him that I will only communicate with him via email.  He has been often rude and aggressive toward her, then seems to have compassion on their next visit. He has told me to send the information and contact info of the people I have spoken to, they have tried to contact him, and no response. I wrote to him and told him she felt bullied and disregarded. He seemed to be on her side for about a month, then back to the roller coaster approach.  She said she has written a letter to the judge and told me it had been ignored. I have so few details, her self-worth is shattered, she has lost her fight. She told her psych doctor she wanted a new attorney and she was condescending and dismissive.  I have contacted another public defender in WA because I think she can switch easily if someone else is willing to step in? That person did not contact me back, and I don’t want to continue barking up the wrong tree. I also am afraid that the next one might be worse.  What might my best strategy be? We have contacted all of the legal aid resources we could find, and have gotten very minimal response.  I really appreciate all of the great info here. Thanks for your time	Yes
47	This happened a year ago, but right after it happened, I moved from New Jersey to Michigan, and next week I will be living in Ontario. I recently got a subpoena in the mail to appear for the case. It's not against me, it's state VS the guy, but I'm just going to be there as a witness. I will be 8 months pregnant during the time of the court date and I won't be able to travel, especially since I don't think I will be able to travel to the States while my citizenship paperwork is being processed in Canada. I've tried contacting the detective a few times but haven't heard anything back yet, my next step is to call the court house even though the subpoena specifically says to just contact the detective. Is there any way they can try to force me to go considering my circumstances?	Yes
48	So I hired a lawyer last year to help me with my child support case. Back story, I was a SAHM for three years and also a full time student. Ex and I decided to mutually split and split our times with the kids as well. After the separation, ex was acting childish and stupid so I started getting my evidence together to take him to court to get primary custody of the kids and child support as well. Of course, I had to get state support since I was not working after the separation and they referred me to their 'go to lawyer'. I contacted said lawyer and her paralegal. They assured me it would be an easy case and to send everything their way.   Long story short, I didn't get primary custody, but shared.  50/50 was what the judge ordered. Even though I had multiple proof of him not being fit to have the children for 50% of the time. Anyways, after the judge ruled the shared custody, we were supposed to go over child support. Here where I'm at, the child support services will not talk to me since I'm being represented by my attorney. They will only speak to her and will only accept documents from her. I've tried calling, emailing and even stopping by the office but they've cut me out cold.   What can I do? Our contract is different because I was referred to her by the state. I paid a one time fee and she said it would cover ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Even if I needed her a few years down the line, as long as it was about my case with my ex. I feel like she's trying not to help me since she's technically losing out on money.  Any advice?	Yes
49	Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	Yes
50	Is there any ways I can fight this in court? They didnt find any actual pot but the pipe itself was dirty. Does that actually count as possession of marijuana in virginia? And if I Wasnt distributing the bowl to anyone and only had it for personal use, what would the correct charge and penalty be? Having trouble finding this information online.  I was given Asap and a 500$ fine but if theres any way I can get this reverted to a different charge and a lesser fine that would be really helpful.	Yes
51	Sorry for being vague, but who knows who is on Reddit? I have a longstanding case against someone who fled the state and has been avoiding service for all legal matters. I have reason to believe they are back and I have a possible address for them. Going up and knocking on the door isn't an option. What is a good way to verify that this person lives where I suspect they do so that I can serve them?	Yes
52	Dear Reddit,  I really need your help!  A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.  Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.  I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.  How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?  How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?  And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?  Tbh, I've been really scared of this day. I've been trying to avoid even talking about it but the 2-year limit is ending. I really do need you guys' advices.  Sincerely,	Yes
53	How do I get proper legal advice on this? do I approach a tax attorney or an accountant? I used TurboTax to file taxes for the past two years.  Is getting proper legal advice going to be more expensive (or close) to paying this debt directly?  If I can get advice on this directly that would be great, but I am almost more afraid and need advice on getting the proper legal advice itself.	Yes
54	After three years my finance and I are finally able to afford and have a home together in Canada. (I'm American) We are getting married in November. We initially met with the lawyer at the end of June. The consultation seemed to go well but I have serious concerns about his retainer.   The email he sent me took a week. Is this typical? Within the email there are serious grammar and spelling issues and the retainer has my name spelt wrong. It's also 3500$ CAD not including he actual processing fees. This is only payable by cash or money order. Is this normal?  The reason why we wanted to get a lawyer is because I was denied entry to the border in 2015 for insufficient evidence to return to the states. I was going to stay for two months, didn't say my exact day of return, was in my car with my fiancé, and had my dog with me. I have been to Canada at least 4 times since then with no issues.  I also was previously married and sponsored someone to become and American permanent resident. They have been a permanent resident since 2015.  We divorced in 2015. The lawyer said this shouldn't be an issue at all. Is this true?   Thank you for the help. I live in Colorado if you need that info as well.	Yes
55	"So in just over 24 hours I have a ""hearing to determine dependency"" with children and youth. The paperwork I received says that ""the child is without proper care or control"" and that she will be placed in ""kinship foster care"". What do those things mean? Also, I was told that once the issue involved is no longer an issue, she will be able to go right back to me. Does it work like that, or will there need to be another hearing? I applied for and was given a public defender, that I have so far not been able to get in contact with."	Yes
56	Texas - I am representing my self in a small claims lawsuit brought by a former landlord who is suing me for damages in excess of my security deposit. I also have a counter claim against him for failing to act in a timely manner (No contact for close to 90 days after vacating the property). Last week I was notified that he has requested a Jury Trial which means our next court appearance will be a pre-trial hearing. The landlord does have an attorney representing him in court but for the amount we are being sued for, I'd likely spend more on an attorney if I went that route than I'd avoid paying if I lose the lawsuit, so I am sticking to representing myself. What should I expect to happen and what can I do to be prepared?  Thanks in advance for all of your help.	Yes
57	I recently got a bike citation for failing to stop at a stop sign while riding my bike. The fine is $257 &amp; after reading up on some other posts on reddit about other citations and fine amounts, I find this a bit excessive??? I do not have the money to pay at the moment. I requested a 30 day extension, but what are my options? Is it possible to get the fine reduced? Do I have to show up to court?	Yes
58	I filed a petition in Small Claims in Nueces County Texas that went unanswered.  I am now told I need to file for a default judgement.  Can someone explain how to do this?  I am not in Texas so this is something I will need to send in.  Thanks,	Yes
59	The title says it all. If someone could PM me with help deciphering this thing that would mean the world to me. I really don't want to go to court. I just turned 18 and it'd be really nice to get this out of the way over the weekend, so I don't need to take off work.  Thanks, P03	Yes
60	My husband has decided to leave me. Even though I don't want or agree with a divorce I have to accept that it is happening. We don't have kids, house, etc. Very little in the way of assets and we mostly agree on how to split everything.  We have decided that an uncontested divorce is best. My husband thinks that we can share a lawyer but I wasn't sure. I have extensively googled and not gotten a definitive answer. Any idea?	Yes
61	Hello all, I received a PI in the Travis county area in Texas and have yet to even go to court for the misdemeanor. I have no blemishes on my record and wish to expunge the misdemeanor ASAP. However I have no idea how to go about it or what to even say when I walk in the court room in a few days. All advice is welcome, thank you!	Yes
62	I purchased a website about 6 months ago, however the website was not as described, and does not have the capabilities that were promised (such as a fully functional shopping cart with integrated payment processing). I've tried to work with the original owner to get these items done, but she is very slow to respond and always has excuses about her health, her child's health, and how she is traveling.   I'm in Northern California. The woman that I bought the website from lives in San Diego, but the LLC that she does business through is in Pennsylvania.  Can I file small claims court in my local court, or would I have to go all the way to San Diego or Pennsylvania?  Thanks for your help.	Yes
63	Hello!   My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force.   Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	Yes
64	So recently I got a DUI and the lawyer was able to get me an agreement on a suspended imposition. This is only in a couple of states, South Dakota and Missouri I believe. Well my question is, will I still be found guilty under the courts judgement or convicted?	Yes
65	New York here. Ill just state the whole situation, so on July 3rd, officer caught me &amp; friend urinating behind a car by the beach (no bathrooms nearby). We talk to him at the car and asks us for our ID, I stupidly give him my fake ID name as i am under  the legal drinking age. He starts to type in info and i realize how stupid that was so i give him my real info. Officer cuffs me &amp; pats me down (was never read rights?) and driven back to station . I was charged with PL 245.01 (exposure of a person), was told likely an ACD for ~6mo.  Just a few questions, is it recommended to get a lawyer for this or is it something i could handle? i only ask because in my position a lawyer would be hard to afford. Am i entitled to a court appointed defender/lawyer or anything of the sorts? also if the only charge was the exposure of a person is a judge able to see anything reguarding the fake ID.  Any help is appreciated &amp; sorry for the wall of text guys, just bugging out seeing as my court date is the 17th and trying to figure out what the next move is.	Yes
66	In the courthouses i have been to you are not allowed to bring cell phones into the court room. You can give them to cop at the front door and he will put it in an evidence envelope and five it to the valid to five to the judge.   My question is how do I present the evidence to the judge for her to listen to it? Do I just just cue up the video and play it on the phone?  Do I transfer it to a differnt device? Do I bring speakers to make it louder?	Yes
67	"Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos.   He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
68	"Hi guys, any help would really be appreciated. I'm going to be sentenced to 29 days in jail for carrying a loaded firearm in a public place. It is a deal offered by the DA for dropping two other infractions that happened at the same time with fines up to $3000. Here are some mitigating circumstances that may or may not help me.  -I'm a teacher and a very productive member of society -I have no criminal record, no priors -I was far away from anyone else, camping, when I was detained -I have 11 very-well written letters of reference  Here's the situation, my lawyer has determined the case to be unfightable (and I got a second opinion from a second attorney too, money going down the drain -__-) been trying to convince the DA to reduce my sentence with letters of reference, to no avail. Only positive thing is the the firearm will be returned to me, obviously I'm not a threat. So why the strict jailtime? The 29 days is pretty much set according to my lawyer; he also mentioned I can make a statement in court, but strongly advises against it because the judge may overrule not in my favor and request the firearms to continue to be withheld. Is there really nothing I can say during court to sway the judge?? Please help!!! The ""statement"" is literally the last thing I can do to avoid jailtime, I'm scared :( Anybody have any experience talking to the judge in court? Anybody know how much influence the judge has in deciding proper sentences? My lawyer told me that the strict jailtime punishment is meant to be something along the lines of ""setting an example"" for these crimes- which I feel is pretty cruel. I feel like going to jail will make me really bitter and turn me into a delinquent..."	Yes
69	I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended license, and completely spaced the court date. I'm fairly certain that means I will now have a bench warrant for failure to appear, in addition to having to take care of my original charge.   I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker.   I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next? I take care of a parent and kid so it would be really bad to go to jail. (Otherwise I'd just bit the bullet and go for a short period.)   TL;DR: What's the best bet for getting my warrant cleared, without spending time in jail, and can I do it on my own? How likely (approximately) is it that I'll get arrested if I go in on my own?	Yes
70	My brother got into some trouble with the law in Dec. 2015 and he got arrested. My cousin and I went to bail him out everything went well, we paid them as agreed. I thought it was all over then but now they're saying that my brother skipped court one day in Apr. 2016 &amp; which forfeited the bond and cost them $450.  They want $668.99. $450 demand amount, $55 filing fee, $14 service fee &amp; $149.99 attorney fee.  Is there anything I can do? I have until 7/31 to respond.	Yes
71	I'm 15 and got caught stealing at Walmart I know I'm really dumb so don't bother commenting saying I'm dumb i know I am for this but in all honesty I need to know What my options are here . I stole under $30 worth of merchandise (2 iPhone chargers) and they caught me and took me to a room and officers came and wrote me a ticket or whatever . I gave them my first and last name as well as the first initial to my middle name but keep in mind this happened in Texas and I live in Florida. I gave the officers my old house address which is a rental house and they said I have until august 7th to go to court and pay a fine or they will put out a warrant for my arrest. So the question is should I tell my parents or just leave it alone and don't worry about them trying to find me back in Florida ? since they don't have my real address. Will they be able to put a warrant for my arrest in Only Texas since this all happened in Texas or Florida too ? or would they still be able to find me? can I pay this over the phone without showing up to court since I leave Texas tomorrow ?	Yes
72	Dunno what's really pertinent here but I have a record in two states living in a third. I'm a pretty stable schizo with two jobs and a BA. I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb. I received ~$200 pair of tickets for operating w/o insurance and driving on a suspended registration. I paid the tickets well ahead of deadline but came home to find info staying that a bench warrant was put out on me but apparently according to the clerk's website I'm good. So what's the deal with this type of situation. I'm not even clear on if these are simple tickets misdemeanors or whatever (WI).	Yes
73	"So I pled ""no contest"" to a shoplifting charge I received after a night out drinking with buddies 3 hours away. I appeared in magistrate court and the judge cut the fine to $1 not including court cost, which I paid on the spot, but also had to pay $50 in resitutions to Sheetz. I wasn't given any information on how to do that when I was at the courthouse and haven't received any mail about it. What do I do? The magistrate judge said it wouldn't be difficult to get the charge expunged and wanted me to follow through with it quickly since I'm a medical student and this can affect my residency. How do I pay the restitutions? And is it necessary to have them paid by the time I file for expungement?"	Yes
74	Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	Yes
75	"Hey everyone!  I'm a Canadian, wanting to attend a professional degree program in the US. I have some questions about US Education Law and would like to find a lawyer, but I'm currently in Canada where I'm assuming most Education Lawyers will be experts in law that is specific to Canada. Is it possible to ""meet"" with a lawyer remotely and where would be a good starting place to find such a lawyer?  Thank you."	Yes
76	"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."	Yes
77	Minnesota: Feel free to delete this if it's not allowed. Obviously this isn't a question, but I think it's information that could be helpful.  After years of butting heads back and forth with someone, we got to a point where a restraining order was put into place. We have emails back and forth for almost a decade fighting- never any physical threats, just verbal assaults. Eventually, I filed a police report against this person. In retaliation, this person filed a restraining order against me.  I got a lawyer and we had our day in court. For anyone who is in this position I want to give the most broad synopsis of what happened, and what I firmly believe will likely happen with your case. The judge doesn't listen to any reason as to why you have contacted the person who requested the order. None of that matters when you are in a position where someone is claiming any level of harassment. In my case, if I had filed first the judge would have granted the order for me against the other person. The fact that you have responded to someone else's initial actions doesn't matter, only what the judge sees as harassment against the original filer. It's safe to say the judge probably realizes there are actions on both sides and doesn't need to waste time listening to it all if they can see any sort of harassment one way.  To make it even more simple, it's like this: Person A punches person B. Person B punches person A. Person A files a restraining order. The likelihood of that order being granted is high. Both people don't get along and one restraining order will keep these people from contacting each other and in the eye of the law it doesn't matter who files because a restraint order is universal. The court doesn't care what it looks like as far as who filed against who. Only the fact that there is any proof of animosity that is patterned and has potential to escalate.  The fact that you were antagonized or provoked into hitting Person A doesn't matter in a court of law- the judge won't hear it. It *only* comes down to who is filing the restraining order and what the defendant did.   I hope this saves someone a thousand dollars in legal fees- I wish someone had told me this, it would have saved me quite a lot of grief in the last few months. If you have a different opinion I would love to hear it, because it certainly seemed like my case would be universal to how all of these issues are handled by a judge.	Yes
78	Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
79	I'm a minor in Virginia and a few months back I got caught with a guy I met off of Grindr who I was trying to buy meth from. At Juvenile and Domestics court, I was told he took the plea deal and everything was done and if they needed me, they would call me back. I just got a different subpoena today for circuit court. Between the time I thought everything was over with and the subpoena for circuit court I have traded pictures with other guys and hooked up with other guys as well.  I currently don't have any charges on me and was considered a victim in the case. Is it possible for them to place charges on me for hooking up with other guys without telling them my age?	Yes
80	I have no idea where to begin looking for a labor attorney in San Diego, CA.   Do I look online in Yelp? How do I go about finding one?  The situation involves a company, specifically her direct supervisor, acting very unprofessional towards my girlfriend. On top of that they penalized her for the government arranging to go to a mandatory meeting for her green card.   She wanted to go to HR but other supervisors have stated it will compromise her career and discouraged it. In that case I think it's necessary for her to see an attorney before she goes to HR, or sees what the labor attorney has to say having heard the full details.	Yes
81	I have a spouse who's an ALT(English teacher), and we're moving to Japan in the near future. I have a 16yo criminal conviction (non-drug related) that I'm in the midst of expunging, and I've been granted a dependent Visa.  Is it worth waiting for the expungement to go through before I fly, or is it safe to assume that the age and circumstances of my situation would make it a nonissue?	Yes
82	Hi all, I am not directly involved, the guy was an ex from 15 years ago who went to jail for a terrible thing against his now ex wife, got out on a technicality, initiated contact with me and over a 6 month period threatened repeatedly to harm her family. I was asked to submit the proof by a mutual friend to police and I did. Ex wife got restraining order and seeking a harassment charge. He did 3 months in jail waiting on trial, and was released last week as trial date was pushed back into next month. His sentencing guidelines for the new charge are 1-3 months of jail time, credit time served. Confirmed with prosecutor's office, that there will be no jail time and they can offer me NO protection order, nothing. Basically they just want me to testify so they can slap him with a felony that will prohibit his job search and he can put blame on me.   I have a baby, no time off work, no reliable transportation to cross a mountain pass to GET to this trial 4 hours away... this is all so irritating. Should I be getting a lawyer to try to get out of this? CAN I get out of this? They have no ability to skype, legal assistant says they want witnesses present to jury can read body language.... I feel like Im being used here for nothing and they cant protect me and I just need some advice man. Can I get out of this?	Yes
83	I received a Petty Misdemeanor about 5 years ago in New Mexico for shoplifting under $30. At the time I was homeless and hitchhiking through Albuquerque on my way back to Florida. I was never arrested but they took my information, banned me from going to any Kmart's, and gave me a court date. I talked to a public defender and she told me if I never plan on coming back to New Mexico that I should just leave. So I did. I ignored the court date and headed back to Florida without a second thought.  It's been 5 years, I have my shit together and I'm living in Colorado now. I haven't heard anything from the state of New Mexico since I left and forgot about the whole deal until I applied for Lyft a couple months back and was declined because of that charge from New Mexico. How should I go about dealing with this? I now regret just leaving like I did and feel like I probably made it worse. Does this mean I also have a warrant out for skipping a court date? The way the public defender talked about it made me think it was no big deal but obviously you can't just ignore stuff like this. Any guidance is appreciated.	Yes
84	My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.  My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?  Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.   I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!	Yes
85	I just got caught going 108 in a 75 on a deserted highway in Colorado; just under the 40mph cutoff. I read that it carries a six point penalty on the license, which is fine, but being unfamiliar with the law in Colorado I was wondering if anyone knew what I could expect at my court date in Burlington; or if there is any way I can avoid traveling back to appear (I'm from the east coast). Are they typically lenient with out of state drivers? Is there anything specific I should say to the judge? Where I'm from the court will virtually always plea it down to something else. Is that how it works out here as well? Do I face jail time? I have some money, but not a lot, and the plane fare both ways is going to kill me this year.	Yes
86	I'm currently in a volatile relationship that is toxic and destructive to me. However, I've just started a new job and I'm undergoing training that is rarely offered, so I can't miss a day of work. I need a restraining order against my former significant other. If I fill out the paperwork and give them to a friend that is free during the court's normal hours can they submit the paperwork for me?	Yes
87	This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	Yes
88	I have been assisting a family member (the respondent) with a separtation. I have all correspondence and pleadings to date. Some letters and emails are between the respondent and the applicant's lawyer. Some are between the respondent (or myself) and the respondent's lawyer. Legally, can I make these letters, emails, and forms public online? The application, answer, reply, affidavits, and financial statements are part of a continuing record that is already a public record, is it not? And I have the respondent's (since all of this information was mailed or emailed to him or myself) permission to do so. We are hoping to change lawyers. Until we find a lawyer who is a better fit, I thought that by sharing all of this information online, anyone who has the time can read the information and offer advise. I thought there may be legal professionals who are retired, or suffer from insomnia :), who may be interested in helping. That is my reason for wanting to make this information public.	Yes
89	"I received a summons for divorce and it has a part that states "" for an order awarding plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and cost of suit."" What does that mean and what does statutory amount of Child Support mean? Any help would be great."	Yes
90	I'm a 21 y/o male from SD just for reference. So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through. Anything at all will help thanks.  (Also sorry for formatting and grammar issues I'm on mobile)	Yes
91	I'll preface this by saying I've been ticketed for this before, went to court, did a day's community service, wiped my hands of it. So recently I was at a park drinking, some officers came around and ticketed me. Especially since I only thought it was a ticketable offense, mixed with the fact that it was dark out, me and my friends were not yelling or playing music, I stuck around after the cops left. Not even a half hour later some new cops came around and arrested me, telling me I shoulda listened the first time around. Now I'm facing a real court date.   Will they probably just give me a ticket in court or am I facing a real problem here? I had no other charges in the system when I left (I double checked). Should I get a lawyer? This is my first arrest ever so I have no idea how to handle this.	Yes
92	[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6lw36b/bicyclist_runs_stop_sign_hits_my_bike_breaks_her/) for some context.   If a lawyer sends me something in the mail but I never received it, can they keep going forward with some process without my knowledge?	Yes
93	[TL;DR I have an assumed bench warrant out for my arrest because I failed to show up for an out of state court summons. I was offered a chance to pay a fine after I emailed the Colorado DA but couldn't afford it at the time. Now that I'm wanting to go back to Co, I need to figure out if I even have a bench warrant or anything to pay]  I'm from California and have (had?) a bench warrant out for an unfortunate event that I was ticketed for in Breckenridge, Colorado. I got the the ticket about six years ago and have never taken care of it because I thought I would never be going back to Co.. that is, until a month ago. I was just curious if bench warrants expire after a certain amount of time? I'd like to get this taken care but was curious to know if there'd be anything to even take care of any more. I googled whether or not b.w's expire and I read that after 180 days they fall off, is this true? IF they don't, I'd like to take care of it and was wondering what the best way to do that would be.   For the backstory: A close friend and I were snowboarding and were riding down a groomed trail when we (stupidly) got the urge to ride down an unmarked section. There was a big gap in the boundary line so we veered off and started down some back country. It wasn't anything insane, just a densely packed forested area with some pretty heavy powder. We ended up going a long way down and basically got stuck as there were no trails or roads at the bottom and going all the way back up in heavy boots was impossible because of how deep the snow was. Finally got a hold of ski patrol who managed to find us from a service road which was literally about 100 feet away.. just couldn't see it from our vantage point (face palm of the century). Shouldn't have happened to begin with though and I certainly learned my lesson.  Ski patrol and police were obviously not very enthused with our decision and we were promptly issued with a summons for a court date set for a few months later. I ended up sending an email to the DA asking if there was anything that could be done so that I didn't have to go all the way back to Colorado and he basically extended an opportunity to just pay a fine (somewhere around $400 I believe). However, I was young and didn't have that kind of money at the time and after a while, just decided to not pay it as I chalked it up to not ever having to go back to Colorado again. Now that I actually want to, I'm worried that I could get arrested on the off-chance I get my id checked. Regardless, I'd like to handle things now that I can afford to pay the fine (if that would still even be an option).  Apologies about the novel, just wanted to be clear. Format might also be messed up because of mobile	Yes
94	I have a petty misdemeanor for shoplifting in New Mexico from 4 years ago. I left the state without dealing with it and now I'm living in Colorado. I finally have my shit together and I want to resolve this but have no idea what I'm doing. I looked into it and obviously I have a warrant for not appearing in court. I talked to a criminal lawyer in Albuquerque and he would charge 1000 to represent me and would first file a motion to quash the warrant.   So I'm wondering if this would be my best option or is there some way I can deal with this myself without having to get an attorney? Maybe a public defender? I'd like to not have this on my record but I'm mainly worried about this warrant. I'm currently trying to find an apartment in Colorado and I feel like this is definitely going to cause problems when I start applying. As it is I don't have very much money so paying an attorney 1000 on top of whatever other costs I'll have is going to be hard. Should I call the Albuquerque court house and try to deal with this myself or will that just make things worse? Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.	Yes
95	I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother.   Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.  I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge.   Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three? Im just wondering if this is worth doing or if I am going to be doing the same thing wether i manage to get the weed charge off or not.  All input is appreciated, Thanks	Yes
96	I have no contract with my subletter, and I allowed his girlfriend stay with us for a month for an extra 200 dollars. A month later, and he is now telling me he's not paying me anything extra, but she is still going to live in his room &amp; use the communal facilities and storage spaces  against my will.   What can I legally do to get her to leave? My first thought is to call the police on her for trespassing, but she now has a key to the apartment.   He's also refusing to pay last month's rent and wants me to use the security deposit instead, which is a problem because he built a bike rack on the ceiling and is refusing to take it down before he leaves. Would it be illegal eviction if I change the locks?	No
97	"Hey all,   We are getting married at a small town protestant church and asked one of the elders of the congregation to officiate.  He says it's his first wedding, and mine too. My question is are we good to go with him just being an elder, or does he need to get some kind of license?   Texas law says ""(3) a person who is an officer of a religious organization and who is authorized by the organization to conduct a marriage ceremony"" which is somewhat vague but sounds good enough to me.  Just covering my bases"	No
98	Greetings!  I reside in the state of Illinois, and I'm wondering if getting married in Mexico will automatically hold a legal authority in the US? I cannot find any info about this online (though I'm bad at research). Do countries instantly exchange marital information about a citizen/resident? Or will it only hold its legal value and thus show up on my american record if I notarize and apostille the certificate in the US.  Big thank you in advance.	No
99	I was informed a week before my move in day that there has been a delay in the construction at the apartment complex I signed a lease with. This is especially frustrating considering how frequently I called them to ask if they were on schedule. I contacted them a week before the notification and they told me they were on schedule. Am I supposed to believe they really didn't know until a week out that there would be a delay of over a month?  I read on one article I have the right to terminate my lease within 72 hours of the notification, but I haven't seen this anywhere else. Can I do this? I've spoken to the apartment people and they said I could only get out of it if I found a replacement.   They are offering two options: A) Waive my august rent and put me in a hotel in September but still pay rent or B) Waive my first two months rent and move in after.  It would be perfect if I could terminate because I just got a job 45 mins away and would like to move there anyway.  There is also an addendum to my lease that discusses possible delays. It is a very confusing addendum to me. Ive tried getting a consultation with a lawyer to no avail. I found out about this on Thursday afternoon. I have very little time to figure this out.  Any advice would help. Thanks	No
100	My friend moved to Canada to be with this girl, and has been married to her for 2 years and 2 months. Now, she's saying she wants a divorce. Starting next week, he's going to be visiting friends and family for 3 weeks. Is leaving on a trip a bad idea for him right now? If not, are there any precautions he should take before he leaves? And can she do anything to have him deported now that they've been married for over 2 years?  The only assets they have is their condo, which is paid off. It's their registered marital home and is in both their names.	No
101	Bear with me here, this is a long and complicated story. My girlfriend has been trying to sell her house for over a year, which she purchased with her ex husband a few years ago. We are under contract for the third time, having had two previous buyers back out of the contract. After signing the third contract, the two of us agreed that if it didn't work out, we would take the house off of the market and move back in. The house has been vacant during this time, and we've been renting an apartment since going under contract the first time. This has put a significant financial strain on us.  The contract we signed with this buyer in June was contingent on her qualifying for low-income grant and having her mortgage application submitted by mid July. We also offered to let her rent the house starting August 1st if her financing was approved. However, as that date came and went, she was twice declined for financing and did not qualify for the grant. On August 1st, we contacted our lawyer and asked him to begin the process of terminating the contract. He never received a letter of declination from those two attempts, so he contacted the buyer's attorney for a copy of them to proceed.  Jump forward to Friday evening (3 days after instructing our lawyer to terminate the contract) we receive a letter from our realtor (who is representing both parties) that the buyer was approved for financing. However she would need to extend the closing date from August 18 until late October. Furthermore, she still wants to rent the house in the interim.  This has become problematic for us, as we have given our landlord notice that we would be moving out, and my girlfriend's son needs to be enrolled in kindergarten (house is in a different district than our apartment). I think we could request another month from our landlord, but we really don't want to be in limbo as this situation is legally resolved. We are also no longer comfortable entering a landlord/tenant relationship with this person. It seems certain that this buyer would sue us for breaking the contract if it was not done properly, so we want to make sure our bases are covered.  I've read through the contract and didn't find any language on reasonable time allowed for obtaining financing, but the contract amendment states that the grant should be determined by July 12. We will be getting in touch with our attorney tomorrow, but have a very small window for either renting another month or moving back to the house and getting her son registered for school. Given that the original closing date will not be met, are we under any obligation to extend?	No
102	I live in Oregon. I have the opportunity to buy a property with cash. My Dad wants to live on it and build a home, which he happily wants me to own. No strings attached, no contract.  My question is regarding my security. If there is no contract between us, and he finds himself in debt, could a debt collector come after me? For example if he spends a lot of money on building a home, then files bankruptcy, can the house on my property become involved in his litigation?  Alternatively, if I wrote a contract with him, how could I protect myself from his potential debts?  It goes without saying, I know a lawyer will be able to answer these questions in more detail. Thanks for any advice!	No
103	This takes place in WA state.  Also, this is just pure curiosity, I am just wondering who is at fault.    [Also here is a picture so you can tell what it looks like ](http://imgur.com/a/2WtYL) The blue shapes are the sprinklers that are on and what they are hitting.  On Saturday afternoon my husband and I stopped by the temporary leasing office to get a package on our way to the store. The actual leasing office is being renovated so they are using their show apartment for now.   Some backstory: we've only lived here about 2 months. When we were moving in, the sprinklers were going crazy by our apartment. I ran into the maintenance guy who told me they were trying to grow grass and so they were more or less flooding the grass. He said once it grows it'll calm down. Ok, fine. Except the sprinklers go off like 6-7 a day, not always at the same time.  We have been in the 100°s for a few weeks now so the grass really isn't growing.    We parked on the street outside the leasing office, and the sprinklers were on. The pavement is also uneven so there are always big puddles. I ran into the office to avoid the sprinklers best I could. Got the package, then got outside. Zoomed (that weird run walk) past the sprinklers and started on the grass, instantly slipping and   Falling down hard. My spine cracked like I'd never heard before. I was terrified something was broken (I watch too many med shows) so my husband called 911 and an ambulance came and took me to the hospital. I got X-rays and luckily it's just soft tissue bruising. But I am in lots of pain, taking heavy duty pain killers, and I did miss school due to it.   So my question is, is the apartment at fault at all? Or am I dumb for not walking 30-40 feet to the street via pathway then back to the car? Also it is possible I slipped on the weird berries that fall from the trees and not the wet grass. And... the lady from the leasing office told me shes always afraid of falling too.  Could we possibly get them to pay any medical bills? Or at least stop watering all damn day? Thanks!	No
104	"So, I have a scenario. There is a year long lease signed. In this lease is the classic ""This Lease Contract will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives at least 60 days (not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days) written notice of termination or intent to move-out as required by paragraph 35."" clause.   The lease then states rent goes up to 150% when the auto-renewal kicks in for the month-to-month lease.  If a tenant moves out on the lease end date, but never gives notice to anyone, is the maximum the tenant is liable for two months @ 150%? Surely the contract cannot continue in perpetuity, but anything more than 2 months rent @ 150% seems incorrect to me."	No
105	"I currently live in Arizona and I am moving out of my first apartment with roommates (I have lived alone before so I'm use to move-in/move-out rental procedure). I have never had damages left to an apartment or had anything sent to collections so this is freaking me out.   Some of my roommates have been less than careful and there is some damage that I'm worried won't be covered by our non refundable deposit.   When I inquired about protocol for damages at the leasing office at the time of turning in keys they replied:  &gt; the damages will be sent to collections, we don't handle any of that.  In my head that screamed **red flag.** As a responsible renter I don't want something my roommates have done to follow my history without at least giving us some time to settle the charges.   They will be sending us our last water bill so I don't understand this procedure for damages. Is it normal for damages to be sent to collections immediately without charging us? How could that affect my rental history?   They also did not do a final walk through with us, which I'm trying to call and schedule with them.   **As I'm writing this post they called a roommate letting them know that they had 20 minutes to be there or be square for the final walk-through. I was able to call them back, received a lot of BS that ""I didn't request it at my 60-days notice"" and it wasn't until I mentioned knowing the move out procedure and my rental right that my request that it be scheduled tomorrow at their convenience and mine was granted.****  Thanks for any help and if this is the wrong sub I will delete and repost elsewhere."

106	"Ok so I have been dealing with this for a week now, and things have gone nowhere. I took my car to get it air wrapped by a gentleman who had advertised on Facebook. I picked the color, dropped off the car, and waited to see how awesome my new look would be. Things started going wrong when he sent a picture and I noticed a slight discoloration. He didn't say anything about it, so I said something, and sure enough, he messed up. So thugs aren't great because we had agreed to pick up the car that Tuesday and now it is taking longer. So I pick out the new color (since he said the original was too hard) and he got to work. Well so I thought. He didn't change out the masking, and ended up ordering the wrong color without telling me (he later told me when I asked that he had tried it and it didn't work, then told me the truth that they just didn't have it in stock). So I didn't say anything other than asking why it was different. So I go to pick it up and I first see some errors. Nothing big, and stuff he said he could fix. He was in a rush, so I paid him contingent on him fixing it. Well when I get home and have a good hour to look at it, I start noticing how poorly it was done. He also had bent trim pieces, damaged the interior door handle, and got overspray all throughout the car. I approached him and asked him to explain. He said it was normal so I asked several installers who were out of state. I have over 4 people telling me it was not done right. He said he messed up on the phone, but couldn't give a refund. So I offered a payment plan. Well now he says he spoke with a lawyer and the lawyer said since the paper didn't say it was a contract it technically isn't one. I'll attach some pictures, but I'm curious if I have a case with this or if I should cut my losses.   Forgot to add, he also removed the first covering with a large ring on (posted a video after I got the car). And I'm worried I'll find scratches underneath. Would he be liable since it was negligent to have a ring so close to car paint? Thanks!'   Edit: added pictures with picture of ""paper"" I signed.   Edit two. Didn't post the cropped picture. Will reupload"	No
107	"My grandmother owns a house in California. She is in a memory care center with late stage Alzheimer's. I have POA on all her medical, financial and legal affairs and the house is in a trust that only I control.       &amp;nbsp;  My father has been allowed to live in the house for many years. He's a disabled senior who is undergoing treatment for cancer.        &amp;nbsp;  My brother was incarcerated about a year ago for a variety of criminal charges including weapons, possession and theft. His previous residence was raided multiple times and he squatted in the house for many months after being evicted. He was dealing drugs there.       &amp;nbsp;  He was released from jail a few days ago. He currently has no place to live.  Many of my family members have been harassing me and trying to convince me to allow my brother to move into my grandma's house. My father does not want him there but feels pressured and obligated to help my little brother so he's reluctant to give a firm 'no'.     &amp;nbsp;  I realize that my safest bet to protect the house is to file a restraining order. But that would involve seeing my family in court and a trip to SoCal which I try to avoid at all costs since it reminds me of the fact that I had to grow up around these people.   &amp;nbsp;  *Other relevant info- My mother is an abusive narcissist who despises that I ever have something that she can't use or destroy and even though I've told her that my grandma gave me legal control of the house, she said that what happens there is 'none of my business'. My brothers have broken valuable objects of mine when they've been angry at me for not letting them use that house. They keep dropping by the house to ask my father for a foot in the door like, ""Well can he just stay for the weekend?"" I've had to fly into SoCal on several other occasions over the past few years to sort out problems arising from my chemically-dependent brothers and their sometimes violent friends.   &amp;nbsp;  TL;DR - Can my brother establish residency in a house because my father is living there and allows him to stay? If so, how can I prevent it since I'm not physically in the location? My father is a legal tenant but I control the house.    &amp;nbsp;      Any help would be much appreciated!"	No
108	This is a bit of an unusual one. I will try and make it simple points.  There are 3 of us each with our own room. We all signed jointly.  One roommate failed to tell the others that he has stopped receiving income. He kept paying late until the point he couldn't pay anymore and is now waiting on disability money from the government.  The other roommate and I have covered his last 2 months of rent and late fees. He kept saying he will get the money but it doesn't come. We can't afford to keep covering his rent.  He signed an agreement that he will pay us back but I doubt we will get our money.  Even if we win against him in small claims court the money he is getting is disability money and normally we cant collect from that.  I talked to management and they said the only way to get him off the lease is for them to evict us all for non-payment or him to sign himself off the lease.  If he refuses to sign himself off the lease, what are our options?  I was thinking of putting all of his stuff to an offsite storage unit and putting it under his name. Then adding someone else to the lease and renting out his room just so we cant get someone to pay rent.  He basically lives with his partner and uses the space he has with us as storage.   Are there any legal repercussions of moving his stuff into a storage unit in his name?	No
109	So I feel like a total idiot, but it has already been done. A couple months ago I had a guy ask tons of questions about a smartphone I was selling, and I answered. After some back and forth he bought it. Once he had received it, he said the Sprint SIM card he had would not work. He formally requested a refund through eBay, then opened a case against me for 'product different from the advertised product'. I was exasperated after he asked me to act as tech support, and I had tried, with no results. I refunded him. He never sent it back.  PayPal and eBay both tell me I shouldn't have refunded it, but the case against me made it sound like I had to refund quickly. I feel like an 80 yr old with her first computer to fall for whatever scam it was.   They also say to report it to my local police. I keep putting it off because I see no hope in doing so. Does anyone know if the police in Iowa could do anything? Thanks for your time.	No
110	Around 11 pm last night I was caught going 100 on a 55 mph highway (way too fast, I know), given a misdemeanor and a court date.   I've never been to court before and I am freaking out. I have a job and commute to two colleges, so more than anything I'm afraid of having my license suspended for 30 days.   What are the chances of a suspended license and should I get an lawyer?   Thank you for the help.	No
111	My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	No
112	Hello all and thank you in advance for any advice you can give me,   Young professional in Houston, wanted to move in to my first studio apartment and found what I thought was a good deal. I asked for an additional discount and they allowed me to move in August 31st, as stated on the lease which would give me a $700 discount for my first month. Retrieving my e-signed lease shows that a highrise representative signed off on all parts of the lease. Part of the lease agreement was that I had to arrange an Renter's Insurance policy with a $100,000 personal liability coverage. After receiving acceptance of the lease I went ahead and secured this for $200.   Now I'm being told that because the current tenant is moving out on August 31st that I must move in on September 7th, losing my $700 discount for summer and on top of that I must get Renters' Insurance from a different company with a $300,000 personal liability coverage.   My Questions:   Since they have electronically signed the lease agreement:   Can they force me to move in later and lose my discount?  Must I get new Renter's Insurance on their demand even though I did as stated on the agreed upon lease agreement?  If I do get new Renter's Insurance will the $200 I already paid be refunded from my old company?  Do I have any legal standing in this matter?  Can I cancel my lease as a breach of contract without any repercussions?   I plan to go in soon and talk to them, the move-in date won't matter so much but the main thing I wanted was the summer discount and losing it is really bad for me. I want to persuade them to let me keep this discount, could I use the lease agreement as ammunition? Should I pursue keeping the same Renter's Insurance?   Thank you all again - I feel like I'm being taken advantage of but am unsure.	No
113	I moved into an apartment with two roommates in October of 2016 and gave my roommate (who I was subleasing from) a $500 security deposit. After a few months, my roommates (who were a couple) had a really bad breakup that ended with the police being called and one of the roommates (Roommate A) moving out. His ex, (Roommate B) and I wanted a new lease that didn't' have him on it so we signed a new one together, making the old one with Roommate A's name on it void. We lived together for a few months until I moved out in May. The landlord said that they claimed no responsibility for my security deposit and that it was technically Roommate A's responsibility to pay me back. Roommate B told me several times she would be able to pay me my security deposit back and is now ignoring me completely. I'm considering going to small claims court but I'm worried if I even contact Roommate A for the money, he'll blame Roommate B and retaliate against her. What can I do?	No
114	Hello,  Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I was concerned about overexposition to the stock market, and asked my wife in late 2015 to make changes.  She ignored my request.   I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax.   I feel overburdened because while my exwife claims a sizeable share of these funds, she has completely ignored anything related to stewardship.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.  Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case for a while now, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending to be unavailable, or absent from the country, or that they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months..., just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.   Any advice appreciated.	No
115	So last night around 11 o'clock me and my fiancé heard a chirping and we looked to see our cat playing with a bat. We killed the bat and brought it in to the U of M emergency veterinary services for testing to see if it had rabies. We also brought both of our cats in to a vet to get rabies boosters this morning to further ensure they don't get the disease. We haven't heard back from the U of M yet, but I'm wondering if our landlord can be held responsible for any of the fees since it is either their fault for the bat getting into our apparent through a crack in our walls, or it got into our apartment because they leave both of the front doors and all of the fire doors open at night causing the bat to get into the building,and then sneak through our front door. We asked our maintenance guy about the situation and he said this was the second incident this month and they are calling an exterminator next week. Apparently this has been an on going problem and no one has told us. We're going in on Monday to see if the landlord will cover at least part of the vet bill. Do they have any responsibility to cover the bill legally or are we just stuck with the bill if they refuse? The initial bill for the booster shots plus all of their extra fees was $250 or so, but this will get much more expensive if the test for the bat comes back positive for the rabies virus, especially since we suspect that it was in our house overnight while we were sleeping so then we will need to get treatment. Any advice is appreciated.	No
116	Hi I cross posted this with /advice I hope I'm doing this right because I've never really posted on Reddit...also sorry for formatting I'm on mobile and also incredibly stressed out.   So basically there were issues with our carpets when we moved out of our apartment. There was a bleach stain in the hallway caused by my roommate that we all witnessed her make (myself and other two housemates). She said before we moved out that she knew she would have to take responsibility for it. Turns out when it came time she tried to lie her way out of it by blaming me (because she hates me, she told the others girls exactly that). In the end she ended up taking responsibility.  We thought we moved on but fast forward to this week. My landlord send my security deposit to the girl I subletted from and I haven't been able to contact that girl to get my security deposit back (that's a whole thing in and of itself). The landlord said the carpet cleaning for the living room went well except one or two small stains that wouldn't come out but it wasn't a big deal. We all made stains on that carpet that we tried to clean. I personally had two tiny coffee stains because my dog stole an empty k-cup when I first moved in. However I spent a long time trying to get it out and it was almost unnoticeable by the time I moved out. Unlike tar my roommate has tracked into the living room after the beach one day.   Anyway today the landlord tells me that my roommate is upset about the living room floor and decided she wants it to be replaced which would cost all 4 of us $1000-1500. She also sent my housemate a picture of said stains and guess what, they're HUGE. They look FRESH. They were not there before. But now the others have turned on me saying now it's my turn to take responsibility. I feel like my roommate is being vindictive and wants revenge.   I'm also concerned on whether my landlord is allowed to try and charge us after the fact she already send my deposit with my itemized list of damages/deductions and it's been 21 days (this is the max limited allotted under CA law to send a security deposit back with deductions).   I am so stressed and confused and really need any help I can get, especially in terms of my legal rights. Thank you.   P.S. I am a sub letter so I know that technically any charges would actually go toward the master tenant but I am so confused on the legality of all this as we never filed paperwork with the landlord regarding my sublet (I filled it out but the master tenant never signed or sent it in)	No
117	This is more of a curiosity question; however, it could affect me if the fires affect my area of BC. If the RCMP or Forestry service issue an evacuation order and I believe it is premature or unnecessary do I retain the right to stay on my property which is owned by me? I don't want to leave and stay in some run down hotel or some school gymnasium. So r/legaladvice, can I stay in my home under an evacuation order?	No
118	"My brother is a horrible sociopath and drug abuser. My mother has been one of those mothers who has been blinded by motherly love in the past, and has enabled him for the past twenty years. But now it has reached a point where she fears for her life. So last year she took out a restraining order against him.  However, whenever the police take him away... they seem to release my brother from custody after a few days. I don't actually know the law, but I'm told that my brother is classified as mentally-ill by the state, and according to the law, they cannot hold mentally-ill in jail. So over the past several years one of three things, happen... they release him to a homeless shelter, or the county hospital, and one time even a church. And from there he is released, and able to come back to my mother's house where he starts the abuse, and the cycles starts all over again.   In the past, she would even bring my brother home herself because, even after physical violence, she would say ""he is still my son and I love him"". But because the type of drugs he abused got harder and harder, and the physical, mental, and financial abuse got worse and worse, she finally was able to get a restraining order against him.  However, my brother has found another loophole to this restraining order law: Police can only remove people violating a restraining order if they are outside the house. What he does is hop the backyard gate and sneak into the house. According to my mother, the police have told her that they can no longer remove my brother if he is already inside the house.  My brother currently has a case against him for violent abuse against my mom, but the next court date is in late September, but I fear she won't last long in her current state.  My questions:  1) Am I misinformed in that mentally-ill persons cannot be kept incarcerated in California? If that is indeed in the case, what options do we have to forcible keep my brother away from my mom at least until the court hearing date?  2) Can the police really do nothing if my brother is already inside the house on the restraining order?  3) Can a restraining order be made null and void if my brother argues that my mother voluntarily took him back?"	No
119	"Hi - I (28f) have a 6.5 year old son from a previous (never married) relationship where the biological father is not involved. He is court-ordered to pay a little child support but that's it. Nothing as far as custody goes - but he won't sign off his paternal rights.  I am getting married next year to a man who my son knows as dad, as he's the only father figure he's ever known and has been there since he had just turned 1.  What changes once we get married? More specifically, what rights will my fiance have over my/our son once we are legally married? Does he become a ""legal guardian""? Would he be able to keep him if I ever die? I really know nothing on this topic so any light shed on it would be helpful."	No
120	My best friends son is in Maine visiting his father. He was supposed to be returned yesterday to Tennessee. The father is ignoring the mother's phone calls, the police have been notified. They won't do anything because it's not kidnapping, it is 'restraint by another parent'. They told her to go to a lawyer in Tennessee, and Tennessee lawyers are telling her to get a lawyer in Maine. She set up a gofundme page, but it's unlikely she will raise money within a significant amount of time.  She tried Pine Tree Legal, they don't deal with family matters. She went to the court in Tennessee AND phoned Maine's court, and was told she needed a lawyer before filling out the forms, and/or told about a 30 day waiting period.  The court order states that the father only gets custody every other Saturday, Father's Day, half of Christmas and Thanksgiving.  They made a verbal agreement that the boy would be returned yesterday, but now they are in hiding. The police have gone to his address and his family's addresses.  What can she do???	No
121	I signed a lease with the intent of moving into an apartment complex that I no longer wish to due various reasons.  I asked for a copy of my lease and the offical name of the place since signing has changed.  The lease papers have the original name of the place and it is under new management.  Can I fight it and terminate my lease?	No
122	Essentially title.  I previously posted about a minor fender bender. The other vehicle will cost ~$700 to fix, which is below the reporting requirement of my state ($1,000 or more total property damages).  My vehicle had some minor damage, but I don't plan on getting it fixed and have not gotten the damage valued.  Per my state, I'm required to report accidents above a threshold, but if I don't get the damage to my vehicle valued, and I don't care about repairing it, do I need to factor in my vehicle to the total estimated property damage?	No
123	"This is for a friend who's currently being investigated by CPS for what they suspect is child abuse.  I'll be keeping this as vague as possible to protect the identities of those involved, but I have a few basic questions that I was hoping someone would be able to help out with.  It sounds like this could get bad pretty quick for my friend if things aren't handled properly, and I don't want to see that happen.  **Quick Background**  One of my friend's kids got hurt from an accident in the home, and ended up having to go to the hospital.  Everything seemed normal, CPS didn't show up, and they were never mentioned during the trip to the hospital.  It wasn't until the next day when CPS showed up at my friend's house for questioning, and even then, no additional issues were brought up.  They showed back up the following day and said my friend was going to be investigated for possible child abuse, and everything since then has been an extremely hectic, mental and emotional mess.  **Questions**  * If my friend is unable to afford a lawyer from a private practice, how long does it usually take to get a court appointed lawer?  Is this something a court appointed lawyer would be a able to quickly act on?  * If my friend is required to have a ""supervisor"" in order to be around their kids, but they don't have any friends or family who are able/available, what will happen?  Will a lawyer be able to help with this?  (I read that some courts will counter CPS in some cases, at least with the ""supervised"" stuff, but I wasn't sure how often that happens.)  This investigation has only been going on for a couple days now, but CPS is already saying my friend is at risk of losing their kids.  It sounds like this could happen sooner than later if my friend isn't able to find a friend or family member that what would essentially be a live-in Nanny that could serve as a full time supervisor.  I understand the reasoning behind this stuff, but I honestly don't know how some families are expected to make it through these situations in one piece.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."	No
124	I stopped at a stop sign and checked to see if there was any incoming traffic from the left. After checking, i proceeded to turn right but then I saw a person in front my car, crossing the street. So I quickly pulled over my brake and the person saw me coming at her and she quickly back paddled. Then she walked over to the driver's seat and when I pulled over my window to ask if she was alright, she said she WASN'T alright and asked for my information. So i gave her my phone number and my name and she just walked away after verifying my phone number... She was not on the ground, and from my perspective at the time, the only contact that my car had with her was with her hand at the front hood of my car trying to maybe.. prevent the car from lunging at her?   Is there any charges that I can get from this incident?  I am residing in Washington State.	No
125	So my buddy just called me, he had been on a dating app and been talking with this girl. She was posted as 19 and going to college in a few weeks and was just looking to mess around. Things happened and nudes were sent. After a few days she wanted to meet up and he was trying to figure out the logistics. Before that happened she told him she was actually just turning 17 in a few weeks. He said the hell with this deleted the nudes and cut contact. The next day he gets a call from a supposed lawyer and the lawyer said the father was an understanding guy and just wanted to talk to my buddy and figure out what happened. He got a weird vibe asked about the law firm and got vauge answers so he said he can't verify the lawyer he won't talk to him. Me and another buddy have been looking into the supposed lawyer and the name given doesn't show up on the MN and ND lists. I called the number and got a different last name that was a lawyer. The cellphone number doesn't match the lawfirms number. We are all confused and this smells of scamming... anyone have any similar situations or advice we would greatly appreciate it.	No
126	A friend of mine is upset that I chose my current boyfriend over him. I am 17 in a state where the age of consent is 18. My boyfriend is over 18.  If everyone else denies it, what does my friend need to prove it?	No
127	USA - Colorado  I'll try and keep it short and to the point. I'll try not to rant, but I can't make any promises lol.  He doesn't follow a single rule that I told him when he first moved in. He's stealing my beer and is only 20. He got fired from his job because he refused to do his job on a daily basis. He violates my personal space all the time and I can't take it. He gets angry very easily and treats me like a doormat even though I pay most the rent. I've given him so many chances to redeem himself, but he simply refuses.  I told him I wanted him out in 30 days. Right now it's only been 12, but his behavior is getting extremely worse and I'm tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. **He's not on the lease** and I wanted to know if it's possible to get him out sooner. I was told by numerous people I legally have to give him 30 days, but I need to know if I can get him out sooner before things get worse.  Is it legally required to give him 30 days to move out in Colorado? He's not on the lease and didn't even pay rent this month.	No
128	Until recently I worked for a large bank and knew before leaving that I had used up more holidays than I was entitled for the amount of the year so far. I was told it would be deducted from my wages but it wasn't. They've now written to me asking me to repay the £400 I owe. Am I legally obliged to repay it?	No
129	"So after pretty much no word from former landlord, he sends us an itemized list within hours of his 60 day duration being up saying we owe him more money. FYI the numbers given aren't the exact quote more just a ballpark figure of what it is.  The first item that took our security deposit is that he expects us to pay for plumbing repair and replacing the plumbing system. In March our basement plumbing system started leaking water. We notified him immediately of the problem. However, he did not actually send a person to look at it until late May. (We have multiple texts from when we first reported the problem and trying to get him to send someone out) When a person did finally come to look at it, the only resolution we got from him was to put down towels around it. He did not actually get it properly looked at until a few days ago. Invoice for replacement is dated 8/01. According to him, the problem was cause by a rag getting stuck in the plumbing system. None of my roommates seem to ever recall flushing a rag down the toilet and I do believe them. Our apartment was one of three in a single building and not sure if the plumbing system in our basement was for multiple units or just ours. Either way, the long period of the plumbing system leaking caused baseboard damage which leads to the next item.   He is quoting us $2,500 dollars for re-painting the entire house. Besides the pictures of the damaged baseboards in the basement there are only a few pictures of minor scuffs on the wall which should be ruled as normal wear and tear. Also, we were told before moving out that he planned to re-paint the entire house anyway. We have texts with the landlord for when he was telling us that a painter would be coming to start the process while we were still living there. The ""painting company"" he hired seemed to be a friend of his and worked for about half a day while we were still living there. However, the invoice for painting in May 17 he sent us was for 61 hours of work.   He is also charging us $500 for Landscape repair. Our roommate did have a dog with dug up the yard a decent bit but the ""backyard"" is only about the size of a suburban and half of it is concrete/gravel so not sure if this is a reasonable quote?  Finally, many of the pictures he is using for ""damages"" are from when we still actually lived there. Earlier in the year he did a surprise visit with his dad so we did not have time to clean the place before his arrival. He is using these to claim we did not do any cleaning before leaving and saying we left the place in poor condition. In some cases, it is obvious as parts of our furniture and possessions are in the corners of the pictures. In other cases, there are pictures of corners/window sills we know we cleaned thoroughly but could not think of another time he would of gotten a picture when they were dirty. Unfortunately, we did not take pictures when we moved out. Besides his slowness to deal with the plumbing issue he had seemed like an honest person and we we're not expecting anything like this. In hindsight, obviously I will be sure to document pictures myself.  There are some other charges such as cleaning fees, carpet repair (damage from dog) and routine landscape maintenance which does seem to be in the lease but confusingly worded. These aren't such a big deal. It is mainly the plumbing and painting that are the issue.   Any advice would be appreciated! Especially concerning how much to reveal on things I can disprove when I initially dispute the bill before going to court.  Thanks!"	No
130	About two years ago when I was a freshman in college I got in some legal trouble. Basically ended up in the hospital super drunk, freaked out, accidentally injured a nurse while they were trying to restrain me. I woke up still intoxicated with a police officer instructing me to sign a piece of paper. I did that then I passed back out. When I next woke up there was a doctor there who told me what had happened and that the nurse I accidentally hurt didn't want to press charges.  I hired an attorney and found out (I believe my attorney told me) that the police officer was also trying to charge me with assault and battery. A few days later I showed up at the local court house with my attorney. He spoke to the judge who decided to get rid of the misdemeanor Minor in Consumption and battery charge and instead give me one charge of Disturbing the Peace. I informally plead guilty by telling my attorney to take the deal. I then paid a fine, and that was that. My attorney also mentioned that, because my battery charge hadn't been formally written up and filed yet, it wouldn't show up on my criminal record. Does that sound accurate and plausible?  Now, back to my main question: how can this all be on my file if I never remember having my fingerprints or a mugshot taken? They wouldn't have done that in the hospital, right? I would have had to have been booked into jail?  I'm also an Elementary Education major and I've taken two fingerprint checks, neither of which have come up with anything that the Board of Education found bad enough to bar me from teaching. Does that mean they didn't find anything, or that they don't care about my record?	No
131	I hear it all the time in Michigan that you can move out at the age of 17. Planning to move my GF out of her home at that age and just wanna be sure that her cop brother can't touch me when i do.	No
132	My girlfriend shares an apartment with 3 of girls, but the each roommate has a separate lease in Ohio. The A/C in the apartment wasn't working sometime in may, when they turned it on for the first time. It's now August 1st and the A/C isn't working. They've put in six work orders over the course of the 3 months and the complex has sent people to try to fix it each time. In July they started respondong in a timely manner (like a week) but in may and june for the first two work orders it took almost or a whole month. The last time they came in on the 20th of July they replaced the entire A/C unit. It seemed to work when she left on the 21st for vacation and was cooling the living area, but when she got back on the 27th, it wasn't work again. She put a work order in that day and they tried to bandaid the problem, which didn't work, so she put in a new work order today on the 2nd. Could this be used to get out of her lease early? Her new lease started on the 1st, but she had signed early to hold her spot.	No
133	"Obligatory: If this is not in the right subreddit, please let tell me where to post it.   I'll try to make this *somewhat* short. My husband and I live on the ground floor apartment in Northern Virginia.  I came home Thursday to an apartment that smelled like chemicals. As I got closer to by closed bedroom door, I start to hear the sound of running water. Kind of like several small waterfalls streaming at once.  I open the door to see that part of the ceiling has collapsed, there are several STREAMS of water coming down onto everything I own, and several huge balloons of paint filled with water waiting to burst. Maintenance comes and they find out that the water heater of the tenants above us(who are currently on vacation) had burst and there is ""water flying everywhere"". No clue how long it had been going, I'd been gone from 6am-3pm.  They rip out the drywall that ""would have fallen anyway"", and carve out a hole for ventilation. Maintenance brings in an industrial dehumidifier that empties into our bathtub, and a huge industrial fan that is propped up on a bucket underneath the carpet to dry everything out. The room needs to dry out the best it can before they can begin work, so they will re-evaluate on Monday(4 days from now).This entire time the room is hot, smelly, and humid. The thermostat in the apartment reads 80 degrees and does not go down despite the AC/fan running.  In this time we're living in the den with our mattress on the floor and everything we own being washed/thrown away/ packed away on any free space in the living room. We both take off work Friday to sort through all our crap/start filing the insurance claim. Monday comes and they re-do the entire bedroom, hallway, and bathroom, and incidental the laundry room/closets because water has seeped through the wall into adjacent rooms. Fans/Dehumidifier remain in the room and stay there from Thursday to Tuesday.  We have asked the Leasing Manager at our apartment if we could talk about some sort of compensation/etc. on our rent this month to offset the increased cost of our electric bill this month.(Dehumidifier/Fans/AC) We're told ""we're glad you have renters insurance, they will gladly replace what was damaged"". In response we said ""renters insurance isn't going to reimburse our increased energy bill, time off work, and general inconvenience of being forced to live in a room for a week."" To that the director said, ""A water heater breaking is not our responsibility. We (the complex) didn't cause it to break, but if you (my husband and I) would like to e-mail a formal request for this I will gladly forward it to the corporate offices."" To add insult to injury, our ceiling collapsing came the day after my husband's car had been broken into for the THIRD time while living here and the same manager saying ""it's not our responsibility"" when I asked for increased security on property to prevent this from happening again.  Now, long story short, we understand if that representative doesn't have the authority to authorize anything like that, but we would still like to plead our case to them the best we can. We would like some advice on how best to word this e-mail to effectively communicate our frustration and show them how awful this entire situation has been, and their lack of empathy hasn't helped at all. *bonus* if possible, advice on how to terminate our lease(without penalty) 2 months early would also be appreciated as we no longer feel safe living in this complex, and the entire thing has left a sour taste in our mouths.  Thank you in advanced."	No
134	I am not interested in suing Starbucks. I quite like their establishment.   Out of curiosity...  Today I ordered a soy latte. They gave me one with 2% milk. Now I have diarrhea because I'm lactose intolerant. I brought the drink to the barista and told her it was incorrect. She remade the drink and gave me a $4 gift card. (Not sure why it wasn't $6 considering that's the cost of a latte.) I told her the card wasn't necessary but she insisted I have it anyway. Does accepting the card diminish my ability to win a lawsuit?   Does Starbucks give out gift cards as a sneaky method to later state the person affected was compensated?	No
135	I moved into an apartment 3 days ago. when I first walked in there was a dead roach next to my door. immediately I called the complex and they told me pest control only comes out every Monday (this was Tuesday)  ever since then I've seen about 5-6 a day. there's roach shit all over my living room floor and in my bathroom. they're dropping from the ceilings. I'm like creeping around my damn apartment on high alert every day paranoid about seeing one. I can't even live in my own place because I'm just alert about seeing another one. they're crawling outside my door, outside my window, idk what else to do at this point  if they come in and spray and I'm still having problems does this give me grounds to legally break the lease?	No
136	"This is a strange situation. I feel like I am being harassed in a really weird way.   I broke up with my ex (we'll call him ""John"") 6 years ago. Recently, I've been getting mail (bills, mostly) in John's name sent to my address. Debt collectors are calling my cell phone looking for him. And I even had a man come to my door to deliver a court summons to him! Whenever this happens, I return the mail to the sender. I tell the debt collectors they have the wrong number, etc.   For what it's worth, he was highly abusive. We went no contact after I kicked him out. But that didn't necessarily keep him from harassing me. He eventually stopped. But now he's using my mailing address and phone number as his contact information, and I think it's just a weird way of maintaining some ""control"" over me.  So what on Earth can I do about him using my information? Is this fraud?"	No
137	Back in December I had a load of expensive books stolen from me and then sold to a used book store. Because they were unique I was able to find them and call the cops, the cops recovered the books and held them for evidence. A few months later they caught the person that stole the books, but it was a different persons that sold them. The Thief was caught with a stolen vehicle  that was stolen from the same parking lot the same night, and the person that sold the books admits to receiving them from the Thief and selling them, thinking that they were legit. (Even though there is no way the Thief plays D&amp;D)   Fast forward to today. The Thief is in jail, and will be for a while, the person that sold the books did not get charged, and I am being told I need to reimburse that business that bought my books.   Is this normal for Nebraska? Is this legal? Should I pay and then take the person that sold them to Small Claims Court?	No
138	Asking on behalf of a friend, she got notice 2 days ago from the new management of her building (property just changed hands) that her rent is increasing from 380$ to 500$. Everyone on the property got this notice. In NC there is no statute of how long notice they need for this. But the management stated it was for repairs of the parking lot and roads. Is this legal?	No
139	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
140	Previous posts are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6hqze7/my_neighbor_cut_my_trees/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ivmck/update_my_neighbor_cut_my_trees_nh/)  It's been a month and we've finally gotten a detailed drawing of landmarks from the surveyor (to confirm that the surveyor got the lines plotted correctly), comprehensive estimates from a landscaper based on photos provided by the previous owner of the house and timber values from an arborist. Now that everything is all squared away in that regard, we're getting ready to submit a demand letter.   The one question my lawyer asked is if I should include a value in the demand letter or if I should invite them to contact my lawyer for further details. What would be the pros and cons of each approach?	No
141	My friend picked up a 3 month sublet lease on an off campus college house this summer. Its mainly empty for the summer. But since she's moved in she's had various issues with place. She wanted a single but the room she got was a double. The subletter promised she would have the room to herself since the other roommate wouldn't be around. This hasn't been the case and the other roommates visits frequently and often time brings other guys with her to the room which makes my friend uncomfortable.   Also the place does not have wifi or Internet hooked up. She constantly brought this up with her subletter but they never got around setting anything up. Even though she's only a subletter, she still tries to keep the house clean but the house always keeps getting messy whenever the normal residents show up and bring people with them. The normal residents don't do any cleaning themselves.  While this was going on, she looked for a new place to move out to. She found one, liked it, and it had everything she wanted. She then paid the first months deposit afterwards. Now as she's trying to move out, she has a big hurdle. She's discussed her plans to move out and all the reasons she wants to move but she's still stuck in the contract. It's August and there's still one month left. She had discussed this to both the landlord and her subletter. Even knowing all these issues, the landlord sided with the subletter and said she has the follow the contract. As a result of this, the subletter has said that my friend is free to move out, but she'll still have to pay the final months rent. Even if she doesn't live there. Does my friend have any legal standing on this? She's paid for a place she's likes and wants to move into but is stuck in a place she's doesn't like and still has to pay whether she's there or not.	No
142	I am simply seeking information on my rights and the regulations in this scenario.  (Indiana, U.S.)  About 4 days ago myself and a few friends signed a one-year lease on a house in our area. Almost immediately after we began our lease the property owner has put the property up for sale, and we were asked by the property management company to make time today for a showing. My concern is simply to know what my rights are and what the situation is should the property be sold.  We do have a 1 year lease August 1st is the official starting date. There is no early termination clause.   I suppose my more specific questions would be  1. Is there any reason, provided we pay rent on time and obey all terms on the lease, that we can be evicted prior to the end of the lease?  2. Should the new owner, likely an investor, want to make repairs, upgrades, or modifications to the property what authority do they have to do so. (More specifically if it will interrupt our daily lives can we protest these changes?  3. Can the new owner modify the terms of our lease in any way?	No
143	"Hello! I'm speaking on behalf of my mom--I don't know much legally and she asked for me to lend a hand. She has been complaining about her landlord for the past year (she signed the lease 9/12/16 and it ends 8/31/17, and it has been paid in full). She moves into a new place at the end of this month. She lives with my little brother and three cats. The apartment policy says the cats are fine, my mom just had to pay a flat fee every month. The apartment complex itself is extremely dilapidated and looks much like a slum, so I'm sure this isn't the first time a situation like this has happened here. The complex has a cockroach problem all around, among other issues. My mom and brother are quiet on their own, and the landlord has made accusations that other tenants have filed complaints about her. She wouldn't provide any record of this.   Here is a rundown of the bee/eviction situation from what my mom said:  ""On Wednesday, August 1, I came home to a swarm of bees in my master bedroom.  The window in that room is jammed shut, so there is no way to open it to release them.  I called the emergency maintenance number 4 times before I got a response, and I was told that there was no 24 hour pest control and they could do nothing.  I am allergic to bees, so I rented a hotel room for the night.  The next morning, the landlord called me and said that she would add the $63 hotel charge to my deposit since I already paid my last month’s rent in full.  At 1pm, she asked me to come to the office and gave me a 5 day eviction notice saying that the apartment was a violation pursuant to ARS Sec 33-1368-a and that if I didn’t clean the cat smell from the carpet, she would start the eviction process.  She told me that it was my fault that the bees got in and that she was not required to clean them up.  She said she was being nice by bringing an exterminator and that she didn’t have to do it.  Landlord told me to remove the carpet myself and that there was no way to make the smell go away and that she would keep my deposit and the added $63 to replace the carpet. She refused to sign any documentation about her statements about me removing the carpet and she would not evict me.  She refused to give me the updated copy of the lease with the increased deposit.  Landlord had a background check from my new apartment manager on her desk.  She told me that she could “ruin my life” by filling it out negatively.  She is to return to my apartment on 8/9/17 to determine whether she will evict me [as in kick her out this Wednesday if the place is not up to her standards] in the final month of my occupancy after all rent and deposits have been paid.""  From what I've heard, it sounds like the landlord is just trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of my mom before she moves out. The landlord is trying to blame the beehive on my mom having cats, which doesn't make sense. My mom and brother are currently sleeping in a shitty apartment filled with bees, and might be homeless in a couple days. Please send help.  What kind of protection does my family have? I can answer any questions, and we would greatly appreciate any help. Thank you for reading through this."	No
144	Tl;dr: In Baltimore, MD, is it legal to rent my separate entrance in-law suite (with its own kitchen and its own bathroom but with one shared door that would probably remain locked on both sides)? If so, would the person be considered a roommate rather than a tenant? What legal precautions should I take to ensure this is done correctly?       Background: My husband and I recently moved into our 6 bedroom home in Baltimore City. It was a renovation, and we designed it so it can eventually be separated into two distinct residences fairly easily. Our main residence (front entrance) would be 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths and there would also be a small 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartment with a rear entrance. To do this (not including the legal steps of getting a permit of occupancy change), we'd need to turn one door into a wall, add a wall to divide a hallway in two, and install a small kitchen in the rear living area, currently used as a large mudroom. I don't believe we need to get any further construction permits since our renovation plan, which included stub out lines gas, water, and drain lines for the future rental kitchen, was approved by the city, so we plan to do the drywall and kitchen installation ourselves.    Because we think our parents/in-laws may need this space in the future, we're less inclined to separate the space fully and keep at least one door. I believe this is (aptly) called an in-law suite. But in the meantime, we'd like to rent it to friends or other folks, maybe Air B&amp;B it, etc. So we'd like to keep the door locked on our side as well as give the tenant/roommate the option to lock the door on their side.      I understand what I'd need to do to get a legal second apartment, but I'm less familiar around what legal/contractual precautions to take for renting an in-law suite to a roommate (or if that person is still considered a tenant). I'm also not sure if the shared door locking thing is considered a violation of the housing code if the rear apartment/in law suite has their own method of egress through the back door, which would be their main entrance. The property would be owner-occupied regardless of whether it's an in-law suite or a separate apartment. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!	No
145	TLDR:  Guy bought property with terms:  if HST, then (price “HST Included”), else (certificate on closing).  Expected to receive input tax credit on HST; Property wasn’t subject to HST; No HST paid. Given certificate on closing; Guy still tries to claim HST input tax credit; CRA says no; Guy argues with CRA; still no; Guy sues seller.    The facts (If you want to read more. It’s dense and I warned you).  My friend &amp; her husband (both retired) sold a piece of vacant land: a hundred acres of junk (new-growth trees, rocks, swamp), at the edge of nowhere, previously severed from farm.    Agent explained that HST might be payable, might not.  Hard to tell, because farm, severance, etc...  Friend isn’t a tax expert, agent isn’t a tax expert.  It’ll all get sorted at closing.   Lists for $Y, friend wants minimum $X net.   $Y is much bigger than $X, of course.  Years pass (boonies:  location, location, location). Offer finally comes in.  Agent turns out to be agent for buyer and seller.   Price is strangely $X + agent commission + closing costs, minus a hundred bucks…  smells like agent telegraphed minimum but strange things are known to happen.  Friend lets it pass.    Useful bits of offer say: “if subject to HST, then HST is included in price, if not, vendor will deliver certificate on or before closing.”  Also says property is “vacant land”.  So far, so good.  Mutual understanding of the facts. Check.  Friend reviews offer: Maybe HST, maybe no HST… if no HST, friend will get $X, but if HST is payable, then friend will $X-HST. Nope on that offer.  Offer countered at $X + small negotiating room + legal bill estimate + commission + HST + more negotiating room.   Still way less than Y.   “Final offer” comes back at $Z =  $X + reduced agent commission + reduced legal bill + HST + 0.00 exactly.  Friend grumbles at strange twice in a row, but it’s the only offer in a long time, and it’s (barely) acceptable if HST.   She accepts.   Useful bits are the same, cause it was back and forth RE deal like usual and these clauses weren’t modified. Agreement also included a right of inspection of all terms by lawyers of Buyer, and cancellation by default if not waived by Date, plus return of deposit.   Lawyers for Buyer modify a few details in the title, adjust closing date.  Condition waived.   Closing is nigh: friend and husband meet with lawyers.  And the answer is: property is not subject to HST, so sign this certificate.  Certificate delivered.  Lawyers pore over details.  Two digits plus pennies of land taxes are added to the account.    Friends pocket $Z - commission - legals + two digits:  it’s bigger than $X by five digits. So they are happy.  Until this weekend.  Friend just served them a summons in small claims court, out in some county somewhere nowhere nearby.    It’s legit, so they plan to respond pronto.    Buyer claims after closing, and despite having been given certificate (which he doesn’t mention), “The Plaintiff subsequently applied for an HST rebate based on his belief that he had paid the HST included in the purchase price.”   CRA denied, on the basis that no HST had been paid (no kidding, it wasn’t owed).  Buyer calls CRA &amp; appeals, asks for ruling, finally gets long letter from CRA saying “no!” but taking several pages to do so.  Buyer is now claiming fraudulent misrepresentation: e.g. that friend fraudulently misrepresented to friend’s agent (conveniently not mentioning he is also buyer’s agent) that HST was payable, and Buyer relied on this agent who only tells truth, and Buyer’s whole deal was based on claiming input tax credit on 13% of the purchase price, which depended on Friend paying 13% HST, “included” in the price…  TLDR2:  Buyer who is impervious to information provided in written certificates claiming he relied on friend’s agent, who screwed him, claims friend is liable for the acts of friend’s agent, who was also buyer’s agent.  Any words of wisdom?  Strategy?	No
146	Hi,  I have 2 things that I need to do, but I'm not sure which forms I need to fill out.  1) I would like to file a motion for reconsideration because the court order is missing some important items that were supposed to be included (and were mentioned in the court transcript).  I don't see a form on the Superior Court website that allows me to file for reconsideration. How should I go about doing this? It's already been 6 months since the original judgment was made.  2) I'm being taken to court for contempt of court regarding child support by my ex-husband. I would like to respond to my ex's motion but I'm not sure which forms to fill out.  Can anyone give me some guidance?	No
147	I was working at a stadium tonight, and at the end of the night it turns out the till was down. After this the security guard searched me, he searched my pockets (no issues so far), then after nothing was found he asked me to remove my bra and lift it up and shake it (with my top still on of course), I felt weird doing this but was tired and wanted to go home so I did it and after I did it the guard seemed seemed really awkward. This took place behind a fridge behind the bar so no customers could see, but the person behind the other bar would be able to see if he looked over. This feels pretty weird to me and I've never experienced this before, I'm not looking to sue or anything but is searching like this (especially by a member of the opposite sex) allowed? If not I'll bring it up to my supervisor tomorrow.	No
148	I finally moved out from the apartment and all my belongings were safe and sound. Before the move out period, however, she made some insults and neglected her duty of keeping the place clean.   She's asking me about $500 for the extra week's stay, $150 for the labor for installation, and electricity bill that came when she specified that previous one was the last one I had to pay.  Now, none of these were written on the paper and I don't think I am legally required to make these payments. She still hasn't apologized and what not. Should I just move on with my life and not pay her a cent? (I did pay for the door cost and transportation for the door)  She originally tried to rip me off by adding personal purchases onto the recipt and overcharging the whole cost and now she's down to all minimums.	No
149	About two weeks ago our landlord sent us and email to let us know some work would be done on the house today. However, she did not mention that we would wake up to find ourselves without power. I am supposed to be doing work from home but I'm dependent on my Internet connection. Do I have any right to take legal action? Compensation for lost wages?	No
150	1. A friend bought a new home in a new development. 2. The A/C unit installed in the house is objectively too small to cool the house effectively. This is based on a conversation with a company employed technician who has had to repair the unit. 3. All houses in the development were apparently given these A/C units which are too small.   My friend is bugging the company to try to get a better unit, but as can be expected they're not being very helpful.   Before my friend speaks with an attorney, and assuming the company doesn't come through, I wanted to test the waters here to see if you all think they have any chance at a successful lawsuit.  Basically, their argument is that they were sold a house with an A/C unit that they expected to cool the house effectively, and it doesn't do that. I guess the home builder could claim the buyer knew the capacity of the unit and bought it anyway, but I'm not sure whether the average layperson would be able or expected to know about this and/or research it.   Based on casual research, the upgraded A/C unit looks to be about $2,000-4,000, so it's not huge money. I mention that everyone got one of these in case you all think collective action (not necessarily legal) might be a good way to go too.   Thanks in advance!	No
151	"As the title says, I'm about to buy a house with my boyfriend soon.  I'll be the only one on the title and mortgage, and I'm putting down the down payment. I decided to be the only one responsible for it until he and I get married, just to be as smart as possible about it. Other than that, he and I are going to split the monthly costs of the home, split the repairs/upgrades, and split the utilities (the same as we do while living in our apartment).   My question is this: Are there any tax difficulties for me if I just have him do an automatic payment or something into my bank account to cover his half of the cost? I'm not sure if it would legally be considered ""income"" for me. For better or worse, it'd be a bit like rent until we get hitched.  If that way sucks, what's the best way to deal with it?"	No
152	when i was about 8 or 9 my dad and I would stay with his GF who was an exotic dancer who used heroin regularly. he is very abusive to my family and I. whatever whatever. I am trying so hard to not see him anymore. i live in MI, USA.   like I was saying, when i was 8 or 9 my dad and her and I would all sleep in the same room. they would be having sex while i was in the room! (didn't completely know when i was younger due to a lack of knowledge, but now I remember their convo and the noises they were making. pretty easy to put 2 and 2 together).   i was just wondering if i can bring this up and tell anyone and have him get charged with SOMETHING. i know it's probably a no since there's no clear evidence, just my word against his. but i'm just wondering. he does have a bad record of DUI's and domestic abuse.  TL;DR- can my dad get charged with anything if it's just my word vs his	No
153	Long story short, I’ve been sick for a few months, unable to work, and pay my rent.  My landlord went through the eviction process, and we had a court date set for August 3rd. I didn’t bother to go because you’re required to pay to file a response or go, and I knew I owed the money (less than $2,000 if that matters). From what I had read, I would be given about a month to find a new place to live, which was okay with me.  Today, 6 days after the court case, I received a package from my landlord with the court document that stated the judgement for forcible entry and detainer was stayed until tomorrow.  Does this mean I can be forcibly removed as early as tomorrow? Do I have any legal way to give myself some more time? I have nowhere to go (I recently moved here for a job, so I have no friends here), and have no means to live out of until I find a place. I have no money until I get paid on the $15th, and my boss/person who does payroll is out of town so I can’t ask for an advance.	No
154	forgive me if this is a long story. this has been slowly building for seven years. i will try to include only the essential facts. after that, feel free to ask questions.  fact 1 -- my husband has degenerative bone disease and was told eight years ago that he would soon be confined to a wheelchair. so far this hasn't happened, but he is not in good health although he continues to work hard for the little money he can make.  fact 2 -- i suffer from mental illnesses including PTSD from childhood and borderline personality disorder. i have applied for disability and been turned down, although it doesn't change the fact that my last therapist advised that i shouldn't be working.  fact 3 -- our landlady uses and abuses us. when she takes vacations, we watch her cats for free because we feel if we say no, we'll be kicked out. this is how she suckers us into almost everything, including spending an entire day cleaning out a shed on our property full of her stuff.  fact 4 -- her worst offense happened a few months ago. our septic tank overflowed (not maintained for 20+ years) and she didn't fix it for nearly two weeks despite my pleas, which only angered her as she tried to turn my husband against me. she also forced my nearly crippled husband to dig up the septic tank himself.  we were unable to take showers, use the sinks, do laundry, or even use the bathroom in the house. the smell was awful and very unsanitary. i do have video documentation.  fact 5 -- since that happened, i believe it has either caused further PTSD or aggravated what i already had. i have nightmares about poop. i smell phantom sewage smells all the time and very often taste it in my food. i was admitted to a state hospital for thirteen days and my psychiatrist classified what she did to me as abuse.  fact 6 -- while i was trying to recover in the hospital, the refrigerator that came with the house broke and my husband has been eating fast food for three weeks as he begs her to replace the fridge. now she isn't even answering her phone even though she is home. (lives next door to our rental property.)  fact 7 -- we have four cats that have also suffered due to the stress in our household. we can't afford to move and if we did, it might be near a busy road or highway, and i fear for them. i might could give one up for adoption but no more.  fact 8 -- in kentucky there is something called a landlord retaliation law that states she can't kick us out for a year after we have complained about a major repair to the house. if this is true we still have time, however with my mental illnesses i became very angry with her before my hospital stay. because of that, i cannot go to my house at all. i haven't seen my cats in weeks. she is threatening to call the police if i show up, although there is no restraining order or anything of the sort.   -  what would you guys do in my situation? i am finally on the correct antidepressants after twenty-two years, but her behavior is affecting my recovery. i really am better and had gotten over my anger with her, but now it's returning.  any and all advice is appreciated.

155	Almost ten years ago, I took a Jiu Jitsu class at the local YMCA.   During a drill on a basic technique, the girl I was paired with broke her arm after falling awkwardly. It was a spider guard technique, done under the supervision of the teacher. Not a submission or anything, just a freak accident. Minor break, i'm not sure of the details of her injury.   This will come into play later.  A few classes later, my teacher has a friend come in and practice with us. A blue belt in akido. He, the teacher, insists I practice with this person, and my hand gets broken during this practice.   I recently found out that the person was the girl's boyfriend. and he broke my hand on purpose.   Is there anything I can do? The true cause of the injury wasn't known until this year.   I know the statute of limitations is up for personal injury, 2 years, but considering that I didn't find out the true cause until recently, would the 'clock' start when I found out this information?   Is there anything I can do legally at this point?	No
156	Hello,  I live in the great state of Colorado, where you can get high legally in more ways than one!  Unfortunately that was not always the case, and in 2009 I received a possession charge.  It's really messing with my job (background checks) and would like to see what options I have.  It seems expunging would only work if I was under 18 (alas I was over 18 at the time) so I think my only option is to 'seal' the record.  I tried to talk to a few lawyers about this, even paid one... the result was just more confusion.  I tried talking to the assistant DA, they were not very helpful either.  It seems I need to wait 10 years, then file a bunch of paperwork, pay some money, and then the state will tell me if the record can be sealed or not...?  Can someone please help me understand the process for getting this sealed?    Thanks!!	No
157	I bought my house with a substantial down payment from my mother. Part of the contingency to that was she was on the deed. So we are joint tenants even though she doesn't live here or even in state. I was not married at the time. I now am and we have two daughters together. My mother is borderline psychotic and I am concerned that if something happens to me before her she will kick out my husband and daughters from our family home.   Can a will override the entire property going to her?  What about her will to her husband if she passes and her will states all her real property pass to him will he inherit half of my home?   What options do I have?	No
158	I bought my first house mid-March of this year in mid-March.  Last week, I went down to my basement to grab something and it was flooded... The ceiling was bowed in and soggy, holding water. I shut off the water to my house and called a plumber, who called a restoration company. I filed with my insurance company and they sent someone out to inspect the damages. Basically an outdoor faucet/pipe froze in the winter (before I moved in) and cracked, which was causing a leak. It destroyed all of the carpet in the basement, and the ceiling is cut out where the water was being held in.   My insurance company informed me that this should be the responsibility of the previous owners to file with their insurance, since it obviously didn't freeze mid-March after I moved in. I contacted their real estate agent who in turn contacted them, and they basically said no.  I let my insurance company know, to which they said that's not really legal and to pursue it to at least to get my deductible covered.   So my advice is how to go about this, where to go, or if it's even worth pursuing. My insurance deductible is $1500 and in total I'm out about $2200 to the plumber and to things that weren't covered by insurance.   Thanks in advance!	No
159	I'm getting ready to file for divorce in Arizona after six years. We agree on everything, already live apart, are friendly, have no children, and the only asset is the house we purchased and own together. I'm keeping the house, and she will file a quit claim deed sometime after the divorce when I'm able to access some funds to give her half of the equity.   I'm going to file the petition, and she is going to complete an Acceptance of Service. We then plan on filing a Consent Decree after the 60 day waiting period. My question is, how do we handle the Response? If she files one, it seems the court automatically schedules an Early Resolution Conference. If she doesn't file, I have to request default which looks to add an additional 4-6 weeks to the process. Is there some other option, or is it one or the other?	No
160	Seattle, WA  My husband and I have lived in this apartment for a little over three years. Our first year's lease was very simple -- just two pages long and pretty boilerplate. When it expired we asked about renewing, but the owner said he was considering extensive renovations and didn't want to extend new leases to anyone just yet. Fine, whatever, it's Seattle, we went month to month. They increased our rent once during the two years we were month to month, but this place is several hundred dollars under market value so it was no big deal.  Fast forward to now and the owners have switched property managers twice. We've been offered a new lease at an increase of $75 per month, up to $1265 (okay) or the option to stay month to month for an increase of $175 per month, up to $1365 (not okay).   The new lease is long, and includes some provisions I've never seen on a lease before. A couple of them make me uncomfortable, because I'm not sure if they're the norm or not.  From the Renter's Obligations: General section:  &gt; To execute all revised rental agreements upon request;  &gt; Not to do or keep anything in or about the Premises that will increase the present insurance rate thereon. Resident agrees to reimburse Owner for any increase that might occur for violation of this rule.  From the Last Month's Rent section:  &gt;Resident paid $1090.00 for last month's rent when the original lease was signed.   As the new lease amount is now $1,265.00, an additional amount of $175.00 is due upon the execution of this renewal.  Are we being paranoid, or are those terms a little sketchy? We've had a good relationship with our landlords and neighbors so far, but we don't want to be held liable for the owner's insurance rates or be forced to sign a new lease every time they want to change a rule.  Maybe worth noting, the new manager seems pretty disorganized. They originally had no record of our cats (who have lived here the whole time and were on our original lease), not a record of us paying our last month's rent when we first moved in (to the tune of $1090, now requesting an additional $175).	No
161	Today while driving a vehicle hit a wooden block that was in his lane and it shot directly into my windshield (did not bounce along the way). I only have liability insurance so will be paying $400 out of pocket on the windshield replacement. Do I have any grounds for seeking reimbursement from the vehicle at fault? They continued on and did not stop but I took photos of their license and have a witness in my vehicle.	No

Is there anything I can add like a disclaimer or something to prevent someone from trying to sue me?"	No
163	"I am in the process of completing drug court. I have no priors before this. I understand that when I finish, the charges will get dismissed. But in the meantime, it required a guilty plea.

I have [read about it online](https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/alabama-employers-may-no-longer-consider-certain-criminal-records) but it's talking about getting records expunged and the only mention of drug court is ""after successful completion of drug court.""  In the meantime, will my charges show up as a conviction on a background check? Can I pay to run a background check on myself and which ones do employers use in this area?

164	"Throwaway because if the people involved read this they will immediately know who I am, and I don't want this linked to my regular user name.  Also, I apologize in advance if there are too many details. I don't know what is relevant.  I live in supportive housing for people with mental illness. They are a registered housing with services provider in the state of Minnesota. I'll call them SH. They provide independent living skills services in my private apartment, provide 24 hour on call services and they also have an office on site. My lease is with the property management company; I'll call them PM.   I paid all of my rent ($700) for the first 11 months that I lived here, then I was approved for Section 8. Now I still pay over half, and Section 8 pays the rest. The rent check is made out to an LLC. PM was the one who did all the paperwork for Section 8.  SH is paid for their services through a CADI waiver through Medical Assistance.  Our building is next to a building that is constantly making being too loud. There is one apartment specifically that the people seem to only be able to communicate by yelling and cursing. I can hear them in my apartment, with all of my windows closed. This happens at least twice a week, often more, during any time it is warm enough for their windows to be open. Sometimes it is obvious they are fighting, when they are screaming that they are going to kill each other. Other times, I am not sure if they just like to communicate by yelling and swearing for all the neighbors to hear. And when they have a party, it really gets loud.  I tolerated it for the first summer because I was told by the staff here when I moved in that I wasn't allowed to call the police without calling them (SH) and that it was annoying but everyone just had to put up with it.  This year I realized that even though I agreed to call SH, that doesn't mean I have to ask for permission to call the police. I just need to tell them I am going to do it. And in a booklet I got with all of my paperwork from Section 8, it talks about MN Statute 504B.205 that says ""A landlord cannot evict, penalize, or limit a tenant's right to call the police or call for emergency assistance in response to a domestic incident or any other situation.""  I could call with a legitimate noise complaint at least twice a week, but I try to drown it out with a white noise machine and headphones. Sometimes it just doesn't work, though. And SH staff have told me that other clients here complain about the noise all the time. There is one staff who has even yelled across towards the building for people to be quiet, but to no avail.  I have ended up calling the police either 4 or 5 times since April (depending on how you count - twice was in one night and they hadn't responded in 4 four hours, because it was an anonymous call, so I called back and left my information.) I always call the non-emergency number, and with the exception of the time they didn't respond, I have always given my information.  Only once has an officer come to talk to me, and that was because I was standing outside. He actually told me to keep calling, that he has dealt with these people before.  Today, one of the managers from the SH came to tell me the calls to the police need to stop. I know they can stop providing me services if I keep calling the police, but I also think I have the right to live in my apartment without hearing the neighbors in a completely different building screaming and cursing.   And since I have a one year lease because Section 8 requires it, I asked SH what would happen if they decide to discontinue services. That's when she told me that she would have to find out, but that PM was going to be having a similar conversation with me. I'm pretty sure that law means he can't evict though, despite SH discontinuing my services???  The other problem I am facing, is if he does evict me, or even doesn't renew my lease. I don't know where I am going to live. My city and the one next to it both very recently passed laws restricting housing with services. In my city, anyone who receives both government rental assistance and supportive housing services can't move into an apartment unless it was previously occupied by someone already meeting both those criteria. I've only lived in supportive housing for about a year and a half, but I've lived in this city for almost 10 years, and my family is here. It is the most convenient and affordable suburb for me for many reasons. And the next closest is the other one that passed a law. The legality of the laws has been questioned, but nobody has challenged it in court yet, so I would either have to move farther away from family, give up my Section 8, or stop receiving services.  I know the obvious answer is to stop calling the police, but when one has PTSD, one can only take so much of certain noises (like death threats.) And it isn't fair to me or the rest of the clients in my building to have to listen to that just because we are afraid of losing our housing! I feel like the appropriate ones to lose their housing are the ones with legitimate noise complaints against them, not the ones complaining about the noise.  Any advice at all would be welcome."	No
165	"Hello,    We just received a certified letter from our rental company stating that our payment was ""dishonored by [my] financial institution."" They are now demanding an additional ~$150 in fees. When we called the number on the letter, we were prompted to leave a voicemail. I left my details along with the confirmation number we had received with the payment confirmation email. We then contacted the customer service for the rental company and the rep stated that it had been denied for ""insufficient funds"" while the website states it was denied for ""closed account.""     1) I have $800 in privilege pay, so if I hadn't had the funds (I did), my checking account would have gone negative to pay the rent.    2) The website deleted our saved account information so I cannot even verify the account number I used to make the transaction. All I have is the last 4 of my account number per the confirmation email, which I verified is correct.    3) The letter demands these fees be paid within 12 days or we will be taken to court. While we can pay these fees, this is not our error as we had the confirmation email stating the payment was made.     4) My checking account does NOT reflect that any attempt to retrieve the funds was made, however. I called to confirm this and the rental company didn't pull out any money. The funds are still sitting there.      5) No one called us to state there was an issue with the payment. We assumed all was well as we had the confirmation email and figured it would take the typical 3-4 business days. I reasoned that with the holiday last week, things would be delayed a bit.    6) We used my checking account for the first time instead of my fiancé's (his has never had any issue before). This is the only difference, but it still made us input the account number twice and routing number once when we entered the information initially.       Questions I have: Are we responsible for these fees? Does it seems suspicious to anyone else that both of our saved bank accounts were deleted from the system so we cannot even confirm the account number from which funds were supposed to be drawn out from? We have not been able to get in contact with the woman who issued the letter (from the collections department), and the customer service line was of no help."	No
166	I'm living in Philadelphia, Pa currently in a home with five people. Three of them are on the lease but me and another girl are not because we do not meet the requirements of the rental company, but everything split five ways is cheap so good for us.  We just had the paperwork signed for one more year starting Aug 1st but it seems that the nonsigned girl and this other dude had some sort of recent fight or something and he came to me saying he wanted to kick her out. She lives in the basement which is not particularly marketable for various reasons and its very unlikely that we could get a new tenant before the first so I objected on a number of moral grounds to be sure but primarily a financial decision: I can't afford for rent to go up that much.  He is now threatening to have me removed as well. Pretty BS now that I would barely have ten days to get everything together. I believe the other two people on the lease would object to this so my question is: With the support of the majority of the leasees can I block getting kicked out? If I can't is there anything I can legally do?  I'd rather not have to do anything about this but I'm a truck driver and my hometime is so limited that I'm afraid I have to treat this a valid threat on my living situation and not just as words said in anger. Thank you for any and all advice.	No
167	"Hi,   We are moving, and we notified our landlord that we would like to be present for the move out inspection via certified mail with the required 15 days prior notice.  According to Maryland law, the landlord has to ""upon receipt"" notify us of the date of the inspection to take place either 5 days before or 5 days after the move out.     We are moving out on the 31st, so we are in the window. I can't find anything other than ""upon receipt"" for how much notice the landlord has to give us, but I am worried that they are going to try and notify me the day before.  Do I have any defense here?   Additionally, the state AG says their response has to be via certified mail to me and I have nothing from them. They called last night, but I have asked that they email me and handle everything in writing.    Because they have waited 12 days from receiving my letter, have they violated ""upon receipt""?"	No
168	"My wife, 1 year old and I recently moved into a house for rent in Pennsylvania. The landlord is an older man who owns multiple single family homes that he rents out in the area. Before signing the lease we informed him (in person) that we have a two dogs (70 lbs Goldendoodle and a 15 lbs mini weiner dog). At the time of the lease signing he had no issues with allowing the dogs to live in the house. Within the lease it includes that two dogs are allowed to live in the house with us. We never tried to hide the size of the larger dog and even made sure twice that he was aware of his size.   On the day of moving in the landlord expressed concern (without ever seeing the dog) that he wasn't sure if he wanted the dogs in the house (he said this to my wife as I was at work). Today, he showed up to the house to ""trim the hedges"" while we were not at home. My very well behaved and friendly, but protective dog was barking at the landlord through the back door. The landlord promptly called my wife saying that he does not want the dog in the house anymore and we are meeting this Sunday to talk about options in regards to the dog. When I called him back he said that he was afraid the dog was going to ""come out the window after him"" and was ""scratching the door"". I know my dog and all he does is bark and look out the window at strangers. I checked the metal door and there are no scratches on it at all, not even dirt marks.   The advice I am looking for is can he force me to remove the dog from the house. The lease was signed by my wife, the landlord and myself. The dogs were written in the lease that they were allowed to be on the premises. The lease also says that verbal changes are not authorized and that only what is written in the lease is legally binding. If he tries to force me to remove the dog (which I will not do as he is part of the family) can he evict us for that? If he does, am I legally entitled to get my deposit/first month rent refunded? Also, could I demand that he pays for any moving fees that I accrue if I do have to move out.   I do have access to a group legal through my employer. Would it be worth contacting an attorney if he tries to force us out of the house?   Thank you for your advice and I apologize for the choppy/bad writing."	No
169	I'm a victim in a domestic violence case. Ex boyfriend punched me in 2013, so an order of protection was placed. He contacted me a few months later via phone. He did 90 days for the assault and criminal contempt 2nd in 2014. 2015 he violated again for calling me and being at my house. He got 1-3 Yrs upstate for aggravated family offense and criminal contempt 1st. He got out on parole last year and is currently still on it. He violated by calling me again in April. This time they charged him with a misdemeanor and RORed him. How is that possible ? He's already had 3 court dates and RORed each one. No d.a contacted me until today, the day before his next court date and told me its because he wasn't in my house this time ? I have a full stay away it doesn't make sense and isk what to do. He's never going to stop :-( help ...btw I have the entire call log as well as texts from that day but I didn't mention the texts in the initial police report.	No
170	Re uploaded to place state in title  Throwaway account here, if only because the obvious sensitive nature of the topic and I don't wish to air someone's dirty laundry in a way that could link to them.   My wife and I have a happy marriage and a 6 year old son, and her parents live with us in our home in Texas. Due to some medical issues that should have kept ANY kids from being possible, my wife had to have a hysterectomy at a relatively early age. We always wanted to adopt a second child and recently have been doing the research on what the requirements are in our state. One of the requirements, of course, is a background check for everyone in the family (I'm not sure if they mean just in the house or everyone genetically linked to you), which makes sense. But it raises my worry about something.   My father in law is a convicted sex offender. Now, I mean that legally speaking in that he has to go and register his location and all that, but my wife told me this early on in our relationship. According to my wife's family he was caught up in this witch hunt back in the early 90's with these two kids who lied about a whole bunch of shit and he decided to take a plea deal instead of dragging his family through the hell of a trial. Not the choice I would have made but it is what it is and I don't know what I'd have done under those circumstances.   I believed my wife and her family when this was told to me years ago, and after being around the man for almost 7 years I haven't had a single moment to the contrary to shake that. He may have his flaws, but if I thought he had ever touched kids like that I wouldn't let him live in the same roof as my son. The issue is this: would his status on the registry prevent my wife and I from being able to adopt as long as they live with us, if at all?  Thanks.	No
171	The situation: Kelly rents an apartment and her boyfriend, Matt, moves in the next week. Matt is not on the lease for three years. Year 4 they sign the lease together. Year 5.5, after they renew the lease, they break up. Who gets the apartment?	No
172	My wife served me with divorce papers last weekend. I have 30 days to file a response with the court in the county that she lives in.   My quick question is: when they say 'file a response with the court', does that mean I have to go in person, or can I mail it in? It'd take me three hours each way to get to the courthouse, so I'd rather not go there in person if I can avoid it.   Court is Washington County, Oregon.	No
173	This is for a friend of mine in Mississippi. He started a month to month lease in a condo that included water and electricity in the rent. Within a week or two or him living there it was sold to someone else who decided they want to live in it. They told him he needs to leave asap (within a few days) and they're not gonna pay for water or electricity anymore. Some googling seems to show they have to give him a 30 day notice but we're not sure if they still have to provide water and electricity for those 30 days.	No
174	My brother and I recently created a card game (it's awesome). We were wondering the best way of going about protecting the game itself as well as the images and logos used in the game. We have also used stylized drawings of world leaders (not referring to specific images) which our research shows is fine but please let us know if you know otherwise. We have had the prototype printed which I believe gives us immediate copyright. Please let us know what is the best way to go about this. Thank you.	No
175	"Hi,  I live on a second floor flat in London. A few months ago we had a party and some cigarette butts were dropped over our balcony into our downstairs neighbour's garden. They were absolutely furious, we apologised, and let them know it wouldn't happen again.  This morning I received this text from our landlord:  ""Hi, I've had another email complaining about more cigarettes being thrown into the neighbours garden and this time they are about to call a solicitor and possibly confiscate the flat from me. I've spoken to the lady at the council and she says the only way to avoid the solicitor getting involved is to issue you a final warning saying if it happens again I have to evict you. I am going to put this in an email (and cc her in), I just thought I'd let you know in advance. I would strongly suggest not letting anyone smoke on the balcony at all in future as they are obviously taking the matter extremely seriously.  Thanks.""  We do not smoke and none of us have even been on the balcony in the last week. This must have been from people in one of the flats above, but they are clearly convinced it's us.  Should I be concerned? What's the best course of action?  Thanks in advance for your help."	No
176	Posting for a friend since she doesn't fully understand Reddit. My friend is from Mississippi and struggling with depression and a recent suicide attempt. In an attempt to help herself and get better, she made an agreement (not in writing) with her mother and stepfather that they would look after her child, while she moved temporarily to Alabama to live with her father while she's working.  Recently she drove back to Mississippi to visit her child but her mother wouldn't allow her to see her child. An incident occurred where the police were called and she was told they couldn't keep her from the child, and if she needed them to they could go get her child for her. She elected not to do this because she felt it would traumatic to the child. She went back to Alabama without seeing her child.  Today, her mother emailed her father [this](http://imgur.com/a/qfvW8) and told him to print out page 6, have her sign it and get it notarized and then faxed back to her mother. My friend was not given the rest of the document until she pressed for it. Now her mother is telling her to sign and notarize the document and if she tries to take the child from them, she'll never see him again. She has text messages of this.  So what should my friend do? I told her to cease communication with her mother until she gets a lawyer and have all correspondence be between the lawyers. But she says she can't afford a lawyer and her mother knows that. Apparently her mother has hired one of the best in the state or something. I've linked her to lawhelp.com. She has not signed the affidavit, and refuses to. But she is scared that her mother and stepfather are trying to take her child away from her. What legal recourse does she have? Please feel free to ask questions and I'll try to respond in a timely manner to clarify anything.	No
177	I just moved to Utah about two months ago and I have a temporary housing arrangement. I signed a lease for early August in an apartment complex. The management, through some internal mishap, accidentally accepted a late request from the current residents for a short term extension on their lease, through late August. I have already signed and committed movers to come cross country to deliver my furniture, and my temporary housing arrangement will not go through late August. The management offered a remedy. We could keep my move in date, but put me in a smaller apartment. This smaller apartment is on the top floor and is slightly more expensive (1150 instead of 1110/mo) than the one we signed before. They would keep my rent at 1110, and would give me 3 weeks free rent, which is general promotion that they have on that floor plan at the moment. I’m usually happy to accept a concession like this in exchange for a blunder. Unfortunately, this smaller apartment won’t fit the furniture that I already own and is already getting shipped in, so it’s not a good option for me. The management has framed the situation as if I have two options that are both bad for me - to either accept their remedy or push back my move-in date. If I push back my move-in date, I will have to find temporary housing for a few weeks (Airbnb, hotel?) and possibly short term storage for the things I’ve acquired here in Utah. I’ll also have to change my already-committed plans with the movers who are shipping my furniture cross-country at a cost I don’t yet know. I have one resolution that would be good for me. I signed for their largest 1-bedroom floor plan, and I know their smallest 2-bedroom floor plan (1250-1300/mo) is available with basically the same layout, with an extra bedroom bolted on. That alternative is the closest they have that is at least as large as what we agreed to. Obviously my furniture will fit there, and I don’t need the extra space but could make use of it, and it would work. If I push for that apartment, what would be a fair way to distribute the additional cost? Does anyone have any advice? I’m not sure what is reasonable here. What are my rights and what are their obligations? What is the best way to bring up this third alternative? Are there other things I should know? I’m going to talk with them in person in a few hours. TL;DR Apartment management bungled our signed lease. My lease is 1110/mo. The cost of the smaller apartment offered as remedy that won’t work for me is 1150 (with 3 weeks free - a general incentive they have at the moment - and leased at 1110). The value of the smallest apartment they have available that is at least as large as what I signed for is ~1250-1300. What is fair here, and how should I proceed?	No
178	Hi! A little history, my parents divorced in high school and I am now in my thirties. Mom has no desire to find another partner, however my Dad has been married again, divorced, and then gotten back with the same woman again (after demolishing half of his 401k and assets to her) and broken up for a third time.   He is on dialysis but healthy otherwise: vegan, organic;  coming from being an abusive Alcoholic.   After retiring, the thought of his on and off again wife never coming back passed, and he joined match.com  He informed me tonight that he has met a beautiful woman. So I ask for details and pictures. He sends two pictures of a woman that seems to be much younger than him. She is apparently 60 and he is 69. I doubt the validity of that though.  He said he is picking her up from the airport next week after being abroad finalizing an inheritance. I think all of this is fishy and tell him that he really needs to know about squatting laws and tenant laws before inviting this woman into his house. He mentioned her having an apartment in a neighborhood near him but i think that is just smoke.   What references should I link him to to prepare or should he just talk to a lawyer?   Tdlr: dad met suspicious woman online. How can he protect himself from fraud if he is adamant about pursuing it?    We are in Texas.   What can my dad do to prevent fraud or a crazy trying to manipulate him?	No
179	The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	No
180	"I need help. Throughout the month of July, I found it pretty difficult to breathe in my apartment. I thought maybe it was due to my nose surgery about a year ago (after stupid accident). I found it odd that I hadn't had any nose complications until then, but I figured a bone had suddenly moved or something.   A week ago, I woke up and it was surprisingly easy to breathe. It was great. There was some construction going on outside my apartment, but I thought nothing of it. A few hours later and they were still working. I wondered how long it would be - a day long project or weeks? So I called my landlord and asked what they were doing. He just said they were ""fixing something with the gas"". He was also surprised to hear that I was already back from visiting my parents.   This whole week I've been able to breathe normally. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but do you think the gas issue had anything to do with my difficulty breathing? I don't have knowledge about different kinds of residential gases that can affect breathing. The only one I can think of is carbon monoxide and if that was the issue, wouldn't my landlord have had to evacuate everyone? Are there any other types of gasses or lack thereof that would have caused my landlord to have to dig through the concrete to replace some of the gas lines? My apartment is right above the area where they were fixing things. I'm on the second floor and my apartment is basically an overhang above the concrete walkway. So if there was a leak or something I guess it could affect me more than others? Possibly? Idk.   For two days after construction, I had headaches - the same pounding headaches I get when the air pressure changes (like on a plane). I could finally breathe, but I had headaches. Now, a week after the gas line replacement I feel great.   Could this all be just pure coincidence? Any advice would be appreciated.    Also, do I have the right to know exactly what the issue was? My landlord seemed vague when I asked. Is he required to tell me? Location is the state of New York."	No
181	"So basically my girlfriend just signed her lease and we were super excited about the place (I'm not living with her) and so we went to visit it tonight and there was this super sketchy guy (tenant) across from her door.   His door is directly across in a small hallway and it's nearly 5 feet away. Anyways, he just gave me the worst vibes, this guy had sunglasses on at 8pm, a cutoff, middle aged, and just had a creepy overall feel to him. He kept talking to himself and just looked like someone who isn't in the right mind.   Anyways I peeped my head out the door and said ""what's up"" and he just looked at me super weird with his sunglasses and paused for 10 seconds just staring at me and said, ""I'm sucking on my daddy"" and laughed and walked away. Then yelled, ""my suga daddy"" and ran off.   Is there anyone to break this lease?"	No
182	I recently quit a debt collection company.  When I was hired roughly 6 months ago they made me sign an employment contract for 1 year with the term that if my employment ceased before the terms of the contract that i would owe the company an amount of money that would diminish over the course of the contract. I just got my final paycheck and it has a letter saying that I still owe them an amount to buy-out my contract and gives the remaining amount due.   The letter also says that authorized per the employment agreement and allowed by federal and state laws, that they reduced my pay for the final 2 paychecks to minimum wage and applied to the amount I owed (they sent both of my final pay periods on once check for some reason or another)  I was wondering what I should do next and if this contract itself has any legal weight. I asked when signing the contract and upon leaving if I could see or get a copy of the contract and I was denied.  So as to the specifics of the contract I'm not really sure what it says. I also know that employers can garnish your wages but I though they had to notify you and go through the legal process first.  I live in the state of Nebraska  (This is my first post so please be gentle)	No
183	A vehicle was stopped in the road. He then began driving very slowly. I decided to cross the double yellow line and pass him. Lucky for me a cop saw me and ticketed me. I explained he was driving like an asshole but she said it was a no passing zone. I want to plead not guilty as I can just barely afford the $170 ticket. Any professional input is much appreciated!	No
184	Is this legal and if not, how do I challenge it?  I'm checking my lease and we were responsible for quarterly pest control.    However, they did not deduct this from the security deposit.  They refunded us that and then today emailed us saying we owe them a little over $100 for a roach treatment.	No
185	Occasionally the safe will be short at work. Last night it was short $100. The GM said that since they have no way of knowing who did it each employee who worked yesterday must hand over $15 or else they will be terminated for theft. Is this legal?    Edit: I am in Arkansas	No
186	My wife and I rent a small one bedroom home from her uncle, which shares a back yard on the same lot or two lots connected. My wife has some mental health issues that prevents her from working currently and last month is brutal and had a lot of things hit us hard and we were late on rent quite a bit. I talked to him and he made everything sound like it was okay.  I was messaged on facebook about the new lease even though our current lease doesn't end til November. He states that we must keep the attic window open from spring till fall or its a 200 fine per month. Anything left on my porch is $25 fine, she must park on the street and not use the three car spot on the lot. If our dog uses the yard to pee or poop its a $25 per incident. all of which end with can lead to eviction. I can't leave the property for more than 2 days with out written notification. Which I assume is part of his insurance clause. Also rent goes up in jan according to the new lease, and each day its late prior to the increase is $5 and $10 after increase per day after the 1st. In the original lease we had until the 5th before it was due. I am sure its all because of last months drama which I was hoping a close family member would have understood what I was going through trying to keep my wife alive.   The attic window is kinda insane to me, I get the theory behind it but we don't have insulation in the attic nor any moisture barrier and it just seems like in bringing an excess of moisture which is bad for electronics and other things. Maybe I am out of line.   I can't afford to move, and I will abide by his requests it just seems far fetched in some areas as if its more of a trap than anything.  Any ideas of this is all legal or is he over reaching in some areas?  Thank you kindly.	No
187	So I signed a lease last week on a 1 bedroom apartment. The agreement states that the lease starts on August 11th. She assured me that the tenant would be out and I could move in. However, she called me telling me that the current tenant is waiting for his new apartment to be ready and won't be out until the end of August. She also said his lease is until October but that she was letting him out early which is why she had me sign a lease for August. I paid $100 for my application and signed the lease. She called to inform me that I couldn't move in on the 11th, she had no definitive date on his moving out but said it would be late August and if I wanted my 100 dollars back she could get it to me. However, I told her I'd wait for now. I found a new place in the meantime and told her that I need to cancel my lease and get my $100 back since I couldn't even move in on the date that the lease specified. Is there something in writing I can get saying that the lease is canceled? She said she'd try to get my 100 bucks back but I want to make sure before I sign the lease at the other apartment.	No
188	"I currently live in a nice 3br/2ba home. I am subleasing my room from ""Liz"" who is the sole tenant on the lease. Every month, I pay her my share of the rent and she pays our landlady. Our lease is up August 1st, at which point we all agreed to be out. I had arranged to move in somewhere else for August 1st. ""Liz"" and my other roommate (also subleasing) haven't lived in the house since June, because they felt the area was unsafe/ too busy. ""Liz"" has been paying her share of the rent, whereas my other roommate found a summer subletter. We all planned to be out August 1st and have been in regular communication about this fact. Four days ago, Liz tells me that I need to be out on July 29th, because she wants to leave town early (moving to another state for August 1st) and the landlady won't let me do the walk through by myself, because I am just subleasing. This has been a major inconvenience. I had scheduled to move the morning of August 1st and spend the weekend preparing my move. Additionally, my new landlord had to shift some things around to let me in three days early. I will be paying him prorated for those extra three days. Because, this was such a major inconvenience and because I already paid for a full month, should I request that Liz reimburses me for those last three days? This would only be about $60, but it would help with moving costs, etc. Additionally, this is not the first time Liz has pulled a stunt like this (a few months ago she listed our house to try and find new tenants for May 1st without speaking to me first because she wanted to move). We resolved our issues on that front, but now she blindsides me again. I'm generally easygoing, but think it's only fair she reimburses me for bending over backwards for her! Thoughts?"	No
189	"Apologies in advance, there's a lot going on and we've only just found out about this.  My grandmother (father's side) has slowly had her Alzheimer's get worse and worse.  Back in 2005, she was worried that she was starting to ""lose it"", and signed power of attorney over to my father in case it was actually Alzheimer's and not just her getting older.  I've checked the county clerk of courts website, and I see the document there granting power of attorney to my father.  About 3 years ago (2014-ish), my Uncle and my Aunt (and possibly other extended family) told my father that they convinced her to switch Power of Attorney over to them.    My father asked my Grandma if this was true, to which she replied yes.  Dad takes that as his cue to stay out of it from here on out.  At that point, my Aunt started living with my Grandmother.  My aunt has multiple felony drug convictions.  I would bet my house that she's been stealing from my grandmother since she moved in, but that isn't relevant to the question, sorry.    Fast forward to two weeks ago, and grandma is in really bad shape.  Almost non-responsive.  A different family member took her to see the family doctor who immediately admits her for dehydration and malnutrition.  She is now (as of late last week) in a senior care facility.  Monday of this week, another concerned family member got online and did some digging on the county clerk of courts site, and there are no records of Grandma signing Power of Attorney over to my Uncle or Aunt.  There are also no records of any Guardianship applications.  Dad realizes he's probably been lied to, purposefully by aunt and uncle (who have again almost assuredly been stealing her social security money) and almost assuredly unknowingly by my Grandmother.  My question is, had my Uncle actually filed for power of attorney, or for guardianship, would there be a record of that on the county clerk of courts website?  This was again supposedly a couple years back, not like last week where it wouldn't be updated.  Dad is now meeting with the current home, who was told not to allow him or my mother to make any decisions about Grandma by my Aunt / Uncle, to show them the 2005 documents.  They intend to move her to a better facility closer to them so that they can help.   I guess I'm just wondering if we're getting our hopes up?  Uncle and Aunt are obviously a mess, and we want to do what's best for Grandma, but we were under the impression (and that's on us for not checking) that Dad was no longer in control.  Also, if my dad still does have power of attorney, how can we get Grandma's financial information so that we can see how much they have been stealing from her, and make sure that her social security money gets used for her care?"	No
190	The mom and I broke up before she was even born. Since then, the mom has battled substance abuse problems so that is why she resides with her uncle. My name is not on her birth certificate. I just really want to gradually become a part of her life. Recently, I reached out to the uncle and he was not supportive of it. However, I don't want to give up and I feel that I have so much to offer her. Any advice?	No
191	"So i live in a end unit townhouse in northern VA with another couple with our own fenced in backyard. I own a 15 year old dog who is both deaf and mostly blind. I received a somewhat threatening email today from our landlady...  (I had a chance to go to the house today to see what ""blank"" had cut down.  I was disappointed to find that, again, the yard is FULL of dog waste. Please let dog owner know this MUST STOP!  If there were no yard at all, she would be walking the dog with a bag ready to collect its poop per County code.  Why does she feel it is ok to leave the waste in a small yard where you all live if it is not ok to leave it in the streets or sidewalks???  I don't get it...I would think it would be in your best interests, and everyone else's to have the waste collected...  Please let her know I mean it...this has got to stop. This was one of the prerequisites to our renting the house to you with the dog...remember?It is disgusting to see, not to mention a major attraction for rats. Do you want rats around there?)  My wife and i were caught completely off guard because we pick up the yard once a week and maintain the yard per the lease agreement, even going so far as to finished jobs that were started before the last tenants left but not yet finished. Her husband has come over several times and spent time in the backyard and never said a thing. We went home to check our yard and found maybe 5 spots where my dog had used the restroom but we had not yet picked up since returning from vacation. To call is ""full of dog poop"" is a gross over exaggeration.   We checked out lease again to make sure we did not miss a section pertaining to picking up after our dog once a day. The lease states that we must dispose of waste in a timely manner. I do not understand the point of getting a closed in yard used only by our home with a dog and getting what i perceive as a threat from the Landlady.  Is it possible she can have us evicted if we don't pick up after our dog every single time in our own backyard?"	No
