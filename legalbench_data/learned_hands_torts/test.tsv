0	Long story short when I was younger my mother cheated on my father with a new man who would do drugs together with my mom and abuse her right infront of me. My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway.   What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all. Like get some sort of financial compensation, and move far away.	Yes
1	Hello,  The company I am having issues with are holding my account that I have them under certain restrictions (one of which is quite serious, money related) due to a claim of theirs to which I do not agree. They want to video interview me over the internet. Not sure why they wanted to do that but there is no such thing explicitly written in their ToS. I find this rather intrusive regarding my privacy, not to mention unprofessional and quite barbaric. And no, there have been no reports of any sort of fraudulent activity on my account that I know of, my track of record is excellent there, and they have already verified my account about 8 years ago. The company is based in California, USA, I am based in the EU, Romania.  Are there any USA / EU / international laws protecting my privacy over the internet that I could enforce upon them ? Do I stand a fair chance of winning such a lawsuit ?  Thank you	Yes
2	"Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18.  - What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?  According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case. - Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?  So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
3	This is probably a waste of time, but I wanted to ask.  My mom and my brother traveled with Greyhound last week Thursday. They had never taken a bus before and tried to maneuver it the best they could. The person working the front desk refused to put a label on two of her items -- two plain cardboard boxes that contained medical records, a bag, school supplies, and toiletries. They swore up and down the luggage would arrive in our city. Well, shocked, it did not arrive.  The real issue here is the customer service is outrageously awful. We've been hung up on, laughed at, and we were given a claim number that doesn't work. It's a 30 minute wait to reach a person and then they transfer you again.  Their compensation policy only offers $250. These items are worth more than that, and were almost certainly lost by the employees who checked them in. It was either never placed on the bus or removed.   Is there anything we can do at this point? Can we sue them? Is there anyway to get in touch with someone at the very top of the hierarchy?	Yes
4	Hi,  My boyfriend and I live together in a neighborhood with an HOA. My boyfriend is blind, and takes our dog to the park every day, which is in the center of our community.  Our neighborhood does not have sidewalks or curbs, it just has road which turns into grass. In the past, they dug a large 4ft by 4ft hole in the middle of the road and only had 4 tiny cones, one on each corner, to mark the area. My boyfriend fell into the hole and luckily didn't hurt himself. I contacted the HOA and told them, and asked if they could please use taller cones slightly outside of the perimeter, and some type of caution tape so my boyfriend would hit that with his cane before physically falling into the hole. They apologized and did this.  Today I got a text from him that he fell into a different hole. This one was right on the edge of the road, they dug up the corner of the park area 4 feet either way, and about 3 feet deep. Absolutely no parking whatsoever. It was filled completely with water because we had heavy rain yesterday.  What can we do? Are they allowed to do this? I don't want to sue anyone, I just want to know if they're required to mark construction in a certain way or not, and if they're doing it wrong I'd like to ask them to make sure it's marked correctly in the future.  His cane catches a lot of things but it doesn't catch everything.  Thanks for any help you can offer, thanks.	Yes
5	I was involved in an at-fault accident recently.  This is my first accident, and hopefully my last.  The cop told me he needs to prove to the insurance company that it was not the other guy's fault.  He wrote me a ticket for failing to maintain a safe distance.  Couldn't he have acknowledged that this was not the other driver's fault in a police report, but not issue me a ticket?	Yes
6	"We live on a lake in North Carolina where a development is going in across the street. Our driveway is directly across from one of the entrances to this new subdivision, which is mostly finished except for maybe 20 or so houses on the side of the subdivision closest to us. We had about 2.25 inches of rainfall in an hour or so yesterday which lead to a very large amount of silt deposited in our flower beds, in front of our garage door (some inside the garage), around the back of the house under our deck, etc etc. A large amount of debris traveled with the water and much of our mulch has been carried away.  As far as I can tell, the rainwater washed into the development's street, past the silt fences, quickly clogged the storm drains (because of the silt catchers they place in the drains), and then ran straight down the street, across the road between our house and the subdivision, and then down our driveway. I ran into the developer today who fed me a line about the gas company destroying the silt fence and not fixing it properly and how he's going to see if they'll fix it and clean up the silt for us. He was very clear that he's not going to take responsibility for the runoff because ""it was a 1,000-year rain that won't happen again"", and apparently other houses had mulch washed away (which I see no evidence of). He's going to send his guys out to start cleaning up the silt, but he won't pay for any landscaping because the water would have done that anyway. Which, of course, is complete BS because the silt clogged the storm drains. It seems to us, based on previous storms, that the installed drainage is not sufficient to deal with the runoff created by the subdivision. Whether or not it will get better once all of the houses are built and grass starts to grow, I can't say.   I would greatly appreciate some guidance on where to go from here? Contact our home insurer? Contact the county? There has to be a precedent for this.  Thank you."	Yes
7	tldr; Someone came into my apt 3 separate times this week and stole varying amounts of candy each time. Apartment may have same locks and key for various units.  Kansas City, MO.  First off, let me start off with how my apartment building works. This is a fob entry building and you need a fob to get off any floor except the lobby. Which is why I believe it to be someone that lives in the building, namely my neighbor.  I have a roommate and we live in a small 2BR/2BA with a small entry way and living room. It's 6 regular steps to our living room, 14 to the kitchen, 15 and 17 to our rooms. I just want to show you how small it is. I came home Sunday from a 1 month trip visiting home while my roommate stayed here by herself. We have a candy bowl that I put candy in for guests and for ourselves.   I come home and see it's half full. Two days later, it's completely empty except for two pieces of candy. I ask my roommate what she did with it all, that's a lot of candy. She said she didn't touch it and her bf didn't touch it. We're both kind of freaked out but think it's stupid that anyone would come in and steal candy and nothing else. I chalk it up to a memory lapse or maybe I have carbon monoxide poisoning and did it, etc etc. I still called the front desk to let them know it was happening and refilled the candy bowl with reese's cups and hershey's kisses. I also talked to my next door neighbor and asked if he saw or heard anything recently. He said no, sorry, and closed the door. We just used a door jammer where even if unlocked, the door cannot be forced in. My 200lb brother couldn't even bust through it. I locked the doors and door jammed it every night until Thursday night, when I completely forgot to jam it.   I wake up Friday morning to go to work and all the bright, orange reese's are gone. I freak out, wake up my roommate and tell her to stop fucking with me cause it's not funny anymore. She told me she was awake all night until 5am, there's no way someone came in. Then she asked me if I woke up around 3am and I said no. She had heard someone in the living room/kitchen but thought it was me getting a snack. We call the front desk again and I head off to work around 9am.   My roommate heads off to work around 1pm and I got home around 3:30pm. Once again, the candy jar is completely empty except for the first two pieces they left the first time they stole our candy. So now they've escalated to daytime stealing. That is where I am left off night. Nothing has happened over the weekend. I called the police to report it over the phone but they want to physically come out and do a report. I went out of town and wasn't able to do it and my roommate worked all weekend. We also don't want to spook the thief because I really want to catch who is doing this. It's really freaking creepy and psychotic to just come in someones home to steal candy, just to fuck with us.   I believe it is the teenage boy because he is only 13, can't drive, and is on summer break. He also isn't the sweetest kid ever. I've seen him throw things and yelling racist obscenities at street walkers for no reason (we share the same window wall).  I had believed that perhaps someone has a masterkey or were picking our locks but my roommate actually talked to a tenant on our floor. The tenant said that when she first moved in, her key worked on three other units. I have already contacted the owner of my unit and let him know what was up and that he needs to come change my locks.  So, my problem is two part: this must be some sort of negligence/ security issue to have same lock for multiple units and how do I go about get this thief in jail or juvie. I am afraid that he will escalate from petty stealing to something worse. I don't want anyone else caught up in this after I move out. I am already hoping to do a stakeout tonight with my gopro recording as well as sleeping in the living room.   Thanks for sticking with the story and I apologize for my terrible writing. Any advice would be great, thanks!	Yes
8	"I'm 50 years old.  After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.  Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.  My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.  Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.  I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.  Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.  Thanks very much for any advice you can give."	Yes
9	Last year I was sexually assaulted at a school dance. I don't want to give details I just want a black and white response.  The school nurse and the principle encouraged me not to press charges. I didn't want to tell my parents but now I have and they want to do something about it.  Do i have any legal leg to stand on?	Yes

11	"So yesterday I was mowing the lawn and looked around the other side of the fence and noticed that my neighbor had installed kayak racks without my permission. They're storing two kayaks hanging off of my wood fence. The fence is inside my property line, and they don't have a fence that is tied into it. I confronted the neighbor as he was coming around the side of the house and asked them not to attach things to my fence without my permission. They apologized and gave me some BS story that they ""forgot"" to ask me and said they would take it down. What recourse do I have in this matter? Thanks."	Yes
12	"My ex who I have been friends with is dating someone new. She tried to befriend me a year ago and I was nice to her. She gave me a bunch of clothes she didn't want and then much later asked for them back but since they were mine I gave them away. She's now saying I stole from her.   My ex gave me 1600 dollars a year ago when my family had a huge rough patch and he and I have no contract of this and he knows I'll pay him back as I earn it but now the new girlfriend is stating she can get me for 1600 dollars.  She's been sending me messages for a year and I've repeatedly asked her to stop and she doesn't. Sometimes I would respond but when I realized she was harassing me I told her to stop and asked my Ex to ask her to quit.   Two days ago I asked my ex a question through text and he ignored me and then I got a text from the girlfriend threatening me. I texted my ex very angrily stating I can't believe he would let someone else talk for him instead of just answering me. It was a low point of very angry texts but not threats. The next day he responds to me like nothing happened.   Now the new girlfriend is rep steely threatening me with her aunt who is a lawyer stating she has ""stuff I stole from her"" and my exes 1600 dollars I owe plus emotional damages that she could put against me. I've been in tears all day wondering if I'm going to end up in jail or with charges. I don't have records of all the harassing messages she sent over the last year because I gave a new phone so it seems like their case could be in their favor since I can't prove how she was harassing me. I have no idea what to do. My family says to ignore her and that she has nothing against me. Please help."	Yes
13	"Is it illegal to lie about your name and gender, and claim that photos found online are ""you"" in order to receive nudes?  Everyone over 18. Photos were not shared or sold to anyone else."	Yes
14	"So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I'm in a relationship with this person. So yeh this is your typical, revenge porn or nonconsensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
15	"I'm in Denver, Colorado. My wife and I moved into a great condo building that we fell in love with. We had been warned that some of the residents were cranky or gossipy but we figured it couldn't be that bad.   The building was built in the late '70s and something like 40% of the peeps still there are original owners. Slowly it's changing over to young families and younger people overall but there seem to be a lot that hate to see anything change. Some families have been hassled since ""kids shouldn't be here"", things like that. Dogs as pets are not allowed in the building.   I have an emotional support dog. I submitted my doctor's note to the office, he's got his vest and everything and the HOA even gave us a little official tag to clip to his collar that shows our documentation was provided and he's allowed to be there. The HOA has been great. Told us to tell them if anyone was being a jerk and even put an article in the monthly newsletter reminding residents that there are service animals in the building, that they are allowed, and showing their pictures and names so people would know.   Despite this, there are several people who have become very verbally aggressive. Shouting at us that he doesn't belong here and calling the office to say he (and us) need to be kicked out. The office shuts it down but my wife and I are tired of being stressed every time we have to go out. Thank goodness for the dog because our anxiety levels are off the charts right now.   My wife wants to sue some of these people for harassment but I'm wondering if having a lawyer draw up a Cease and Desist letter might do the trick? If one gets it they'll all hear about it and my hope is that people will stop shouting at us. I'm nervous that someone is going to try to injure or poison my dog. I know CO is a one-party consent state, should I just start recording people? I have no clue what the best course of action is in a situation like this.   Thanks in advance and please let me know if more details are needed."	Yes
16	"I was rear-ended. As a result I several herniated and bulging disc. The only treatment I got from the ortho was prescriptions (anti-inflammatory) stuff. I refused the spine injections (freaks me out. I rather deal with the pain). I wanted to wrap this up last time I saw him (month 3). He says ""you should keep coming settlement will be larger if you come more"". The visits are literally 5 minutes. Is this true or is the guy trying to milk me for bills? Also in Florida."	Yes
17	There is a video of a woman, who is antireligious, drawing a picture of Muhammad.  And in the comments there was  a guy who found her address where she lives, and another man wrote 3 days ago that he is going to her address to address kill her because she drew the cartoon.  Im from Scandinavia, and i dont know how to report this to the police in LA. Maybe im overdramatic, but eeeh... am i really? For some reason i think this is quite important to report. Any tips?	Yes
18	"My father was insured under Medicare and was diagnosed with diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis by his ""primary physician"" (which is basically a group of nurse practitioners) back in August-October 2016. They took x-rays and claimed that the mass in his right lung was due to his lung slowly hardening from pulmonary fibrosis. My father's condition grew worse over the next couple months and my mother requested for him to be admitted to the ER for further examination. They denied my father this opportunity because they said his condition ""wasn't severe enough."" They led my father to believe that his drastic weight loss was from diabetes and that his breathing issues derived from pulmonary fibrosis.  On May 3rd, 2017 he was admitted to the ER because he had trouble breathing. They took a biopsy and determined that he had Stage 4 Lung Cancer. On June 2nd, he passed away.  What can I do? What documents will I need to defend my case?"	Yes
19	"http://m.imgur.com/a/IiDrC  About $100 worth of Pokemon cards. The boxes were kicked and scattered all across the ground. There were twelve damage counter dice and two larger dice, and I only have two damage counters left. Both coins I had were also lost. The large stack of unsleeved cards to the right are the disfigured and frayed cards, and the stack to the left are the sleeved cards that survived.  She refuses to reimburse me for the destruction of my property, as I ""left them there"" after she kicked them, because the 911 dispatch told me to separate myself from her, and I should be lucky my mother even bothered to pick them up.  Additionally, I've paid my rent for July and August already. She's agreed to repay the $250 frpm August's rent, but, seeing how July is only half over, I'd like half of the rent from July, if at all possible. What can I do, Reddit?"	Yes
20	"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	Yes
21	I'm traveling and recently got a hysteric call from my wife. Our cat was chilling under a car in our driveway when a neighbor walking a dog walked by. The dog got excited, pulled away from the owner, and managed to scare the cat enough to leave the relative safety of the car. The dog caught the cat and killed it.  Neighbors have video of parts of the incident I've been told.  I'm not interested compensation, as it's be meaningless. but we and neighbors have small children and this concerns me, as the owner was wholly incapable of stopping or controlling the dog. She told my wife that the cat instigated the encounter, which I'm told by a neighbor is not the case.  My wife described it as a bulldog, but I suspect she means pitbull. I'm not sure til I see video.  What action should I take to ensure a safe neighborhood... does this need to be reported to police, animal control, or some other body?	Yes
22	I'm trying to get some advice for my roommates sister, and I only have the basic run down. Her sisters son died from Bacterial Meningitis, and was sick for about 2 weeks before it happened. They were controlling it with Motrin, but his fever got worse and they took him into the ER after a couple days of him not improving. He had a 103 fever upon arrival, and they just told him to keep giving him Motrin and released him. They never ran any further tests finding out that he had that, and the next day he continued to just not really wake up, and continued to look in bad shape. They took him into another hospital the next morning after being released from the ER, and they wound up admitting him and had to put him on life support that same night. 24 hours later, they pronounced him brain dead.   I just don't see any way the ER should NOT have admitted him, and possibly been able to save his life. Would they potentially be on the hook for this?	Yes
23	My seventeen year old daughter made some poor decisions and ended up passed out in the back of a taxi last night with some friends who were apparently trying to get her back to one of their homes. At one point, it seems she need to vomit and the driver stopped the car. Somehow, the car door was opened and my daughter, who remembers nothing, ended up hitting her head on the ground and suffered a major concussion. At that point, instead of seeking medical attention, the driver simply put her back in the car and finished the route. We only found out about this later the next day.   Is there a cause of action here? If I find out the driver was responsible for opening the car door and causing my daughter's injury could she/he be found liable?	Yes
24	So we had a guest staying with us for several months who moved out last week. She left her car in our driveway with much of her stuff in it.   We want it out for many reasons. We dont want to be liable for someone taking studd out of it (its unlocked), she may try to say that she still had belonging on our property so she can still claim squatters rights, it blocks us from taking garbage out and from using the parking space, but mostly she's a toxic person we want out of our lives asap.   We spoke to an officer who said all they can do is ticket it until it visually looks like it is abandoned. They said call back in two weeks and they'll put a tow notice and tow a week later. This is way longer than we want to wait.   We live in Rockford, Illinois.	Yes
25	"Was at walmart last night and was walking up the frozen food isle to start heading to check out. Right as I reached the end of the isle I slipped smacked the side of my face along my jaw against the freezer door, landed on my butt and hit my left elbow, ankle and tailbone. Along with catching my toe on one of those end racks. Thankfully a friend was with me and helped me up. The back of my pants were soaked. Sure enough I slipped in a puddle of water. Now it had been raining, so I grabbed the first employee I saw and let them know I was injured and there was water on the floor. He spoke no English and didnt understand I needed a manager. I had to almost drag him to where I fell to even get him to pay attention. He still didn't call a manager. Went to customer service and they were gonna make me wait. So we went to jewelry where someone finally called a manager. Waited 10 min before they came up. She handed me an incident report and asked where it occurred. I told her the location and her reply was ""we have busted pipes up there that leak and need to be fixed"" and I was not the first injury. So they know there's a leak, and have neglected to fix it or put up a sign. I currently have no insurance but my jawline to my temple is killing me, my elbow hurts and it feels like I tore something in my left shoulder. What happens if I go to a doctor seeing as I don't have insurance? would walmart need to pay my medical bills. Could I sue for negligence? Or what can I do. Thank you for any and all advice in advance. I'm in Dallas Texas."	Yes
26	I don't want to disclose too much as to give away my identity. I got into some controversy on my channel, people got upset and someone on a gossip forum leaked my full name (I only reveal my first name). I've also had people leak photos of me that are only available on my FB and to access my FB you would need to know my full name. Recently, someone messaged me on my private FB account asking me questions about the controversy that went down and I feel like thats a complete invasion of my privacy. If you want to speak with me, you can email me or comment on my videos but to stalk me and look for my FB and then message me on there? That's extremely creepy and I was honestly freaked out by it. Legally, is there anything I can do about people who leak my full name? I mean, can't people on gossip forums be charged with some form of targeted harassment? Location is NY.	Yes
27	I have recently gone through a really bad breakup and me and my family are being harassed by my ex. She calls from a blocked number, she somehow sees what I post on instagram even though she is blocked and I'm sure she doesn't have a fake account to follow me because I am on private and know who each follower is. I would just change my number but it goes beyond calls.   I don't want to have to do it because her family is cool and her dad works in the prison system but I really don't have a choice. She has physically hit me on multiple occasions, the night we broke up she ripped my shirt off and threw a cup at my head, she once started yelling loudly that I was physically hurting her and to stop hurting her even though we were just arguing (I called my mom and told her what she was doing in case she called the cops and I was arrested), it's just a total nightmare. She is diagnosed bipolar and has been 5150'd. When she was 5150'd I let them know she had been physical otherwise they wouldn't have take her.   Do I need to put all my family on the request for protection? Can I fill out the domestic violence one if I don't have proof of the violence? Also this seems like it should be the last of my worries but I have no time I can use to take off work because I've used it all from all the stress that has caused. Will the court let me request a specific date so I can not miss work?  Any help is appreciated. I can go a week with no calls and then once they start I get so anxious and sick to my stomach. I'm already in treatment for depression and anxiety and her contacting me is the only thing that causes it to flair up.	Yes
28	"I had 3 teeth extracted yesterday by a local oral surgeon, and after I got home and the numbness began to wear off, I realized that one of the 3 was not one I had asked them to pull. I had a referral list with x rays from my dentist that reccomended 5 for extraction, but included a note that said ""per patient which ones"". I had opted to only do 3 for now since they were patially broken and painful, was going to ask my dentist about options to save the other 2 since they hadn't been painful. Before they started I was showing the assistant which ones I wanted done, and I opened my mouth and pointed to each one. I explained also that I had no clue which teeth the numbers on the list corresponded to, and my dentist had told me to just show them which ones that they would know the numbers. I thought she seemed to understand which ones I meant, but later I realized they pulled the one in front of one I had asked them to pull. It was on the list, but as I said, I wanted to try to save it. I called the office up, but they were already closed and the best I could do was leave a message with the answering service explaining what happened. What are my options for dealing with this? ""I'm sorry"" clearly won't bring my tooth back, and I'm less interested in money than I am in being able to eat as normally as possible again."	Yes
29	Earlier this week, I opened my front door to let my dog out into our fenced in yard, and the mailman was standing on the front porch with a package.  As you might expect, my dog (50 lb 10 year old mutt) was startled and started barking, and before I could react we were both pepper sprayed, the dog lunged, and the mailman fell down the front steps trying to run away.  The dog didn't bite him, but he did skin his knees and was limping when he left.  It was a substitute mailman, my normal mailman leaves packages outside the fence, but had apparently not bothered to tell the substitute that my yard has a dog.  My dog has never bitten anyone, so bite history isn't an issue.  How much risk am I at for being sued, and is there anything I can to do to prevent this from becoming a problem?	Yes
30	I live in a second floor walk up. There are 3 units on each floor. We have a front entrance and a rear entrance. The rear has a balcony, which each floor shares. My neighbor recently started recording the stairs coming up to our unit and some of our balcony to try to catch another one of our neighbors smoking. Even though I know he's not trying to record me, it still creeps me out every time I walk by the camera. Is it legal for him to record?	Yes
31	I know someone who owns a golf course with her two brothers. They built it together over 10 years ago from what was a dairy farm handed down by their father.  One of the brothers has a 21 year old son that LOVES his 2nd amendment and goes out onto the course when golfers have left and shoots his guns at geeze and targets with his friends. This past 4th of July he and his buddies went out at night a fired 1,000 rounds of into the side of a mound and than posted it on social media for the public to see (this is a public course by the way).   One of the three owners cannot stand this behavior but can't really tell her brother to stop, and we're not sure if there's any legal reasons to make them stop since it's technically private property, but also a golf course open to the public.  What would you do in this situation?	Yes
32	"This happened months ago and the hoop is still sitting there, the guy has city ties and is running for common council. I couldn't care less about It but now I have a bee in my bonnet about messing with him.   My neighbor has an illegal basketball hoop on our shared street. Where we live they are illegal and the city makes you remove them. It happened to my cousin. A city official came to my next door neighbors house asking who the hoop belonged to, and she told him it was the mans hoop. The man found out because he is in some political position. He is currently running for common council I believe is the position. He has connections to the city. He stormed into the street and started screaming ""FUCKKK YOUUUU (NEIGHBORS NAME)!!!!!!!!!!! FUCKKKK YOUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" He did this multiple times until we went over to our neighbor and told her what was going on. Someone had called the city about his hoop and he thought it was her. It was not. My one regret is not getting it on video. The guy is a real jerk and the worst neighbor we've ever had. He is rude and disrespectful and has a very short temper. We don't care about the hoop, it was the city who came to ask about it. We didn't ask for it to be removed but now after what he has done I want to get it removed. He has city ties so I'm sure it will be hard.   My question is, can I send him a letter telling him I have video of him acting like a fool. I obviously don't but I want to mess with him. Just for shits and giggles. And what can I do about the hoop. This guy is a real dirt bag."	Yes
33	"Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.   As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her.   I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked.   When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me.   Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes.   and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record.   There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.  Thank you. TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it."	Yes
34	On mobile, throwaway, first time posting, etc etc.   So I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada on vacation. I'm originally from Alberta Canada. Tonight me and a group of girls went out for some Asian fusion. Unfortunately I am anaphylactic to peanuts. I carry meds in case of a reaction and always tell the waitress of my allergy.   So at dinner we decided to let the server just bring us food that would end up totalling $40-50 each and sharing instead of each ordering something individually. I told her at the beginning that I am severely allergic to peanuts. This allergy includes peanut oil. Server says great she understands. Awesome.   So our food comes out, one dish being chicken satay. I double check with the server that dropped it off (not our waitress) that the satay does not have peanuts. He says nope, it does not. Great! He said the dressing in the salad (which wasn't on our table yet) might have peanuts and he'll go check. So I start dishing up. I use chopsticks to put some veggie dumplings on my plate. I then grab some other food and eat it. Notice an immediate allergic reaction. Not awesome.   The waitress then hurries over and says don't eat the dumplings as they are cooked in peanut oil. Unfortunately I used the same chopsticks to pick up the dumpling as I did to eat something else. So serious cross contamination. We call the hotel paramedic and an ambulance. I spend about three hours in the hospital for observation. I gave myself my epipen and Benadryl at the restaurant. They gave me prednisone at the hospital. Had an IV and fluids given.   My question is do I have any grounds to sue? I'm pretty pissed since we're here on vacation and I felt like shit. I do have travellers insurance so the hospital stay will be covered by them. I'm really just curious what my options are. Thanks!  TLDR; told restaurant about peanut allergy, served food with peanuts, spent evening in the hospital emerg.	Yes
35	Roommate flew into a rage this evening about a lamp I broke and wound up punching me three times in the face. I did not return any strikes, he proceeded to call the cops.   I did not stick around for the police to arrive for the reason below, which is why I need advice.  I've been effectively homeless for the last 2 months, crashing on couches and paying people a pittance with no lease etc. I've spread the love across a number of couches so no one friend gets too sick of me. Being homeless is the result of me having been kicked out of previous living quarters during an event for which I am now on unsupervised probation.  The only condition of my probation is to notify them of address changes... Well they've been so frequent and entirely unofficial that I am technically in violation of my probation. Thus why I didn't stick around for the cops.  Having reached a safe location for the evening I was able to examine myself further and I probably have a broken nose, but have no insurance or funds for medical attention (and refuse to use the ER for shit like this, I'm not dying). I would absolutely like to file charges however I suspect I'm fucked on being able to do so because of the afforementioned probation issue.  Help please?	Yes
36	"i'm posting here in hope for a miracle. this is going to be long and i apologies but i'm going to give all details in hopes some one can help my family out. we live in beaver county Pennsylvania. i'm 20 and live at home with my parents as they do what they can to help me get through community college. we live in a three house culdesac. the neighbors next to us have been calling the police claiming harassment, shooting automatic weapons wildly, their daughter has been telling the police my parents have been screaming at her and being obscene in front of her ( when in reality it's her who has said and done everything) their dogs have tried to attack people, and they told lots of people that we grow and sell weed ( i found out through a friend while in high school). this has been going on for years and the list of accusations go on and on and we need help. recently we were just smoking ribs in our back yard peacefully ( a good 200+ ft from their property and everything) and the cops showed up. were going to court for the 5th time and this is our 9th fine. we can't afford very much my parents are on/off unemployment as finding work has been here and there the best they can ( they both being 60+ with no college degrees). the daughter is in on this one and we believe her to be 17, so were sweating any sexual related claims from her in court. the police the past 8 times have done nothing but feed their attacks with barratry. they show up, tell us were being accused of X and tell us the papers will be in the mail then drive off. they refuse to even hear our side of the story or ask the neighbors questions, NOTHING. the court has grown tired of seeing us so they dread the cases and never have a pleasant attitude in the cases ( said neighbors give them shit attitude and they do a poor job of letting us actually tell our side of the case going so far as telling my parents to ""shut it"" during a hearing once) my parents want to try a lawyer but were rapidly going very broke and i'm sending this on a prayer some one here can help us before we have to leave the house we own for a new one."	Yes
37	"Got in an accident a while back.  Sought legal assistance.  The lawyer I found dropped my case after a month and I felt they wasted my time.  I left them a single negative review online containing hard facts, all of which were true. I can back up any of my claims with evidence from multiple sources.  I settled with the driver on my own and figured it was time to move on.  The lawyer felt otherwise.  Since our ""falling out,"" the lawyer has taken the following actions:  * Called me to threaten legal action against me if I do not take down my factual review * Called my employer to try to convince them to fire me, saying he knows their business partners etc. * Called various family members of mine and made them feel harassed. * Has emailed me countless times threatening multiple lawsuits. * Has emailed me threatening to employ a private investigator for the situation. * Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false. * Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer) * Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident * Is threatening me with lawsuits, again  I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.  what do you think?  1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment? 2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since. 3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?"	Yes
38	Yesterday evening I was on my bike stopped at an intersection when I got rear ended by a car. Long story short, got a concussion, a cut in my head that was stitched up, a bunch of bruises and spent the night at a trauma center.  The thing is, I found out last night that my insurance was cut off about a month ago so I don't have any coverage. I'm a graduate student who has less than $1000 in his account so there's no way I can pay it off right now and would hate to have to pay off the bills over time, stunting my personal expenses once I'm out of school and working. I don't know exactly how much it'll cost me yet but I'd guess the $6-7k ballpark since they took a bunch of scans too.  My intent is to get the woman who hit me to pay off my medical bills. Besides this, some compensation for my injuries and the time I'll have to take out of school would be good as well. I don't know anything about her but she didn't have the best car so I'm guessing she's not too well off. What is my best course of legal action?  Thank you for the advice.  Location: Atlanta, GA, USA if that helps	Yes
39	I was at a friend's party when the deck collapsed and I along with 2 others had to be taken to the hospital. My injuries are a severe scalp laceration on my forehead and up through my hair line. Another girl broke her back.   The house was a rental and from what I know they had the deck looked at/repaired twice. What is my best course of action?	Yes
40	I don't want to give any serious details out, but my direct boss has falsely claimed that I have asked him out/ asked for his number and made advances towards him at work. None of these things are true.  Nothing serious has come of it, but is there any action I should take? This is just a shitty part time job but I don't want to get fucked over.   I only heard this from a co worker. It happened when my boss, another manager, and a few co workers went out for drinks, and I don't think anyone believed him.   Do I file with HR w/o proof? I don't even have an actual HR department, just a phone number. I just don't want to get into trouble for something I didn't do.	Yes
41	I had a very, very bad experience with a dental  surgery the other day. Woke up during surgery, surgeon held me down and finished procedure with me wide awake, no pain meds, and left the room. No other interaction with him afterward. Is this information I'm allowed to share in an online review of the dental practice?	Yes
42	"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	Yes
43	I think some lawyer would benefited just to follow me around. Seriously. I have a series of bad luck despite of trying to be very positive. Just this week alone: 1. The president of a dumpster company trespasses my property. I complained to his worker previously but have no intention to pursue it. He took pictures and denied that his worker broke the driveway. He's going to call another expert into my property even after I said he's trespassing. I have the before and after drivrway pictures btw. His company worth 1 million and the damage only worth a few hundreds bucks. Lol.. 2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up. 3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out. 4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools..  5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it. I've dealt with many more.. IRS double charge mistake (1 year to resolve), real estate agent knowingly sold a property with many violations (didn't disclose mold, structural, etc and inspector was her brother), etc.  Disclosures: Not sue happy, PhD in science,  just wonder what the heck life at 1 am..	Yes
44	Hello! So I live in San Francisco, CA in the Richmond district. I just moved into a new place as of the 3rd and am sharing a bedroom in a 4bd/1bth unit with a roommate from the previous place. Today, the master tenant texted me directly and asked that me and my roommate be out of the house from 9 pm to 10 pm as the landlord was coming over to fix a door in our room that leads to the fire escape, and that we needed to be out of the way as the landlord didn't know we were renting the room out (contrary to what I was told when I moved in). I was also told I was not allowed to sit in the living room either.  I became suspicious as the door works perfectly fine and I recorded this fact on my phone pre-emptively. I then took two old phones I had and set them at two different angles in my room, recording both video and audio and left the room for the hour. I came back, checked the videos- it was a full interaction of the main tenant showing our room to someone, making derogatory comments about us, implying that the room was available right now and then leaving. No landlord at all. I copied over these videos to my hard drive, then went out with my roommate to talk to the main tenant who was in the living room. She told us that she didn't know us very well, her friend needed a room, and so we had to be gone by Sep. 1, and lying to me about who was entering our room was no big deal. I informed her that I would need a written and notarized 30 day notice, which she said she didn't need to give me because I don't have a written lease with her as the main tenant. However, having dealt with eviction before, I know that a) as of August 4th, I will be fully protected under occupant/tenant rights, and b) that I can file a protest of unlawful eviction with the SF rent board, which I plan to do as soon as she actually gives me a non-verbal notice/August 4th comes, whichever one is first.  Other info: We paid our rent and security deposit in full, by check, dated, with notes, etc. and said checks have been cashed.  Texted main tenant asking for reason for eviction, she has not replied. I am not sure of how CA recording law specifically applies to recording in my own unit/room, as I placed them there under suspicion of someone entering the unit who was not the landlord. I believe that audio is not allowed, but video is- I'd just like confirmation of it.  What other actions should I take to protect myself and my roommate from being evicted and thrown out from our home?	Yes
45	Hi all,  I recently received a notice from an insurance company stating that I caused body damage to my neighbor's vehicle with fireworks.  His wife claims to have seen me lighting them too closely to her vehicle.  Though I was lighting fireworks, I was not the only person lighting them in the area.  The fireworks I had lit were small fountain style fireworks, barely capable of exceeding 10' in height.  I have a photo of myself standing between the fireworks and the neighbors vehicle, seemingly at a safe distance.  Should I dispute this? What type of proof will they need to deem me responsible?	Yes
46	While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell.   I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home.   My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with. While I was at the ER, I told them it was a work related incident and to contact my employer. I received a bill for a little over $500 and promptly handed it to my general manager. I have now received another for a lowered amount, $267. When I received the bill for $267, I sent it to my employer with a note asking what we needed to do to take care of this and haven't heard anything.   I no longer work there because I accepted a position for an internship in another city. What legal obligation do I have to pay the remainder? I don't want it to go to collections, but I don't feel responsible for paying it, either. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have gone to the ER at all. What is the best course of action?  TD;LR: got Tilex in eyes at work, boss sent me to ER, stuck with bill.	Yes
47	So basically my ex-girlfriend borrowed my cat on Thursday under the pretense of needing to spend time with her for emotional support.  Then this morning (Sunday) she started sending me text messages saying that she is keeping the cat and that she will not return her at all.    What can I do here?  I've already called the police but they said I'd have to hire a private attorney and take her to court.  I have mountains of evidence and witnesses that the cat is mine and not hers, the cat is chipped to me and I have vets bills etc with my name on it.  I also have the texts where my ex says in clear terms that she knows the cat isn't hers but is keeping it anyway.    What can I do here?  I know this is a silly question but I really love the cat and want to get her back, thanks for your help.	Yes
48	So I posted on Craigslist looking for women or couples who will let me jerk off in their panties/thongs (yes, I'm weird).  A guy emailed me about it, but when I asked if he would ask for or if he had his girl's permission this is what he said:  She wouldn't be into it. But she won't find out either. I've cum in her panties many times and put them back in her drawer. She's never known.  I've even used her when she's passed out drunk and cum on her face. She never knew.   Is there a way to report this? If so, how do I do it and is there a way to do it anonymously?  Will I have to talk to the police myself, or can I just submit the emails?  I'm kind of freaked out right now, and would like to avoid doing this publicly because I'm kind of embarrassed about my craigslist post/fetish...  All I have is his email address and the messages.  I have not yet responded to that last email	Yes
49	I live in Vancouver, BC. I think I know the person who may be ordering pizza online for me from abroad. I fired him and he was quite upset. He moved to another country a few months later. That's my evidence against him. I heard from another person that he plans to move back to Vancouver, BC next year. Once he comes back, can I have the police arrest him for harassment?	Yes
50	Happened in Missouri this week.  A company that seems to be contracted by the city was working on a line next to my house.  There was a surge of wastewater while they had the line blocked(my vague understanding of the situation) and it caused the waste to back up into my house, completely covering the downstairs floor in sludge that I assume to be mostly human waste.  I woke up sometime within the next 3 hours to find this;  went outside and got ahold of the sewage company workers who were still working outside and let them know about it, they contacted their supervisor who came to my house, took pictures, called his boss and then told me that they were taking responsibility for the  incident.  So far they've hired a company to do the cleanup, and the same company is expected to start doing the repairs(floors, carpet, drywall, etc) Monday.  They've also agreed to get the HVAC ducts cleaned out because the AC is currently circulating the smell of sewage through the house even after the cleanup downstairs.  I'm renting and my landlord and I both have concerns about the situation - most of my belongings got sloshed with sewage, including my computers and office furniture;  I'm also just cut off from the bottom of my house for the next several weeks.  My landlord's concern is that he is going to have to disclose this incident whenever he eventually sells the property and that it will damage the perceived value of the house and make it harder to sell.  I'm trying to figure out what, if any, sort of recourse we have in this situation beyond the cleanup and repair.  Nothing has been signed yet.	Yes
51	I got into a fight at school with this girl. We had an argument and on that day, she posted on Facebook that she's was going to fight me the next day. Someone screenshot it and send it to me. Well the next day, at lunch, she was putting her hair up in a ponytail when she saw me. When the bell rung, I was walking my friend to her class when I saw her looking at me. She made it seem like she was just walking past me but I saw her friend watching and I knew she was going to throw the first punch. I was ready and she came at me. Well the police was going to charge me with an assault until I told him the whole story and showed him the screenshot of her threatening me. So I have a court day and it says crime/Traff misdemeanor. Never fought in high school. I think she was 17. No major injuries on both of us. I didn't get charged with an assault, got charged with disorderly conduct.	Yes
52	The second woman that hit me made it clear she would rather pay out of pocket than have a claim on her insurance.  I realize it may not be the most ethical thing to do, but would I be breaking any laws to accept a cash payment from her, and make a claim with the other rear-enders insurance?  I realize it's a bit shady, I just need to be clear on whether or not I would be breaking any laws.	Yes
53	I was riding down a street in the bike lane. There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while. My bike kept going and it got run over by their car being completely destroyed. The driver was immediately apologetic and claimed responsibility. They provided me with their contact and insurance information.   So my problem here is I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I'd prefer not to get lawyers involved because she was extremely nice and wanted to work with me on this. I do want her to pay for my hospital visit and a replacement to my bike. My bike I bought new and got it in a rare situation of the bike needing to be sold because it was a year old model and got it for about half the msrp with also haggling. I'm pretty sure I can't get a bike like that again for the price I paid for it.  My main questions: 1. I have not been in a situation like this before. Do I call her insurance right away and report the situation? 2. What do I tell them? (Might sound silly but I don't to say anything wrong that will prevent me from getting covered) 3. Can I provide them with the make and model of my bike to get the msrp value for it instead of receipt value?  Thanks in advance for any advice.	Yes
54	"This ""Dog Shelter"" is threatening legal action against my sister and her husband for supposedly ""killing their dog for no reason"", or ""because they were having a baby"", and posted on their facebook page resulting in people also sending hate messages and threatening to kill my sister, and her husband. My sister has official documents from the animal hospital explaining why the dog was actually put down due to an unknown problem that had started leaving the dog blind, deaf, and suffering. We are pretty sure it started from a text my sisters' husbands' adoption sister got from my sisters' husband about them not being sure if they should give the dog away or try to train him around the baby, resulting in the adoption sister assuming they put the dog down because of that and knowing someone at the adoption center? The Center claims to have ""proof"" even though my sister has official documents. Can the shelter actually ""take them to court/sue them"" as they say, and can my sister do anything about the shelter posting their images and profiles online threatening them?"	Yes
55	I'm currently living in Los Angeles, and I started chatting with someone that I met through a dating app. I stupidly sent them nudes of myself and now they are threatening to send them to everyone of my Facebook friends including my family. I sent the messages through Kik, so I know I could report them for abuse and state the exact reason and let them look at the messages, but I'm afraid they'd only get banned then just send the pictures because they would figure I reported them. I honestly have no idea what to do right now.	Yes
56	"Hello. Last night, someone broke into my vehicle and stole about $380 cash, a $300 check, two debit cards and two credit cards along with my social security number as well (I had it in my car because I had just taken it for verification purposes at school the night before). They used all the cards, and due to them making online purchases (with shipping to their home), and video surveillance at the restaurants they went (license plate number and faces) and I have a ton of proof that I am going to be handing over to the police. I suppose my question is, I want to recover this money, but the police straight up said ""it is US Government property and might as well be gone"". I want to recover, obviously. Do I need to file a civil suit after the criminal charges? Is this petty theft, or larceny? All in all, they had spent about $600 on the cards plus everything else mentioned. Do I need to lawyer up to due someone? I had no idea where else to ask"	Yes
57	Neighbor's tree fell on my car. My car is covered by my insurance but we have a $1,000 deductible.  They're long-time good neighbors and have promised to hire a professional to remove the rest of the tree. They offered to contribute to the car repair cost.   We can afford the deductible.   Legal question 1. What kind of legal document would be useful to document our verbal agreement? Is one needed?  Moral question 1. If I take them up on their offer to contribute to the car repair, what is a fair percentage to ask for?  2. Considering professional tree removal cost is $500-$1,000, should I decline their offer to contribute to the repair cost as a gesture of goodwill?   Thank you!	Yes
58	My girlfriend with a mental condition (schizophrenia) has a friend who constantly makes her feel bad until she sends a sexually explicit image to her. If she doesn't respond to him (he lives in New York) then he berates her and curses at her.    This past day there were over 45 missed calls from him while we were spending time together. I didn't know she was doing this until she told me he was yelling again because she hadn't answered today, and I finally snapped and called him out on it. He eluded to having the images which led to my learning she had been doing this, and then spoke of how he got annoyed and mad at how she didn't send these images so he got mad. Today was the first day I learned of this. Once she learned I knew about what she did for him she cut herself so deeply she was in the ER and the other guy was unapologetic at his actions. I'm not sure if this has any legal grounds. Would it be helpful to call the police and report this? We are both 20 so are rather inexperienced. Apologies if this is written badly. I'm a mess.	Yes
59	My dogs got into my neighbors yard and now she is claiming they did $300 of damages. I fixed the fence already and she's still asking for more money. Can I just ignore her or can I get in trouble with law?	Yes
60	I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	Yes
61	Hi Reddit Law,  My dad is a contractor and recently finished tile work on a new house. The owner did not want to pay the balance and my father threatened to break the tiles throughout the house with a hammer. My gut is that this isn't legal but I'm not really sure, it is his tiles and setting materials after all and this guy hasn't paid.	Yes
62	"Long story short, my fwb and I broke up. It went terribly, was strung out over many months, and we're both left bitter about the whole situation. We were in a dom/sub kink situation. I think there may have been some emotional abuse involved, but that's not why I'm here... he's been posting on craigslist looking for hookups for months (daily posting). I've also known about this for months. (this is essentially why we broke up). There was a posting up with the pictures he uses on his posts, and the text he uses on his posts, with a paragraph that essentially read: don't contact this dude, he's an alcoholic and gave me an STD and lots of trust issues. if you want a fwb on craigslist, reply to another posting. Also, his face is not in any of the pictures, and his name isn't any where on either of the posts (his original post, or the secondary post), so I don't think there is any way to identify who it is just from the posting.  So... today, he sends a screenshot to me and tells me he's suing me. He says it ""won't be for much"" and he ""hopes I learn a lesson from all this"". Last week, he was threatening to call the cops on me for something I didn't do. I eventually talked him down from that, but I don't think I talked him down from this.   My question is: Would a lawyer take this case? If so, what should I do?  Please let me know if you need other information to make this more clear."	Yes
63	So I was involved in a hit and run collision this morning. I was stopped at a stop sign at an intersection and a Honda came around the corner too fast and too wide and smashed right into the left front of my car. As I was getting out they sped off and left me stranded. My left front wheel is bent and my steering arm is bent so I couldn't steer my vehicle. I managed to drive it back down the street to my aunts house house with the wheels pointing in opposite directions and the tires squeeling and park the car until a tow truck arrived. I called the police and they told me they wouldn't send an officer out for something like this and to make a police report online. I drove around the corner with my dad in his car and we found the vehicle that hit me. When he hit me his left front turn signal lens broke off and I picked it up. It matched exactly to the Honda we found around the corner. I wrote down the license plate number and took a lot of photos. I called the police a second time and told them I found the car who hit me and they still said they wouldnt send an officer out and to make a report at the station or online. I made a report online but when I did so it said that hit and run reports made online will not be investigated. When I got my car home I called my insurance company and made a claim. I only have basic liability and no uninsured motorist coverage so I don't think they can really do anything. They took all my information I had and told me I would receive a call back within two business days. I guess I'm going to be waiting on them to call me back but I almost feel cheated that my tax dollars are going to waste when the cops say they won't do anything. What kind of bs is that. Im a mechanic for a living so I already ordered all the parts to get my car back on the road functionally not cosmetically and plan to repair my vehicle myself and take it to get aligned. Ive spent about 150 dollars on suspension components to fix everything. I live in Sacramento California if that means anything. Any advice is appreciated. I wrote this on mobile so hopefully this doesn't read too bad.	Yes
64	Someone close to my family sent out a video of a family member masturbating. The video is only from the chest up but hey are talking to the camera and it is clear what the person is doing.   Would this follow under revenge porn?  It is on my spouses side of the family this is happening. Due to the shock of the situation I don't think anyone is as concerned as me that this video is being sent around.   I am leaving it up to my spouse and my children on if they should seek action. I informed them that I thought it was illegal and that it is considered a felony in the state they are in.   In the mean time should I notify the person spreading the video that it is illegal and they need to stop sending it out?	Yes
65	"Hello guys. My friend just came over to my house almost in hysterics - about to cry. 300'pound guy who doesn't shotput for NCAA...not exactly somebody who gets like this very often. I asked him what was wrong, and he explained the situation, which I will detail below.  He said that he was on Seeking Arrangement, which is a type of dating site. He was using a picture of and pretending to be a female that we both know - we went to HS with her. While he was doing this, he struck up a conversation with a guy and they exchanged numbers, he texted him for ""shits and giggles"" supposedly. Well, that guy eventually found out that it wasn't actually the girl and instead it was him. my buddy said that he didn't admit to it or anything over text, despite the guy urging him to admit what he did. What are the repercussions for this? I'm sure it's illegal to some point, but what action could this guy take against him? Thank you everyone. I very much appreciate any help offered here and I'm sure as hell that he will too...lol. You can save the ""what is he, gay?"" Comments, I've already given them to him twenty times over. Here are the messages that the guy sent to my friend:  ""Can we FaceTime? If that's okay"" ""Are you hiding something?"" ""Okay, I'll ask you the last time before I take action against you"" You have fifteen minutes to confess what you've done"" ""Bro, why. Like you know you would've been caught.""  My buddy didn't reply to any of these and has declined calls from this man, which I believe is the right move but I could be wrong. Thanks again for any help."	Yes
66	Currently residing in NYS and have been having on and off problems with our neighbors. We rescued our dog over a year ago and as a result of going through whatever she went through, she is experiencing problems with anxiety and fear of other dogs. We have been working with a certified trainer for almost a year and have been making great progress. We use a gentle leader, which goes around her face, and due to her dominant tendencies she will paw at it trying to get it off randomly and this sometimes leads her to stand on two back legs with us trying to calm her down. Anyways, when walking we have gotten a lot of positive feedback from neighbors about how well we're doing and the progress we've made. Except for one. The male and female that live a few houses down decided to approach us aggressively saying that we're abusing our dog and swearing, screaming, but not getting too close to us. Even when we tried to explain the training situation, they didn't want to hear it and kept yelling, so we went into our house. This happened about a month ago and due to feeling threatened at the time, we called the police within an hour of it happening. The officer showed up and after telling the situation he said that we are within our rights to train our dog how we want and if they approach us again to tell them to go away. Fast forward to a few days ago. We were walking again in our neighborhood walking and our dog pawed once at her halter and all of a sudden  the same female yelled something, however, we ignored it and kept walking. Shortly after, the female drove her car up and started yelling and cursing again. We replied with we're working with a trainer and we called the cops after last time and we were told we're within our right to train our dog how we see fit. She replied with we're lying and she's within her right to follow us and also said they've called the cops. After ignoring her, she drove off and we turned around to go back to the house. As we came closer to our house, the male was walking down the street yelling something, but we just ignored him and went inside. Again, we called the police and four officers showed up soon after. Upon answering the door, our dog was at the door where they could see and later the officer said that she looks fine and could tell nothing was happening. Anyways, after explaining the situation, one of the officers basically said to go about our business and there's really nothing they can do at this point and if they approach us again, to call the police again. I also should add that after mentioning the neighbors said they've been calling the police, the police confirmed that no one has ever called them.   Our question is what can and should we do within our legal rights? Currently, we feel unsafe and are planning to go elsewhere to walk our dog. We don't like this because we bought our house and want to enjoy the area, but at what costs? These individuals could escalate the situation to something bad next time, but we also don't think it's fair for us to go elsewhere to walk. Even though there wwere no immediate threats, this still feels like harassment. We don't want the situation to escalate or get out of hand, but at the same time, we don't feel safe or that we're able to enjoy our home and neighborhood.   Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you!	Yes
67	My sister runs a semi popular African American natural hair blog and instagram. She interviewed with a hair company in order to join their sponsorship program, which would require her to post images of her using their products on her instagram in exchange for monthly free products. After going through the interview process she was informed several weeks later that she had not gotten into the program. Flash forward to today, I am scrolling through my Facebook page and see that this company has posted one of her pictures taken from her instagram without permission. Are companies allowed to Take images from instagram without giving any sort of compensation or obtaining permission from the owner?	Yes
68	"The car that hit the plaintiff has a 2 channel dashcam, so it records the front and the back. You can see that the victim was not hit nor did I feel a hit, but ""if anything"" might have been clipped - it would have been grocery bags she was carrying, making her superficially wider for the narrow ramp. Currently working with the insurance company at the moment, sent videos (in HD) and letter, but I'm curious to know what I should be prepared for? The videos show no hit. The after moments show the plaintiff making a ""mean face"" at the rear of the car, then adjusting their grocery bags from one side to another, and finally walking up the ramp showing no signs of injury. It all seems to be in my favor, but if not - how should I prepare? Secondly, if it comes out that this was a false claim, are there steps I should take against the plaintiffs?"	Yes
69	Hello. Pretty short question. I live an apartment complex in Vermont and the septic tank busted. Causing a sink hole of sewage in the back yard. We have been given no notice that they are going to do anything about it. We live by a river, and I am unsure if the sewage is seeping into the river.   I am unsure what I can do, so any info you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thanks!	Yes
70	"here is an update to anyone who is curious link (here) [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6mckz3/girlfriend_had_her_butt_grabed_by_a_mcdonalds/]. So today we filed a police report, the officer said that they would not go for any sexual battery type charge but rather a class C misdemeanor assault charge. That is honestly fine by me, i just want some form of punishment for ""Tyrone"" so he knows that it's not okay to grab women who don't want to be grabbed. They said they would review the tapes and im hoping to god that the cameras caught it, there is two cameras in the lobby but this was over at the drink station so they might not be able to see the physical contact that occurred. I also called the Mcdonalds corporate office and the lady seemed very understanding and polite and said that her supervisor would launch an investigation and review the tapes and contact the Franchise owner immediately. I told her that the police were already investigating and all that happened. We have no interest in sueing mcdonalds or the guy who did this, i just want him to maybe get a fine and lose his job.With that said i am tempted to call the DA's office once he is charged with the Class C assult to see if they could possibly bump it up to class B or something. Feel free to give any advice or ask questions, once this is all over i will post a final update."	Yes
71	"Hi Reddit Lawyers. I need some advice on my case. Backstory:  April 2016- I injured my hamate bone, fracturing the hook. I did not know this until May, when pain persisted and I went to an Ortho. I had X-rays and an MRI to confirm the fracture. My ortho elected to wait for the bone to heal. Fast forward to July. Still have pain, went back to the same ortho but with a hand specialist. He also had me wait and did not perform an excision. By August, the pain was still there and I would not heal. After X-rays and a CT, we decided to excise the hamate hook. (I was told I could immediately get back to sports and life as soon as the incision healed, but that story kept changing as I followed up the procedure and had pain. Being told I could participate quickly is something for another time).  After waiting a few months with no activity, my wrist was feeling ""better."" I was not having the same pain. On July 3rd, the same pain came back. After X-rays, MRI, and CT, it was shown that my hamate hook was still there. Only half was removed. The same fracture site existed with only the tip missing in the images. I went to a new ortho and recently had the rest removed.   The standard of care for this injury is to excise the hook immediately based on my research. Non union rates of the fracture are as high as 90%. My new ortho also said that they do not even talk about letting it heal, that went out of date 20 years ago. The go to is excision. This is also coupled with the fact that the surgeon stated he removed the entire hook in the op report. He ""completely"" removed it and said he examined the fracture site- something not possible because the original fracture was still there. Apparently, all he did was cut the tip of the bone off. This, obviously, caused me to have a follow up procedure to fix that issue.  So I had to wait in pain and not continue my life, which was wrong to begin with, and my surgery was incorrectly performed. I spoke with a lawyer and was basically told my case isn't big enough for his firm. I plan on getting a second opinion. I would like to know what you guys think. If I can't find representation, should I send a letter to the original ortho? I would include what happened, what had to be done, the images from the CTs clearly showing the hook still there. Maybe compensation? What should I do? Thanks in advance!"	Yes
72	Bought a beat up house couple years ago.  Have a renter neighbor who has called cops and city inspectors at least 5 times on us.  We are only doing work that doesn't require permits.  In the past the larger work we did get permits and used contractors.    City guy comes out saying they have 3 calls about a gas barbecue that we are building apparently but actually we put in a patio of pave stones on sand which doesn't require any permits.  We assume its from the neighbor next door whom bird dogs us etc.  City said they want a picture of my non existent bbq or if we don't show them the yard they will get a warrant.      How do I get this neighbor to stop harassing us using the city?  They city guy acknowledged it was the tenant in question and that it was multiple calls.  Yes we have contacted their land lord whom lives hundreds of miles from here and she just argues that her tenants are angels.  Is this civil harassment?  Can we send a cease and desist  letter or something like this?  Can the city be asked whom is reporting these violations so we can send the letter to the correct people?	Yes
73	I'm a college student in Florida and hit a parked car in my neighborhood while I myself was parking. I've only been driving for around a year now but have always been a safe driver. I immediately parked, went up close to asses the damage and then left a note on the dented backseat passenger door telling the driver to call me. So later in the day she texts me and is very understanding and even asks if I rather not get insurance involved. We both call our parents and I'm ready to go get a quote on the damage but she doesn't text me for 2 and half months so I'm thinking she's forgotten about the whole thing or gotten it fixed herself or something.  Now she's texted me back asking if we can get her car fixed by the weekend. Just looking at the price estimates for fixing dented doors + chipped paint looks like it'll be at least a grand, I really only have a 300$ limit right now so i'm kind of screwed. What would be the consequences if we got insurance involved? (It's my dad's insurance as the car is still under my father's ownership)  Thanks in advanced for helping the nervous college kid out	Yes
74	"Hey there /r/legaladvice. Using a throwaway here.  Around February of this year I was contacted by a friendly acquaintance I had known for years asking me if they could stay with me for a convention in the area that we would both be vendors at. I told them that sure, they could, and I had no problem with it. Convention comes and goes, and then about a week afterwards there was some fallout and we decided to go our separate ways.   The fallout had nothing to do with the convention but of a personal matter.   This person made it clear in no uncertain terms that they didn't want to have anything to do with me anymore, and I respected that wish and never contacted them again.   I've never once talked about this person online, blasting them, or even ""vaguebooked"" about them.  During the time this was happening, and every few weeks like clockwork, this person would send me some very nasty texts and emails, commenting on what a horrible person I was, etc. I never replied (in kind or at all) and just let them rant and rave. It finally died down a bit until this last week.  Here's where the income thing comes in.   We're both members of a fairly niche convention circuit. There's about half a dozen shows over the next few months we're both supposed to be vendors at. As far as I was concerned, the matter was closed; I sell my stuff, you sell yours, and we have the professionalism to ignore each other and get on with our lives.  Two days ago I got a very long text message filled with more ""commentary"" and a threat that if this person sees me at the next show, that ""there will be trouble."" I have no intention of interacting with this person and I finally broke my silence and emailed them, stating that I had no desire to have anything to do with them, but I wasn't going to cancel my spots at the next few shows just because they were going to be there. I also stated that they were not to contact me again, and if they did, I would consider it harassment and do what I needed to legally protect myself. I blocked this person on all social media, blocked their email, and blocked their number from my phone.   I got over this whole thing months ago, and I've already moved on from it chalking it up to a lesson learned.  This morning I have a few showrunners for this next event and a few after it contact me to ""get my side of the story"" because this person is now reaching out to them saying they feel threatened by me. In short, they're trying to get me booted as a vendor from these shows. If this happens, I stand to lose a lot of speculative income, and I'll lose the very *real* income of the thousands of dollars I've paid to secure my spot at these shows.  This person has more ""pull"" in the circuit than I do. They've been doing it for a few years and I've only been doing it for a little over one, and upon doing some digging, they have indeed gotten people banned from shows. I don't know the circumstances behind those, but I do know it's been done.  I'm unsure what to do here. I've taken a lot of written abuse from this person (all of which I've saved) off and on for months now but simply let it roll off my back because I've had other things to focus on and I never made any reply to any of it until the email I sent last night.  This convention circuit is a source of secondary income for me but it is the *only* income this person gets. I'm not trying to get this person banned from any shows ""before they get me banned"" because I absolutely *do not* want their income to be affected. I was willing to let all the verbal abuse go, but now this person is seriously making threats that could affect my income.  I just want to be able to sell my stuff in peace. That's all.  What are my options here? I'm in AZ, this person is in OR."	Yes
75	So I posted something on Facebook and this guy (that I don't know) posted something and then messaged me separately. Is this a threat, and should I report him?  Location: US, New York  [Here is what he said](https://imgur.com/gallery/yxODj)  Also I wasn't sure what to flair this, so please let me know. Thanks in advance!	Yes
76	I lived in and worked as an RA in a very old building when I was at university. There's one very uneven staircase and one day I fell from the top of it, hit my head, and fell down the rest of the staircase. I had all of the normal concussions symptoms and was diagnosed with one.   I haven't really been the same since then. I've always had bad headaches on a daily basis but I starts sleeping poorly and had more really bad headaches after this. About a year after this happened I basically had a migraine for three months, had to stop school, and developed an eye droop.   No one could figure out what was the matter, I had scans, blood work, etc. They still couldn't figure it out so said it was likely complications from severe headaches for too long. I was put on pills and Botox injections.   A few months after that I began having neurological problems, confusion, memory problems, my handwriting got really small, and I had to stop university for the second time. Once again nothing could be figured out. I had more MRIs and even a spinal tap and nothing was found. Thy said it may have partially been a complication from one of the headache drugs.   I live in pain everyday. I take pills at breakfast, supper and night, I'm just now attempting to finish the degree o should have over a year ago. My life has changed completely. Even though I'm in Canada the medication still costs a lot. I don't get to be young anymore.  A disability lawyer said I might have a case and I'm not sure if it's something I should pursue.	Yes
77	Now I will go into more detail. Two days ago I noticed a mini-tractor outside of my house, and a bunch of men with shovels and tools. I approached them and asked what they were doing. They claimed the pipe to the water main connected to their house busted, and needed to be replaced, and that they would need to dig up an area to install the pipe. I showed them my property line and asked them to go around it, which they said they would. They did not, they tore up existing concrete and left holes and patches of concrete/rocks every where.   I live in the front of an easement that has more houses in the back, I own the areas they dug in. Which from what they said and I understood, they could have gone around without damaging my property...  First of all, they started doing this without trying to contact me in any way. Which is the real reason I am pissed off. They are new Neighbors and I haven't had much contact. They are Renting the home I believe, and I don't have contact with the home owner.  What are my options... Do I call the police? Do I have to fix it myself..? It's so frustrating...	Yes
78	A little over week ago, my bf and I offered to babysit a kitten for one of my bf's friends. We were told by her that the kitten was 9 weeks old and was litter trained. She also wrote that she would pay us around $20 a week to watch him. When she brought over the kitten, he was obviously to small to be 9 weeks and he hadn't had any of his shots. Later we found out he wasn't litter trained. Since he is so small he requires a lot of attention and we both think that he is more around 3-5 weeks old.    We contacted her about making appointments for the kitten to receive his shots and to be dewormed, along with requesting she bring kitten food instead of the cat food she ended up bringing. Soon it was obvious that she probably just wanted to dump the kitten on someone, we asked her to come pick up the kitten. She then messaged back that he was our problem now and she was not responsible for him, and if he was that much of an issue we should put the kitten down. She then blocked us.  Are any legal options we could go about returning the kitten or even reporting the owner? Is she required to pay us the money she told us she would? We have all the text messages about the kitten. As much as we love this sweet little kitten we are not prepared to raise a cat nor have the money for all the expenses that come with a new pet.	Yes
79	"A friend of mine is a dog breeder and has come under fire from the locals who are angry with her because dog breeders are Literally Evil and she breeds 3 litters per year (different mothers) which apparently makes her a ""puppy mill."" She takes good care of her dogs, but has a few elderly dogs who, well, are not in excellent shape because they're old as the planet itself. She still brings them in every few months for nail clippings, general wellness exams and so on.   Well, one of the vet techs who has decided she is Evil Incarnate for breeding dogs has taken pictures of her cloudy-eyed, skinny decrepit old dogs, one of whom had an infected eye (that's why he went to the vet!) so he looks practically undead, and is posting them on social media because she is anti-breeder and wants her to be ""shut down."" Animal control went out to her house and said everything looks totally normal; so did a health inspector, but this woman is still on the warpath.   The problem is, the vet tech was fired, so it's not like contacting her boss is an option. What are my friend's options here as far as getting her to stop go? Does not seem legal at all to share patient information like this."	Yes
80	Hello all,  Did some searching through previous posts but couldn't find an exact case related to mine. Here's a bit of backstory -  Was walking our dog in a wooded area yesterday (Sunday, 7/10). Upon meeting another guy with his dog, our animals got into a scuffle. My leg ended up in the middle of it, with the other dog taking a bit ol' honking bite into my calf. Got the guy's information and gave him ours, then went straight to the hospital where I received a single stitch and some antibiotics. I forwent a tetanus shot (had a booster last year) and the rabies shot *for now*. I am currently in a health insurance coverage gap because I just returned to the states from a year working abroad (great timing, right?).  Here's what I and my family have done so far -   * Requested the vaccination and medical records of the dog that bit me.  * Provided our dog's owner information to the other dog's owner for the town's animal control officer.  * Filed a dog bite incident report to the town where the bite occurred.  * Started looking around for a personal injury attorney willing to provide advice.  I've held off on filing a police report for the time being, because the other owner has been extremely cooperative and communicative throughout the whole ordeal.  At this point I'm just looking to see if there's anything I missed or what someone like myself should do in this case, beyond lawyering up.  Any and all advice is sincerely appreciated by me and my family!	Yes

82	Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
83	"Almost 20 years ago, an extremely fucked up series of events happened to me in public schools. I'd be willing to discuss more details in a private message or an e-mail, but here's the brief sequence of events:          1.) A school administrator assaulted me in his office (grabbed me by the throat and slammed me against the wall, didn't stop choking me until another teacher who was present physically removed him)     2.) Another student pulled a stupid prank and blew up a toilet. I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time. Charges were pressed against both of us, and we were both suspended indefinitely. I spent almost 2 years awaiting trial. The trial lasted 15 minutes. The judge grilled the DA for wasting everyone's time.     3.) Started going to school in the next town over. Was brutally beaten by a student, perhaps as a ""hazing"" ritual - I had never seen him before.     4.) Dropped out of school and started using. Spent the rest of my life as a high functioning addict - until 16 months ago.     5.) Got sober, subsequently had a serious mental break down, was hospitalized, diagnosed with several severe mental illnesses.          Not sure if there's any lawsuit here. It's all super fucked up but it was also so long ago. If that idea is dead in the water, what can I do about the fact that I keep getting denied when I put in disability claims? I really can't work more than 2 or 3 days/week and even then I still have days where I just can't.           Appreciate any help, even if it's just pointing me in the right direction."	Yes
84	"Hey everybody,  my friend and I are both minors who recently went fishing on a golf corse with no ""no fishing"" or ""private property"" signs. It was pretty late and there only about 5 golfers out.  We were minding our own business, walking through the rough area surrounded by trees and carrying our fishing poles when we were approached by 3 golfers. One brought a golf club with him and told us it was private property and fishing was illegal. The other guy was a little more intense and calling us names.   We said there were was no sign and we've been up here several times. We also asked if they worked there, to which they denied. We wouldn't budge and tried to walk away when Golfer 2 grabbed my friend by the back of his shirt and threatened him to leave. Before things got ugly, we dipped out.  What can we do about this? I managed to get a decent picture of the guy as I was walking away."	Yes
85	"(I understand this is a very complicated subject and it would be impossible to give me any straight answers here.  I'm mostly just looking for insight.  I'm going through a very scary/stressful period and I don't know whether a consultation would even be worth the energy at this point.  Any input at all is appreciated.)  Male  30 years old  So in 2015 I was diagnosed with a severe migraine variant that involves daily episodes of head pain and neurological deficit.  No fun.  This involved a great deal of emergent investigation and consultation with several specialists.  The problem isn't life threatening but it does carry some risk-factors and it's recommended that I keep a close eye on it.  Fast forward a couple years and I move to a new town.  Migraines aren't doing so hot so I set up a new patient appointment with my current provider (a Physician's Assistant).  I bring in detailed documentation of my case and we discuss my problem at length.  I watch her (presumably) enter all of this information into her computer.  At the time she seemed pretty on top of things, referred me to a new neurologist, got some bloodwork set up.  I felt like I was in good hands.  Fast forward to the present day and things are not going very well.  I am having severe issues with my neck and the neurological component of my migraines has become frighteningly pronounced.  My neurologist is booked for the month so last week I report to her office to discuss what's happening.  We decide to order a set of MRIs.  A number of things about the visit strike me as very odd/unprofessional/concerning:  - ""Wait what neurological symptoms?""  She forgot about them.  This was essentially the entire focus of my first visit.  I had given her a printed out description of exactly how my migraine auras present and we had discussed at length how important it is to monitor these because they can mimic some very dangerous things.  She kept this printout.  I checked my records after the visit and it seems none of those things had ever been recorded.  - She insisted the weakness/numbness on the right side of my body was due to a pinched nerve in my neck.  This is despite three different neurologists previously diagnosing these symptoms as brain-related, either migrainous or epileptic in nature.  I explained this to her, which she completely disregarded when placing the MRI order explained below.  - She forgot I have blood pressure issues.  - She prescribed me a muscle relaxer which the pharmacist later told me interacts with one of my other medications.  - She said she wanted a good look at the soft tissues in my neck, but ordered a spinal MRI.  I thought this sounded wrong so I checked with the imaging center when scheduling my appointment.  Wrong indeed.  I had to call her and have the order revised.  - Upon arrival at the imaging center, a confused looking receptionist told me my provider had called at the last minute and changed the order again.  I was never contacted about this.  - When ordering an MRI, the doctor/PA notes the patient's current problem so the radiologist knows what to look for.  For my Brain MRI, the order reads ""Migraine without Aura"".  I've been diagnosed with Migraine *with* Aura for 2 years.  This was established at my first appointment.  It's rather important, because frequent migraine auras can actually leave behind lesions detectable on MRIs.  No mention of the extremely complicated, localized neurological deficits I have such a detailed history of.  - Likewise, my Neck MRI order fails to mention the severe pain I've been having in the front left side of my neck, which was presumably the entire reason we were getting it done.  Instead it only mentions the numbness/weakness in my arm which (again) already has an established brain origin.  I got the MRI on Tuesday.  The imaging center said it would take up to 48 hours for the scans to be read, and then my doctor would call me to let me know what's next.  Friday rolls around and I still haven't heard anything, so I drive over to the imaging center and pick up the reports myself.  They tell me the reports were finished on *Wednesday morning* and I must have missed the call from my doctor.  I triple checked.  I'm signed up to receive multiple forms of contact.  No emails or portal messages or anything.  There are even some abnormalities noted on the report, which I thought typically meant the patient was contacted as soon as the information had become available.  Funny thing about the MRI report, it came back noting I had ""right sided neck pain"".  My pain is on the left.  I don't know who's fault that is.  It's like they're throwing darts at a board.  So now I have these reports that I have to second-guess because my provider gave the radiologist shoddy/incomplete information about my case.  I'm taking drugs that interact with each other because it's the only solution I've been offered.  The diagnosis I spent over $10,000 resolving in 2015 is now being changed by someone who isn't even technically a doctor.  I know I haven't been physically injured by anyone, but does any of this sound like malpractice?  I don't even like the idea of suing anyone, but this illness has caused me a great deal of disability and I am now looking at a situation where I may have wasted almost two thousand dollars on scans that need to be re-done because somebody else didn't do their job.  Sorry for the length of this post I'm just very wound up about the whole thing and have no idea how much of this I should consider acceptable or how I should proceed with handling it.  Thanks in advance."	Yes
86	"Personally, I'm more leaning towards the mechanic (my friend) being at fault for failing to follow safety precautions.  When someone hands you a Rifle, the first thing you do is check if it is loaded, even if you literally just witnessed that person emptying the Rifle right in front of you.  In the same way I feel like a car mechanic should do the same and follow basic safety precaution, like checking if the car is indeed in park before starting.    But then, I'm not sure how stupid another human being has to be to hand someone a loaded Rifle and tell them ""Oh it's not loaded""... aka 'Let's leave my car in Drive, turn off ignition and invite a car mechanic to do repairs on your car'.  I feel like the Customer does have some liability in this case, but I'm not a lawyer.    Also, I believe it was an older car that made it possible for this stupidity to happen.  I'm not a car expert but I'm pretty sure you have to step on the brakes before ignition on modern cars?  At least that's the way I learned in Driver's Ed when I was 16.  Always step on brakes before starting.    No one got hurt, the repair amount is really small, I think about $500 bucks for minor bumper damage.    But I'm wondering ultimately who is at fault considering the possibility that someone could have actually died from this.    I should probably post this in /r/Justrolledintotheshop/ or /r/mechanics and ask them as I'm sure the mechanics on there have plenty of prior cases similar to this.  Take care out there guys, there are many idiots out there that could kill you.  Anytime, anywhere."	Yes

88	During a tag type game in gym, my son (age 12) suffered two breaks in his wrist when he ran into the unpadded wall while being pursued.  The school has been making accommodations for his injury (a  buddy to write, etc.), but they wouldn't show the gym to my wife. She found a picture online (linked below). Most of the wall is uncovered.  I have never brought legal action in my life. However, there will be medical bills from this, and other kids could be hurt in the future if the school does not add more padding. Wondering if I should contact an attorney, or if I should just go to the school with the medical bills and request they pay and also add more padding.

89	Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	Yes
90	I am not interested in suing Starbucks. I quite like their establishment.   Out of curiosity...  Today I ordered a soy latte. They gave me one with 2% milk. Now I have diarrhea because I'm lactose intolerant. I brought the drink to the barista and told her it was incorrect. She remade the drink and gave me a $4 gift card. (Not sure why it wasn't $6 considering that's the cost of a latte.) I told her the card wasn't necessary but she insisted I have it anyway. Does accepting the card diminish my ability to win a lawsuit?   Does Starbucks give out gift cards as a sneaky method to later state the person affected was compensated?	Yes
91	"I'm currently in a 1 year lease for an apartment. It's a multi dwelling apartment, meaning that we have separate entrances, and separate driveways.  However we have an upstairs neighbor, and she has been very nasty to us.  We started to get weird vibes from her from the beginning, like she is nice to us, but only when other people are around. (Like the landlord, her neighbors, or sometimes her friends.) But when see her and no one else is around, she is cold and curt. Sometimes she would just ignore us.  For example, when we moved in the landlord said to work out parking spots with her. There is our driveway (which is insanely steep), and then a little 2 car lot at street level which is her driveway (she only has 1 car). you can also fit a car parallel to the road next to a power line pole. She said ""yeah it's really whatever, first come first serve. We just kind of figure it out. It's not assigned parking spots"" seemed pretty chill.  Actually on the night before we toured the unit before we knew that we had it, someone had ran into her car which damaged her parking so only 1 car fits there until they fix it, so she got the OK from the neighbor across the street (super kind and generous man.) to park in his dirt lot which can hold like 6-8 cars.  an example of weird vibes is that, before we had finished moving in, my father in law and I were bringing a couch I had bought, we didn't cover it and it started raining right as we got into town. We parked in one of the spots that was supposedly cool to park in, but she got home shortly after and was very impatient with us and was really demanding, asking us how long we are gonna be there cause she has a friend coming over (meanwhile it's raining and the couch I bought is getting wet). so I asked if we should park in the dirt lot, and she loudly said ""NO"".  she had the unit to herself for a few months before we signed our lease, so we are thinking she got used to how things were?  She sent us texts at 4:30pm when we were moving in saying that we were being too loud, and we apologized and explained why the sound was happening to which she replied ""great""  She send us another text, at about 9:40pm on a Saturday night, asking ""do you have carpets yet? maybe that would help..."" this was during my 'bachelor party' (I just had some friends over to play video games before I got married)  Since then she has had many parties (outside on her deck) that go late (11:00pm, 12:00am, 1:00am) on a weeknight, at one point she had a party go until 2:45am on a Friday night, with loud music, stomping (not walking, stomping), and when my wife and I woke up we noticed there were cigarette butts on our deck.. our deck that's covered in dry leaves.  Anyways.. a week or 2 after that, we were almost done unpacking. We had been given a piece of furniture by my sister and we decided to get rid of it by putting it in our driveway (not in the street) with a free sign on it.  we had seen the other neighbors leave stuff out with free signs, like a couch, an aquarium, and a cat jungle gym. There is no HOA here either.  She texted us about it, at which point we texted the landlord asking if what we did was ok, he said it was fine. So we replied, and explained that we saw the other neighbors do it, and that the landlord said it was ok. but we apologized that it was bothering her and that we would move it when we got home (we were out at dinner).  She replies with a lot of condescension and sarcasm, and claims that she has never seen anyone put furniture out on our street, and that she would never do that ""that's what the dump is for"" and that we need to remember that she lives here too, and that her associates come over.  we decided not to respond to that because it was obviously a lost cause (we suspect she had been drinking because there were a lot of typos). When we got home, the Futon was gone. we thought someone had taken it (it was dark), but when we walked down our driveway we saw that she (presumably) had dragged/pushed it down the driveway. We can't prove it was her. but it would make sense.  there was a huge scrape mark going down the length of the driveway, and the leg of the furniture was bent from being dragged.  we felt like that was an invasion, we didn't feel safe. It was a totally aggressive and dramatic move. not to mention completely unnecessary because we said we would move it. At that point we contacted our landlord to let him know what happened. he said he was unsure of what to do, if he should call her, or wait until his next time coming down (some contractors had done repairs) which he said would be ""in the coming weeks""  we said we would prefer it if he came down so the 4 of us could talk. we didn't want him to call her, because she could just make stuff up. also because she isn't nasty when he's around, we felt like it would help us all reach a amicable solution if he was there as an arbiter.  he said he would come down, but that was more than a month ago.  One night when we were showering, we heard really loud and startling stomping above our heads. We finished our shower and when we got out of the shower we saw that our neighbor had texted my wife using all caps, asking if we just started a load of laundry at 12:00am. - when we do something she doesn't like, she ramps up to 60mph at the drop of a hat, and does something physical.  Based on earlier events, we didn't reply to this text at all. But I emailed my landlord about it.  I didn't feel like we owed it to her to respond to her abusive texts if she's going to be rude and aggressive. and as the days went by we kept showering whenever we wanted to.  She stomped a few more times (at one point even doing like 'marching band' stomping.. it's hard to explain, but doing it with both feet very fast and very loud)   and at one point she texted my wife again and said that ""she had a meeting early the next morning and our late laundry is disturbing her sleep""  So I (hesitantly) replied on my phone that ""Hello &lt;neighbor&gt;. We actually haven't ever done laundry past 9:00pm, what you're hearing is our shower""  She was sarcastic in her response.. ""so? whatever it is is keeping me up at a very late hour""  This was kind of annoying to us, because she has people over stomping right above our heads several times a month late into the night, and after they leave she is cleaning up moving furniture around slamming it down on her deck.  I've been emailing all of this as it develops to my landlord, he was surprised at her response and expected her to be more laid back (don't really know why.. considering the furniture incident). My landlord said, if she complains again, just tell her that we hear her when her friends are over and lived with it.  A few days later we had to contact him again because our dryer had gone out and we were working on replacing it. He actually said our neighbors dryer went out too (and she left it on the hill outside of our bathroom window...) which angered me because she was harassing us about our furniture but she leaves her dryer outside of our window? I moved it a few feet over because I didn't want to see it, and I didn't want to contact her about it. (then the next day she left a cardboard box to a new samsung phone in the same exact spot...)  He said he has been busy with work and unable to come down, but in the meantime, if we see her, if we bump in to her, then should try to talk to her for a few minutes and just say ""look , we want to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers, but when you have friends over late we hear that too and lived with it."". He has been sympathetic to us, but hasn't actually done anything yet. He said that if she is disrespectful again, then he will call her himself, he also said if it was him, he wouldn't want to live here either.  Since her text we had tried to get our showers done earlier (before 11:00pm). Some of the times she has stomped it was when she was clearly awake. We will drive up to our house and see her flipping channels on her TV, we can hear her walking around, calling her cat inside, and on the phone etc... But as soon as we get in the shower she starts stomping. and complains that we are 'waking her up'  So just last week my wife and I shower at 10:30pm, and we hear her start stomping around above us.. I didn't know what to do, so my wife and I wrote a text on my phone but didn't send it, we wanted to sit on it.  We decided, if we saw her the next day, we would try talking to her. But if we didn't we would text her. I felt like I should text her soon because my family was coming over for the long 4th of July weekend, and I didn't want her to be stomping if they needed to shower. (we had a beach day + dinner planned, so I knew we were gonna get back late)  Well we didn't see her, so I texted her Monday July 3rd while we were at dinner saying:  ""Good evening neighbour.  I was wondering if you were stomping again during our shower last night? I guess even if you weren't, I wanted to say some things and try to clear the air.  We want to be able to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers. But here's the thing.... when you have your friends over with music playing late at night during the week, we hear that. and we've lived with it. In May you had people over until almost 3am with really loud stomping and music right above our heads as we were trying to sleep. I've even heard you take a hammer to your floor at 11:00pm You woke us up this morning at ~7:40am. with your banging furniture around on your deck right above our bedroom.  Because we live under you, we hear a lot more than you might realize, but we've lived with it.  Live and let live, that's what we've been trying to do.  We've been accommodating and respectful to you. That's all we are asking in return.""  to which she replied:  ""I think u need to learn how to live with neighbors.. have you ever lived in a multiple dwelling place before?  There is etiquette involved...and waking people up late (10pm-6am)cause thats when u decided to take a shower is not cool.    Having friends over...talking...listening to music at a reasonable hour is cool.    Leaving your trash / used furniture out on the side of the road with a Free sign on it like you just moved into the ghetto is not cool.  Having friends over ONCE in 3 months late on a Friday night is cool.    Not communicating concerns you have to your neighbor and instead hitting them with an Uber long text on a monday night....not cool  Having 3 gorgeous decks and wanting to sit outside at 8am is absolutely ok.  It is not my fault you choose to keep non-business hours. Stop taking showers late (after 10pm) and everything will be okay on my end.    If my friends stay past 10pm on a weeknight and we are loud...absolutely let me know and we will move it inside.  But if I have friends over 2-3 times a year...late on a Friday or Saturday night....suck it  buttercup.     You may want to have people over too...and you know what...i won't say anything 2-3 times a year And no....you haven't been accommodating and respectful....you have been disdainful and rude.  You didn't even acknowledge me outside one day.. walked right past me.....i smiled said hi....u were completely disrespectful and rude. I think I have addressed all your concerns.  Have a good night""  After she sent that, I emailed my landlord again.  He replied July 4th in the morning and he said he was frustrated and didn't know what to do. In the 12 years he's owned the place he's never had this problem. He said if we wanted him to, he could call her.  We spent 2 nights at my in laws because being home was too stressful at this point. We were sacred of how she would react when he called her, and we were scared to go home. Even taking a shower at my in laws was stressful. My wife has severe anxiety, and to be honest this situation is giving me a lot of anxiety too.  I emailed my landlord on the 5th, asking if he had called her yet. and he said he hasn't called her because he wanted to enjoy the holiday without any drama.  I haven't heard anything from him since then.  However since then I've looking into taking legal action (trying to get a free consultation from a lawyer here). I don't know what the landlord is going to do, if anything. or if talking to her is going to help anything at all (or make it worse).  When she dragged our futon around, was that vandalism? Should we have called the police? is it too late to call now?  Is what she's doing defined as harassment? Is that enough for us to get out of a lease? Is there any other legal action we can take?  We are scared to bump into her.. and she is always on her wrap around deck above us which means if we use our deck we would have to see her.  Rent isn't cheap in California, and if my landlord isn't gonna do anything I don't see why I need to pay thousands more dollars to be living under a bully with this stress. We have family willing to take us in until we find a new place.  We are very skeptical that he will evict her."	Yes
92	"Located in North Dakota.   PICTURES OF DAMAGE ARE LINKED AT BOTTOM OF POST  I posted in this subreddit a few weeks ago. Long story short, I own a twinhome. My neighbors are renters. One of my neighbors moved their sump pump hose right outside my basement window, and it proceeded to come into my basement destroying my carpet and padding.   It was suggested in here to file an insurance claim, which I did.   First I filed with my own insurance company, and they said they wouldn't cover it as they would consider it to be ""flood damage"" and I don't have flood coverage. They suggested to file a claim through the other homeowners policy policy, and it may fall under their liability coverage.   So that's what I did. His insurance company sent out an adjustor, inspected the damage, and did his thing. A week later, I got a call from the insurance company saying they wouldn't cover it, since it wasn't their insured (the actual homeowner) that caused the damage, but rather the person renting the home from him. I asked if the homeowner has any liability for his renters actions, and the insurance company said no, not at all.   So now I'm in my present situation.  I paid 2300 dollars for carpet and padding, which is going to be installed on Tuesday. Admittedly, this carpet is nicer than the carpet I had to take out (5 dollars a Sq foot as opposed approx 3 dollars a Sq foot for the original).   I know my neighbor isn't going to want to pay for the damages they caused, as that is the nature of negligent neighbors. So I'm guessing my ultimate course of action will be to take them to small claims court. I'm only really armed with pictures of the damage as well as pictures of where my neighbor left his sump pump hose. Is this enough to get a judgment in my favor? I've never gone to court for anything, so any opinions are appreciated.    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-FrQKc4fy6qVEFxemdpblNBN2c?usp=sharing"	Yes
93	I know it was fucked up what I did but I did it. So I work in my dads business (I dropped out of college but am working my way back currently). There's a regular who is married, we would make small talk here and there and we eventually exchanged snapchats. Anyway she vented to me about her marriage, all the problems with it.  Short story is we started seeing each other and having sex. This went on for a few months until we were caught in a parking lot together. To make it easier to understand our families are both from cultural/traditional backgrounds, so word about our affair spread quick.  Her husband has threatened to kick my ass, gave my dad's business negative reviews on google saying they hire people who fuck other guys wives. His family started harassing me/ talking shit about me on social media. I started ignoring it as it died down but the husband wouldn't stop this shit, he hates me I get it. I did apologize.  Anyway he came into the store once and started making personal remarks to me, I had enough so I told him I didn't regret any of it. We're both from religious backgrounds and everybody knows about our affair now. I feel like I'm being blamed more than his wife and I'm tired of it. I made a mistake. I've lost friends over this and my family is angry with me. I just want people to get off my back and get this dude to leave me alone already.	Yes
94	"I was in my car driving toward my home last night when a maniac on a motorcycle was driving right on the lines. It was immature and I regretted it almost immediately but I flipped him off. This angered him, and he began to chase me on his bike. I tried to shake him off for around fifteen minutes but he swerved in and out of traffic, and ran some red lights to try catching me. At one point, he smashed my mirror, and I began to get too scared to focus driving. I crashed right into a light post, and totaled my car. Luckily, I wasn't injured... Guy fled the scene almost immediately.   I filed a police report but they told me they didn't see evidence of having been chased. I got the breathlyzer because they assumed I might have been under the influence. I called the insurance provider, and they told me they might not cover me if the investigation deems it ""my fault"".  What are my options now? What steps should I take to bring that maniac to justice, and repair my wrecked car? Any recourses? What if the police deem it to be my fault? What then?"	Yes
95	I’ve had this phone number for nearly 2 years now. And when I first got the phone number i would receive unwanted calls but that’s normal. I Would inform them this is no longer “so and so’s” phone number and then would block them. Over the course of time I’ve learned the previous phone number holders name and nicknames but that’s about it. Since the beginning of December I’ve been getting calls from this woman who would call looking for “so and so” and i would tell her “this isn’t ‘so and so’s’ number anymore and then would block it.” But she managed to keep getting new phone numbers and continuing to call. It turned into this degrading competition to her to see how many nasty things she could call me. I told her the whole story. How i have had the phone number for a while and that that’s how i knew who the previous owner was but that i didn’t know him in real life and she wouldn’t believe me. She would call and say awful things. Calling me a “scary ass bitch.” “That I’m just a little side hoe” that i was nothing but a “little piece of ass” for this man. So i put her phone number into Facebook and sure enough i found her and where she lives and all about her. Mind you any time she would call from a new number i would continue to block it. Then she decided to start calling from No Caller ID which i couldn’t block. I would get 40 phone calls in 5 minutes from this woman. Continuing to leave voicemails and call me horrible things. Now she’s threatening to show up to the previous phone number owners home and “beat the fuck out of me” i told her I’m filing a police report. But I’m not sure how to go about that. I’ve never had to do this before. I seriously want her to learn a lesson. She’s nearly 40 years old. It’s not like she’s a 16 year old little girl who’s got her britches up her butt. This is a grown woman calling and harassing and threatening me and I’m only barely turning 20.   Suggestions? And how should i go about filing a report?   Thank you so much in advance.	Yes
96	Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
97	I'm just wondering if I'm opening myself up to anything here. I bought a car last year and was told that it had a clean title. When I asked if it had been in any accidents they avoided the question. I Carfaxed the car a couple months ago and found out it was a total loss rebuilt that is somehow not marked on the title.   I submitted a BBB complaint and the owner has done nothing but make up lies, saying I was told about the damage and repair before purchase, and even lying by saying I hadn't driven the car prior to purchase.  It's ridiculous, and at this point if I'm not going to be compensated I will make sure others know about their practices.	Yes
98	This is in Brooklyn, NY. Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage.   Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,  The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.  When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.  The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife.   The body damage is just cosmetic so it wouldn't be thousands (I don't think) to fix, but it would be at least a few hundred, maybe more. I'm also really anxious about what was done in my car without me knowing and how often this might have happened. I am due to move out of state this Thursday, 7/13, so I'll be severing my relationship with the garage anyway, but I'd appreciate any advice on how best to proceed. Thanks!	Yes
99	I've run into a bit of an issue with my dishwasher and I would be interested in getting your opinions on how to resolve it.  The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.  After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.  After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options:  -Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher  -40% off a new Bosch replacement.  I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?  The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.  What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this?   A 40% discount would have seemed to be a fair, good faith resolution if it wasn't for the inflated pricing and all of the associated inconveniences.	Yes
100	"I posted this originally in /r/relationships and was told I should speak to the police and/or an attorney about a restraining order. I wanted to post here and make sure taking these steps would be worth my time. Here's the situation:  I dated my ex-boyfriend my first semester at university (7.5 years ago). We dated casually (I was seeing other people) for about 6 months, and then he asked for us to be exclusive. I met his parents shortly after when they came to visit him at the university over the summer. My parents were also visting at the time, and they all seemed to hit it off, even exchanging contact information so my dad and his could go golfing sometime (which I'm sure was just my father being curteous, but I digress).   The following semester, my ex-boyfriend started to show his true colors. He began yelling at my both in public and private if I cursed, dressed provocatively (wearing shorts or a tank top), or if he felt I was disrespecting him. I ended the relationship shortly after. This is when his harassment started.   My ex-boyfriend would text and call me and my best friend non stop about why I left him and how he was going to kill himself. I ignored this, I knew he was just being manipulative. He started accusing my best friend of ""stealing"" me from him and turning me into a lesbian. We continued to ignore this crazy train and eventually it slowed down.   When I went home at Christmas to visit my parents I learned that my ex boyfriends FATHER had been calling my dad about the break up. He said his son had bought an engagement ring and we owed their family for the expense. My dad just laughed it off, thankfully. Nothing ever came of this.   Fast forward to now. My ex-boyfriend hasn't done much for the past two or three years to me. But my current partner and I just got engaged and my ex-boyfriend found out (I'm guessing via social media?). My partner was faculty at the university I attended. We started seeing each other at some point while I was still a student. He has since left the university and obviously I graduated. A few people knew about our relationship and ignored it; we were in different colleges and were never public about our relationship. But my ex-boyfriend has now begun harassing him on social media and even got his office phone number and is threatening to ""out"" us to all of my partner's colleagues. I don't think anything would come of it, albeit some embarrassment, but the bigger problem is that this guy is still obsessed.   I have no idea how to get this guy to stop. I've tried blocking him, obviously he's still vindictive as ever. I feel like I'm trapped in a teenage drama. I'm not a child anymore and I want this all to stop. But I'm scared to talk to him either over the phone, via email or face to face for fear of inflaming this issue even further.   Also, in case this is of relevance: I currently live in California and the guy harassing me resides in Georgia.    TL;DR my crazy ex-boyfriend won't let things go 5 years later. No idea how to get him to stop. Not sure if I need to seek legal council."	Yes
101	So, my car was stolen earlier this week and was found in a parking lot last night (completely trashed, very likely totaled). In it was a sentimental item (wristwatch from a deceased relative) and some important paperwork containing sensitive personal information (SSN, bank and investment account info, etc.). Both are gone... the watch isn't really replaceable given the sentimental aspect, and the aftermath of the loss of that paperwork has/will cost me thousands of dollars between money being frozen and unable to move and so forth.   Speaking with the detective handling the investigation this morning, I asked about pressing charges if they find a suspect and he explained that DNA and/or prints don't stand on their own... if (*if*) he finds a suspect he'll basically need to get a confession out of them to pursue anything, at which point the state will press charges automatically regardless of my feelings on the matter.   So my question is, considering the items that were in the vehicle and... you know, them stealing the car in the first place... if a suspect is found by DNA or print matches, is that enough to build a civil suit on even if it isn't enough for a criminal case?	Yes
102	I know this is super petty and I'm new to this subreddit but my ex has a Reddit account that he's been posting personal details of our relationship in. This is information that may seem like no big deal in general but is information that can cause trouble for me down the line and is, I guess, character defamation. Is there anything I can do here in order to get him to stop posting personal details? I've already had a friend and family member comment on his posts cuz they've come across them and I'm worried about him saying something that might put me in hot water. Any advice would be extremely helpful, thanks.	Yes
103	EDIT: This was in Indiana  Hello all. Made an alt account to ask for help.  1 weekend ago I went to a rather large cosplay convention in another city and went about my day. I went with a group of 3 and we were a Zelda BoTW group cosplay. Anyway, it has been brought to our attention that some photographer at the convention had taken pictures of random passerbys (couples, single adults, even kids!) in cosplay, and he posted our picture online to sell. One of the photos was of my group. I am the only person in our group under the age of 18, and I do not feel comfortable with my face in cosplay being on a website where someone can buy the picture. He never asked us for a waver to sign, he just took them without our consent.  We contacted the people who run the convention and they contacted the photographer, and he said its legal because the convention center is a public venue and he will not take them down. I don't think he even bothered to ask the staff if anyone under the age of 18 complained.  I know taking pictures and videos of people in public is legal, but I do NOT want my picture being sold. Is there anything I can do?	Yes
104	"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, and it's very long, but I'll give it a shot. Disclaimer: I already know I made poor choices and deserved what I got. Just asking for advice.   I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know).   Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be  a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point.   We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to  get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open.  I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?  Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.  Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did? I was terrified out of my mind..you can't just drive off with someone against their will. Or can you?"	Yes
105	I'll keep it short.  Had skype sex with boyfriend of 4 years while he was overseas. He took explicit screenshots of the skype sex without my permission and I found them hidden on his computer. Was he legally allowed to take the nude photos or is it only illegal if he starts sharing them?   Worked the situation out with the BF, deleted the pictures, and reestablished my boundaries, but I just want to know what my legal rights are in case I run into this situation again.	Yes
106	Looking for legal advice on the below situation. My neighbor had a tree (about 50 ft tall) in their property that was adjacent to my garden and separated by a fence. Today they hired a landscape who cut all the branches of the tree while i was at work. A large number of the branches fell into my garden, destroying a good part of my garden and leaving a large amount of debris in my garden.  What recourse do i have available?  Am i entitled to compensation? Who would be responsible for this, my neighbor or the landscaper?  Thanks.	Yes
107	I'm living in Indiana. My girlfriend was on seekingarrangements and she met up with this investment banker who said he was making 500k a year and was going to pay her $500 to meet him at a hotel. At the hotel, she gets a bad feeling about him and says that never mind she doesn't want to go through with it. He hadn't paid her anything yet. He got all angry then saying she wasted his time and had to at least suck his dick. He was going to let her leave. So she pulled a gun on him and he was scared and gave her the money. She blocked him on seekingarrangement but he had her number so he texted her and found her address and facebook and is threatening to come over to her house and report her to the police and tell them that he robbed her. But really, can he even do that since what he was doing is against the law too.	Yes
108	"So I just was told by by my neighbor that their dog was attacked (badly apparently) by mine, in my backyard. It is not fenced, but has an electric fence. My dog will not leave but it doesn't prevent anything else from coming in obviously. If this is true, am I liable for any injuries? Does homeowners cover this?  Also part 2 of the question: my dog has never shown any aggression to other dogs, she has no scratches or cuts, there is no blood on her at all(she has white fur so it would be super easy to see). Frankly, I'm not convinced she did this at all. But if I didn't see the ""incident"" is it basically just his word against nothing? I took pictures of my dog as soon as he told me but other than that I don't have any proof of anything."	Yes
109	"Hello. This sort of thing never happens to me when I'm out so I'm just looking for advice/info.  My friends and I were out at a bar last night, one friend and I were a bit drunk and being stupid, there was a cup of plastic forks/knives on the table and we spilled it over (admittedly this was immature and stupid on my end but I would have cleaned it up). As we do this a bartender walks up to my friend and grabs his shirt and demands he comes with him. So I interjected and said no don't go with him. Then another bartender comes up and physically slams me to the ground, then straddles on top of me for over a half hour. Meanwhile he is aggressively pulling my left arm over my throat and choking me, so I try to fight back and get him off me. He's also laughing at me and saying things like ""you're a faggot. You can't do shit. No one is going to help you"". Then my cell phone falls out of my pocket and another worker walks over, picks it up and takes it away somewhere.  Eventually after a half hour of struggling they let me up and leave, and I had to argue with multiple workers to give me my property back. The guys wouldn't give me their names of course.  I woke up today with a large bruise on my right arm, my left rotator cuff is killing me, and my neck is red.  They could have easily asked us to leave or thrown me out the door, but instead they brought me close to the back of the restaurant and assaulted me.   Can businesses/bars do this to customers? Do I have any legal action I can take? Multiple of my friends witnessed and are willing to testify.   Thanks so much. This was ridiculous."	Yes
110	Sorry for the spam guys, I made an earlier thread claiming it was Customer that left it in Drive but turns out it was a Mechanic #1 instead after confirming the story with my friend.    Going to make easy simplified bullet points of the scenario:  - Mechanic #1 works on Car. - For some reason leaves Car in Drive while ignition is off.  - Mechanic #1 stops working on car and Mechanic #2 to start working on it. - Mechanic #2 starts the car (from outside the driver window) - Car rolls due to being in Drive and crashes against wall causing minor bumper damage.    Both Mechanics are now pointing fingers at each other.	Yes
111	"Il  I was stupid and lucky. I parked somewhere with free parking for an event at a con. Only rule I could see was ""No overnight parking"". I get back to my car around 1am to someone calling  in my car to be towed. He said that once the mall closes you can't be parked there and it's a big fine. Luckily he let me go.   Now, this is just for curiosity sake, but he put a big sticker on my car window. On the driver's side back one. It isn't coming off easy, it's ripping like a sticker does and is leaving behind sticky shit. It's irritating. Is it legal for someone to vandalize my car like that?"	Yes
112	I’m not sure where this falls as My knowledge of all this stuff is pretty much zero, would appreciate some help.   Riding bicycle this afternoon and I hit a huge unmarked pothole. Flipped over and messed up my knee pretty bad. I called 311 but was told, after they asked if I needed an ambulance which I said no to, I have to go into police station to make an accident report.   Went home cleaned myself up then visited hospital. Will be going back after the hospital to accident sight and take pictures of pothole then will go to police station to file accident report and provide all the paperwork from hospital.   As this was an unmarked pothole in the bike lane will the hospital bill and bike damage bill fall on the city of Chicago to pay? Or am I paying for this myself even though it wasn’t my fault? I am uninsured at the moment but will be insured at the end of August through my colleges insurance plan which I filled out paperwork for already.   Thanks for your time	Yes
113	"Hi guys, sorry if this takes a while to read. I thank you for your patience.  To make a long story short: two months ago, someone messaged me asking for help with an investment fund. He said that he had spend 13 years working on an software trading program that accurately predicts the foreign exchange market. I realized that he was woefully unprepared to run or manage a fund and consulted him on how to set up a fund. He likely was not going to pay me but that's fine, I wanted him to succeed as accomplish his goals. I later realized that it was very unlikely he had programmed an worthwhile arbitrage code, as he claimed to have, because he showed a lack of understanding for basic macroeconomic concepts. Furthermore, his trading policies involve SEC violations and using boiler room tactics for obtaining funding. Additionally, he nonchalantly expressed that he could choose however much to give back to investors, whenever--indicating a ponzi scheme like distribution. When I expressed my disagreements, he commanded me to get back in line and told me to get him ""operating capital"" for his fund. He had also mentioned knowing cartel members (with implied threat), and saying that he wanted to work with them, thus signaling a money laundering scheme. I requested that he stop what he was doing and told him that I will not be providing him with operating capital. He then told me that he had recorded all of our conversations and will release all my information public (where I work, live, etc.). He will then call my workplace and pretend to be a client being harass by me, as well as actively seek out my clients and harass them. The gist of his intent is that it'd be easier for me to bribe him to stop, then to file all the legal proceedings to sue him. Furthermore, he is seeking out attorneys to assist him in harassing me as well as file a lawsuit for having called what he was doing a ponzi scheme.  --- My question is this: Assuming that he finds a corrupt attorney willing to assist him, do I have the grounds to sue this attorney for morality clause violations?"	Yes
114	My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes
115	"I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.  He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.  The day of my flight to California I texted him to confirm that he could still host me, still wanted me to come, and could still afford everything. I even told him if money was an issue for him we could reschedule and I could meet him another time.  I got on my flight, and when I landed and called him he told me his check didn't go through, and that I was on my own. I have his address, his full name, as well as some of his family members added on Facebook.  I have incurred costs from a hotel, as well as a very expensive flight back home 2 days later. I had planned to stay 2 weeks, but since he would not even agree to meet out of embarrassment I decided to leave ASAP.  Could I legally take him to court because he agreed over text and email? I had asked him multiple times, as late as before I even boarded the plane to make sure he still wanted me to come and was able to host me during my stay.   I wouldn't have got on the plane if he had just told me he didn't have the money. I'm incredibly upset by the whole situation and at this point I just want the money back for the 2 nights at the hotel and the flight back home.   Would suing him in small claims be realistic or do verbal or text agreements not hold up in small claims court?   I have him plenty of oppurtunities to speak up and potentially mitigate and costs I would incur but he literally waited until he knew I was on my way. The last text I got before landing was ""are you ok the plane?"" To which I told him I was boarding. I honestly think the guy did it purposefully. Do I have a chance at winning a suit against him if I file? The total cost for the 2 nights and the flight was $976.40."	Yes
116	"I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...  tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.  Full story: I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail).   The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.  I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.  A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.  I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.  So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.  So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily."	Yes
117	I bought hot pepper extract that's 500 times hotter than a jalapeno pepper. I am thinking of putting it in my boss's coffee when he is away from his desk. What will happen when I do so?	Yes
118	"A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.  State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.  The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.  Now this is where it gets really shady. Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.  So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!"	Yes
119	"So my dog and I were attacked by a loose dog about a year back, I fronted all vet and hospital bills, and we're about to go into mediation with the dog's owner. Thankfully, my pup recovered very well, and the worst I've got on my end is numbness on one pinky and a bad scar on the other hand.  What really gets me is that Animal Control was familiar with the family (recurring), and the owner relocated the animal citing, ""we're not sure how she reacts to smaller dogs and children."" I assume everything is based on actual damages, but the recurring theme and the fact the dog was moved into another home without notice makes me feel like it's going to happen again. Is this something to bring up in mediation?"	Yes
120	So this morning I woke up and let my 2 dogs out to go potty. They are both very small dogs, a chihuahua and a yorkie. I went back upstairs to get ready for work when I heard what I thought to be my two dogs fighting with each other.   So I came downstairs again, holding my 8 month old this time  and checked my back yard. This is when I saw the neighbors dog had my chihuahua in its mouth by the belly and was flinging her around.    I yelled for my husband to come down , he opened the door and the dog ran into their property through the hole he had made in the fence.    I didn't initially open the door since I didn't want him to charge at me while I was holding my daughter.  My husband then told me to call the police while he tended to our dog who could barely even move.   When the police officer arrived he was really mad. He said he has had calls about these neighbors multiple times for their dog. It is illegal to own a Pitbull in our county. And he said they cited them multiple times for it. He took our statements and went to speak with them. He took their dog in his patrol car.   The officers gook pictures of the fence, my dog and theirs. I did as well.    We took my dog to the vet and she passed away a few hours later.  I called the officer to let him know so that he may add it to his report.   I am not sure what our next step should be. I am worried about retaliation from them since they have caused problems before.    We have our suspicions about the death of our other chihuahua, and we think they might have fed her marijuana. The vet said she had died of marijuana poisoning (?). No one in our house smokes, but we know that they do since they do it in their front porch often.    It is too late to do anything about that but I feel they will try to hurt our other dog since this happened. We plan on getting cameras to monitor the back yard.    The officer suggested I take them to court over the vet bills (this was before our dog died). I don't know how any of that works.   We just bought our house a year ago so moving is not an option. They are renting, so I don't know if this is grounds for eviction from the landlord.    Please tell me what my next step should be.	Yes
121	"Note: Posted in r/relationships and r/askto first, someone suggested you'd be a better resource.   Hey Reddit,  I live in a condo in a town about 45 min north of Toronto, Canada. My neighbors (we share one of those metal walls on our balcony, so sound basically is like it's right beside each other) they were blasting music from about 3pm to 11:07pm on Sunday night, specifically to affect us. I found out from their drunk rants back and forth that they are upset that I sometimes play metal music after work (I've never got a complaint from them before). I'll play music sometimes off my cell phone or off my TV, but they had a very loud sound system blasting oldies rock (van halen, AC/DC, etc) all day, while making jokes like ""hey Rocco think we should play some screamo music instead?"" He'd say ""nah I hate that shit, this is real music"". It's a man and woman, probably at least late 50s, my wife and I are mid 20's. (and Disturbed/System of a Down/ Otep is the music I think they're complaining about, certainly not screamo!)   Eventually we complained to security twice, they only answered the door to security for the first complaint, which I made on my way out of the building for a rec league sport I play downtown. My wife ended up feeling unsafe as she heard them after the complaint ""they don't know who they just fucked with, they'll regret this"", ""I'll fuck them up every chance I get"", ""we'll complain to security about every little thing they do now"", etc - those were all told to the security guard and added to their file (whatever that entails).   While I was out my wife went down to complain the second time, the male neighbor walked out of the parking garage, visibly intoxicated, was most likely driving just before that. He saw my wife making the complaint, both her and the security guard noticed that he almost fell over he was so drunk. I probably would have called the cops right then if I had seen that but neither of them did, pretty sure it's too late now.   According to my wife they then made more veiled threats to us talking with each other, my wife got scared and called me and I left my game early to come home. Neighbors continued drinking and playing music until 11:07pm, their son came out at around 10:30 and told them they should be careful because 11pm (official noise complaint time) was coming up, they just laughed at him (I'm guessing he's around 15ish, and I hear him smoking bongs on the balcony pretty often). He came out at another point and asked if they had any batteries and they just laughed at him and said ""what do you think we are, the dollar store?"" - obviously they're not the best parents and really drunk.   I took recordings with my phone of the loud music and backed them all up on iCloud. Even in the bathroom on the opposite side of the unit (950 sq ft), with my cellphone music at full blast and the fan on I could hear deep bass. Security entered our unit both times (at my wife's request) and noted the loud volume we could hear inside.  These neighbors are in at least their late 50s, maybe older. They don't seem to work at all, sound like they're straight out of Sunnyvale trailer park and best friends with Jim Lahey, they really just drink and smoke cigarettes all day. They and I smoke cigarettes so we're outside often at the same times (I've never talked to them before, I don't even know what they look like, but wife does). They rent, we own. Security guard told my wife that they and their landlord will be sent a complaint letter.   I'm worried that they'll cause more problems in the future, especially if I have music on that they can hear, it's the summer and I like to have the windows open and some music on for like half an hour when I get home from work most days, but I don't even own a stereo that could play music at even half the volume they had theirs on at today. I'll likely stop that or at least cut this back now.   Any suggestions? I'll call the cops if I need to (if this persists) but I really don't want to cause even more issues, these people sound like really vengeful children. I found the website for Toronto bylaw and it says noises at anytime, not just after 11pm that effect ""quiet enjoyment of a home"" can be grounds for a cop call, but  a) we're in a nearby town and I'm not sure if the bylaw is the same (couldn't find that online) and  b) we like to make noise too, we have the occasional party or times with loud music (but not as loud) - difference is if we get a complaint we've turned it down and apologized, not turn it up and make threats and loudly complain all day (only got one noise complaint in this building from a different neighbor and did exactly that, but have got some at past residences and did the same)  Any ideas Reddit?   Tl;dr - condo neighbors (who share balcony with metal wall between) wanted to get back at me for listening to normal-Volume music by blasting really loud oldies rock from 3pm to just after 11pm while drinking, we could overhear them making non-specific threats against us, wife got really scared. One of them likely drove really drunk during the day, but no proof of that."	Yes
122	"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
123	My girlfriends son is almost 2 years old. A few weeks ago he hurt his leg, and she took him the very next day to an urgent care facility. They did X-rays and stated a sprain. A week later he was still showing pain and swelling so she took him to another imaging facility who also stated sprain after additional X-ray. Today she is at Vanderbuilt with him and the doctora there are saying a fracture.  Is there any action that can be taken against the first two facilities?	Yes
124	"I was walking with my friends in a casino when out of nowhere some random guy intentionally strong armed me right in my pregnant belly, knocked all the water I had in my hand over. Security was literally 2 feet away from me and fid notthing. As I approached security and told them if they were going to do something about it they told me "" sorry were kinda busy right now escorting someone out"" and just left.  I started to feel short of breath and in pain literally 2 mins later. I went up to another security and told them of what happened and it wasn't until I told them I was pregnant and in pain that they started to take down a report. Do I have any legal recourse?  Went to hospital to check on baby and they said baby looks fine but to check up with my dr"	Yes
125	"Sorry if my post is a little messy, this just happened yesterday and I've been a complete wreck.  A little backstory: my cat was about 13 or 15 years old (I can't recall what age I adopted him, I think I was 7 or 8), and I'd had him since he was about three weeks old, and we grew up together. I have severe anxiety due to mental illness, childhood abuse, and the death of my father, and he was classified as a therapy animal by my therapist who'd I'd been seeing for four years at that point. He was my best and only friend and I'm just beside myself.  On Sunday I let my cat outside (he had arthritis and liked to lie out in the sun for a couple of hours before coming inside, I guess it helped because he started walking better once it got sunny) and went about my day. Later as I was outside, I saw a huge Boxer dog carrying something in his mouth; once I realized it was my cat, I streaked across the lawns to the neighbor's house where I basically had to fight the dog off my cat so I could hold him as he died in my arms. I was inconsolable and traumatized. The owner wasn't present, but her mother was and assured me that she was sorry and informed me that the young child in the house had incorrectly tethered the Boxer dog to its chain, causing it to break out of its yard and run into mine, where it found my cat.  After wrapping my cat up and talking to the owner when she got home, she apologized and offered to pay for any bills, which I accepted. I called a vet, got an estimate for cremation, and everything at that point seemed as settled as it could be.  I walked to her house this morning as I was headed over to the vet appointment to ask her for the finances she offered, and she refused, saying she didn't have the money and that she has leukemia and simply doesn't make enough to cover the bills. I told her I was sorry that she was ill but she is responsible for my cat's death and she needed to take responsibility, and she told me to contact her attorney. My mom offered to pay for my cat's cremation, but now I don't have money for an urn to put the ashes in (the vet doesn't offer free urns so it would come in a sealed bag).  **Since she told me to take her to court, I'm here asking for advice. Here's a TL;DR bulletpoint with information**  **My therapy cat was killed by an unleashed Boxer dog and the owner refuses to take financial responsibility.**  * The leash law in West Virginia states:   &gt; §19-20-13. Dog running at large; liability of owner.  &gt; Any owner or keeper of any dog who permits such dog to run at large shall be liable for any damages inflicted upon the person or property of another by such dog while so running at* large.  * My city within West Virginia's leash law states:  &gt;  The City Code of Ordinances Chapter 4 states that ""no person shall allow any dog owned by him or in his custody to run at large within the city. The term ""running at large"" means allowing a dog to leave the property limits of property owned, leased or occupied by its owner without restraint. The term ""restraint"" means being secured by a leash or lead, or being under the control of a responsible person and obedient to that person's command.""  * The owner admitted fault and offered to pay for damages * The owner then refused to pay for damages she previously offered * The owner requested that I take her to court * The owner verbally attacked me when I went to her house on Monday (I don't know if this is relevant but I'm including it) * The owner admitted negligence in allowing her young child to handle a Boxer dog three times her size (again I don't know if this is relevant but she admitted to being negligent in this respect) * The owner keeps three dogs in a 3x4 kennel in the backyard, which is way too small for the size of her dogs * The owner admitted that her Boxer dog was actually looking for a different cat that has been wandering around her yard lately, so she admitted to knowledge that her dog had vicious intent but did nothing to prevent it  I can't think of anything else. I don't want pain and suffering money, I don't want to hurt her, I just want her to pay for the price of my cat's urn. I want to put this behind me so I can grieve my best friend. I haven't had a day of restful sleep or without crying and and wailing into a pillow for two days. I'm really hoping you guys have any advice, and I thank you in advance."	Yes
126	N.CA   So I was involved in a collision like two weeks ago and my dumbass admitted fault because it was my first accident.  Talked to my adjuster (I have full coverage) and I told her how it happened and she told me that it was not completely my fault. My insurance already gave me a check for the damage of my car &amp; everything. Yesterday the other driver called me twice but I didn't answer because I was working, and today his insurance called wanting to talk about it and I told them they can talk to my adjuster if they have any questions. I'm freaking of maybe being sued, like the other guy was an Uber so he can claim lost wages, and everything I google leads me to law websites so I'm stressing.	Yes
127	I live in South Carolina. I saw my neighbors doing archery in the area on the side of their house which happens to run parallel to my privacy fence. I didn't think too much of it at the time. Later I found two arrows in my back yard. Now I'm afraid to let my kids play out there because I don't want them to get impaled by a rogue arrow.  Is there some regulating body I should report this to? Also is this something I should bring to the attention of the HOA?  I already plan to speak with them in person about the situation, but I figured I'd seek some advice before I do.	Yes
128	On September 4th, 2017; my father Tommy Wayne Baird jr was brutally beaten (held down, boot heel prints on each wrist, broken nose, sub dural brain bleeds, bruises all over his body, tased in the neck and chest with no defensive wounds, etc) and killed at the age of 49 by 4 Canton, MS police officers (of which 15 minutes of the killing was on Facebook live) after passing up an inspection sticker checkpoint and being followed for several miles while on his way to Jackson, Mississippi to get his PTSD medication from the VA clinic. He served two tours in Iraq and medically retired because of his PTSD. My father would never fight police and he did anything and everything for people; he would give you the shirt off his back if that's what it took. The articles in Mississippi news have slandered and made my father out to be a monster but he wasn’t. Any legal advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
129	"Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...  Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.  So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.  Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".  But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.  I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.  I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself. All I could picture were the pictures she used to send me. So without getting into detail, I got into my first fight. I regret in a way now, I didn't think I could go so far....  Tl:DR; Beat the shit out of a girls abusive boyfriend, no weapons involved. Definitely broke some bones. I am not proud of it believe me, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. I just want to know what to expect if he presses charges...   By the way, if the story is unnecessary let me know and I'll remove it, thank you."	Yes
130	My renter neighbors are incapable of following multiple HOA rules. I've tried talking to them, they just spurt a million excuses. The biggie is with vehicles. 24/7 they would work on their cars (fluid changes, brakes, you name it) and park in the street. We've been woken up multiple times by them working on loud cars in the middle of the night.    I finally snapped, took a photo of multiple infringements, and sent it to the HOA. First time filing a complaint, our HOA claims reports are anonymous. The HOA apparently forwarded my photo to the home owner, who then gave it to the renters.   A little about the photo: The people in the photo are in the (public) street, profile view, and too far away to get a proper ID. Their house is in the photo with it's house number legible. They of course have no way of proving specifically who took the photo, simply that it likely came from my house.   So anyway, renters come over furious and start spurting nonsense about having a police officer in the family and they said taking a photo like that was illegal and they could sue me, on and on. I told them to go ahead and do whatever they thought was necessary.   Now I'm second guessing myself. My understanding of photo/video/etc taking legality in Colorado, USA is that if that unless it's somewhere that privacy should be expected (ie a bathroom, changing room, etc) it's perfectly legal to take a photo of them without their consent. It is of course best to err on the side of caution, like definitely don't go taking photos through an open window, etc. A public street is clearly uh public, right?  Good news is they've ceased working on vehicles in the street.   Tl;dr Took a photo of my neighbors violating HOA regulations in the street, neighbors got ahold of the photo, and threatened to sue me.  And sorry, on mobile.	Yes
131	I've never had this sort of thing happen before and I'm not sure if I can even pursue anything. But I thought I'd put it out there. My girlfriends brother in law had to help dislodge it from my windpipe.	Yes
132	I have been living in my apartment for nearly 2 years now. Shortly after I moved in there was a leak in my ceiling that damaged my mattress beyond repair. My landlord grudgingly paid for me to replace it though angrily told me I could replace it for 50$. He is an angry cheapskate but told me it was fixed and we had no issues.  Fast forward to yesterday when the Same pipe burst. Soaking my mattress monitors and keyboard. I am looking at 500-600$ to replace them. Luckily for all products I have either receipts or amazon history for each purchase.   My landlord has been apologetic so far but is already talking about just giving me one of his used monitors when I fully intend for equal replacements.   As far as I know my landlord is responsible for the damages correct? I am comtemplating finding asking a lawyer or if it would even be worth going to court should this turn ugly.  I have taken pictures of all the damages and the burst pipe. Thoughts/advice?	Yes
133	"Context I got a really bad tattoo cover-up from one of the artists at this shop. Which is both unfortunate and confusing because she's done 2 other tattoos for me and did an amazing job. I'm glad I stopped her from finishing the shit show while I had the chance.   Now begins the task of finding someone to cover it up. This was going to be more difficult than I imagined. The artists I've contacted either want nothing to do with it, ignore me, or tell me they may be able to cover it up using a dragon or a snake. I've learned that my options are limited, and finding someone to collaborate a working design with is becoming less and less hopeful. I had one artist suggest tentacles, and when I asked if he had any other ideas he was offended and began preaching about ""how I'm the type of guy that needs everything in writing"" and emailed me later saying that ""He'd have to pass on the project"". The tattoo is so dark that another very reputable shop I contacted to cover it up said they could help me if I do tattoo laser removal to lighten it up as much as possible. Sounds like fun. No. $300 dollars and two excruciatingly painful sessions later, I saw zero results. Even the bits of the faded original tattoo you could see underneath showed no improvements. The nice lady that owns and operates the tattoo removal studio told me it could take up to 12 sessions to remove. I'm not willing to dump another $900+ and subject myself to more painful treatments on a gamble.  So I decide to try my luck again with a cover up and just black it out with a design. I've been told something organic like feathers works well for cover ups so I found some splatter like crow designs online and figured it would be dark enough to cover everything up. The same tattoo shop I got the bad cover up at has an artist named Thor there that does some really beautiful work. He's done two other smaller projects for me and he's a really nice guy, or so I thought. Now I know what you're thinking. ""Why the fuck would you go back to the same shop after the first bad tattoo? Don't you know how to learn lessons, stupid""?  Well hypothetical asshole, one of the artists there is actually a good friend of my girlfriends, and he suggested I talk to this Thor guy about covering it up for me. I call him, and he asks me to come in so he can take a look at it. I go in. His facial expression is concerning but he seems optimistic. He asks for a $60 deposit and we schedule a time for me to come in at 5 the following Monday. Thor requests some pictures for reference so he can draw a design around the dumpster fire tattoo, and that he'll send me what he comes up with so we can collaborate a design that will work and that I'll like. Sounds fucking great right? No. I finished work early that Monday and sent him a text telling him I could come early if he wasn't busy. He responds ""Nah bro"", and ""Actually if you wouldn't mind showing up about an hour later so at 6pm or so I just got a flat so I'm running late"". Sounds reasonable. Shit happens. Eventually, he tells me ""Actually I don't think that's gonna work I still have to do my first appointment before I can get yours"". So we reschedule for the following Friday at 12 when they open.  Friday couldn't come soon enough. I was really excited to get this butt butter of a tattoo covered up. Again. I had work but I busted my ass to get it done, commuted over an hour from the last customers location, bought water (over 105 degrees outside and I was on a motorcycle), paid for 2 hours of parking, and was on his shops doorstep by 11:55. Waiting on the bench, I watched the clock pass 12. I knock. No answer. So I send a text. To my extreme disappointment, but honestly not surprised because this fucking tattoo has cursed me, he responds ""I'm sorry bro I'm not going to be able to make it till 5 today"". Are you serious? I'm here and already paid for 2 hours of parking and have taken off work resulting in a loss of wages (Piece work pay). At this point I've lost trust and all faith in this tattoo shop. So I texted him back ""I'll come pick up my deposit later."" He responds ""Can't do that bro"", and my blood starts to boil. I say ""Whys that"", and he says ""Deposits are non refundable"". He never said anything about this and I didn't sign anything acknowledging it either. So I tell him ""I can take you to small claims court if you like"", and he responds ""Or you can be a man and just get your tattoo"". I can be a man really? Wouldn't a ""man"" be someone who shows up to his obligations? Wouldn't a ""man"" tell a paying customer before his appointment starts he's not going to make it? Wouldn't a ""man"" give someone their money back if they weren't happy with their services especially if he hasn't done any work for it? So, trying really hard to keep my composure, I respond ""I'm sitting outside your building right now. You steal clients money and then insult them. Not smart. I'll see you in court"". After that I get a steady stream of messages. He tells me ""sometimes shit happens"", and ""if you can't be a little patient and accept the situation for what it is then Unfortunately I'm sorry what else can I say"". He goes on to say ""You don't get your deposit back because that deposit goes towards research and development as well as the stencil has already been madeyou"". Fair enough. Except he never made the stencil. I texted him about it several times and he never answered. So I called and got him on the phone. He sounds annoyed. He tells me ""I'm still working on it, it will be finished when you come in"". Bullshit. He was going to draw it on the spot like every other tattoo I've ever gotten. Not to mention I was the one that did the ""research and development"" for him when I texted him 8 examples of what I was hoping to get done over a week prior. He continues, ""I didn't become one of the most respected tattoo artists in Tucson by stealing my clients money that's not the business I'm in"", and ""you've already had problems with other artists at my shop your patronage has been more of a hassle than anything so if you want to start throwing threats about small claims court I have to ask you to please not ever step foot in our shop again and I'll see you in court"". So now I guess the bad cover up I got from one of their other artists was my fault. Sorry to hassle you by coming back to the same shop that fucked up my arm and give you a paid opportunity to do the right thing. What I came to realize after this whole fiasco was the fact that he never intended to do the tattoo in the first place. I know this because the guy that's friends with my girlfriend that works at the shop told us ""He does that all the time. He's done it to my friends and it pisses me off"". I can't blame him for referring me to Thor. Thor does great work, and like I said, he seemed like a nice guy.   Shower Thoughts On a more personal note, this entire tattoo mess has been exhausting. I've been trying to find a solution for covering it up since the day I first got the damn thing almost a year ago. It's embarrassing to show and people constantly ask me the five WTF W's about it. This whole situation gives me anxiety, and all I want is to get it covered up. I just want a professional that takes pride in his craft and treats his clients with respect. For that I would gladly pay whatever the cost. It's been difficult to find someone with these qualities in my area. In my experiences they're disrespectful, narcissistic, and rudely opinionated. They act like they're doing you a favor for giving them your business. It doesn't help that most of these artists talk shit about one another and their clients as soon as they leave the building. The girl that did the 2 out of 3 good tattoos for me left the shop she was at before because she got tired of all the shit talking. It seems they all know each other, and it feels an awful lot like I'm walking through the fucking halls of my middle school again. I don't care about your drama, I'm just here for a tattoo.  Legal Questions Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant. Long story short is this worth taking to court? An attorney I contacted instructed me to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals Consumer Complaints Division. Small claims clerk told me that I need to find the tattoo parlors statutory agent to serve the papers too. The problem is he isn't an owner there, and I don't have his personal contact information. I think tattoo artists are like barbers where they pay rent for the chair they use. You can pay for this information. You have to pay a fee to process the claim. You have to pay someone to serve the papers to him. And then there's even more wages lost going to court. It doesn't seem worth it but from what I've learned of this guy he does it to people all the time and it's not right. There's more to running a business than the quality of your craft. I just want my deposit back. What should I do?"	Yes
134	My girlfriend and I went to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico this past week. Went great, until I ate something bad and came down with severe fever, chills, pain, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Worst infection of my life. I ended up needing medical transport and was hospitalized for 3 days, where they pushed all sorts of drugs and antibiotics. Ultrasound revealed my colon was super inflamed, and I had a condition called gastroenteritis. The hospital stay cost $16,000.  We contacted the resort, asking for a refund. We know for a fact it was something that I ate from there that made me sick, since we didn't leave the resort at any time. If they refuse, do we have legal grounds to sue?	Yes
135	Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7m0485/mt_we_were_given_a_dog_by_a_coworker_of_my/ I know that first post is a mess when it comes to terminology and general formating.  The update:  We've been served a letter threatening legal action. The letter claims that in receiving the dog, there was no consideration. As far as I am aware, a gift doesn't require consideration. Am I correct in thinking so?  The second part of the letter, which is moreso why I am here, is that it is the mother of the doner that is claiming she owns the dog now. We have never had contact with this woman before today, when she dropped of the letter. When I called the mother's representing lawfirm, they refused to take my call and insisted that I have my attorney contact them directly. I cannot afford the hourly rate of local attornies, and am wondering if there is a way that I can force the lawfirm to accept my refusal to comply without needing to hire an attorney?	Yes
136	"Hey! My girlfriend was at fault in a minor car accident about a year ago. What I saw was minor damage to the bumper of the car in front of her. The person she hit was pretty nasty at the scene and was holding her neck saying she might be injured but refused an ambulance.   Girlfriends rates went up and she got a notice from her insurance that the other person is claiming injury.   However this other person happens to have a public Instagram and is a ""fit chick"" so lots of posts of her doing workouts/headstands/skydiving.   Is there anything my girlfriend should be doing about this? Passing along the info to her insurance?"	Yes
137	Are there any laws in California about how close you can smoke to doors and windows of residences?    I live in an apartment complex with a lot of cigarette smokers.  I am highly allergic to cigarette smoke (been to the ER, multiple doctors, prescribed inhalers, EPI-pens, etc.)  The number of smokers has gotten much worse in the last few years, and it is negatively impacting my health to a serious degree.  I had to move out of a previous residence for the same problem.    The apartment complex has a small open grassy space with a barbeque where most people smoke.   [&lt;Sexy MS Paint Diagram!&gt;](http://i.imgur.com/5uOE8AX.jpg) It is within a few feet of windows and doors.  People also smoke inside the laundry room and inside the enclosed garage.  At any given time of the day or night there are around 2-4 people smoking.  I really don't want to be one of those people who complain about this sort of thing, but there are lots of children in the complex who shouldn't be inhaling this too.	Yes
138	So I was waiting at a stoplight today and got low-speed rear-ended. It wasn't bad, but did give me a fright. My car was still perfectly drivable, even with the dings and scratches. I took pictures of my car, her car, her insurance and license plate and submitted a claim online. I didn't call the police on her because I am certain it wasn't bad enough to cause injury, and accidents are accidents, but she started being a little cagey after all of this and kept repeating that she thought some of the damage was there before, which it wasn't. I don't expect any issues and I'm not trying to get some payout, but was there anything else I could do besides calling the police to prevent me from being screwed over?	Yes
139	I would like to know what i can legally do to defend myself against a dog. I know the self defense laws states that you should only use necessary force to defend yourself.	Yes
140	2-3 weeks ago my neighbor's dog started coming on to my property. We live in the city and the dog used to have an electric fence, but it seems that is no longer the case. The dog is on the larger side (40-50 pounds) and very aggressive. Several times my mother has had to run for the front door while out gardening because the dog will run towards her and begin growling and trying to bite. Tonight the dog attempted to bite her and she kicked it several times until it ran away. We have told our neighbors on three separate occasions about the issue and they keep saying they'll handle it but never do. We have also called our local police department whenever we see the dog on our yard, but because it is not an emergency, it usually takes 10-20 minutes for them to arrive, by which time the dog is back in it's yard/house. The police knock on the neighbor's door, but they never answer. The officers we spoke to last said they could do nothing until there was evidence the dog hurt someone or was dangerous. My mother is beginning to fear working in our yard because of this animal. I love animals, but this dog is becoming a threat to my mother's safety, so I was wondering if it was legal to shoot it the next time it tries to hurt someone in my yard. Between the police and lack of problem solving by my neighbors, I feel like I am running out of options and it is only a matter of time before someone gets hurt by the animal. However, if shooting is illegal, what other steps can I legally take to resolve this situation?	Yes
141	I bought a house beside a church parking lot that the church goers rarely use because there is a closer parking lot, so there's usually no need for anyone to use this back lot. Since living here a year I've seen prostitution (front row view right from my kitchen window while cooking), drug deals, teenagers doing donuts driving dangerously close to my house in the lot, people setting off large fireworks, all sorts of things. Yesterday was the kicker. I had to risk physical harm approaching a vehicle with an overdosing driver that still had his foot on the gas headed straight for my house where my daughter was inside to prevent him from plowing into it.   I plan to speak to the church's pastor and see if we can find a solution but I wanted to ask here first if anyone has any advice to offer. Is a mostly abandoned lot considered an attractive nuisance, and do I have any recourse to keep my family safe if they can't help resolve this? Thanks in advance!	Yes
142	This friend of mine contacted this person and sent exploitative pics to her. This person is now trying to take revenge and is sending these pics to me and my other friends. I worry for my friend's safety and future. What are things he/I can do?  Sorry for bad English. Not first language.	Yes
143	"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	Yes
144	"I'm renting a 2 bedroom in LA and got a new roommate, who signed a lease and got approved by the management company. 6 months later she said she was going away for a month and gave her keys to ""a friend"" who may stay a few nights. A month later, she never returned. She told me via Facebook messenger that she'd be back in a few weeks for a while, then said this friend wanted to sign on to the lease. I told my roommate I wasn't comfortable with her friend doing that. About a week before the end of my roommate's lease, I told her ""friend"" that she had to leave, since I needed a new roommate and she wouldn't let anyone see her room. I asked for the keys and she assaulted me, throwing me on the ground and then calling the police saying I'd attacked her. The police came and threatened to arrest both of us, I cleared out and got a restraining order. Despite this, I couldn't get her out of the apartment and I no longer feel safe there. As of July 1, my roommate no longer is on the lease, but the squatter won't leave. My actual roommate and I have told her many times to go, the police came by 4 other times and even threatened to arrest her, and the management company has served her a 3 days notice. She's still there and it's become clear to me that she squats habitually-- she knows the laws too well.  Questions-- 1. What can I do to get rent and damages from the roommate who let her in? What kind of lawyer would handle this? 2. The management knew about the squatter and hasn't acted. Is there anything I can get them to do? 3. Are there any other options besides the management evicting me and my roommate (the people on the lease) to get her out?"	Yes
145	"So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit. So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help.."	Yes
146	Almost ten years ago, I took a Jiu Jitsu class at the local YMCA.   During a drill on a basic technique, the girl I was paired with broke her arm after falling awkwardly. It was a spider guard technique, done under the supervision of the teacher. Not a submission or anything, just a freak accident. Minor break, i'm not sure of the details of her injury.   This will come into play later.  A few classes later, my teacher has a friend come in and practice with us. A blue belt in akido. He, the teacher, insists I practice with this person, and my hand gets broken during this practice.   I recently found out that the person was the girl's boyfriend. and he broke my hand on purpose.   Is there anything I can do? The true cause of the injury wasn't known until this year.   I know the statute of limitations is up for personal injury, 2 years, but considering that I didn't find out the true cause until recently, would the 'clock' start when I found out this information?   Is there anything I can do legally at this point?	Yes
147	So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	Yes
148	So a guy almost hit me with his car while I crossed the street.  As he pulled around he yelled obscenities at me, I yelled obscenities back, and then he yelled that he was going to beat the shit out of me and started pulling his car over.  I told him to hold on while I wrote down his plates.  He drove off.  I called the cops.  2 questions: Firstly, I don't really care anymore and was seriously freaked out by the situation and in hindsight honestly don't really care to press charges.  How much is this going to cost me in time and money?  Secondly, I yelled obscenities back at him (but no threats).  Does that totally screw me over?  Thank you in advance, legal gods.	Yes
149	Hey guys, I was hit and run over by a car and I need advice on the next step. My insurance as well as the insurance provider of the person driver have all been contacted. Today I received a call from my rep that insurance of the driver is not admitting full fault and will not cover full replacement of my bike (it was totaled).  So, my rep mentioned I need to hire a lawyer to take driver to small claims court OR convince the driver's rep to back down and take responsibility in full (my insurance sides with me 100%).  MAIN QUESTION: Should I contact the driver directly (I have her info) and give her a heads up that I'm moving this to small claims court in an effort to have her convince her rep to take full responsibility so she avoids court? Or is that not kosher/illegal?  Thanks!	Yes
150	Hi all,  My parents are currently having a problem, and I was wondering if there is any legal recourse.  There are several trees that are on my neighbors property. A significant part of each tree overhanged onto my property, and the trees both provided significant privacy and shaded the property for most of the day. The power company came yesterday and cut down those trees completely. We now have the lovely view of the trailer park behind my house, without so much as a bush in between us. Additionally, my parents are concerned that their property value (and they're trying to sell) is going to go down, because you can now see the aforementioned trailer park quite clearly, and there's much less privacy and shade on our property.    My question- is there any legal recourse for my parents? I'm guessing not, since the trees weren't even planted on their property, but I figured it's something worth exploring.	Yes
151	I am currently on a study abroad trip with a US based provider ( supplied through my school ).  I was suppost to on a week long trip to Thailand with this company but they canceled it with two weeks notice.  They are giving me a refund for the program fee but I am now stranded in Thailand all alone for a week as I already have my flights and can't afford a flight home.  Is there anything I can do to get them to pay for part of my flight?  Unfortunately I signed no paperwork for anything.  I simply paid the extra fee on top of my study abroad fee	Yes
152	"Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos.   He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
153	"So I'm not sure what to do as I have never experienced something like this before.  I waited for the walk sign to turn on and went when it said to.  This girl was taking a left turn and ran right into me.  She stopped and asked if I was okay which I replied, ""I think so."" Because I was in shock, I probably didn't do everything right.  She gave me her business card and left.  A couple of witnesses called 911 and stayed with me.  The cop said she did everything right and that it was an accident, although she was at fault.  She said the sun was in her eyes.  My question is, do I have any grounds to get compensation for the anxiety this accident has caused me?  I already have bad anxiety issues and this has exacerbated it.  Also, I had to spend 6 hours in the ER, I am assuming her car insurance is going to foot the bill?  Any suggestions for next steps are greatly appreciated."	Yes
154	"The accident happened in Irvine, CA. I was giving my girlfriend a ride to work on my motorcycle in the far left lane before HOV. With the intent of using the HOV lane, I waited for a break in the yellow lines, hit the turn signals, looked over my shoulder and then mirror, saw that there were no vehicles in the HOV, and made the lane change. Maybe ~10ft from the point where I changed lanes, I heard another motorcycle's tires screeching (assuming he locked up his tires), and the rider going down in my rear mirror. Pulled over and did a police report. He and his bike suffered some rashes; neither my gf, my bike and I were harmed. I received a warning letter from the DMV saying that I will be receiving a point on my license from that accident for ""failing to notice (the rider) approaching from the left rear"".  I got a copy of the report today and found out that in his statement, he said he was ""driving (his motorcycle) on I-5 s/b splitting lanes between the HOV and #1 lane (far left)..."". Is it legal to be splitting lanes in between four solid yellow lines? If legal, what can I do next time to prevent a similar accident?"	Yes
155	"A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine (I am a supervisor) got into a yelling match with me over me asking him to do something he didn't want to do. He did not directly threaten me verbally at this point, but he is twice my size and was attempting to intimidate me; including him coming up close to me and asking ""You wanna say something to me?"" In a threatening tone.  I contacted our director, and the other supervisor, to alert them to this. The other supervisor comes in because they live close and I was very much under the impression I was not safe at work. The co-worker that threatened me returned; thinking I was out of the office, he began to brag about how he was about to come back in and attack me.   At this, I ask him to leave for the day and all hell breaks loose. He and the other supervisor start screaming at one another, as myself and other had to hold the two back from one another or there would have been a fight. Finally he leaves the office, and having heard what happened, our director comes in to speak with him. Our director leaves, the asshole who threatened me got to work the rest of the shift. I was promised that the situation would be resolved and I was more than happy to be patient. Weeks have passed and literally nothing has been done, even the bare minimum that the director promised.   Now when have HR coming in tomorrow with an eye to fire all three of us involved. I'm at my ropes end with this company, and I've been told by a few people that if I'm fired that I'd be in my right to sue them. Is there any truth to that?"	Yes
156	I posted something on Facebook that apparently he is upset about. Is this a threat?  [this is what he said to me](https://imgur.com/gallery/a0LiP)	Yes
157	"Detroit Dog Rescue brought to the attention of this gentleman who posted a picture on fb of two dogs in a corner. The gentleman explains he had to ""whoop the dogs ass"" for pooping in the house. He claims it is just a joke, but nowhere does he proclaim that I am aware of. Other people have commented that they have screenshots of him stating on fb that he has drowned the dogs and thrown them in a lake.   There is a lot to this story, but I have a hard time believing this guy actually can sue Detroit Dog Rescue for Defamation of Character when he stated that he ""whooped"" the dogs.  There might be a lot of investigation work but would like to know if this guy actually has legs for this case.  Below is the link to story. If it doesn't work, just google search Detroit Dog Rescue and it will all show up.  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1658908090800593&amp;substory_index=0&amp;id=190296407661776&amp;__tn__=%2As"	Yes
158	I have two dogs who were both in their kennels. One had minor surgery yesterday and we had just gotten home when the vet called because they forgot to give me a prescription he needs, and asked me to come get it.  While I was gone my landlord came over unannounced. Apparently the house next door, he also owns, had water in the basement from storms. He wanted to see if my basement was flooding too.  However apparently he was concerned about my dogs because one (the one who had surgery) wasn't moving much (he was still groggy) and the other was whining a lot (she was fine, she just whines when she's in her kennel but someone's around and she wants out).  He said that he and his wife were afraid that the dogs were in bad shape and needed water or something, so he let them out. He got the younger one (who just had surgery) out first and apparently the other (still in her kennel) started growing. She can be defensive of the younger one so I am guessing she was upset that a stranger was messing with the younger one who wasn't well.  She had been extra attentive to him since he got home licking him and trying to give him food so I think she could tell something was wrong with him.  Apparently even though the older dog was growling, they still let her out of her kennel. They said that the younger one went under the bed and the older one tried to keep them away from it, growling and barking when they tried to get the puppy out. Apparently they kept trying to get close, and eventually the landlord pulled the puppy out from under the bed and my older girl bit his hand.   When I got home, they were still trying to get the puppy who had gone back under the bed, and my older dog was going nuts wimpering/barking/growling at them.  The landlord's wife had called animal control.  The bite had broken the landlord's skin just barely but was no longer bleeding.  Animal control came and checked my paperwork for shots and said normally they would take the dog for quarantine because it was involved in a bite incident, but they said that in these circumstances they didn't see a need to do so. They told me that I shouldn't expect any further issues with the situation and that they would talk to the landlord about what he should have done differently.  I thought that was it, however my landlord went to the ER. His wife told me that the ER didn't believe any treatment was needed but they elected to go through rabies meds just in case, so he is going through that treatment now.  Today they delivered a letter to my mailbox saying that they want me out by the end of the month or no more than 30 days from now because my animals have presented a dangerous situation on the property that keeps them from fulfilling their ownership duties safely.  He also told me in the letter that he will be keeping his ER visit and rounds of rabies meds from my deposit but that if the bills exceed it he will be forwarding me the bill.  At this point I'm not really even sure what I'm asking for other than just general advice anyone might have. It's probably obvious from my post but I am very frustrated by the situation because I had my dog properly contained and they chose to let them out even though the dog was growling, which should have been a warning sign to leave it alone. However I am not sure what the law says on this or what I'm in for.	Yes
159	"There's a local obstacle gym that we pay a monthly fee for our son to attend.  He's 11.  There are trainers on staff for structured play time as well as ""free play"" where the kids can do the various obstacles at their leisure.  During free play, the trainers are suppose to wander through the obstacles observing the kids and making sure no one gets hurt. During free play time, my son fell from about 10 feet up and landed on the safety mat.  The way he landed shattered his elbow and broke his arm in two places.  This injury required immediate surgery to correct.  He now has wires holding his elbow together.  Another surgery will be necessary in a few months to remove the wires because his bones need to be able to continue to grow.  We have insurance but have had to pay the co pay on two emergency room visits as well as the surgery and follow up doctors appointments.  I've contacted their insurance company but the rep has been infuriatingly difficult to get in touch with.  I've spoken to him once out of 7 attempts.  I've spoken to a local attorney but they declined to represent me.  I'm not looking for a million dollar payout, but would appreciate help with the expenses I've incurred.  What are my options?  Will it just be classified as an accident and I eat the cost and move on?  Do I contact my insurance company and let them fight it out with the other?  We payed a premium for an inside gym with the proper safety equipment and a dedicated staff.  Both failed in this situation.  Just looking for a solid direction to move forward in. Thanks for any advice in advance."	Yes
160	I'm looking to file a Small Claims Filing for an accident caused by a bicyclist who was in my lane going down a hill around a blind corner. What I'm looking to recouperate is the amount of the deductible from my insurance claim for the damage she caused. I've tried contacting her 4 times over the last 2 weeks to no avail. She has no auto insurance because she lives in the city, so it was as if I had an accident with a pedestrian. There were no injuries from the accident, as the bicyclist was treated at the scene and refused further care.   I've emailed the office of the Ombudsman for Hudson County, NJ, and told me that I'm to file a small claims filing for a Motor Vehicle Accident. I was provided the following forms:   * http://www.njcourts.gov/forms/10148_sc_motorveh.pdf * http://www.njcourts.gov/forms/10290_small_claims.pdf  What I'm hoping to find out from you guys is A) If I'm able to also put on the claim the $42 I was required to pay to file the complaint in addition to the $500 deductible, and B) If I'm able to place a somewhat arbitrary amount of dollars for the burden of having to take off of work to take the car to the shop, come to court and do the filing due to her negligence in the first place, and if so, what is a reasonable amount for this (I am a salaried employee so I had/will have to take PTO to do so but don't have lost wages due to this)?  If you have any other recommendations I'd love to hear it!	Yes
161	Hello, On July 7th I had my grandson over for a week. My property had a large population of feral cats who were extremely aggressive. I killed or trapped at least 5, and the rest eventually stopped coming around my area. I still received visits from the neighbors cat who lived several acres away) who wears a green collar. As well as an occasional feral cat.   On July 7th I was watching a western movie when my wife yelled at me to come help her through the screen door. I rushed on to my deck to see what was going on. My wife was bleeding from the hand, and the neighbors cat was hissing at her. The hairs on the its back were standing up, and it looked pissed. The cat stood blocking me and my wife from my grandson The cat swiped in our direction then slowly walked in the direction that my grandson was in as he cried. I drew my .45 (note I had it in a concealed holster, which I have a license for) and fired 3 shots into the cat, who died.   I then obviously called my wife and ambulance. She had to get several stitches, it was a whole mess. The police filed a report notified the neighbor, and now the neighbor is threatening to sue me. Claiming that her cat was docile and was not violent.   What are my options? Am I at fault here?	Yes
162	Good Evening,    First time here, so sorry if this is already answered. Please provide link to answer if so and I will delete this post.   **SITUATION**: Other night I tapped the bumper of a man (driver), and his pregnant wife and child (passengers). Speed at impact was no faster than walking speed. There was no damage to my bumper and a slight scuff on theirs, we exchanged insurance and contact info, and I asked to pay out of pocket if he was willing. Next day they contact me and say that they are sore and taking the wife to the dr., and that the impact dislodged the plastic wheel well in their car. However, they are still willing to let me pay out of pocket for car repairs and health insurance co-pay from the dr visit. They gave me a reasonable quote that I accepted. I don't really care if they are faking and just keeping the money, this is an inconvenience for them, and I was at fault. Additionally, the quote would be cheaper than my insurance increase in the long run.    **QUESTION**: My concern is that I will pay them, but they will still try and make a claim in the future due to injury they didn't know they had yet (or something along those lines). If I have them sign a release of liability contract in front of a notary at the time of payment, will that protect me here in Oregon? If so, is there a recommended release of liability contract template I can download for free? Or am I out of my league here? I think getting a lawyer involved would contradict any future insurance premium savings I would gain from the other party not making a claim.  Thanks for your time,  everyusernametaken2	Yes
163	"I have a friend who I wish to help, and I have no idea how to go about it. She's a woman in her forties who lost vision in her right eye due to an accident with a burning ember. Her eye socket was badly burned and she became *mostly* blind in that eye. Her first physician treated her with some type of steroid eye drops. She was prescribed the drops and told explicitly to only use them *only* with her damaged eye, and never under any circumstances with her good eye. Fast forward approximately two months, and my friend was given a new doctor. I'm unsure about the details and reasons for the switch; all I know is it had something to do with her insurance. So, she meets with her new doctor and the doctor examines her and studies the details of her case. The woman doctor then decides that my friend should continue with the same medicine which she was originally prescribed by the first physician, with one difference: she was told to use the steroid eye drops in *both* eyes. My friend objected, and did so in a very adamant and serious and confident manner. ""But Doctor So And So very specifically and very plainly told me in no uncertain terms that I was to never, never, *never* put those drops in my good eye. He told me over and over, he really drove the point home and underlined emphatically to not let the steroid drops get anywhere near the other eye."" And so on. Somehow though, this new physician who had been assigned to her managed to eventually convince my friend to entirely disregard what the other doctor had told her. And this was a BIG and LOUD sort of conversation these two had, almost verging on a heated argument. And so, in the end, my friend submitted to the new physician's orders. She was a doctor and she knew best. And so my friend returns home, puts the medicine in both eyes, and goes to bed. When she awakens the next morning the world is blackness. She is 100% blind. I won't go into the aftermath, the bottomless depression, the sense that her life had become the worst, most terrifying nightmare, the *endless* crying, etcetera. Suffice it to say she suffers *enormously*, and the fact that she caved in and ignored her instincts only adds a whole other Hell-Factor to it all. And to make matters even worse, she's living with an abusive and horrible man who she had a kid with, and she's scared to death of him. Always has been, really. He's completely drained her bank account since the blindness, he's hit her on at least one occasion that I know of, and once, when she meekly stood up to him and refused to do something for him involving her bank, he kicked her out of his car and left her alone and stranded in the middle of downtown Seattle. ""Get out and find your own way back."" I could go on but I won't, suffice it to say her life is an unbelievably bleak and abysmal mess. No one has helped her with this, and she lives in fear. So, I'm wondering how to proceed. I'm going to anything and everything I can to assist her, but I don't know where to begin. Would a contingency lawyer be prone to rip her off to the fullest possible degree? My working hypothesis is a strong YES, and I'd be grateful if any honest and knowledgable person could explain how that scenario might play out. And lastly I should mention that proving all of this is a piece of cake. Numerous witnesses saw and heard and were present when this second doctor gave these harmful directions to my friend. So there won't be any problem with that. She has written proof as well in the form of a prescription and in the form of this doctor's hand-written note.   And I apologize for the breathless and unorganized text; I just let it all pour out as plainly as I could. And again, I would be grateful if any knowledgable person were kind enough to help with advice or information or honest help in any other form."	Yes
164	Basically an obese customer was denied service since we didn't have the proper equipment to handle someone of her size. (weight limit on machine is stated as 250lbs)  She writes a bad review claiming that we really denied her because she was black since she saw another large white woman in the store (but she fails to mention the other woman was half her size)   Since her review was framed in such a way to make this seem like a case of discrimination based on race, her fb post has been shared by a few thousands and as a result we've taken a hard hit on our online reviews/scores, harassing phone calls and what not.   I feel like we could have a libel case on our hands, but I'm not sure. How do these cases usually go? I ask if it's worth it since I also don't know the process of investigation for them, and I don't necessarily know if inciting this case somewhat more publicly like that would also be good...	Yes
165	I'm going to summarize a long story to ask this question; Over a year ago now I prepaid a firm to declare bankruptcy. Things seemed fine until I gave them the full amount in advance for the service. Then they disappeared for a month and when I finally did get a hold of them, they strung me along for another several months and refused to give my money back. Eventually after I reported them to the better business bureau, they agreed to pay 1/3 of the money back, but that was a month and a half ago and they still haven't sent the check... What can I do next to recover this money? This is in Ohio. Thank you!	Yes
166	"I realize that this is probably a lost cause, but whatever.  For context, my girlfriends brother, called Eric for this story, works in a family-owned restaurant in a mountain town in Colorado. My GF, called Jane for this story, was going to the town to meet up with her brother, as they hardly ever see each other. He is 27, Jane is 17. Eric has been working in a restaurant to finance his wedding to his fiancé, Jordan (fake name). He also works in ski patrol during the winter and does odd jobs around the town during the summer.  The incident began when Jane arrived in town. Jane and Jordan were waiting outside the restaurant for Eric to get off his shift, and both of them go inside to ask Eric how long he has remaining in his shift before he's off. Jane goes to wait outside while Jordan talks to the manager. Jordan comes back outside, apparently looking really creeped out and distraught. Jane asks what happened, Jordan says the manager asked how old Jane was, saying ""what is she? 19? 20?"" Jordan relies and says, ""no, she's 17, why?""  The manager responds with ""well when she's wearing shorts like that she might as well be 20. She's got an ass like a 20 year old"" and then made a gesture where he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and inserted his other index finger into the hole repeatedly. (This is obviously a sex gesture).  It should be noted here that the manager of the restaurant is not the owner, and is a 42 year old man.   Jane and Jordan wait for Eric to get off work, and when he does, they tell him of the situation. Eric replies with ""I'm going to fucking beat his ass."" (Eric is very protective of Jane. For the first 6 months of our relationship, our dates were always me and Jane… and Eric. Were like brother now though.)   Jane and Jordan tried to hold him back from going into the restaurant, but they're small girls while Eric is 6'4"" 250 lbs of pure muscle. He walked back into the restaurant, and Jane and Jordan followed him. He asked the manager what he said about his sister, and he, strangely, told Eric exactly what he said, with gesture and all, and added at the end ""she's a dirty little girl, isn't she Eric?"" And winked after the last question.  Eric uppercutted the manager so hard he left the floor briefly before hitting the ground. The manger was driven to the hospital by Eric, and has a concussion, a broken cheekbone, and brief amnesia.  I should say now that this is all 2nd hand. I didn't witness any of this, but Jane and Jordan saw all of it and relayed it to me.  Is there anything they can do to keep Eric out of jail and not bankrupt him/the entire family? Thanks all!"	Yes
167	I came back to my apartment yesterday after studying at the library to see it on fire.  The cause of the fire was determined that the back left stove was on which heated a pan which then then heated a toaster which consequently caused the outlet it was plugged into to catch on fire.  My landlord is expecting me to pay, due to negligence, for the damages to the unit, i understand im liable for my personal property damaged.  However, in the pictures i took while the fire department was there none of the knobs on my stove where on.  In addition, the outlet which was the actual cause of the fire did not have Arc Fault Circuit interrupters which would have prevented the fire in the first place.  Also my stove had broke the in early June and had maintenance done on it by that apartment complex.  I am therefore asking where do i go from here? I am a college student and do not have any money to cover the cost of the damages	Yes
168	Location: Los Angela's California  I was at a bar last week with some friends and some time during the night I was at the bar getting a drink and when I turned around an extremely drunk man smashed his glass into mine while he wildly gestured about something.   At first I was in shock since he basically smashed a glass in my face but when I looked down my entire right hand was a bloody mess. I shouted and one of the bartenders saw this and called the ambulance. I  was furious with the guy who gave me a fuck of comment before the manager on staff sat me down and helped me until the ambulance got there.   I'm at the hospital and during the exam it was discovered that 3 of the tendons in my hand had been cut and I need surgery to repair them.   The broken career part of the story is that I'm an graphic designer who relies on the use of my hands to do my job. And now that my hand is still recovering I can't work or do anything and I'm concerned about what to do. I don't know who I should call, if there's some way of getting my expanses covered, what I'll do if I can't use my hand well enough in the future and I can't work as a graphic artist anymore.   I'm surviving off the money I have saved and will be okay for about a month and I have medical insurance so that's all taken care of. But I just need advice of if I can get some sort of money to help pay for my expenses and what my options are.   I don't really have the money to pay for a lawyer since al of my savings are paying for everything and I don't have a salaried job since I'm freelance at the moment.   I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes as I'm writing this with my left hand on mobile and I'm kind of dog scared shitless about what to do.	Yes

170	I just noticed that another website probably copied one of my site's more popular posts (responsible for about 20% of my traffic). Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:  - The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.  - It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective  - This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.  - I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains. This kinda adds insult to injury.  Now since I can't proof anything I don't want to throw around accusations, but it all seems pretty clear to me. I'm placed higher on google, so I doubt I'm losing too much traffic to them because of this, though it may be some, but it's more about the principle. I link to their site because I like their service and recommend it to my readers, and they steal my content and a chunk of traffic.  So, what do you think I can/should do about this?  My first instinct was to write them an email, politely requesting they link to my site since its contents my interest their readers of that particular article, but maybe you have a better idea?  Thanks in advance for your input :-)	Yes
171	Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	Yes
172	I am writing a memoir and doing my best to prevent any sort of defamation of character accusations before I send a chapter of my book to an online publisher. The people I am writing about include the two multimillionaire business owners (one had since passed away, one is the head of a largely recognizable brand) and a person in academia involved in highly unethical practices.   I have already read about the legal topic and done things like change names, stick to facts, not opinions, and stay in my own point of view, not jump to what another person felt or was thinking.  I have emails and articles to backup that what I am saying is true. However, for my own peace of mind, I would like a lawyer to read my chapter and suggest to me if any edits need to be made to further protect myself.   I do not have a lot of money, (less than $1000 in the bank). Is this something that I might be able to get a pro bono consultation for? Where would be the best place to look for a lawyer that would review my chapter? Does it make a difference if I look for someone who specializes in whistleblower law, literary/creative arts law, or first amendment law?  I am 60 minutes from Chicago, if it makes a difference. Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
173	I drove less than a mile to the store, I drove past a downed stop sign (it was literally on the ground because somebody else hit it) and was struck by another car. Nobody was hurt, we were going fairly slow. Damage to my car was worse, he had a scuffed/slightly dented fender. My window was shattered and the door was pushed in.   I freaked out because I know I'm not supposed to be on the road and I saw the sign I drove passed. I said sorry, claimed responsibility and we took pictures.  He seemed nice and agreed not to involve the police, assuming that I'd get into trouble. Said he had no interest in taking advantage of me, however it was a company car and somebody has to pay.   I'm confused, my parents are in the hospital because my mom got injured from something unrelated. I have no idea what to do.   I don't have money, I am disabled and subsist off of SSI. What the hell do I do? My friend guessed it would cost around 1100-1500 for repairs. I have a trashbag on my window.   Why don't I have insurance/license? Long story nobody cares. Why did I risk driving without them? Well, I'm a fucking idiot apparently.   What do I do?	Yes
174	"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."

176	"As the title states my neighbor built a full-size Olympic regulation skeet range in his backyard. Overall I feel like there is a lot going on here but I'll try to keep it relatively succinct while giving context on everything.  I live in rural Shawnee County, KS. I bought my home in 2014 to get away from the city and have some peace, quiet, and space, and maybe have a few farm-style critters. Our home is on 3 acres. It was a delightfully quiet first winter in the new house.   Late winter of 2015 a neighboring house and 15 acres went up for sale and quickly sold. The new neighbor is a kind man with a family. He stated that he planned to use his land for dirt bike trails and putting in a shotgun range for his son (who is, admittedly, quite a talented shooter). My dreams of a quiet rural home felt shattered.   Within a few months he was running skid steers to flatten the plot, had dump truck loads of gravel brought out, built a high and low house for the target throwers, and put in concrete pads for the shooting stations. This is a full-on, permanent, Olympic regulation installation. In no time at all his son was out there shooting hundreds of shots a day practicing. Evenings on our back patio or deck were filled with the sound of shotgun practice. I did not want to be ""that neighbor"" so we just tolerated it, knowing the son would be moving to college within a couple years and the shooting would decrease.  Note that I also own and use firearms so I don't have anything inherently against their use. It's the fact that this is a permanently installed shooting range that I feel is detrimental to property values and disruptive to the ability of my family and all of our neighbors to enjoy our property. It has come to the point that I want it to go away. If we were to try to sell our house, I'm certain we'd have to disclose the neighbor's range. Can you imagine how limited our potential market would be? Who would want to buy a house next to that?  I looked into the zoning of our area (Rural Agricultural) and it lists ""Gun target and practice shooting ranges"" under ""Uses permitted by Conditional Use Permit."" However, his property is subdivided as single family residential. The publication which specifies a process for conditional use permits is [here](https://www.snco.us/planning/document/zoning_regulation_20131205_art_25.pdf) and references a procedure found [here](http://www.snco.us/planning/document/ZoningRegulationSec33.pdf). I don't know how that all works if the property is already set up as single family residential. I do know that I was never informed of any hearings or opportunities to provide my opinion on its use. He just did it.  The kicker here is he just listed his home for sale yesterday. I fear that there may be some sort of law that if properties neighboring his don't file a complaint or speak up about disruptive use within a certain period, or if a sale goes through, that we will have in effect agreed to its use and waive any right to complain. I also fear that the buyer may use it even more than the current owner did.   I am about to head over to the county planning department to file a formal complaint about it and see if there is anything they can do.   Does the Legal Advice community have any other suggestions? I just want to make sure that when the neighbor is gone, so is the shooting range."	Yes
177	Hi all,  so rewind to about a year ago when I began taking some medicine to remove a foot fungus in the. During one of my last treatment visits in January 2017, I saw a different podiatrist for the first time due to my other podiatrist being out of the office. This new podiatrist may have had an issue with my appearance or something because he did not really address me at all and seemed annoyed by my presence. He did not talk much even though I had asked him a lot of questions about my progress. He takes a quick look at my nails and then proceeded to cut my nails very low, despite my painful cries, without warning me or asking me to do so in the first place. After which he writes me a script for some bogus prescription that didn't help and left without saying anything. Fast forward to May 2017, and I start to develop very uncomfortable pain in one of the toes trimmed down low. Apparently, the low cutting of the toenail resulted in an ingrown toe nail in eventually both toes. A preventative measure to this is to soak your foot in salt water to help the nail grow, but my previous podiatrist did not mention anything about that.   The ingrown toenail proceeded to get infected, and resulted in the last couple of months of alot of pain, discomfort, expenses on medical supplies, and many trips to the doctor. I really find this podiatrist culpable of all of these issues, especially since the other podiatrist I saw before him did not think it was necessary to cut the nail so low, and has been coaching me through the entire process.  Can I sue that podiatrist I saw in Jan for cutting my nail too low and not giving me any advice after to prevent ingrown toenails?  Are their lawyers out there willing to see this case considering there won't be a lot of money involved?   Thanks for any legal advice you can provide!	Yes
178	"Hi reddit, I'm posting on behalf of a friend of mine that can't access the Internet so sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'll try. My friend's phone was dropped into water by her manager at work. The manager asked if her phone was waterproof, she said kinda and that was it. She wasn't aware of how bad the damage was until she tried to charge it after work. This caused her house to short circuit. She had an electrician come in then he called some other guy and he said it will cost $20,000 as the whole house will need to be rewired. Now I'm not sure if that number is realistic, I'm also not sure what they should do as they have just finished paying off their mortgage. When my friend told her manager what happened he basically said ""if this is you trying to get money from me don't even try"" so yeh. Also this happened in NZ if that helps and my friend is not a legal adult yet."	Yes
179	i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	Yes
180	Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
181	Today while driving a vehicle hit a wooden block that was in his lane and it shot directly into my windshield (did not bounce along the way). I only have liability insurance so will be paying $400 out of pocket on the windshield replacement. Do I have any grounds for seeking reimbursement from the vehicle at fault? They continued on and did not stop but I took photos of their license and have a witness in my vehicle.	Yes
182	I work as a manager in Vancouver, BC and not too long ago I fired one of my employees. A few months ago, the company's email address began receiving lots of emails containing insults about me. I think the guy I fired is doing all this. What can I do to get him in trouble?	Yes
183	I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my leg in 2013. Medi clinic Doctor didn't prescribe blood thinners or send me for an ultrasound to confirm it or even suggest a follow up afterwards. Ended up almost dieing in the hospital with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs so bad I passed out from lack of oxygen and my stressed out heart couldn't pump enough blood. After my diagnosis (two xrays and CT scan later) I was on clot busters so strong I had to stay in ICU for 24 hours in case my brain started bleeding out. During my stay, the info pamphlet they gave me pretty much stated flat out that PE is caused by deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) in the legs.  Currently on blood thinners right now for the next 6 months and am otherwise healthy. I think the Dr that diagnosed me completely dropped the ball with not prescribing treatment or requesting an ultrasound to gain even basic knowledge about what was going on and to that effect it's probable the clot remained for years and moved to my lungs (been having breathing issues for the last couple of years)...  Thoughts?  I'm not about frivolous lawsuits, but this sounds like negligence at the very least.	Yes
184	Hello r/legaladvice and the Reddit community as  whole. First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.  Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al’s devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.   Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?   What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?   Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?   Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.   If there's any questions I can ask or information you guys need please let me know and I'll ask Al. This is so early on he's still dealing with the emotional blow. Btw I did ask permission to ask for help on his behalf so long as it was anonymously.	Yes
185	She left them with him because she was moving and couldnt bring all her things right away. Now after moving back to the same area he ducked her text and calls for months about retrieving her things. Then we came to find out that him and his wife had had a divorce and he said that she was now in possession of the unit. We got her number from him and upon texting her found out that he had stopped payment on the unit and all the items were removed or taken by the company. What do we do to get her things back or monetary compensation for the thousands of dollars worth of things that were in the storage. She is inconsolable over the loss of her things. Any help is much appreciated, if more information is needed Im happy to provide it.	Yes
186	"Hello! As a small business owner, I am looking for help from lawyers/business owners alike. I have run into a fraudulent injury lawsuit from a stranger on my property. This person claims that a piece of equipment on my property hurt him as he was passing through. The person has no proof and when asked to provide medical documentation or pictures of the injury, the person refused. Knowing what I do about the equipment in question and his story presented, it is not possible that what was claimed actually happened. In addition, the person is claiming an exorbitant amount of money. It is obvious that it is someone with a piece of shit lawyer looking to make a quick buck. As a small business owner, I do not have access to high power lawyers nor do I have the money to just pay off people for everything they threaten lawsuits with. When asking my insurance appointed lawyer how this could possibly hold up in court, I am told it is a sympathy case and there is no way to defend against it. It is absolutely infuriating that I am not protected in some way from fraudulent injury claims especially with no proof! It seems that the system is rigged against the ""big bad company"". How can a small business stay in business with no protection against these shit heads? Big companies obviously have cash to pay off people or lawyers on retainer. For me, a lawsuit can literally make or break my company. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Or how to retaliate?"	Yes
187	All vehicles our parked at owners risk. No liability is assumed by management for loss or damage by fire, theft, or any other cause to, or by the vehicle while in custody of management. All claims must be presented before vehicle is taken from facility. Any person driving becomes the agent of the owner solely. We are. It responsible for articles left in vehicle or mechanical problems.   Background: left car with hotel valet to park for a few days. I came back and car was stolen and then impounded. I'd like to not pay the $275+ obviously. Do I have any recourse or am I SOL?	Yes
188	"TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.  First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.  Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.    The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.  Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays.   Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?"	Yes
189	So this was a weird day. Today my S/O was driving their car past our city's downtown bus terminal. An individual on a bus stole a bag from another passenger, and then attempted to flee the scene. While being perused by security, the individual ran out in front of my S/O's car and was hit. The person was lifted off their feet, slammed into the windshield, shattering it, and then proceeded to stand up and flee the scene. The individual was caught a few blocks over and taken to the hospital. My S/O was found not to be at fault by police at the scene, with many witnesses corroborating the events. So I'm just wondering what possible outcomes there are from here.. could this individual press charges against my S/O? Could the individual sue my S/O? Could my S/O sue? Really just wondering about any possible outcome.	Yes
190	"Okay so we were at a bar down the shore in Jersey, just us two. We have been friends for about 3-4 years now and we met through my cousin who went to high school with him. We have been going out together a lot lately on the weekends and everything seemed cool until a couple weeks ago when he called me out in our group chat about me never being the one to drive when we go out. I took it as a joke in the group chat but soon after I invited him to come out on said night with me to the shore and that I'd drive us down there.  So he agreed and when the day came he left his car at my house and we went in mine. Everything was going well the whole ride there and during the time we were at the bar. We started drinking at around 4pm and we had agreed that I would stop at 9 in case I would have to drive back (we had planned to stay at one of my friend's house nearby). Later on in the night at around 8:30pm, while I was at my peak of intoxication, I closed my eyes for a split second and rested my head back against a column that was behind me and in that moment a bouncer approached me and said ""alright, you're done."" and directed me towards the exit. So my friend followed, leaving behind the group of girls we met there.   It was honestly the most bs way I've ever heard of anyone get kicked out of a bar, if anything I would've given myself a warning. But anyway, at this point I was pretty drunk so i can only remember certain instances until later on at night. So as we were on the street, he texted our group chat (which he tells everything on) saying ""(me) got us kicked out of the bar for being too drunk. If he says anything stupid imma knock him out."" I didn't like that whatsoever so as soon as I read that I snapped on him, basically telling him that he wont do shit and to stop running his mouth. In that moment I realized that this kid had a lot of bad energy held in towards me because he started to verbally go off on me as well saying disgraceful things and standing his ground as well. Not much time had passed until two police officers appeared from the shadows and began talking to us. I don't remember how the discussion with the officers went because I didn't know I had gotten cited a noise complaint ticket until the next morning. But anyway, that's what came out of that interaction with the officers.   After the police left, we walked separate paths but both ended up at my car. When I saw him there I told him to fuck off and find another ride home, which was how angry i was towards him because we live almost an hour from the shore. So I stayed in my car until I got an answer from my other friend who has the house down the shore which wasn't until after midnight.   As I was in the car, my friend who had freaked out on me continued his hateful rant towards me in the group chat, basically trying his hardest to make me sound like a loser. So what do I do? I gave him a bunch of sarcastic responses until he was infuriated enough to write: ""I will beat you to death. I will beat your dad and your siblings and your mom and your dog to death. I have lived through things you can't imagine."" Word for word, I have the screenshot.   This one pushed it overboard for me. I called him and when he answered I was screaming and cursing him out and telling him to ""come do it then."" But nothing else significant happened that night.   After i got home the next day, he texts me ""are your parents home?"" I said ""Why?"" he said ""I have to talk to them."" I said ""No you don't, you need to get your car and immediately get off my property."" to which he replied, ""I'm not paying this ticket, either you or your parents are paying for it because it was your fault.""  I read this and out of the intention of avoiding any physical altercations on my property I said ""Give me the fucking ticket. You're not going anywhere near my family.""  He came, game me the ticket and I ripped it up after he left my property. Now I just paid mine ($290) and his court date is tomorrow if he doesn't pay it off which he can't do now because he needs to mail in a check with the ticket itself. Noise complaint tickets can't be paid online in this municipal bureau which I just found out today, if I knew before i wouldn't have torn it up. I sent him a picture of the summons #, court ID, etc. a couple of days ago thinking he'd be able to pay it off online after he sucks up his pride.   He claimed he would sue me because I ""agreed to pay his ticket"" and he screenshot my ""give me the fucking ticket"" text. can he effectively use that against me? I said that to get him off my case with the intention of giving him all the ticket info through text afterwards. When he told me he'd sue me I said i would bring up his death threats towards me and my family.   So if he doesn't show up to his court date tomorrow to plead not-guilty and actually does go through with his claim to sue me, would his case be valid enough for the judge to rule me as responsible for his ticket payment? If so, how would I go about a counter-sue in the unrelated matter of him threatening to kill my family?  Thanks in advance."	Yes
191	My partner co-owns a popular restaurant in our city, and I tend to deal with the general complaints and inquiries that we recieve.   Recently, a woman contacted us over Facebook complaining that she and her friends got food poisoning from our restaurant. [Here's an album of our conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/1OIvv)   In order to prove food poisoning, you must first provide evidence that the food you ate was contaminated, and that this contamination caused you to fall ill. Typically a customer would call their local health committee in order to have an inspection done, which she hasn't. We issued an inspection ourselves, regardless of always having an incredibly clean restaurant with quality produce and staff. We've always passed our inspections.  I actually used to work at the newspaper company she said she talked to, so I contacted the director of the newsroom to confirm that she was in touch with them. The director has yet to get back to me, but I find it odd that a customer would contact the media prior to contacting the restaurant itself. It feels threatening from our end.   I should note that neither of our servers from that afternoon remember ever seeing her, but we can't rely on their memory. I also eat at our restaurant often and have never felt sick afterwards.  Is there anything we can do about this lady?  **TL;DR: A woman contacted us over Facebook to say we gave her and her friends food poisoning. We've never received claims like this before, and our restaurant consistently passes health inspections.	Yes
192	I was in a car accident and the other driver was at fault. The car was totaled and my insurance is paying ~$6,000 for it and I still owe ~$7,000. I have GAP insurance so that should cover the rest of what I owe, and the insurance said the other guy's insurance will cover the deductible. I have no help for getting a new car though, can I pursue having the other driver pay for the new car?	Yes
193	"I own an SEO company and we do legit work.  We have been in this space since 2007 and have had 0 complaints and no chargebacks.  A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results.   2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.    After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.  Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.  He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..    My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.    We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.  We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.  Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.   TL;DR client hired us and did a chargeback which we won, now is threatening legal action in the form of criminal complaints if we do not refund him."	Yes
194	I thought it would be funny to poke a little at one of the biggest businesses in my city, so I made some stupid page that literally only got 2 likes. The article was obviously a joke, talking about how they were going to purchase a graveyard and charge entry as a new “attraction” in town. It’s kind of an inside joke I new all of the locals would get and find humor in. Apparently one of the owners of said business saw the article and didn’t like it, and said he’s going to send me a cease and desist (like I care, it’s a stupid page I just made yesterday that’s not even popular), and he threatened me with legal action.   So can they do anything? I took the post down out of respect, but was just curious  Thanks!!	Yes
195	I was in a collision on my motorcycle a few weeks ago and the police report stated that the other party was at fault. My left index finger was broken and I needed surgery because there was a piece broken off in my middle joint. The surgery went well but i may not be able to fully flex or extend my left index finger for the rest of my life. Therein lies the main issue: I'm a professional musician and my surgeon says I may not be able to play again. I'll also have to take 6-8 weeks off of work due to my injuries. So with her being fully at fault, should I get a lawyer?	Yes
196	"So ever since I got hired at this job there has been an issue with a co-worker and there is a long list let me just start   #1: complains about every thing I do. If it's not my music it's about the way I work and he goes to tell our boss and I get either yelled at or asked to turn of my music  #2: I was playing my music loud enough that I can here it in my area but walks over to my area and complains that my music is too vulgar and it offends him and his religion(Islam) I was listening to wu tang clan and the song had nothing to do with Muslims or middle eastern countries but claims that the words ""mother fucking nigga"" offends him and proceeded to yell it across the shop which in turn offended me because he's not African American I am that pissed me off  #3: I was working on a tire and proceeded to bitch about the way I work and how I'm inconsiderate to my other co workers and that I'm a lazy fat fuck   I just wanna know when it's legal to punch someone in the mouth to make them shut the fuck up and my boss won't help me either btw because the employee make the company more money than I do slightly and has tenure there. Please someone just tell me I can punch him in the mouth because I'm heated and this is the last fucking straw"	Yes
197	Hello,  I sell handmade items online and do all the product photography for my items. I just did a reverse image search of some of my popular sellers. I found a website using one of my photos and my product description to sell similar items. What is the best way to go about getting them to take this down?	Yes
198	Several years ago I received a REALLY racist email from a business in Louisiana that was intended for somebody else. It was sent from a work address, so I forwarded it to the sender's management. Management sent a very weak apology, and that was the end of it.  A few days ago, I was telling somebody about it, and found out while Googling that the person who sent the message is still employed there, and has apparently been promoted.  I'd like to go on a few review sites like Yelp and and tell this story, so that potential customers will know what sort of business/people they are dealing with. I have two concerns:  - Will the fact that this is all veritably true going to keep me out of legal trouble?  - Is the confidentiality threat at the bottom of their emails as hollow as I think it is?  Also, if it matters, the business is in Louisiana but I am in Massachusetts.	Yes
199	My girlfriend went out to a casino this past Saturday night with a group of work friends. Apparently one of the guys in the group was annoyed at my girlfriend for getting cigarette smoke in his face. According to her, he grabbed her by the back of her neck and slammed her down onto the sidewalk. She came home with nasty gashes on her face and forehead. She's asleep at the moment, but as far as I know police were not called and she declined medical attention. An employee of the casino had her sign some sort of waiver which I'm assuming said she wouldn't bring legal action against the casino.   I have no interest in bringing action against the casino but in the morning I'm going to see if she will file a police report against the guy that did this to her. I also believe that the casino will have video surveillance of the incident as well as a copy of the waiver she signed. Will we need to file with the police who have jurisdiction over the area the casino was in? Looking for any advice on how to proceed...  Thank you	Yes
200	Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.  When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay.   My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!	Yes
201	"Got a letter in the mail today that the TASB had private employee information (SSN, names, etc) publicly accessible on one of their web applications.  From one of their directors:  ""It wasn't a hacking into the system, the information was essentially posted to the internet.""  The only consolidation they're offering (besides an ""oops sorry"") is a 1 year subscription to some ""life lock"" type service.  I am wondering if I have any legal recourse here.  They have no information confirming this data was obtained but there is no telling how long that information was available.  Their offices are closed so I have no further information at this moment but I'm trying to see what options we have and what information I need to request from them."	Yes
202	I found my name on the FCC website and my real name with my real address has a comment on it saying I do not support net neutrality. It is the same spam-botted message with many other fake comments. I emailed FCC and they haven't responded. Please someone help me, I am all for NN and this is blatantly stealing my identity for supporting something I do not believe in. Can i take it this to court?  I am from New york!	Yes
203	I apologise for the phone formatting  I recently purchased a home in mid May and was able to move in at the end of May. In the past few days we have had rather hard rains but nothing out of the norm for a summer storm. There was never any flooding problems disclosed when purchasing the home but today and Friday water is coming in from under the trim in the basement. Is there anything legally I can do about this?   Water is pooling in the front of the house on top of a brick walkpath towards the front door and it has to be draining into the soil next to the house which is draining into the basement. The carpet in the basement is getting sufficiently wet where it and the padding is completely soaked. After the storm was done half of the basement was completely soaked on the same side that the water had pooled.   Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks	Yes
204	Hello  I live with my bf and i had a pet (dog/cat, rather not say which) for 2 years before we moved in together. Once we moved in he expressed hatred for my pet. He was willing to deal with it, it seemed. But we got into multiple fights daily because of the pet's behavior. I mentioned once in passing that I feel I might have to give the pet away (this was in no way shape or form permission for him to give away my pet, just a passing thought because of our fighting). But he said, no don't do that.   One day I go to work and I come home to no pet. He decided to give it to a coworker without my permission or knowledge. Once I expressed to him how upset this made me, he promised to get it back. Well the coworker gave the pet to someone else as a gift, but was willing to work with us. He approached the person he gave the gift to.  Gift receiver said no initially. So we offered money. Person later felt bad when they found out the pet was not a random animal but in fact had a previous owner and was given away without permission(they had no idea the pet was not a stray when they received it as a gift). But would only return animal if money was offered to recoup for expenses ($200). We paid money happily.   Gift receiver starts giving us the runaround at this point. Keeps promising to return pet if we met at their house, but refused to meet anywhere else. The whole thing was shady and weird but I was desperate. When we arrived at the residence the new owner said hang tight while I find the pet. Never came back to the door. After almost an hour we knock again and they tell bf to come inside. I'm not sure what happened at this point but there was some sort of altercation and pet was never returned. We left. Situation was sketchy and we were worried about our safety.   My question is, what can we do at this point? This person has agreed to return the pet, with no problem, but now it has been a few months since we initially started going back and forth with these people. I understand the pet was given away but the pet did not belong to the person who gave them away in the first place. And what's more, we paid this person money and now we feel left high and dry. Aside from the situation i have to deal with inside of my relationship because my significant other thought it was okay to give away my beloved pet, what else can i do to deal with new owner?  TL; DR:  Boyfriend gave my pet away without my permission. Person in turn gave pet to someone else as a gift. New owner thought gift was a stray, was not aware it had a previous owner. We offered money in exchange for pet. New owner insisted we meet at their house to pick it up (this was weeks after we paid $200 to them). Upon arrival at new owners house we were met with confrontation and never received my pet. What else can I do?	Yes
205	I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical. When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas. A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call  b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her.  Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request. I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper). *Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty.  *She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.” *Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them. *I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored. *I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.) *I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy. *My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic. *My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call. When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy. Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.	Yes
206	"So there is a guy who for this story i will call ""Tyrone"" who grabed my girlfriend (19F) as she was at the drinkstation at Mcdonalds. She and i used to work there and Tyrone was an aquantence, but without warning today he grabed her, im wondering what we should do. I am going to try my best to get her to file a police report but aside from that what should we do? I belive that it was caught on tape because there is a camera over that area. The people who own this Mcdonalds have covered for an employee in the past who was accused of sexual harassment, so we are not expecting much sympathy from them. I am willing to hire a lawyer for an hour or two to send a threatening letter to the owners, ideally i would like for this guy (he might be a minor, like 16,17,18) to face criminal charges and to lose his job. If you have any questions please let me know, sorry if this is not well put together i am just upset right now."	Yes
207	I moved into an apartment in CT back in May 2016 which turned out to be horrible due to no wall insulation and an unstable downstairs neighbor who moaned when I had females over for fun then smoked cigarettes and denied it and made me ill from second hand smoke. I later found out from a next door neighbor that the prior tenant living in my apartment abruptly left after a few months due to similar reasons to mine. Calls to management made no difference and they denied any smoking or problems with neighbor. They even went as far as threatening eviction for stating I was causing him a disturbance, refusing my calls about the eviction threat then stating it was sent by mistake by their Jewish lawyer during their holiday. Despite all of this, I received a lease renewal request in March 2017 and was too busy with work (I work in a hospital) to look for apartments or sign the renewal. Finally got to a point where my neighbor continued to smoke and then harass me with total denial by him and management and I decided to get the hell out. I found a nice but more expensive place and signed the lease renewal letter on June 1 as intent to vacate by July 1 which was received by them on June 8, 2017. I also left the apartment spotless and in better condition then when I moved in by leaving expensive blinds and newly painted walls. I have all letters, payments and the apartment condition documented with pictures.   Now the management company is refusing to return any security because they are saying I did not supply 30 days notice. The apartment is spotless and they only commented on the timing of receiving the lease renewal notice. Does the timing of the renewal signing and 30 days notice have anything to do with receiving back my security? Can I take them to small claims court?	Yes
208	Can I get in trouble for anonymously registering a domain name (let's say janesmithsucks.com if Jane Smith was my ex) and publishing true things (I could all prove in court if needed) things about my ex wife. No pictures or revenge porn or anything like that, but needless to say though they would not be things that painted her in a positive light.	Yes
209	Groundwater has been leaking heavily out of our street 24/7 for 6+ months in Belford, NJ.  Water Company has been out 4 times but because it is groundwater and not a broken pipe they can't assist.  Multiple homeowners have complained to township but nothing has been done.  The water is now coming out of our yards and seems to be getting worse.  Are there any legal options we can pursue?	Yes
210	Went in to get noise checked, mechanic drives car onto lift and some how punctures a tires sidewall. They want me to pay for a new tire. Doesn't seem right I should pay for their negligence.	Yes
211	"A while back, I bit down on a rock hidden inside a sandwich.  There was a loud crack and a sharp pang but no ongoing pain.  I notified staff and they talked to me and disposed of it before I could get a picture.  I didn't notice any damage or lasting pain so I didn't make a big deal out of it.  Fast forward two weeks, it's starting to hurt, I get it fixed.  I'm talking to the company, I have a picture of the food, a receipt for the dessert I got, but not the sandwich itself.  I'm trying to play nice and I don't exactly want to sue since I really like this place.  The company is saying things like ""well since you don't really have any definitive proof..."" and coming up with excuses with insurance... and offering me 1k to settle.  I declined since I didn't think it'd cover the dental work.  They bumped it up by a bit, still doesn't cover my dental work...   I kept telling them I wanted to wait till I settled the dental work.  There were quite a few complications and trips to the dentist.   Finally, most of the dental work is done and I have a pretty good idea of how much this is going to cost.  They offer the cost of my dental bills and a tiny sum of cash.  I feel like they're trying to screw me over while I'm sitting here trying to play nice.  What should I do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Let me know if more details are necessary. Thanks for reading!"	Yes
212	For some god forsaken reason my neighbor has decided to put up what I can only assume is industrial strength flood lights along their property line facing directly at my home.  They are probably 200ft away but extremely bright, well beyond the normal light produced by the average flood light.   I have tried to ask politely if they could use bulbs  that aren't as bright, or change the direction slightly so they aren't shining directly into my home at night. They have refused and told me it's not their problem.  Could I legally build panels covered in reflective material in front of my property to reflect and reduce the light that is shining on my property? I have tried blackout curtains but they do not completely block the light.  I obviously don't want to do this if it isn't legal, but at this point I don't know what to do.   I live in a rural area, so I'm not sure what specific laws would even be applied that I could look into, or if light pollution is even something that can be considered a nuisance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
213	I made friends with a fellow nursing student about a year ago. We got along well for a most of that time until she started acting very strangely so I tried to reduce our interactions to more of an acquaintance level. I still helped her with school work and coached her through some NCLEX practice exams. I made sure to be very non-confrontational as she has mentioned all sorts of mental instability issues in the past and how she hates having any sort of direct confrontation. I have no idea if any claims about depression or anxiety are actually diagnosed.  We ended up with pretty much the SAME EXACT schedule this past semester. So naturally, we would walk to class together and occasionally go to the restroom together. Normal female things. Nothing she did gave me any cause for alarm. I never tried to bother her. I thought it was a simple, functional, school-based friendship.  This is where things get strange. She started acting very distant and would ignore about half the time when I would say hi and she started leaving class for long periods. Then she started leaving whenever I would even be in the same hall way. She'd leave class about a minute before it was over and not make eye contact with anyone. I thought maybe she was having a serious problem so I texted her to see if she was okay. If anything was wrong, etc. If I could help. I may not want to be best friends but when someone acts THAT oddly, maybe just a little compassion can change whatever situation they are in.  She assures me that everything is fine and then started ignoring me completely a few days later. I gave up on trying to figure out what was up or if I could help. I kept to myself. This was a while back.  I get a text about a week ago saying that she feels uncomfortable with how much I stalked her last semester and she didn't think it was okay for me to go to the restroom with her because she felt that I wanted an intimate relationship and would try something.  I told her I was uncomfortable with further contact after telling her it had been a while since I 'stalked' her and that the stalking she was talking about was unavoidable on both of our parts because we had five classes together in the same day. If she was following me or I her, it couldn't have been avoided but that whatever she perceived to be the case was simply us walking to class together. She was the one that showed up on campus on days that she had no classes and went to some of my classes with me (I had seven classes total that semester). I feel like if anyone should be scared of the situation, it should be me. I'm not, though. Just uncomfortable.  I'm worried that since this contact was so out of the blue and so unprovoked with specific details on how I made her feel threatened basically, that she's trying to set me up in some way. I'm genuinely worried because what if she's saying all of that and being so unpredictable because she's about to do something like file a restraining order? That would kill any future I could have as a nurse.  We are both early thirties in Nebraska if that affects regional laws.  What should I do? Save the texts and get a lawyer on retainer just in case? I don't understand why she would just now start doing all of this when we haven't really talked since last semester. This whole situation feels very wrong to me. I know she's a very good manipulator which is one of the main reasons I stopped associating with her so much. This all just feels too odd and specific to mean anything good.  **TL;DR-** Ex-class mate from last semester texts me out of the blue saying that she feels like I was stalking her. Why bring this up now, without ever indicating that feeling before? What should I do to protect myself and my future?	Yes
214	Hi I live in GA and recently bought a car from a private seller. He hid the fact that the engine was bad by bumping up the RPMs. Is there anything i can do to get my money back or have him pay for the car?	Yes
215	So basically i live on a quarter mile long driveway that i share with my neighbor who we were always friends with and kind to but he is at the very beginning near the road and I am tucked away in the woods at the end of it.  We have beach access and our neighbors have right of way to use our driveway and a path on our property only as a means of traveling to and from the beach. They have come over numerous times without warning to watch the sunset on a section of our property that leads to the beach (rather than the actual beach because they can't make it down the waterfall/stream that leads to it).  We've asked them a few times now to let us know before hand (mainly after an incident where a bunch of strangers and cars unexpectedly showed up for homecoming pictures on our land not the beach) when they are going to come down and we have always been ok with them watching the sunsets on our property leading to the beach as long as they let us know ahead of time. So basically the other day while my mom was at work and my dad was working in our garage they showed up walking down the driveway uninvited and without plans of going to the beach. My dad was outside with our three dogs (Rottweiler, golden retriever, and weimaraner all sweet hearts with no previous signs of aggression even in a house with two toddlers) and my sisters when they decided to walk down with a stranger and there three dogs (a lab, a golden retriever, and an 8 week old Australian shepard puppy they just got a week ago but hasn't met my dogs before).  My neighbors were supposed to be getting married on the section of our property that they always watch the sunset on so they said they were walking down to show the guy they brought with him the work they thought they were going to be doing to our land in preparation for their wedding.  I was not home at the time but i guess while my neighbor was walking ahead with the stranger, his fiancé was standing on our property surrounded by her dogs and now my dogs who ran up to see what was going on. I'm not sure how long the dogs were interacting for but the puppy was new to all three of my full grown dogs and the rottweiler ended up biting her and breaking her leg.  She was taken to the vet and had four puncture wounds as well but they weren't serious.  We were all very surprised to hear of the situation and upset as we are all dog lovers and offered to help in some way but we've never been in this type of situation before and didn't know how payment would work for something like that (we were still going to try to help even if we weren't liable) but my neighbors seemed pretty cool about it and said that wasn't a big concern of there's at the moment. So the dog eventually went in for surgery but never woke up from the anesthesia (we're guessing the dog was given too much for it's young age) and our neighbor told us when it happened and said to not call or text today because his fiancé and step daughter were very angry (at us? the dog? themselves? idk). So the next day my dad was coming home from work and stopped coming down the driveway because my neighbor was out and apologized for the situation he was in and my neighbor went straight to telling my dad that he has a couple thousand dollar pet bill that he's going to send him as well as a receipt for the dog that they spent $2000 on at a pet store.  Now my parents were trying to handle this situation as nicely as possible since we felt terrible and have to continue to share a driveway and think about this relationship longterm but feel like we aren't really fully responsible and don't appreciate how our neighbor is acting like it's completely our/my dog's fault and is going to demand this money from us for the incident without taking any responsibility of his own.  We've tried contacting an attorney just to figure out if it truly is on us but all so far have only been for dog bites on humans. Sorry for the grammar mistakes this is just like the 10th time reciting this so I'm getting kind of tired of it and just wanted some other opinions and feedback on the situation.  After them demanding the money basically my parents don't really want to help them pay the bills at all unless they have to but we believe that my neighbors are mostly in the wrong here and that we definitely shouldn't have to worry about the cost of the dog when the vet is the one that killed it even though my dog caused the need for surgery.  Thank you so much for any feedback this is just causing my family a lot of stress and I'd be happy to elaborate more or clear things up that weren't explained well if questions come up.  TL;DR  Neighbors have always been close friends and are legally allowed to cross a piece of our property to reach a beach that only we have access to but they always stop before getting that far and hangout on our property.  They've unexpectedly dropped down numerous times after us asking for just a heads up beforehand but they thought it would be a good idea to do that the other day with no intentions of going to the beach, a stranger with them, and their three dogs (one of which is a brand new 8 week old puppy that my three big dogs have never met).  Eventually while they were down on my property, uninvited and not there for the reason their supposed to come down, my dog with no history of any aggression bit their puppy breaking his leg.  The dog needed surgery but died due to reasons unrelated to the injury and afterwards my neighbors started acting like it was all completely our fault and that we had to pay the full vet bill as well as the cost of the dog.  Also just an FYI incase it comes up, the beach I'm referring to is public but surrounded by 40 foot cliffs and we have access to the only semi easy way of getting down on our property but my neighbors never go all the way down to the public part they are supposed to (again this wasn't a big deal to us when they would tell us ahead of time)	Yes
216	He was served a pay or quit notice and then surrendered the keys. There was a court date he didn't know about and I assume a default judgment against him for $3500 or so.   My question is; was he actually evicted? I can't seem to find an eviction record anywhere, just a court case ending with a writ of possession.  Also I guess it may have expired? But I thought that took 7yrs, it's been 3.	No
217	Discovered we had bed bugs in one room and reported it july 28, landlord gave us a paper to sign about how to prepare for treatment and since then I haven't heard anything. I asked them twice what was happening and they say they'll call, but haven't. I know it's only about 2 weeks so far but I've never had bedbugs and thought it was a bigger problem. We live in a multi unit apt building if that helps. I'm asking here because we've had to move out of the master bedroom and are sleeping in our kiddos room. It is cramped and not ideal. What can I do to speed things up?	No
218	I work at my state university, and there is a cap on the hours a student may work (25 hours/week). I am an instructional aid (I teach the chemistry labs), but instead of paying per hour that you are actually there they pay you at a rate of 7 hours per every lab you teach (factoring in 3 hours per lab plus 2 office hours and 2 hours grading), and 3 hours for every recitation class you teach. Now, this summer I teach 3 labs and 3 recitations per week: this should equal 30 hours per week, but since I'm capped at 25 hours, I can only enter that many on my timesheet.   I thought that this was far, since often times the 7 hours they pay you for doesn't really equal 7 hours of actual work, but then I thought that they're making me work more per week for the same amount of pay as another student who works 5 hours less than I do.   Is this legal? Thank you in advance for any help!	No
219	Hi, I'm signing a lease for an apartment in Florida, that comes with attached garage. The lease says I am to get notice to enter except emergency for the apartment, but says owner can enter the attached garage at any time without notice. Is this legal?	No
220	So last night around 11 o'clock me and my fiancé heard a chirping and we looked to see our cat playing with a bat. We killed the bat and brought it in to the U of M emergency veterinary services for testing to see if it had rabies. We also brought both of our cats in to a vet to get rabies boosters this morning to further ensure they don't get the disease. We haven't heard back from the U of M yet, but I'm wondering if our landlord can be held responsible for any of the fees since it is either their fault for the bat getting into our apparent through a crack in our walls, or it got into our apartment because they leave both of the front doors and all of the fire doors open at night causing the bat to get into the building,and then sneak through our front door. We asked our maintenance guy about the situation and he said this was the second incident this month and they are calling an exterminator next week. Apparently this has been an on going problem and no one has told us. We're going in on Monday to see if the landlord will cover at least part of the vet bill. Do they have any responsibility to cover the bill legally or are we just stuck with the bill if they refuse? The initial bill for the booster shots plus all of their extra fees was $250 or so, but this will get much more expensive if the test for the bat comes back positive for the rabies virus, especially since we suspect that it was in our house overnight while we were sleeping so then we will need to get treatment. Any advice is appreciated.	No
221	So, I need to find a way to get my mom, siblings, dog, cat and me out of my home and away from my dad. We live in Michigan. I'm 20 years old. My sister is almost 18 and my brother just turned 15. My Dad is verbally abusive to my mom, constantly berating her and screaming about the smallest things. Occassionally his outbursts have been directed at me or my siblings, but mostly my mom. He loves to throw and break things. There have been several times where he has been physically violent towards my mom, hitting her or pushing her over. He pushed her down the stairs once. He has only been physically violent towards me once and never towards my siblings. Most of the time it doesn't escalate this far. He usually only gets really bad when he's had way too much to drink, but he's an alcoholic and drinks every day so...  Anyways, things have been pretty bad recently and my mom is done. She wants to leave, with or without my siblings and me. I'm pretty sure he will kill us if we try to leave though. He has threatened to kill my mom numerous times as well as threatening to kill us all and then himself. He has guns and once pulled one out during an argument, so I don't think they are just empty threats.  I'm just trying to figure out the best way to leave. We need to disappear. I'm tired of being constantly afraid. I have about $15,000 saved up, but my mom doesn't have much. We could make something work. I would obviously have to quit my job because he knows where I work and I wouldn't feel safe, plus we would have to move far away.  My biggest concern is that since my brother is only 15, my dad could fight for custody or if we just left, my mom could get in trouble. I don't know how any of this works, but my dad having any custody if this happens is not an option.  We have never filed a police report against my dad or anything like that, so there is nothing on record. He has no criminal background. During one argument, my mom did call the police (about three years ago), but it was so bad that we left the house before the police got there. They tried to call my mom, but she wouldn't answer her phone so nothing came of it.  Other things that could hopefully somehow help. My dad drives drunk a lot. He hasn't ever been caught though. He also used to smoke marijuana daily, but quit about a month ago. I'm not certain but I think there is still a plant in the backyard.  Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.	No
222	Hello, first time posting here.   I have a 5yo child whose father has never been in her life. He wasn't even there for the pregnancy because he never cared for the child, nor did I want him there because he honestly scares me.  A few months prior to her first birthday, I met a wonderful man who has since then raised her as his own. This man is now my husband as of 6 months ago, and he would love for my daughter to have his last name. However, I fear I would have to get into contact with her bio father for this, which I'm dead set against. Her last name on her birth certificate is my own as, like I said, he has not been present AT ALL since before her birth.   Do I need to contact him for this? Has he lost his rights? Advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
223	"So as the title says, I have some evidence of my landlord entering the house I live in with my 3 other adult room mates.   We are 28, 29, 40, and 21 males respectively with the 21 year old being out of the country for most of the summer. The three older of us all have full time jobs while the 21 year old attends college full time in the fall and spring. We rent all 4 rooms of this house and obviously with that comes use of the bathrooms, kitchen, common areas, etc. Typically all four of us are only home in the late afternoon and hang out in the evenings, so we have little interaction with our landlord Paco (changed for this story). Paco is an Argentinian immigrant, and for the most part a nice dude. All this is just background info.   Recently my girlfriend has been off school for the summer and has been spending time between my house, her parents house, and work considering she hasn't been bogged down with papers, class, etc and has been working a little bit more. On Friday 7/21 she had decided to stay the day and just hang and watch tv in my bed while I went to work so she could meet me at the gym afterwards. Obviously that's boring and she decided to clean the kitchen in the meantime, because with a house full of dudes it hardly ever got a deep clean. Pretty nice of her right? She figured since she was staying over extra that would be her way to contribute something to the house.   Well at some point Paco opened up the side door to the kitchen from the backyard and came face to face with her mopping the floor. He quickly said something along the lines of ""oops sorry"" and quickly closed the door.   Quick backstory on Paco, he pretty much bought the place as a tenant cash grab. My room is an illegal addition that used to be the living room, he lives in an illegal studio built off the side of the garage, and he lugged two Gulf Stream trailers back into the backyard to also rent out to additional tenants.   Suffice it to say we all know it wasn't the perfect situation to be in, but it's cheap so whatever.   Not anymore. After Paco opened up the back door with gf there mopping the floor he decided that we could only have guests over one night a week, which was never specified in the contract. The ONLY thing explicitly stated by the rental contract is that I would be paying rent on the 5th every month and that I would pay a security deposit before hand. Nothing limiting any sort of guests, or behaviors for that matter.   We had a talk about it where I reiterated that gf was off school for the summer and would be spending more time here until she goes back at the end of August. We seemed to agree on that point, and I thought that would be the end of it.   Well he decided to take the thumb turn off of the kitchen deadbolt, and then started stalking around my bedroom windows this morning while gf was getting ready to leave for work. When I walked her out to her car he was sitting right at the fence to his driveway staring at us while he seemed to be trying to fix the fence.   I'm pretty sure code enforcement would love to come have a look at all the living situations up in here, but until I find a new place to live that really isn't an option. Is there anything I can use to keep my landlord out of my place, or am I screwed because I rented a room and not the house? I'm just trying to see what my options are, me and the two older room mates are getting a new place as soon as one becomes available because living with this petty weirdo is getting really frustrating. Beyond giving me grief he's been giving gf anxiety and making the rest of the house incredibly uncomfortable.    (Sorry if this is rambling, it's kind of a developing situation and I'm a little frazzled)"	No
224	"I paid half of the deposit on a room in Colorado before moving in, which looking back on it I know was dumb but I didn't want him to give the room away to someone else. Me and my girlfriend broke up and now aren't moving into the house. I don't have any written receipt of said deposit, but I have a bunch of texts from my girlfriend and myself back and forth with him and his girlfriend talking about this $650 deposit and how it was ""earnest money"" to hold the room, and how he passed up on another renter because of it and that now he doesn't have to pay it back. But it wasn't a holding fee, it was half of the discussed security deposit. He just offered my $300 of it back but that was a large majority of the cash I had saved and I really need the full $650 even if it will take a while to pan out in court, do I have any legal recourse? Can I use those texts in court to sue for my deposit back?"	No
225	"Can anyone help me out? What legal action should I take?  I co-founded a business in 2013 in freshman year of college with a friend of mine where girls step on insects. We usually sold our stuff using xxxfetish-media, which is a good place to sell bug crush and femdom content. I used their official OCMB forums to help figure out what people liked best when I started out. Early that year I saw a legit filesharing website (we'll call it fetishare) where people made accounts to trade videos and got points for it, so I figured that it'd be a good way to spread my store's name around. Well soon after that I found out from the admin on the OCMB forums that they were spying on customers, farming IPs from 'known pirate websites, and in some cases placing malware to track people. I figured I'd stop using the fetishare site and just sell normally.   Well last year in June when I was waiting for a payout from them, I didn't get it and started wondering why it didn't hit my bank account. I contacted them but the customer service wasn't good at fixing it. I eventually got a response saying: 'Your account has been suspended for copyright violations'. So basically I got locked out of my store for something that happened three years ago. Notice I said 'locked out' and not 'closed down'. My store is still up. People can still buy from it and they can make money from it while giving none to me. They don't respond to any of my emails either, except for one when I ask for how I can restore access to my store they said: ""We will for forgive this if you sign a statement saying you will never again share videos.'   I made about $41k/yr from that store. In hiatus/hibernation mode with no updates it at least made $10k from last year to now. I'm owed money, and this isn't right. They're not only hurting me, but other producers by banning customers left and right from being able to buy and lowering profits.  Since then I started my own e-commerce store and hosted on Clips4Sale and Kinkbomb instead. However I would still like to know what to do about this.  I live in Alabama.  Any thoughts? Should I take legal action?  - tl;dr: Possible embezzlement with my store on a fetish hub. What do?"	No
226	1. A friend bought a new home in a new development. 2. The A/C unit installed in the house is objectively too small to cool the house effectively. This is based on a conversation with a company employed technician who has had to repair the unit. 3. All houses in the development were apparently given these A/C units which are too small.   My friend is bugging the company to try to get a better unit, but as can be expected they're not being very helpful.   Before my friend speaks with an attorney, and assuming the company doesn't come through, I wanted to test the waters here to see if you all think they have any chance at a successful lawsuit.  Basically, their argument is that they were sold a house with an A/C unit that they expected to cool the house effectively, and it doesn't do that. I guess the home builder could claim the buyer knew the capacity of the unit and bought it anyway, but I'm not sure whether the average layperson would be able or expected to know about this and/or research it.   Based on casual research, the upgraded A/C unit looks to be about $2,000-4,000, so it's not huge money. I mention that everyone got one of these in case you all think collective action (not necessarily legal) might be a good way to go too.   Thanks in advance!	No
227	"We rented a car from the Hertz in LA, and returned it to a small shop in the San Fran area about a week later. On handing it back in and signing the final paperwork, we were told to fill out a vehicle incident report. Confused, we asked why. Our credit card used to rent the car included insurance and we would have owned up to any damage because it would be easier to coordinate reimbursement immediately. Turns out there was a bend? (no damage to paint, just a six inch deformity?) in one of the doors. We asked to speak to a manager, and were told there was none to talk to. As we were in a hurry, we filled out the form, and were told we would be contacted in 3-5 days if there was going to be any repair charges. A month goes by, we throw out the paperwork thinking all was well. A few days after that (now 36 or so days after returning the car) we get a letter in the mail that we owe $1,021. Its through a private collections company (Viking) so they know nothing about the actual claim itself or has a copy of the itemization. Conveniently the store that we dropped the car off at ""loses"" any documentation after 30 days as it gets sent to the corporate database.   Any advice on how to dispute this? We never got a phone call, an itemized bill... anything. I've submitted a claim that takes 7-14 days to process but I'm just wondering how best to help myself and protect against getting screwed over."	No
228	"Posted this in a thread over on r/finance, and several people suggested I ask the question here.   My gym has a habit of randomly increasing our monthly payment with a $20 ""Club Fee"" a couple times a year. This charge was not initiated until after I signed up, and had signed authorization for a set monthly rate. The agreement I signed included no wording of this fee, so I have not given them permission to charge me this extra amount. I also have received no type of notification of this fee prior to it being charged to my credit card on file.  This seems very illegal to me. Am I right? What course of action might I have to get this stopped?  Already planning on talking with the gym manager when I go in tomorrow morning."	No
229	Hi there,  Few days ago, I received a letter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stating in that I had used the toll road twice in locations in Massachusetts in which that wasn't me. The requested payment was $2.60. Even though the amount was very little, I do not want to pay for the amount for something I didn't do.   So, I started googling on what I should do because I was afraid this was some sort of scam. I started reading articles about a lady who didn't know she was being charged and ended up owing $49,000 as a result. I started worrying about what I should do to resolve this matter so it doesn't come back to me again.  I apologize if this is not the right post for this subreddit. Could you please guide me to the correct one if that's the case? Thank you for taking your time to read my post. :)	No
230	Hi there.   Im leaving my apartment 2 months before the end of my lease and I have found someone else to take it over. If I had stayed my rent would have gone up 1.5% meaning for me it would have been an increase from 1260 to 1278. My question is would this still apply to the new tenant if they take over my lease or can the apartment management give him a totally arbitrary number for rent? He wants to sign for a full year but Im not sure whether he would be paying my protected price of 1278 after september or some higher number that the company would like to give.	No
231	"Good afternoon. I am a family friend of a disabled person who is in a bit of a pickle, and I'm wondering if you can point me to relevant information on how to proceed.    Quite a mouthful: My family friend has cognitive disabilities that are evident. He went to the mall on a day trip, where a third party salesman at a kiosk talked him into buying more than 1500 dollars worth of gift cards (rather than using his card or cash, which raises alarms since gift cards are notorious liasons for fraud) which were then used to purchase a multitude of accessories, two phones, and a new line of service. A new account was set up under his name. The kiosk entered their own email into his account though, he was not told his username or how to access it, and the security questions were not asked. The store must have put random information in, because when trying to access his account with common answers he gives to those questions, they are all wrong. I believe this was purposeful as the incorrect info made it very difficult to access the account or petition for a refund.   When he arrived home and this was all discovered, the phones and accessories were returned in full with ample time left on their return conditions.   He took back everything to the same kiosk and was told to expect a ""corporate check"" in a few weeks to his home address (we don't know if the address they have is correct, since the information on the account is not accessable due of the incorrect info filled in by the kiosk salesman...) Unfortunately when he returned these products, they handed him one return reciept which was folded- it shows only the return of the accessories, totalling about 185 dollars. The phones he returned are NOT listed on this, and this was not found out until later. They kept his orginal purchase reciept when he made the return.   It has been 2 months and no refund has been received, no corporate contact will speak with us or confirm that they have the reciept of this phone purchase in their system. They refer us only the the kiosk. The third party kiosk has not returned our calls. I am starting to worry that he was the victim of opportunistic fraud and that this is not a civil case.   So, what do you think of all this? Should we pursue civil action/arbitration over the untimely refund, or does this sound like a criminal matter to involve police in? We are unsure what to do and are very unsettled. Thank you!"	No
232	"Figured I'd give this a shot. We've had a leak in our utility closet in our apartment, and it's gotten to the point where there's so much water it keeps turning off the pilot light, and doesn't allow us to use hot water. I've tried relighting it but it stays on for a solid 30 seconds and goes out again.   I put in a work order on Monday when it occurred the first time. Tuesday rolled around, no action was taken and no hot water. Earlier this morning  (10am), my roommate called the office and let them know about the situation (again) and they said someone would be out to fix it ASAP. I got home after work (5pm), and the first thing I did was check to see if it was fixed. It wasn't. No hot water, still a massive leak. Someone HAD come by though as the water heater cover was removed. That's it though.   I walked over to the office before they closed and spoke to the manager on duty, and he said that no work had been done on either order. I informed him we've had zero hot water for three days, and he did express concern. The maintenance guy had already gone home but his assistant was still around but about to leave as well. Apparently, there were ""other emergencies"" that the maintenance folks had attended to before ours today. The manager said he would speak to the assistant and try to have it fixed tonight, but it was more likely to be tomorrow.    Now, I know it's a far cry, but what should I do in this situation? I need to wash my clothes and actually take a fucking shower. Any help is appreciated.  TLDR: no hot water for 3 days due to leak, maintenance puts other orders on priority before ours, would like to know next steps to take."	No
233	Feeling very stressed, my landlord has not given me a copy of my lease yet. I used a broker service to find this apartment. There were actually two brokers involved, as mine had found the apartment through another broker.  Last week I signed the apartment lease at the broker's office and paid the deposit, first month's rent, and broker fees. Prior to this I had paid a deposit that took the apartment off the market, and gave them time to run a credit check/give all of my forms over. The landlord was supposed to be there, but didn't show. They said I'd receive my lease shortly. The next morning I did a walk through and signed more forms with the landlord (NY forms about lead paint/child safety bars on windows/etc). But also another one giving permission to run a credit check. (which I thought was weird, bc the broker already did that). The landlord asked for me to give him my social security number and a copy of my gov. ID. (he said the brokers' copy he was given didn't show my photo good enough). He said I could take a few days to make a copy. I asked for my lease then, and he said he hadn't signed it yet.   The move in date was for Saturday, so I moved in and set up the electricity. Yesterday I set up gas, and talked with the landlord on the phone so that he will be there for when the gas company comes out to check. I had also sent a text message about needing my lease, but this was ignored. (giving benefit of doubt it was over looked with texts about gas scheduling).  I've asked again this morning, but haven't heard a reply.  I guess my question is... how do I get a copy of my lease now that I've already moved in? Can he kick me out now that I've moved all of my stuff in and set up utilities in my name? It's all strange, I've always had landlord there to sign the lease when I signed.	No
234	Hi, throwaway because I'm really not sure what to do. I worked for my apartment complex this past year and also lived there. I loved my apartment. I resigned for next year back in February and then in may they told us we'd have to move in order to keep or jobs. I decided to choose my apartment over the job but they still cancelled my lease without asking me. They did not have a valid reason to cancel other than they wanted to move my apartment. I signed for a certain unit and now I currently have no lease. They always told us it was an extremely legally binding agreement both ways. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated because I don't know where to start.	No
235	Hey All,  Just looking for some legal advice on a mortgage that is under my name.  So here’s the story. I was renting an apartment until my cousin’s wife and kids wanted to move to Alberta from Hong Kong to go to high school, but they couldn’t afford the down payment on a house because the bank requires a 35% down payment since they do not have a Canadian income. They proposed that we buy a house together under my name so the bank does not require a 35% down payment. This idea sounded a win-win at the time because I was and still am willing to help them adjust to Alberta life and show them the ropes around the city and I would get to have a garage and live in a house with “family”. We ended up buying the house together and I lived in the basement while my cousin’s wife and two kids lived upstairs. My cousin remained in Hong Kong for his job and sends money over to his wife.  But after about a year my cousin’s wife completely shut me out without explanation. She stopped talking to me and put a lock on the door that separates the main floor from the basement. I confronted her about it and basically she said that I went upstairs too much and that we aren’t a family and they wanted their privacy and she wants to live in a separate house but they can’t afford it. After the confrontation she became more passive-aggressive by doing the following: leaving my mail in the mailbox when she checks it, bought her own laundry washer and dryer for the main floor (the original washer/dryer is in the basement). It seems obvious that my cousin’s wife wants her and her two kids to live entirely separate from me.  I contacted my cousin and told him I wanted him to buy me out, initially he agreed to it but now he is having money issues and even if he does buy me out I can’t get another mortgage for a condo because of this house. I also cannot transfer the house to their name because the bank requires them to buy the house from me and then they would need a 35% down payment again.  Living here has become stressful. The basement I live in is a lot worse than when I was renting and now I am stuck with a mortgage under my name so I can’t even buy a condo for myself I wanted to.  I feel like they used me in order to benefit themselves at the cost of my well-being  Here are some quick facts that I feel are applicable to the advice I am seeking:  * Mortgage is under my name only  * Mortgage payments are paid 50/50 (they pay me cash and I the mortgage comes from my account).  * They pay all utilities because there are more of them. Utilities are under my cousin’s wife’s name.  * The main floor is larger, has windows, and has better kitchen appliances. (I would love to live upstairs)  * They paid a higher portion of the down payment (65/35). They paid their portion through a bank transfer from Hong Kong.   I was wondering what legal options I have to get out of this situation. I was thinking that we should just sell the house and go our separate ways, but they won’t agree to it basically because they would have to down-size, live in a townhouse in a worse neighborhood etc.  Am I legally allowed to sell the house without their permission?   Thank you.	No
236	I'll try my best to keep this brief, but I am looking for some direction.  I was born in 1978, by 1979 my parents were divorced and my dad bailed on us and moved to Florida. My mother re-married several years later and had 2 sons with her new husband. In the early 90's when I was 12/13 years old my mother asked if I wanted to be adopted by my step-father. I agreed, and they took the legal steps to adopt me and change my name.  Now, one important factor here is that step-father was extremely abusive to me specifically. I have no fond memories of this man. In fact, I chose not to burden my children with the same last name as it's synonymous in the town I grew up in.  Also, when I reached the age of 21 my real father reached out to me for the first time. I've since built a good relationship with my real father and have come to regret the adoption that occurred when I was young.  The adoption took place in NJ, where I was born. I currently live in PA and would like nothing more than to reverse the adoption, or at the very least, get back my original name.  My step-father died nearly 15 years ago at this point. My real father is very sick and I'd like to get this done ASAP but I have no idea where to start.	No
237	Is there anything I can do about this? My current lease ends August 27th and I gave the notice by email on July 7th. Seems a little unforgiving to charge me for an entire extra month (September)..	No
238	hello. I live in Wisconsin and own my own home. My boyfriend has lived here for the last 4 years. Things have progressively become more abusive. Never physical but definelty verbal. Today I was in fear it would progress. I had to call the police which required him to leave for the night, but now I am lost. The officer mentioned a 5 or 30 eviction? but any research ive done online does now help. He does not pay me rent. He does pay the electric and cable bill, although only electric is in his name. Can someone please help me because these forms make me believe the 5 and 30 difference is based on rent? he has never paid me rent. Please help. I need to go to the courthouse first thing in the morning and I am so lost.	No
239	I've been in my current apartment for several years now, and last year the old landlord sold the building to a new person, not a management company or anything like that. No idea if that's significant or not but the new landlord seems to have very little idea what he's doing, ie not depositing rent checks for weeks.   Anyway. Recently the water pressure in the unit has gone down significantly, to the point where the toilet basin doesn't fill after a flush. Basically, busted toilet. Only one in the unit.  I've e-mailed the landlord about it twice because I want a paper trail but he hasn't responded for almost 3 days now. What are my options here? Thank you in advance.	No
240	"I recently had maintenance come to investigate a strong ""smell"" in my place and it was immediately identified as Kilz brand paint fumes. He said they ""work with Kilz every day and that's definitely it."" He told me that the apartment was completely painted wall/floor/ceiling with either Kilz paint or primer, and that it was very likely that the next coat of paint for the walls and ceiling was applied before the Kilz paint had time to fully cure, and that the flooring was likely laid down too soon as well. He said that he personally took over coordinating renovations on my apartment after those steps had been completed but was informed that was what happened. I also have had conversations with neighbors stating that the unit I'm in was renovated super fast. After some minimal research, the scenario of not letting the first coat cure before moving on can lead to an oil-based paint/primer (which Kilz is) never being able to cure, and to continuously off-gas. Looking into just what chemicals are being released by this brand is difficult but in general VOC (volatile organic compounds) tends to come up a lot, and acute exposure to VOC matched my recent symptoms nearly exactly.   The problem here is that I've been living in this apartment for 11 months (alone by the way). When I first moved in Sept of 2016, I encountered the smell, which I just assumed was the recently renovated apartment smell, and would fade. I moved from a big city to a smaller city and part of the move was to be able to be outdoors a lot more of the time, with more fresh air, so I was outside a lot and kept the windows open constantly whenever I was home. Even in the colder months, I'd air the place out every few days just because I like the fresh air and it was never crazy cold where I lived. I do travel for work regularly, and work from home the rest of the time, so when I'd leave on a work trip and come back, the apartment would have been closed up, and I'd notice the smell again, but air the place out and get on with life. The first few months in the apartment were busy as it was a new city/area for me, so lots of exploring to do, and lots of people visiting. For the past year I'd have an extended time away from the apartment about once every five or six weeks, with the same ""smell"" when I came back, and eventually I just assumed that this was how the apartment smelled - it's an old building, and not completely airtight anywhere, so I figured the off-limits basement had this smell and was just coming up through the (poorly finished) plumbing/walls/ducts.  This continues with no severe/unusual/sudden effects on my life until it is late June/July and is now too hot to leave the windows open all the time. I was getting very drowsy in the afternoons, lightheaded, and occasionally have headaches. Would also feel absent minded and lethargic and just not myself in general, but didn't really put that together with the lightheaded feeling. But the ""smell"" was getting pretty intense with the windows closed nearly all the time, and in the afternoon on hot days it was be just unbearable, and if I was working from home I'd have to force myself to leave. I say force because it was a good 10 minute internal conversation (yes voices in my head, like a crazy person) trying to convince myself that yes u/Kilz_Fumes_Apt, you should stop what you're working on and go somewhere for a bit.  I decide to put in a request for maintenance to come and investigate the odor which I'm assuming is coming from outside the apartment, only to be told that it is in fact paint fumes, and I am basically living in a box that is 360 degree coverage in the source of the fumes and that the source will likely never stop off gassing. Also turns out that heat and humidity will increase the rate of off-gassing as well. Now it seems I've apparently also been getting at least a low dosage exposure for 11 months, with about of month of recent, high dose exposure resulting in acute symptoms of VOC poisoning. (fyi it sounds like serious long term exposure to VOC's has some pretty grim possibilities including increased risk of cancer, and semi-permanent to permanent brain damage resulting in memory loss and reduced cognitive reasoning capacity. Super!!!)   I have had a brief conversation with the property management about this, and there is initial talk of letting me switch to a different unit, which I am almost certainly doing when I return (I am away on work again currently, and btw haven't felt this good/focused in 2 months). They have currently installed a charcoal-filter air purifier in my apartment and it's been running for a week while I've been away, but according to a neighbor with a spare key, there is apparently still a noticeable smell in the apartment.  My questions to r/legaladvice are: - Do I have need to get legal counsel and is it likely it would be worth it? - Will working independently outside of a formal legal agreement with the property management (e.g. swapping units in the same complex) possibly nullify any future actions? - Do I have a reasonable expectation to expect compensation for having to stay in a hotel if upon my return I find the apartment to still have a noticeable paint fume smell? - To what degree am I personally responsible for not recognizing the ""smell"" as paint fumes, and taking action sooner? - What am I missing here, that maybe I should be thinking about but unable to realize myself?  Much thanks!"	No
241	"Girlfriend thought she only needed to give 30 days notice to not renew her lease. Turns out its 60. The lease says they'd give her a reminder ""in writing"" 5-90 days in advance.  1. What is the legal definition of a written notice? Can it be email or physical? Do they have to prove it was delivered? Either way we know she never got anything.  2. Her lease automatically converts to a monthly lease if you never give notice and don't sign a new one. She still has about 45 days so that isn't close, but we are afraid the rate for staying one extra month will be $2000 instead of $1250. The early termination fee on the entire lease is $2500. What options should we explore?"	No
242	"My brother got a girl pregnant via one night stand, the baby is now 2. He wants primary custody. Here are the circumstances.  The mother has no criminal record. Has her own home. Has 3 kids. Works as a CNA and makes probably $25,000ish a year. She is the custodial parent. We are concerned about her volatile relationships. She has had several boyfriends since her daughter was born. She keeps getting back together with the other 2 kids's dad, an alcoholic who has been arrested for DUIs several times; as recently as March 2017. Everytime they've broken up, she blasts him all over Facebook, posts pictures of him cheating on her with her sister, goes into these huge drama posts. He supposedly threatened to set their house on fire during one of their off-periods.   My brother expressed concern the last time she got back together with him. She said he was still drinking, but that she would get him help by bringing him to a church sobriety program once a week. My brother used to check the fridge every time he'd go over there out of concern for Baby. 3 months later, they're still together, she's still having alcohol around the house. She posted on Facebook a few weeks ago a picture of her boyfriend working on their car next to a beer, and captioned it with ""yeah that's his beer, if you have something stupid to say about it, say it to my face!""   It's just a matter of time before they break up again and more drama erupts. Last time they broke up, she had posted on Facebook that the guy wasn't safe for her kids to be around, and that she'd never let him around them again. Before she brought this guy back into her life, she had a different boyfriend where there was a domestic dispute, they both assaulted each other but neither pressed charges, and the kids had to be locked in their room. Brother has a text of her talking about it.   She smoked cigarettes while pregnant with all of her kids and still smokes. She sent my brother a text about how she was smoking in the car and an ash flew under her butt and she crashed the car, several months ago. She's posted several videos on Facebook of her recording her kids dancing to music at a 180 degree angle from the road, and has one video (albeit a year old) where one of her kids is next to her in the passenger's seat.  Brother is a registered sex offender. Offense was committed 8 years ago. Makes 40k a year, has his own home and lives with a girlfriend. They've been in a stable relationship for a year. Never has brought the daughter around any other girls.  In the court ordered parental agreement, my brother is only supposed to see Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. However, through informal agreements, my brother has seen the baby every weekend Thursday-Sunday for several months. Before that, informally he had the baby Thursday-Sunday every other week, and visited on the alternating weeks.   My brother drives 1 and a half hours to see his daughter one way, it should be mentioned. He's driving 6 hours round trip each week to have his daughter.   Our biggest issues are her instability and that everytime Mother gets mad she threatens to ""enforce"" the actual parental agreement, which would mean that Brother only gets Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. She uses the daughter as a pawn to control my brother.   He used to give her $200 a month, undocumented, on top of his child support. He stopped after a lawyer advised him to, she went hysterical and nearly ""enforced the agreement"" again. It's walking on eggshells with her now. Any day she will probably pull their informal agreement. We don't even know if he'll  be allowed to get her this upcoming week.  Our question -   My brother wants to hire a lawyer and go to court. He wants the primary custodian title, shared decision making and to have Baby 5/7 days while the Mother would get her during the weekends. Is this possible, considering the circumstances? We have screenshots of everything I mentioned, texts she's sent him, etc. He just doesn't want to waste the $4000 retainer for a lawyer if this is going to be a waste of time or if there's not enough here, if his sex offender status would not allow for it, etc.   The mother likely can't afford a lawyer. Don't know if she would be representing herself or what, but probably.   Thanks."	No
243	A couple of months ago I noticed the carpet in one of my two bedrooms was wet. Upon further inspection, I saw black mold lining the corner of the carpet in the surronding area. I called my apartment complex's reality company that handles all issues and had to leave a message. In the meantime more and more area in the room began to have water coming up (with no sign of wall leakage) and the carpet was soaked to the point of squisheness so I used my own carpet cleaner to suck up as much as I could, but it seemed the water would replace itself every time I tried. Within a period of 3 weeks, they had a carpet cleaning company come out twice to remove the water. Both times the water came back. Now we are more than two months from the issue first arrising and it has still not been fixed. I have called multiple times about it, and they give me the run around. At this point, I have not been able to stay in the room for about 2 months and my bed currently resides in my living room. I am getting very impatient waiting for them to fix anything, and now I  am wondering if I'm entitled to some kind of compensation because the room has been unliveable with the smell and mold. I don't know how to go about getting this issue fixed. Please advise!	No
244	My roommate and I signed a lease for an apartment (September-September) in Nova Scotia two months ago. Now, almost a month before we're supposed to move in, she tells me out of the blue she cannot come live with me, she has to stay at home. Her (completely legitimate) reason being she is incredibly sick, her mental and physical health issues have caught up with her, and she has to stay home near her doctors until January at the very earliest. Long story short, she has no other option but to break her lease - the lease we signed together.  From what I understand, since we signed the lease together, if she breaks it, then I am forced to break it, too. If I do that, I have to pay a $300 fine as well as pay monthly rent until new tenants can be found. My other option would be to break it, re-sign it, and be on the hook for my rent as well as hers, unless I find a new roommate. A third option would be to find a new roommate and just sublet my old roommate's room. But, seeing how I apparently need to give a month's notice for a sublet, I have two days to find a new roommate (which is an incredibly difficult, if not impossible, task, especially when I do not live in Nova Scotia and cannot meet potential roommates in person).  My question is this: are my three options I outlined flawed / false in any way? Do I have any other options that I haven't considered, that might be better alternatives? As my roommate is dumping all this on me with such short notice, do I have any protections? Or am I completely and royally screwed?	No
245	I was looking for apartments in the Los Angeles area and found one I liked.  As part of the application process, I was required to deposit one month's rent (roughly $1,500) with the current tenant, who had leased the entire unit and was looking to add a roommate to the lease.  Neither party was particularly experienced with the process, so all I have is an email from the current tenant confirmed that I sent them a deposit for 1 bedroom / bathroom in a 3 ba/3 br unit.  My application was approved by the building management to be added to the lease, but I ended up finding a better housing situation, and so informed the current tenant that I was no longer interested.  Aside from the application, nothing was signed with the building management, and certainly no lease.  The current tenant now refuses to return my deposit on the grounds that it was a holding deposit meant to compensate them for these types of situations.  My position is that, given that this entire process start to end lasted less than 10 days, it's unreasonable to retain an entire month's rent as compensation for this.  Is the current tenant justified in keeping all of my deposit, and, if not, what options do I have for getting it back?	No
246	I live in PA, my house is on a corner lot. My deed states that a ten foot wide roadway must be accessible for my two neighbors next to me to access their property located at the back of my property. It is my land on the deed. One can I remove this from my deed so I can build a garage or shed? Two, the person next to me is not providing access to their next door neighbor which it states in my deed could this help? There is a gate to my neighbor’s yard but I have never seen anyone use the gate. Please help if you can, and thanks in advance.	No
247	"I live in a house with a few other people. Up until this month, everyone has been paying the one tenant (hereby called Tenant A) who was on the lease. These payments also include our last-month rents that we paid when we moved in.  As of this month (July), I and the other tenants are on the lease. Tenant A, who was previously the only tenant on the lease, is off the lease this month (July), but is living here until July 31st. When we asked Tenant A for our last month rents, he essentially told us to go pound sand, as they say.  There is no documentation for anything (lesson learned!). All transactions have been paid in cash.  I'm pretty sure this is a huge longshot, and that I am up ""shit creek,"" as they say. But is there anything we can do to get our last-month rent payments back? I don't know if what Tenant A did is even illegal. There is no documentation but there is the word of all the current leased tenants.  Some side questions:  (1) Tenant A's motivations are that we owe him for the security deposit he paid when he got on the lease. I'm under the impression that the deposit is between Tenant A and the landlord? and that moving-in tenants do not owe deposit money to moving-out tenants. With the state of the house, Tenant A would not be able to get the deposit back from the landlord.  (2) Tenant A, upon notifying me that I wouldn't get my last-month back, also threatened to call the landlord and say a bunch of things to make sure I get kicked out of the house. I'm not even sure what to do about that, legally or personally.  Thanks, PoorDecisionMaker69"	No
248	"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	No
249	So our landlord just told us that she is filing for bankruptcy and that she will be foreclosing on the apartment we live in. First she said that we would be able to stay in said apartment after she forecloses until after the bank is done which could take up to 2 years(said it happened to a friend of hers and she didn't have to pay rent. But now she wants us to sign a lease termination fee and is saying that we won't be able to stay. Not really sure what to do I looked around at some chicago laws and some places say that we would be able to live there until the end of our lease either for free or by paying rent just not to her to the bank or someone assigned by the bank. she sent a lease termination form from her lawyer and wants us to sign it Please help I have no idea what to do.

250	Divorce with the ex was final almost two years ago, but there is no official custody agreement as I filed in Colorado, and she and daughter live in Massachusetts. Fiance and I have agreed that we want to try to get custody (we will be married soon, that should help). Daughter has said that she wants to live with us. What steps do we need to take? Should we get a family law attorney in Massachusetts, since that is where she currently lives? Any idea how much something like that would cost? Totally out of my wheelhouse with this so any advice is appreciated.	No
251	"Location: Colorado  I'm in my mid-20s. My mom was recently served with a ""Petition for Dissolution of Marriage"" document by my stepdad. I went over to talk to her about it, and she started handing me things to bring back to my place. These include legal documents for the ownership of several valuable horses that she owns ($20k+) as well as two guns that she uses for horse-mounted shooting (if it matters, they're crippled guns only capable of shooting blanks).  I have a suspicion that this was the wrong decision, but I just took the items from her and put them in my car because she was crying and I just didn't know what to do in the moment. She also tried to get me to take my half sister's passport (she's a minor), but I refused to take that.  What sort of legal risk am I at for being in possession of these items? I believe the Dissolution of Marriage document states that she's not allowed to hide assets."	No
252	"Hello reddit!   So basically my friend needed to find out some regulations regarding a certain immigration topic in Belgium. She sent an email to a  belgian lawyer asking for help and she wrote ""please let me know how much your help would cost"".   After they exchanged 2-3 more emails(the lawyer completely ignored the request for a fee). In the latest email he just wrote saying he'd like 275 euros for the information his given so far.  So my question is can a lawyer ask for payment over this? With no written contract or agreement to pay? My friend is willing to pay but she feels that the lawyer was shady over his fee discussion and does not want to pay 275 but since this is a lawyer she is afraid of maybe some loophole she might be caught in Belgium laws."	No
253	Here is my situation.   My SO and I live in an apartment complex that allows either one cat OR one dog under 30 lbs. My SO currently has a cat that lives with us, the cat is documented with the rental office and we paid the deposit and pay extra each month.   I am hoping to get an emotional support dog. I do have a diagnosed disability and my therapist and general practitioner are both willing to write a letter for me. I am willing to get a breed fitting the weight limits of the apartment, and I plan to be very involved with training the dog (perhaps to be a certified therapy dog along with being my ESA).   I have seen many posts about getting one ESA in a no pets building, but what about getting a second animal to be an ESA in a 1 pet limit building? Can the management office deny this request or am I protected under the Fair Housing Act?  Honestly I know for a fact that some other people in the complex have multiple cats and I've also seen dogs clearly over the 30 lb. weight limit. I can make a reasonable guess that I could just get the dog without mentioning it at all and nobody would notice, but I'd prefer to go about this the right way and I'm hoping to better understand the legal processes.

254	"Hi folks,  I live in a 3-person apartment in California. All three of us are on the lease. I suspect one roommate might be encouraging the landlord to evict the other two of us. I don't believe our small city has any specific rental laws re; eviction, so we're just bound by state law. The roommate's complaints:  * My other roommate occasionally plays music too loud in his room, though not late a night. * We mop, but don't mop frequently enough. * We scrub the counters and sinks, but not frequently enough. * We, infrequently, leave a pan or two in the sink overnight (once every two weeks or so). * Sometimes, small messes (e.g. a bit of flour powder from cooking) are left scattered too long on the sink top. This usually gets cleaned up quickly (e.g. soon after cooking) but every month or so, we might * The smell of the foods we cook bother him, though we run the fan and open the window. * I once restarted a what I thought was a malfunctioning router while he was gaming (I didn't know he was home). * I make too much noise walking in the apartment (creaky floorboards and I usually stay up until 1:30, though I try my best to slink and wear slippers). * We don't shut the lights off every time we leave the room. We do when we intend to permanently leave, but not always if we're going to other rooms to retrieve something or take a call.  Otherwise, we pay our rent, treat the apartment well (the landlord frequently comments how amazing it looks), keep things always sanitary, and don't engage in illegal activities. Does my roommate have a case that the other roommate and I are a ""nuisance"" and thus could be evicted for cause?  **Context for what set my roommate off**  My upset roommate frequently sends out long and vaguely threatening rants to me and my other roommate (""There's scum on the sink behind the faucet. Here's a picture. Clean this up. I will not ask you again"" ""You left your cutting board on the counter and I wanted to use the counter. Move it immediately"" ""You left the dishwasher door open too much. I had to close it.""). I have many emails and text messages containing these rants.   While I was away on vacation, he sent me some pictures of a extremely minor mess (flour spill + oil spatter; 10 sec clean up time), which I didn't make, and told me to clean it up. I finally lost my temper and to him to knock it off and not bother me on vacation and that the kitchen was perfectly usable in the state it was in. He ranted over text message for a while and then told me that I'm welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. I told him he's welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. He told me that he was the original tenant in the apartment and kindly allowed me to move in and live with him and therefore am morally bound to follow his rules.  ** My commentary**  I agree that, given the standards of cleanliness my roommate demands, the other roommate and I are a nuisance ***for him***. However, I argue that his standards of cleanliness are unreasonable and that my other roommate and I are already meeting him much more than half way. Frankly, I think he has serious control issues and possibly has some form of mental disorder (e.g. no eye contact, shuffling walk, no furniture in his room, never laughs or smiles, never accepts invitations to socialize, etc...).  He does have a point that my other roommate and I are messier than him. However, that's because he doesn't actually use the apartment. He comes out of his cave in once in a blue moon and has a fit when he sees that everything isn't spotless at the moment (i.e. he doesn't consider how long a mess has been there). He doesn't cook or use the kitchen or use the living area. His complaints seem to be primarily about minor aesthetic issues that eventually do get cleaned up regardless or things that he could solve on his own without any difficulty (e.g. he can spend 3 seconds moving a cutting board someone forgot, in a rare instance, to put away if he wants to use the counter). We all have our own bathrooms, so thankfully that's not an issue.  We also know that he allowed the apartment to be illegally sublet at a profit prior to our move-in, but we don't have any evidence beyond the word of the guy who sublet the apartment (and maybe he has some paper-work, but he probably doesn't want to get involved).  We also know that he had previous conflicts with one or two of the previous tenants.  I asked him to compromise and understand that living with roommates always comes with minor annoyances but he told me something like, ""It's unfair that you would expect me to do extra work for anything I didn't cause."" In the context of this conversation, it was regarding the fact I forgot to close the dishwasher door after unloading and he had to close it as he walked by.  ** My question **  * Does he have any legal basis to get my other roommate and I evicted? * Now that he's officially complained to my landlord, what options do my other roommate and I have to present our case and make sure the landlord doesn't see us as bad guys? Both of us intend to move out when the lease terminates, regardless, but I'd prefer to not have to deal with any ensuing landlord issues."	No
255	Over the weekend I was having a discussion with friends and they turned me on to the California Overtime Exemption laws. I work in the IT field, and according to [one site I found](http://ckslaw.com/it-and-computer-technology-workers/) it appears I'm paid significantly below the Overtime Exemption threshold, but am salaried and not provided overtime pay.  The main hangup I have is that if I check the [actual wage order](http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/WageOrders2006/iwcarticle4.html), it breaks down the salary cutoff as 2 times the state minimum wage, so I'm not sure where that number in the first site comes from.  I've never had any experience with legal matters like this and am not really sure what to do with this information. Any advice is greatly appreciated!	No

257	Hi everyone, hope I'm posting in the right place  We closed on an older (~35 years) home in early July, so we were expecting some issues. The owners was gracious enough to leave us receipts for some of the work they had done to the home. One of these receipts were for some foundation/crack patchwork they had done in the laundry room and the installation of a sump pump.  We had the home inspected and the inspector didn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary that we couldn’t see with our own eyes. There were some patent defects (i.e visible defects) so we made the informed decision to proceed with the purchase.  Fast forward to when took possession of the home.  We removed the basement carpet and noticed it smelled and there were some wet spots. We figured this was normal with an older home/older carpet so whatever. Then we explored the option of installing a window in the basement, so we took off the drywall and saw a big problem…a large crack in the foundation from top to bottom (where foundation meets the attached garage). When the house was being sown, this room had boxes and furniture in the area of the wall which made it impossible to see or feel the carpet  We called some foundation repair guys to fix the crack, which they did. But in the process, they noticed that the entire weeping tile surrounding the home was clogged with roots, which they said would be the reason the old owners installed the sump pump this past spring (right before they listed the home for sale)  So what was originally a ~$3000 crack repair job has turned into a ~$30,000 crack repair/excavation around the home/waterproof/weeping tile replacement job. They even had to break our garage floor and excavate down to the bottom to replace that piece of the weeping tile system  So, my question is…anyone have success with latent defect lawsuits (Ontario, Canada)? I know “Buyer beware” is at play in all real estate transactions, but with a crack big enough to put my hand in and the fact that they installed a sump pump prior to putting the house on the market leads me to believe they or the plumber or even the real estate agent  knew something was up.  TL;DR…Bought an older home only to discover a cracked foundation and clogged weeping tile system. We’re in for  ~$30,000 worth of repairs so far	No
258	Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	No
259	My wife and I are getting divorced and I'm trying to figure out if I'll have a penny left to my name after this.  We have a house, 2 cars, no children.  Married 2 years.  What I'm trying to determine is how ownership of the house is divided. We've been putting money into paying it off as fast as possible, including an inheritance that she received last year.   Is it as simple as the two of us agreeing to how much each is owed, or is there an official accounting method?	No
260	Last year i went into the hospital and was misdiagnosed with the stomach flu, i went home and a week later ended up taking myself back to the emergency room after my appendix ruptured. I ended up needing emergency surgery after the drains didn't work and spent three weeks as an inpatient. I had to drop out of school for the semester and am still having problems. is this worth a law suit? or even a consultation?	No
261	It is a very restrictive non-compete and the company won't contract with any voice actor who won't sign it. But as a contractor, I thought a Company couldn't compel/enforceable a non-compete like that. It would prevent voice work for other simmilar companies, educational video voice over work, and science video voice over work. That's pretty broad. Can the enforce something like this for a contractor? They are not paying to license the voice, or hiring a spokesperson.	No
262	I started to work with a startup 3 months ago. They wanted to know my hourly charge and how many hours I am going to work in a week. Then they said they need the app asap, because they are going to release their product within 2/3 months. So I worked overtime and made the app almost usable (according to other fellow devs) within 2 and half months. Now when I asked for my overtime payment, they clearly denied my payment. They did not pay me 3 weeks payment. They did not pay me overtime payments. Then they stopped to communicate with me. Removed me from slack. No reply to my emails. How should I deal with this situation ? I am working as an hourly freelancer from India. This startup is Brooklyn, NY based startup.	No
263	"Long story short, my partner of [N] years, together in general (not married) of [N+2], called me back on [a recent date] to say we should get a separation. [shortly after] I drove some of her belongings to her [quite a distance] and we settled things and had a verbal agreement to kinda go our separate ways.  [there is a significant piece of ""ammo"" I have to use against her, however it is heresay, although she is the one who told me this piece of information]  In our relationship, I worked, she became sick, I told her I'd take care of us. So I'm not sure how the separation is going to work money wise. She has since picked up a job. Never actually getting diagnosed. We were not intimate for the last 8 months of our relationship (her decision).  She is recollecting a time in which we were intimate early in the relationship and she is now phrasing that I assaulted her.   I am scared, and I want to just tie things off and go our separate ways, even if I absorb all the debt and she leaves with what she came into the relationship with.  I have a consultation with a lawyer setup for next week. for 250$. We bought a house, vacationed, got in debt. So even though I have a great job now. My past has financially crippled me. The lawyers office said the retainer is 1500, at a rate of 240/hr. Of which is 6 and a bit hours. Of which if we chat and get a document together. If we send it to my ex, and she doesnt agree, then its just a waste of money? Or if she doesn't respond? or something to that effect ...   I just don't know what to do or where to start. I mean, the 250 consultation, but no legal advice until 1500$ ... and I can't do legal aid since I make too much. And I don't have cash because I'm back to back paying off loans and credit card debt.  Thoughts? need more info? inbox me?"	No
264	"Good afternoon! I desperately need some advice. I purchased my own home a few months ago and rented out a bedroom to a couple that seemed to have fallen on hard times and decided to help them out a bit.  They have always been late on payments, causing extra drama and then not paying me $100 in rent due to said ""drama"" that they caused.  Now they're saying they found weed in the bathroom and will not be paying rent for 30 days and that I can't evict them before that.   I don't even smoke weed, the picture they sent me was like a microscopic piece of weed and my agreement with them is on a week to week lease.  Can I not just end the lease starting today and they would only have one week to move out? Please advise and thank you in advance! This Is in Houston, TX if that helps."	No
265	"I originally posted this in /r/boston and was directed here instead.  I took a look at my electric bill this morning, and noticed that SFE Energy (one of those companies that goes door-to-door to discuss energy options) has apparently been providing my energy through Eversource since November. I usually just login, see the amount due, and pay online without taking a look at the finer details of my bill. Last week I did look at my bill, and noticed SFE was listed as my energy provider. I distinctly remember them coming to my door around October or November last year, and I freely admit to talking with one guy, asking my name, etc, but after 5 minutes or so I told them I wasn't interested. I kept the original agreement, incomplete and unsigned, and shredded it later that day. I called them to inquire, they had no email address for me on file, have never mailed/emailed me before, and they finally emailed me with a copy of my ""original"" agreement only, and the signature is forged.  Since my initial post earlier this morning, I have spoke to one of their customer service reps over the phone, and was asked to forward over proof of my signature such as from my license, which I have now done. What's the best course of action to take? Obviously, I want to be removed from their services, but I do have any recourse to be reimbursed for the money that was spent on their services? Is there a police report to be filed against the rep for the forgery?"	No
266	Like everybody and their brother in this town, I too, am an aspiring screenwriter on the side.  I am about to start a tech job at one of the major studios, and in my offer letter it has the boilerplate stating that as of the day of my employment I assign any and all IP to them.  I don't really have any choice about signing this if I want to work there.  This job is not creative, but I could be exposed to creative projects at various stages of development.  I have developed to a reasonable degree one TV project (pilot written, season 1 outlined) and on film script (fully outlined with 20 pages of dialogue).  I've never really done much with either project other than have my friends read them.  I have no representation, nor am I a member of any trade union.  Obviously I'd love to have the film studio pick up either of these projects, but I don't want to have gifted these work (nor anything else that I create) to the film studio just because they've hired me as a code monkey.  What are my rights here?    I know in CA that as far as tech is concerned as long as you don't develop the IP with the company's time or resources and it is not substantially related to their business you can own it.  Does the same thing apply to creative works?  Can I continue to create works on the side?  Obviously, I can't steal ideas from anything I get exposed to at the studio.  What precautions should I take to avoid any appearance that I've done so?  You can find a lot on Google advising independent creatives about sharing stuff with studios, but I don't see anything pertaining to individuals with an employment contract.  Thanks for reading.	No
267	I'm in NY and preparing for a divorce and have a quick question, since I haven't been to a lawyer yet and am trying to anticipate things in advance in order to make a rough plan.  We own a house but have only about $8000 in equity. We've decided the best option is for me to keep the house. I am assuming this means he will just owe me $8000 less (since I will be receiving half of his retirement funds, etc.) but he seems to think that the court will order half the cost of the entire house deducted from what he is supposed to pay me. (So, including all the money that we still owe the bank.) That doesn't seem right to me, I'm just curious if anybody could help me out with what to expect.	No
268	I sublet my room under the table without the consent of my apt complex. I know that's where I went wrong so let's move past that. The original lease is up now so we are all moved out. Anyways the rent of $500 was to be paid to me in cash in the first week of the month. He bailed without paying the last month and I want to know if I have any options. We have a verbal contract for this agreement month to month and since it was $500 I'm of the understanding that's a valid verbal contract.    Can I take this guy to small claims? Any help would be appreciated.	No
269	So my dad is on a ton of medication for his blood pressure that causes extreme frequent urination. Yesterday morning when he was headed home he got the urge to go RIGHT then. Anyone that has been on diuretics will understand. We are in Oklahoma by the way.  He pulled over in to an enclave (in a fairly rural part of town). As he was leaning against the hood urinating into the woods, someone drove by. They turned around as he was getting in the car screaming at him. (The guy had his wife and child in the car). My dad drove off because that is obviously a scary situation to be in.  Later we find out that the guy is blasting all over social media that my dad had his pants around his ankles and was masturbating in public. He didn't name him by name but we have an EXTREMELY recognizable car. Think only one of them in the state. He has since taken down the posts but claims to have made a police report and such.  My dad is an absolute wreck. He believes he has ruined our families reputation, is going to be hauled off to prison because its his word against theirs and they have three witnesses.   We have been in contact with lawyers and they just told him to lay low and not worry about it. They said worse case the cops might come by and talk to him. Urinating in public isn't a sex crime here in Oklahoma either.  Is there anything else I can do, what should we reasonably expect? What can I tell my dad to calm him down?	No
270	I was stopped the other day and was given a court date. The cop allowed me to drive home and was was a very nice guy. I'm just worried about what will happen once I appear in court. If the officer didn't arrest me at the time, can i still go to jail?	No
271	A work colleague is moving here from France in August 2017. He will eventually be purchasing my car, but can not get a state driver's license or registration until he has a social security number. This can apparently take up to 6 weeks. The US midwest in a small town is difficult to navigate without a car.  I want to help him out, but dont want to be liable for any accidents.  What is my best option to stay legally safe but still help him?	No
272	Multiple months ago my fiancee and I signed a lease with our landlord to move to a different duplex to live without roommates. Today they called to say the family where we are supposed to move to hasn't moved out. They thought the lease ended in December. They are trying to get us to move to much shitier apartments at a unreasonable rent for them inconviencing us. They have already leased our current place to others. What do we do? They are now offering we move to the apartment for a month while they try to evict the people in what was supposed to be our new place. What should we do?	No
273	Let's say I write a book about a now pretty unknown legend. The word has had various different meanings over the years. And if I ever make a movie I don't want the studio to be a dick. And take down other works people might make. What's the best way to make sure I can legally do that, before any studio  gets their hands on the script?	No
274	"GF and I broke up. I confronted her about her affairs and told her I would report her [unrelated] illegal activity. She got an order of protection. She went out of her way to tell me in an email that her police report included that I ""shattered a light switch.""  I have a family court hearing coming up. This is what I plan to include in the memo. (I know you'll tell me to talk to a lawyer but I can't afford one and none of the free legal centers answered their phones today. And the public defender doesn't see my case until the day of.)   &gt;The evening of July 2 I confronted X about her affair while we were in the bedroom. I moved out of the bedroom into the living room. As I was passing through the doorway, walking away from X, I open-palm slapped the wall, and then sat down on the couch. The bottom edge of my right hand hit the top left corner of the light switch and broke the top left corner of the light switch. This left a superficial scar on the bottom edge of my hand. The top edge of the light switch is about two inches below my elbow. I didn't raise my hands and I didn't throw a punch."	No
275	"I received the following email from my landlord today.  &gt; Good afternoon,  Our office has not received rent for the month of August 2017. Even though your lease is expiring and not being re-newed and you have a move out date of 08/31/2017 you are still responsible for the rent. Due to your NSF check you must pay with either a cashiers check or money order. Also when you will be completing the repairs to the property including paint and replacement of flooring's and baseboards which have been destroyed. The backyard is dug up and destroyed. The property will need to be detailed cleaned and we do have the name and rank of the unauthorized tenant you have sub-leased to. The property needs to be given back in good clean condition as which you received it or we will be contacting both chain of commands and filing in court. I hope you plan to cooperate with this.  For context: I am in the military and had a returned check *one* time and the realtor now requires me to bring a cashiers check, I was in the field and have already payed my rent, before it was late.  Here are the facts  -I have not subleased to anyone. I believe the realtor dug through my things and found my husbands information and made assumptions. He is no longer in the military; and is attending school in a different city.   -The damaged floors she is talking about are floorboards that are cheap laminate faux wood flooring, and are starting to raise at the corners. I believe it is normal wear and tear and the damage is only affecting panels in a small area, it is in no way destroyed.  -I put down a $4700 dollar deposit including deposits for the pets I have.  -I was at a 45 day training exercise and could not pay my rent while I was away. 2 weeks before I left I contacted them 3 different times to fix my online account to accept payments; they did not fix it until after my rent was late, then they slapped a late fee on it, fixed my account, and served me a 3 day notice to pay rent or quit. I paid about ten minutes after my account was fixed.   -My property manager did a walk through in May and found some damages, they did not contact any vendors, as they said they would, to make repairs. Nor have I received a list of things they claim to be damaged by me.  -I moved in after the grass had died for the year, when spring rolled around I realized the landlord had just used dead grass to cover the land as mulch, the grass never grew back and is now completely dirt except for weeds. This is what she means by ""completely destroyed."" I do admit my dogs dug a couple of holes, but those can be easily covered.  -The property manager asked my permission to let the owners enter the property to survey the second bathroom because they wanted to do renovations. I locked the doors into all rooms and placed scotch tape on the walls to see if they entered other areas of the home. They went into every room.  -The property manager made a statement that the owner of the realty did a walk through with me. I told her he hadn't, she became accusatory and refused to believe me. I have never met the owner of the realty.  - My lease states that I should not do any repairs myself.  So my question is, can the landlord force me to make repairs before I move out even if they are holding my security deposit? Also, can they contact my chain of command for this? I don't see the point if they have my security deposit and if they plan to take me to court. It seems their goal in that situation would be to simply get me in trouble. I do not disagree that I have caused some damages, but it is absolutely not something that a good contractor couldn't fix in a day or two. Please help!  -"	No

I told him it doesn't work like that and that both of us had to agree.   He said he owed our boss a favor, and I was going to help pay it off. My boss, last night, told me to stay late and told me my boyfriend said I was ""fair game"". I told him I didn't consent to have sex, which of course didn't stop him.

I want to leave, or press charges but my boyfriend won't let me do either.   Can I even press charges with no physical evidence?  Do I need his permission to break up with him?   My parents gave me to him when I was 17, like to date... Kinda like an eventual marriage.  We are now 19 but not married. I don't know if this affects anything.   TL;dr: my boyfriend told my boss to rape me and won't let me break up with him. Please help.   Dallas, Texas"	No
277	"Moving out of a house and our landlords are basically taking all of our deposits to clean a dirty fridge, dirty bathrooms, a bit of trash left in the back, and literally 3 holes in the wall. Apparently those ""damages"" amount to $1250. Anything I can do to try and stop this? I dont want to go to small claims court for my portion of it but if there is something else I could do that would be amazing! Thanks in advance!"	No
278	Hello LA,  This one is a bit out there. I will try to be as clear as possible.  I, the tenant, am renting a business space from the person who inhabited the storefront before me and who signed a 5 year lease. This leaseholder (LH) had to close his business and I opened up my business in the same location. I pay rent to them, they use that money to pay the building owner (BO).  The lease is set to expire in another 2 1/2 years. Last week I received a letter from BO that they were raising the rent by 25% and moving the rent due date from the 15th to the 1st, effective September 1st.  I, the LH and the BO sat down and talked the other day. BO says they were unaware that there was a current lease. Explains that leases were handled by a former employee who is no longer working for them. LH has a copy of the lease and would be happy to not have to be liable for it. I have always made payment in full and on time.  BO wants to rip up the old lease and sign me to a new lease, directly. That would include a 25% increase in the rent. This is not financially tenable for me. I have no incentive to agree to pay more, years ahead of schedule.  I am wondering what my legal recourse is here. Would California law allow for me to enter into an agreement with the LH wherein I take over responsibility for the remainder of the lease? Do I need the BO to approve such a move? Would I be legally entitled to continue paying as I have been, provided the LH agrees to it? Can the BO force me to pay more or to be put on a lease?  I am consulting a lawyer in this field ASAP, but am looking for some info here first in order to know what to ask and what to look for.  Thank you all for you time.	No
279	I own in a really strict HOA and the renters nextdoor have it in their head that I am somehow connected to some fines they got (I am not connected in any way). They have signed me up for PornHub, put my phone number and email on Craigslist in an explicit ad, and stared down visitors to my home who later mentioned it to me (I never told visitors of the issues.)  The landlord and property management company are non-responsive. The HOA is monitoring the situation.  I have made police reports and reports to the HOA where it made sense.  Is there something else I should do? Can I take another approach, like civil court?	No
280	Just like the title says. I have a recurring payment the first of every month to have money automatically taken out to pay rent. However, for some reason it was not taken out yesterday and now the apartment wants me to pay a late fee. I dont plan on paying that fee since it was the complex's system that did not take money out. However I am worried about them threatening the lease if I dont pay the late fee. What can I do?	No
281	My (now ex)gf assaulted me in our shared apartment in nyc. I recorded it on my iPhone. Are there any laws in New York State preventing me from using it?	No
282	"Ontario, Canada  My husband and I bought a new car in March. It was a showroom demo, so it was last year's model and had 10k on it. The manufacturer rebates let us upgrade to a nicer model because it had those kilometers on it.   At the beginning of May, we brought it in and told them it was leaking from the arm on the driver's side. They tried to say oh maybe the door wasn't shut right. I insisted they look anyways and once they pulled the interior plastic off and put the hose to it, it was like a sprinkler. They ended up pulling off the windshield and reseating it in new seals. At that point I paid nothing because of the warranty.  Now here we are over two months later. We've had a bad smell in the car for about a week. Took a few days to get into the dealer's shop. Asked them to do the free full inspection we got at 3 months owning the car and try to find the smell.  Turns out the back seat floor carpet (we are very very rarely in the backseat as it's just the two of us) is soaking wet and growing mold.   It's been raining a ton here lately, and we're both anal about closing windows since water in car = bad and nobody likes a wet butt. A couple weeks back it was raining so hard people were pulling over from low visibility, and we thought we heard water in the car but assumed it was splashing in the wheel well.   When the dealer service guy called back he told me this, said I had to have left a window open, and that I'd need to get the car detailed to ditch the smell.   I explained while it's not impossible that we left a window open, it's very unlikely, and our car had an established history of fucking leaking water inside. The guy repeated what he said and told us our car could be picked up. I hung up with him and called back to speak to the manager in service.   I told the manager I was beyond frustrated because we bought new specifically to avoid things like this. If we were gonna dump this much money into a car every year instead of it being a 13 year old junker trying to stay driving might as well buy new. I explained I didn't like being told it's my fault too bad, same as last time when I was told I must have ""shut the door wrong"" and it was a leak. That I suspect it's a leak again. That I don't want to come back for ""oop third time's the charm found all the leaks"". Service Manager laughed and said he doesn't want me in again unless it's routine service.   At this point the manager is sending it to a body shop owned by a good guy who my family sends all our business too, and I called him and he'll have his guys go through the car top to bottom to make sure everything is sealed right.   I'm very concerned about damage to the car. It's not even 4 months old.   1. At what point is the car a ""lemon"" and does that kind of thing even apply here?   2. What happens if the floor boards are rusted from the wet carpet for so many weeks (and who knows how long before that? Last summer when the sales guy drove it around?)  3. What happens if I keep finding leaks for all eternity?   4. What steps should I take to resolve this if things aren't being fixed? Like dealer/owner first, then corporate, then lawyer? My insurance? The warranty people?   This is our first time owning a brand new car that won't end up being sold to a scrapper for finally dying down. Please help. I'm lost and angry and not sure where to go next while I wait for the verdict from the body shop."	No
283	At the beginning of July, I had bought a money order to pay my rent to my landlord. His office was closed for a small vacation and he was due back the next day, so I filled it out, put it in an envelope and dropped through the drop slot at his office. It landed about five feet from the door. This was on July 3rd.  July 7th - he messages me about missing a rent payment. I get up with the money order vendor and it was cashed on the evening of the third. They won't tell me where or who; I have to pay for an expedited scan of the endorsement.   July 8th - I contact local police to file a report and am told that nothing is able to be done until we learn whether or not this was a mistake on my LLs realty office or it was stolen.  July 10th - I receive a scan via email of the front and back of the money order. LLs name is scribbled out and another name is written above it. LL has no idea who that is, but i recognize the name from around town. I file a police report again and give info on who I am pretty sure this person was.  No info is included on where cashed the order; am told I can receive that info via mail appx. 2 weeks later.  July 21 - I receive the letter and am told it was cashed at a bank one town over in Ohio. I go over there and they say it was done via their ATM and they have no idea why it was approved as those are apparently approve at an office whenever someone wants to cash via ATM. They tell me there is nothing they can do more than just confirming it was cashed at that ATM.  July 22nd - Went to local PD and gave info on where it was cashed.   That's all that I've done so far. My landlord is not wanting to file a report themselves unless it's required to get the rent payment back. He is obviously wanting the missed payment and I simply can't just give him another payment. What are my options in terms of recouping my money?   At this point, do I just wait until local police get back to me? Is the bank liable for cashing the forged money order? Since it's been cashed, I assume moneygram is going to say no on a refund. Do I just wait at this point?  Thank you all for taking the time to read this.	No
284	"I recently applied for a position in a VT branch of a major insurance provider. During my application, I had to agreement to private arbitration for any legal disputes before, during, and after any potential employment.   In addition to signing away any right to pursue a class action, disputes covered by the arbitration clause include things like sexual harassment, unpaid wages, discrimination against protected classes, overtime, and other issues clearly covered by both Vermont and federal labor law.  This is unlikely to ever be relevant for me, but I just want to understand, because this seems a little nuts to me. Basically, if this employer were to, say, refuse to pay me for wages I had earned, and I couldn't work it out through negotiation on my own, we would then go to a ""neutral"" third party selected by the employer. This neutral third party, while technically supposed to make a judgement based on actual law, could really do anything. They could just say, ""lol, you ain't gettin' paid"", and then I would get no money. I would not be able to appeal this decision... Is this correct?? I guess I don't understand the point of labor laws existing at all if employers can just have people, for practical purposes, sign away their rights. This can't be how it works, right?"	No
285	Long story short, my complex uses a third party billing service for their water/sewer/trash bill.  I use about $6-8 of water a month, garbage is $16, but the sewer is over $20 (plus a $3 service fee!).  I was gone for one month, literally had 0 gallons of water used, but my bill was still over $40.    The sewage charge is supposed to be only around $8 according to the city's sewage rates.  They're definitely profiting on top of my bill... is this even legal?    Seems incredible this is even legal.	No
286	Hi, so my friend had to leave her apartment before the end of her lease. So her and her roommate subletted the place out for the remainder of the lease with permission from the landlord. She found a couple (for one room) and another person (the other room) and everything seemed set. Because she and her roommate were desperate, they agreed to pay the couples’ last month rent in advance, and they would pay my friend back at the end of the lease. As a result, the couple just paid the security deposit to the landlord and moved in.    Recently, the single subletter left early so my friend had to find another person to fill for 2 months. However, the couple did not like the new person and decided to leave at the end of this month. They told the landlord that they would use their security deposit as their last month, and the couple has already moved out all their things. My friend has been trying to reach out to the couple to get the last month from them, but no luck. They haven’t paid for July’s utilities and internet fee either.    So my friend contacted the landlord to see if she can see their contract when they subletted the room to see if there are any legal grounds to do something. However, the landlord does not have a paper contract with the subletters and my friend and roommate simply had a verbal contract with them. Furthermore, one of the couples’ close relative is a lawyer, and basically threatened the landlord to sue if he didn’t let the couple use their security deposit to pay for the last month’s rent. The lawyer/relative threatened to sue since subletting is illegal, and apparently the new roommate has mental issues (he doesn’t seem to. As least, the several times I’ve met him). Because it was just a matter of one month, the landlord backed down and obliged and let the couple use the security deposit as last month’s pay.    My friend is desperately trying to get in touch with the couple but they haven’t been responding. They still owe her the last month rent, internet fees, and utilities. She was going to pursue legal action, but is now scared because the couples’ relative is a lawyer. Is there anything she can do? One person has suggested reporting this to a credit authority so that they receive a permanent note on their credit mark. How viable is this? Should we fight them? Do we even have grounds to fight them?   Tl;dr: friend and roommate were desperate to sublet. Paid for couples’ last month in advance and now they are not responding to their requests.	No
287	This whole thing is going on in PA. I'm 33, my GF is 25, her Ex is 28 (i think) and their son is 4  So here's a rundown of events  I'll refer to my girlfriends son as G from here on out  My girlfriend is very into giving her son education opportunities. Last year, she was able to get G into a very organized and solid Pre-K program (at no cost due to her low income)  Her ex fought her on it. They have split custody, almost even amount of time is allocated between parents (a little heavier on the moms time).   The dads main beef was he'll lose time with his son, not to mention he had no transportation to drop him off or pick him up. Her ex lives with his parents, and they are great grandparents, but I think they are tired of their sons bs. He doesn't really have his life together.   We understood, so we setup a special thing with the school where G could go part time (1/2 days, 3 days per week). Since G was only 3 at the time, he would be eligible for the same Pre-K program the following year (coming up) and go to kindergarten the year after that.  It was kind of a pain agreeing to her ex'es demands to go part time. Her ex has no ride, so my GF would drive across town before work to take him to school even though it wasn't her day with him. I was in a position to pick him up around lunch time without issue.  Her ex verbally agreed that if their son liked going to school, he could go full time the following year.  Now the time has come to officially enroll him for the upcoming school year, and her ex is absolutely refusing to allow G to go full time. He likes the agreement where G only goes part time and we drive G back and forth.  A couple weeks ago he said he would agree to whatever G said he wanted. And G said he wanted to go to school more, and his dad agreed, and even verified all this via text to my GF. But her ex also had G for 3 days following this conversation, and once we picked G up, her ex said that G had changed his mind and didn't want to go to school more. When we press G why not, he says he doesn't want to make his dad angry (I don't suspect any physical abuse). I told G that dad wouldn't be mad att him, he would be mad at mom. But G is clearly a bit upset about the recent mom &amp; dad fighting on the phone, and being pressured to make a decision.  My GF is fed up with it and told the school to enroll G full time anyways, the ex called the school and told them not to. And now the school says we have until the end of this week to make a decision or G will lose his spot entirely. We view her ex's attitude as extremely selfish at this point, and find the mental conditioning he's trying to put on G very disturbing.  Is there anything legally we can do to get things moving that benefit G the most? Something that might be a small wake up call to the dad?	No
288	In my lease you're encouraged to have staff do a walkthrough when you're moving out of the apartment. I called to make that appointment and they basically said they don't usually do that. They didn't say they wouldn't, just that it wasn't something they thought was necessary, I guess.    Should I insist and have them come anyway? If I do, what do I have them do/sign so it's not pointless? I'll be taking pictures either way.	No
289	"Hi legal advice, let me first say thanks for any help you can give me! Secondly, I want to be clear I have done nothing yet, and I'm not sure I should, hence why I came to you.   My ex girlfriend and I have two kids together. For the most part we get along, but we have some serious flare ups from time to time. We didn't go to court because she has a past with DYFS (NJs more extreme cps) and we feared that we might both lose the kids if it came to a court fight. During our most recent argument I was at her apartment arguing with her over texts while she was at work and she had left her iPad there. While I couldn't access it, the main screen still shows texts messages as they come in to her.   So I'm sitting there fighting with her and I see her 2 sisters start texting her advice to take my ass to court, nail me to a cross, take all my money in child support and, best of all, ""we will have him with a gun in his mouth"". I of course took pictures and all. The sister advocating most harshly to break me and force me to suicide is actually a registered therapist.   I have a two fold question: first, she's registered in NJ, can she actually do anything besides provide advice to her sister?   Secondly, with the texts can I do anything to stop her? Last I heard she worked with at risk youth, so would her job do anything if I showed the texts to them?   Let me be clear, I DONT want to do anything, up until this situation I got along with my exes family. Even if I can do something, would it be worthwhile, as I'm sure there would be a serious shit storm? But are my hands tied?   TL;DR: my exes sister is a therapist and wants to make me commit suicide. What do?"	No
290	What is the procedure to name change legally in MS. I have a minor who wants this before his permit next year. What paperwork do you need to present to license bureau for the name change on permit. How do you get gender marker changed for a child born in MS?	No
291	California.   I am a landlord in a rent controlled area, making it very hard to evict tenants.   One of my tenants has been doing repeated minor lease violations - changing internal locks, painting common areas and inside his unit, leaving items in the common areas. So far he has fixed these when I find out about them (without forcing me to give a 3 day cure or quit).   It is abundantly clear that he knows they were against the lease but also knows I cannot evict him for them and must give him a chance to fix them. He does not seem to have any intention of stopping.  Is there anything I can do about this?	No
292	"First off, I'm a 14 year old male, and I have a sister who is 12 years old, my sister does not feel the same way as I do and therefore would most likely stay on the same schedule no matter the outcome. About four years ago my Stepmom and Dad took my mom to court to (from what I've gathered) try to gain full custody of us. It ended with the decision being equal time where my sister and I switch every other week. The weeks where I am with my Stepmom and Dad have started to feel like a living hell. For various reasons such as my bisexuality and their refusal to acknowledge it, (other than the usual ""You're going to hell"" of conservative Christians) which has been causing a huge decline in my mental health. I have brought this up once before when in a particularly bad argument with my Stepmom and Dad where they said that they would go to court to get me back and that ""The court can't keep you from us."". What would be the best course of action?"	No
293	"My boyfriend and I have been living in a co-op apartment for two and a half months now. The landlord lives in Europe, is elderly, and is only reachable by email.   Before we moved in, the place was gross. It needed a deep cleaning, which was never done, but we agreed to take it as is in exchange for almost an entire month rent free. We spent 2 weeks straight scrubbing the place of smoke stains, spills, and mildew from the last tenant. We also made the mistake of not checking every appliance or nook and cranny before signing the lease.   All of the appliances are probably near 20 years old, most work fine. The fridge has been making noises every few hours and we're afraid something is loose or will break with it at some point, so we told the landlord. She told us to have it checked out by a repairman but will not pay for anything because when she was last there it ""worked fine"".   The bathtub has been having an issue of pouring from the spout when the shower head is on and dripping when the water is supposed to be off. She told us this is a ""minor repair"" and we need to pay for it.   Other issues regarding a broken door lock and semi-broken dishwasher were brought up and she agreed to cover expenses.   The wording in my lease regarding repairs and responsibility isn't very clear so I don't know what to do. Its fine by me to leave the stuff as is and ignore it until there's a serious issue that she'll have no choice but to address. I don't want to be blamed for things breaking even though the appliances are older and plumbing has had this issue since moving in. I don't know how to approach this situation to avoid having a bad relationship with the landlord, but I don't want to pay for these repairs which should've been done before we moved in."	No
294	Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	No
295	"A few days ago, my dad received a letter from some legal advice company (not an official court summons) that said that they could help with his case of domestic violence and a restraining order against him. We looked up the case number included in the letter, and it indeed did have his name on it, and that he's being sued for domestic violence by some woman that he claims he's never met. I do believe my father 100%, since he's never raised a hand against my mother or my siblings and I for as long as I can remember. (Though I am open to the possibility that he may be lying, but I really doubt that.)  We're not sure if this is a real fraudulent case against my father, or if this is a mistake that this legal advice company made. What we do know is that there's a court hearing a few weeks from now and that this was filed in the city that we live in. As of now, we don't have any official documents from the court letting him know that he's being sued. My hope is that this is all a huge misunderstanding.   Main thing that worries us is that my dad has just started the naturalization process to become a US citizen, and that this ""lawsuit"" could have a negative impact on that.   Regardless, we are going down to the courthouse later this week to make sure."	No
296	Have a rental property in Queens, NY, with a husband and wife on the lease and allowance for 1 dog. Tenants have been a nightmare (domestic disputes, cops called multiple times, late with rent, etc), and now are going through a divorce, and each is claiming that the other is responsible for rent and refusing to pay (lease lists them as jointly and severally liable). In addition last time I was on site for maintenance I saw they had 2 dogs there instead of the 1 allowed by the lease (but can't prove it otherwise, no photo).  Plan on starting eviction process and utilizing an attorney since I'm pretty sure this will go to trial, but wanted to see what typical costs would be for a fairly straight forward case for an attorney from start to finish (they draft letters, handle serving papers, filing with court, and going to court date etc.). Would it typically be a flat fee or an hourly rate?  Thanks!	No
297	I want to create a website of every white supremacists (supporters, politicians, businessmen, lawyers, etc.), so that people are aware of who not to support, etc.   Would this be legal? Could I be sued for such a website?	No
298	I am really out of options here.  We are not divorced so there is no type of child care plan. In order for me to see my child I had to live with either her mom or her dad.   Well one evening her dad freaks out on me and it no longer became safe for me to stay there. So I moved out. I haven't seen my son since. This goes back 8 weeks. His birthday is monday. Between my house payment and bills I virtually have no money left over to afford an attorney. I have shit credit and no way to make more. I have 450$ to my name outside of that and anyone that could help has. I called legal aid in my state and they denied my case for unspecified reasons. I am at a loss.  As a result my son is being kept from me. His grandparents will not let him talk to me because for fear that they would be denied the right to see him. This is the type of person she is. I need your help.	No
299	So to me it seems pretty cut and dry, but the company I used to rent from decided to charge me the remaining rent on the lease even though I let them know in person and in writing over a month before our planned move out date. The reason I needed to break my lease was that I had military orders and I was separating from the Armed Forces. Charging me past the move out date violated the SCRA and also Florida statues.  I know I'm in the right AND I have supporting documents (Orders, letter of intent to vacate, etc), but they're making me jump through hoops to not have my credit affected.   My main question is, after working for weeks to reason with them, can I be justified writing a formal demand to compensate me for having to deal with this for weeks? In addition to them striking my debt of course. Thanks!	No
300	First off, I live in Ontario.  So - long story short, my cat peed on her bed, and there is a stain and a bit of odor. She is not taking this too well (I don't blame her). That being said, she first expected that I owe her an entirely brand new mattress. I know for sure that that is not legally okay, because the value of the mattress would be lower than the original price from the wear and tear after what she thinks has been a year (I am getting her mom to find the receipt which will have the price and date).	No
301	Throw away because people know who I am and my story.  Moved into a new place which seemed fine. At night my neighbor started doing laundry at 2am and doesnt stop till I dont know when. The walls are thin so I can hear the washer and dryer. I hope it is laundry and not something else. Who needs to do use it for that long. The person has been doing this every single day for that long! I dont care what it is - I just want to be able to sleep!  After a week I complained to my leasing office and no response. The front desk said you cant stop someone from doing their laundry. If the front desk wont knock on the door then I am not going to risk my life knocking on that door. That person might shoot me and say I was trying to break in.   This is sleep deprivation torture - I cannot sleep. I cannot sleep with the washer whirling and the dryer buzzing. This is a noise violation. The apartment in the lease says no noise after 10pm to like 7am. This is a breach of contract or something right? Do I call the cops? What are my options?	No
302	Hello, broke up with my ex girlfriend in January after finding out she was addicted to opioids and cocaine. We have a daughter together who is now four years old. Found out of her addiction when money started going missing and finding valuables missing. After a confrontation she admitted to me and her problem. I found my own place to live and have had my daughter under my care since. She attended a short rehab in January. She went on to show no interest in being a mother and my daughter showed no interest in seeing or asking for her. She entered another rehab in April which last 60 days. She has since been out and is showing all signs that she is back on her drug. Money missing around her parents house (where she stays) she is up all night. Lies about her money and claims to never get paid. She demands to see our daughter and threatens to call the police and have her escorted to have her picked up. She told me over the phone she wanted to kill herself. I guess what I want to inquire about is what are my rights as a father as I am going to pursue legal action. She told me if I go that route she will keep our daughter from me the whole time until a judge decides. That is the only way I believe this will get settled but I am in deep fear for my daughters safety and well being while going through this process. Is there any way to ensure she is under my custody while this process unfolds given the circumstances of the past 8 months?	No
303	Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	No
304	Hi All, first of all I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but here goes.   My parents live in Virginia, they have VERY little in assets. (Rent home, few posessions, old car, small life insurance policy, small pension my dad receives, dad is on disability, both are receiving social security).   My mom recently broke her hip and had to go to the hospital. the recovery will take months and my mom will not be able to take care of my dad. (thankfully we have my sister stepping in to take care of him for now, she lives close by). We would like to see if we could get my dad to qualify for medicaid so that he can receive long term care that is paid for. No one in my family can afford paying for the type of care that he needs.   I understand that the limitations for medicaid are very strict. A family friend has told us that we need to transfer all assets to my sister or I (I would prefer it be my sister) in some sort of trust so that the government does not recognize any assets under their name and they can qualify for medicaid.   Basically I think we need to start talking to a lawyer to facilitate this. But I need a list of items to go into the meeting with the lawyer with to make sure that we can get this accomplished. Any advice or assistance in navigating this would be helpful. Thanks!	No
305	I'm not sure if I have flat out proof of her premeditated planning to fabricate an altercation in order to get a restraining order, but it seems that way.   This is a no fault state, I understand that, so I'm not asking for sympathy about this sad situation, just advice.   I'm a Navy veteran, we were married for nearly all of my Navy career. I got out in 2009 because I couldn't stand her infidelity when I was out to sea. (pathetic, I know.) We now have a 9 year old son with his own story this has effected.  We purchased a boat inside a boathouse in the Seattle area a few years ago. I was in school on the GI Bill at the time but have never made as much money as my wife since the Navy.   We were renters before the boat and boathouse. Here's the kicker. I've always had the VA loan program available, but her grandmother died and left her plenty of money.   It was then that she quit her job, we bought this boat home with plans to renovate it, sell it down the road. It wasn't much, but COULD BE CONSIDERED PART IF HER INHERITANCE, even though we're both equal legal owners.    Since then, I've spent the last year working tirelessly to build equity in the investment we went on. She got another job and likes it. The place is worth much more now than when we bought it, because of my labor.   During this time, I've worked on the home or been a stay at home parent, doing side jobs here and there to support our dream.  She got a boyfriend though. She has insisted on a separation to retroactively excuse her cheating, but that's emotional crap.   Her and my son now spend three nights a week at this boyfriend's house and I'm here on the boat paying moorage.   Questions:  1) How will custody look if we don't already have a parenting plan in place?   2) Can she just uproot me from our family home at a whim because it was purchased in part with an inheritance from her side of the family?  3) Is it unethical to find her new secret address where my son has gone for months, or in my best interest?   Realistically, there is no way she can maintain a boat and boathouse alone. It's not in her wheelhouse. Clearly she plans to move him here to help.   Am I about to be homeless?	No
306	I live in Washington state.  About 4 years ago, the ex and I decided to replace the house on the property as it was in serious disrepair (had been a rental before we owned it and the ex refused to do work on it and I didn't know how, so it was in bad shape at this point).  I suggested we consider a manufactured home, we looked at what was for sale and bought one that the state inspector said was a nice one when he gave it the once-over for the occupancy certificate.  I bought 1800 square feet of well-insulated, well-built housing for $25K, and I believe I got a very good deal.   Two years later the marriage ended.  In trying to figure out how to refinance the mortgage (which has subsequently been paid off) I discovered reverse mortgages.  This looked like a good way to obtain the money to continue my education, pay bills, etc. after the money from the divorce ran out.  AFAIK, in WA all reverse mortgage lenders/underwriters are FHA approved, meaning they are required to follow the rules that the FHA (and by extension, its parent agency HUD) makes.  Nothing gave me any reason to believe I would be refused a reverse mortgage.    However, one of those rules (24 CFR 203.43f(d)iii) is that if, in the past, if someone ever moved their manufactured home from its first placement, no mortgage will be insured.  When I said to the lender in passing that I'd gotten a good deal on the house and moved it to my property, she said 'HUD/FHA has a rule that if you moved your house you can't get a mortgage.  Since I have prior professional experience with manufactured home movement, I know from that and research into this that the regulation has no basis in law, and in fact violates federal law in that it imposes a penalty without prior notice and is retroactive without prior authorization from Congress.    When I was refused, however, there was no contract signed as yet.  The process is that you go to the lender, find out how much you can get (theoretically), get counseled (and I've owned several pieces of real estate so a lot of this is I already know) and then go back to the lender to start the process of getting the house appraised, etc., etc.  Appraisers are required to report on whether or not a house has been moved, so the visual evidence, or an appraiser searching the tax roll, will give that fact away, so before I've 'signed anything', I've been refused a mortgage.  Note that in Yesler Terrace Community v. Cisneros, the Ninth Circuit said that the third-party implementation of HUD/FHA rules, even if it did not immediately apply to the plaintiffs, did not deny them standing.  How can I prove injury-in-fact when I haven't even got the chance to sign anything?  Would a formal letter of refusal from the lender citing the federal regulation do it?	No
307	I will spare you the lengthy story of how my friend came about owing me $2,000. (Please spare me your opinions of how I shouldn't share my Paypal or the quality of the friendship)   He agrees that he unintentionally took this money from a shared Paypal account and I have records to prove the money is mine and went into his personal bank account. He has agreed to pay me back the money, however he is doing it very slowly. In the last 6 months I have received $400 in payments from him. His reasoning for infrequent payments is that his dad is battling cancer and all his income is going towards hospital bills.  I have kindly asked him to increase the frequency to $200/month and since then I have not received any money in over 1 month.   Should I take legal matters to the small claims court? If so, how do I approach that without being aggressive (How do I tell   him this before filing)?  I have all of our conversations and agreements documented through text messages so having it ruled in my favor will be easy.  I am in Sacramento, CA  Thank you in advance!	No
308	Hi guys, I'll try to keep this brief.  A year ago, I moved into an apartment and filled out an extensive inspection sheet. This was all done online and through my phone since they have a convenient online system. I noted some issues with the property, mainly scratches in the floor, but also a fist sized chunk out of the corner of the granite countertop.  I included a picture and note about the countertop in my inspection, but didn't request that it be repaired because it was still a very functional countertop.  Fast forward to this week when I moved out. After I move out, they give me a call about the countertop and say they want to charge me for replacing it. They didn't say anything about my deposit, but are claiming that I would have to pay the entire replacement cost of the countertop.  I talked to the office guy and went into the online system again to look at my inspection again, but a bunch of the questions I had filled out were no longer there. Instead of the massive form I had filled out, there were maybe only 20 inspection items and my notes from those items. The question about the countertop where I entered the damage note and picture is no longer there.  When I moved I transferred apartments so I live in the same building but just across the hall. I've double checked my NEW inspection form and sure enough, that has at least 50 questions like I remember the old one having. But the online system only shows 20 of the answers.  Basically my plan today is to go in to the office and show them with my new inspection and the incomplete old one that they're missing some data. What are my other options? I am a college student and I don't have money to replace a granite countertop.	No
309	I hope this is an OK place to ask this.  I got a ticket in Nov of last year in CA and did a trial by dec. and lost and I just completed online traffic school about 2 days ago.  My insurance is due and is higher due to the ticket. Insurance told me I need to get proof of the ticket is gone from the DMV then send it to them and they will credit me the overage. So whats the typical amount of time for the DMV?	No
310	Hello all. My girlfriend and I recently rented an apartment in Atlanta, GA and have been living in it for the last 8 days. The apartment has gone from great to terrible in that short amount of time. I will list out the issues we have faced since our move in and will provide more detail if needed.  1. Potential gas leak. I informed the customer service manager of a potential gas leak in my apartment as both my gf and I smelt a strange gas-ish odor when using both the gas stove and gas-heated water. I reported this issue to them around noon of yesterday, but no maintenance personnel were sent out to investigate despite this being a potential serious issue. Concerned for our safety, I contacted the local fire department who sent out a fire unit to investigate my apartment. They found no gas leaks, but did uncover some other serious issues that I will list below.  2. Indoor AC/Water heating unit. When the fire department came to investigate the potential leak, they removed a locked maintenance door inside of my apartment. The maintenance room was locked and only the maintenance staff has the ability to look inside. After removing the door, the fire lieutenant informed me that the unit was incredibly old and that it has several code violations such as exposed wiring, no cover over the wiring, and cut wires which are just hanging out. Not to mention, the unit looks to be at least 20 years old and has never been maintained- it is truly disgusting with trash, dirt, and bugs everywhere and leads me into some of my next concerns. When the fire unit was here, they cut power to the unit and also turned the gas off to the stove and hot water as it seems they deemed it a large enough safety risk.   3. BUGS. Since we have moved in, we have seen 5 nymph cockroaches in our apartment. I say nymph because these roaches are small as if there is a nest in the area. We also photographed one of them and have identified it as a nymph German cockroach, which, from what I've read on the internet regarding infestations, basically means this complex is overrun and there is very little that can be done to eliminate the issue. I have no doubt that many of the bugs come from the maintenance room as it is truly dirty in every sense of the word. There are also cracks in the wall behind the stove which could also be an easy entrance for bugs.  4. Black mold. When the fire department came, they moved the stove to test for gas leaks. No gas leaks were found, but there appears to be black mold on the wall.   5. Bathroom faucet leak. The bathroom faucet is leaking from the wall where the faucet is attached. I have no doubt there is water damage behind the tub.  On move-in day, none of these issues were identified. We tested the stove and water and did not smell gas, we did not look in the maintenance door as it was locked and seems to always be locked unless a maintenance personnel comes to open it, we saw no bugs as they likely had no reason to come out as the apartment was vacant with no major food sources, we could not look behind the stove because it was nearly impossible to move (3 firemen were needed to move it from the wall), and the bathroom faucet did not seem to leak (at least not noticeably).  At this point, I believe the apartment is beyond repair. Management is very unresponsive here. There is always a line at the customer service office with people complaining (yesterday it seemed everyone was going on about their AC not working), so it's no doubt maintenance staff are overwhelmed, but that doesn't excuse the lack of concern for issues as serious as these.  Maintenance staff did finally get around to our unit this morning around 9 AM and told me that they will try to have the entire indoor AC/water heating unit replace, but that it will take at least a week for it to arrive. In the mean time, he flipped the power and gas back on to the stove and water heater and told me that it was safe to use- this completely contradicts the fire department as they obviously deemed it serious enough to turn off. He also told me that he will try to address the mold, however, I don't understand how he could address it without tearing the entire kitchen apart.  My girlfriend and I think it's best that we terminate the lease early and get out before anything else major happens. We have submitted a written termination request, but the management is trying to charge us outrageous fees for early termination. In the lease it seems there is no grace period if we are unsatisfied with the unit, and it seems there is a 60 day notice needed for the early termination which we will have to pay rent for the entire 60 days and then also pay another months rent as liquidated damages for early termination. The customer service manager yesterday quoted me around $2600 in total for the early termination which is absolutely insane.  I understand that we signed the lease and I did read through it before hand of course, but we had no idea that the apartment was in this condition and I don't believe some of our issues could have been identified without living in the complex. At this point, we are willing to write it off as a learning experience, but what I need to know is if there are any additional steps we can take to possibly get some of the early termination cost waved as many of these issues seem serious?   Is there anyone I can contact to help with a situation like this? I've contacted the fire department and am going to go get a copy of the report today and I've also contacted the local inspectors and am trying to get someone out here to confirm the code violations found by the fire department.  At this point my girlfriend and I are miserable and only want this nightmare to be over. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.	No
311	Until recently I worked for a large bank and knew before leaving that I had used up more holidays than I was entitled for the amount of the year so far. I was told it would be deducted from my wages but it wasn't. They've now written to me asking me to repay the £400 I owe. Am I legally obliged to repay it?	No
312	"My girlfriend and I signed a lease with a landlord in August 2016 for a 1br apartment in Los Angeles. The lease states our contract begins November 2016, then after November 2016* it becomes a month-to-month lease. We assumed this to mean our lease was month-to-month from the start. When we left 6 months into our stay (giving proper notice as per the contract's specifications), the Landlord said there was a ""typo,"" thus we were breaking our lease. He is withholding our deposit ($1300) instead of ""pursuing the additional 6 months of rent money owed.""   This contract is the only legal document we signed with this landlord. Regardless of whether or not he meant for the lease to be 12 months or month-to-month, paper is paper. My question: Can we take him to small claims court to get our deposit back?   There is no damage to the apartment. We have before and after pictures to back it up. Our only concern is that he also misspelled my girlfriend's name on the contract we signed, but it is still her signature on the paper.  Bonus: Not sure if this is relevant to anything, but here are some additional problems with this landlord.  Rats - 2-ish months in, we had rats chew a baseball-sized hole from the apartment's foundation through the floor inside of a cabinet. Landlord simply came over and sealed the hole with sealant from Home Depot. He then went around our apartment and sealed off other holes that he said might be a problem. I found one of the rats in our kitchen prior to the sealing and chased it into the heating unit, which had a huge chunk of wood missing on the bottom (clearly manually removed by someone previously). I sealed the hole with a wooden shim that I built, but the rat could be heard scurrying around inside the heating unit for days. When we showed the Landlord video of the noises, he didn't do anything about it. We assumed the rat got outside via the heating unit somehow. My shim is probably still there. He paid another tenant to come clean our apartment for us with cut-up t-shirts and lysol.  Disgusting Tub - when we viewed the unit, the unit looked so dirty, particularly the tub in the bathroom looked like a murder scene (we never used it, there was a separate shower thank god). I asked if the landlord planned to have the unit cleaned before we moved in, but he said he already cleaned it. We were desperate for an apartment because our new jobs started on Monday and it was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Otherwise, we would've bailed on this place immediately."	No
313	I'm a full-time nursing student, who works 32 hours a week in a local ER as an EMT (on my feet all day).  My apartment complex was bought by a new company a couple of years ago and they've been renovating the property. They placed a gigantic dumpster in the parking lot beside where I park and in front of my apartment.   I cut my foot on some of the trash that's always lying around outside of the dumpster and was unable to pick up the overtime I needed to pay my rent for July.   I have only been able to work just enough to keep my job, but it's too painful to stay on my foot for a long time right now. It's still healing, and I'll have my rent paid by the time I appear in court. I just have to come up with legal fees now to pay my apartment complex now that they are taking me to court.  I put in a request online to maintenance to clean it up because I cut my foot. 2 days later, my online account got deleted and I was served with my eviction papers.   I'm due to appear in small claims court on Monday to defend myself from eviction. I'm just trying to figure out how I should proceed.   I have screenshots and documentation about that dumpster being out there and the trash. You can even see it on Google Maps on satellite view. I'm not sure if it can help me or not though.	No
314	"My SIL has been in and out of homeless shelters with her 5 children, including my 2 nieces for about 2 years. She has asked us to keep my nieces for a minimum of a year until she ""gets her life together"". She currently lives in NV and I live in CA. She is willing to sign them over to us. I'd really like to put them on my insurance and enroll them in school. What do I need to do? I'm at a complete loss."	No
315	Hey everyone, hoping the title wasn't misleading or something. Im new to reddit btw! :0 Anyways, by the way my knowledge legally speaking is very amateur so please see where I'm coming from here! my wording might not be the best. Emma give this a shot and keep it very brief I am aware of the premise of emancipation in America, when someone comes of age to basically legally sever themselves from their parents or guardians. I was wondering if there is anything like this in Korea? My girlfriend is Korean and is wondering, for her own personal reasons. Ive done what research I can, but I end up stumbling into complexly worded and misguiding articles, blogs etc. Someone help me out here, i would love and appreciate any and all advice. Thank you !!  PS.Am I even posting this in the right sub? If you guys know of anywhere else I could post this question let me know!	No
316	I am a homeowner. The house next door is vacant due to the owner being in a nursing home. Her son, whom I have never met and cannot get hold of, is supposedly a real prick according to my other neighbors. They tell me he will likely never sell or rent it out as it was his childhood home. Seems stupid to me to leave it empty, but whatever.  Long story short, the yard next door has become overgrown with blackberry bushes and other brambles and scrub. It's infested with vermin (had rats in my my attic over the winter, and have seen them scurrying over the fence from his yard), and the brambles are destroying the posts of the 7 foot fence between our yards. The fence is on my property.  My one neighbor who has his contact info was reluctant to give it to me, but he did reach out on my behalf a few months back to no avail. At this point, I do not want to deal with or talk to the owner's son. I will happily eat the time and cost of trimming/fence repair just to resolve the issue.  I want to know: Am I within my legal rights to go into this yard with a brush cutter ($75 to rent for 4 hours ought to do it) and take care of it?	No
317	Hi all, thank you in advance for your help.   Long story short. A woman and I are about to determine custody of a 1.5 year old in Vermont. It is a complicated situation, but the bottom line is that I would like Zero custody or visitation rights. I would like her to have sole custody. I think this is sincerely best for the child and the adults in this situation. I understand that I will owe child support and that is perfectly ok.   Initially she was on-board with the idea of me giving up parental rights, but she has change her tune lately and wants me to have some form of joint custody and seeing the child on the weekends. Can a judge force me to have custody?  Can a judge force me to have a relationship with this child?  I sincerely appreciate your help. I was waiting on a call back from a lawyer, but they must have gotten tied up. :(	No
318	"Location: I do not want to get too specific because it will identify me. If there are major laws that apply to this that are state specific please let me know.       Background: I am a software engineering intern at a major ""non-tech"" company. I was told at orientation that interns were not allowed to work overtime- but that if we went over a bit we would be compensated for it and it wasn't too big of a deal. I have been working here for several weeks now and every pay cycle I have received a bit of overtime- nothing major. Maybe an hour or 2.       This pay cycle I was supposed to receive 2.5 hours of over time- the reason being that I was unable to leave work at an earlier time so I went over 40 hours. Instead of sitting and doing nothing until I can leave I continued to work. I found out that the online time sheet i fill out was manually adjusted to remove ALL overtime I have worked this pay cycle. I was told this is because ""interns are not allowed to work over time"" but nothing I signed through employment seems to indicate that. I did a quick run through all the documents I signed ctrl + f for terms like ""intern"", ""overtime"" and nothing came up.      I am absolutely furious that I ended up wasting time at work that I will not be compensated for. What are my rights? Since I am an intern I don't think I can afford a lawyer (and a company this big surely has some pretty decent lawyers I'd assume). I just don't know where to go from here on out.      For what its worth- this company has had controversy over overtime pay in the past which I found through some googling. I don't want to allow myself to be treated unfairly just because I am an intern. Any advice?     In case it isn't clear: I am an hourly intern unlike most of the full time employees who are salaried."	No
319	If the permit inspector sees an unrelated issue in my home that requires a permit (e.g., a porch or a sky light) can they initiate a new inspection process for that? What type of lawyer would I consult about this? Thank you!	No
320	... and I live in Naperville, IL (Will County); and live almost half a mile from the nearest man-made lake. My house was newly built 6 years ago. It first flooded around 18 months after we moved in causing around $3000 of damage. This one wasn't too bad since the water had only seeped into the unfinished parts of our basement and we did not need to replace any of the carpet or the padding. Several other houses in our neighborhood had also flooded at the time and many people were experiencing similar damages (not too extensive, no need to replace their entire carpeting or anything). This didn't really cause too much worry to us so we didn't take any additional action other than draining out the water.  2 years later, our basement was completely flooded with nearly 5 inches of water everywhere. All the carpet was soaked, some of our valuables ruined; over $10,000 in damages. At this point, we hired plumber to re-irrigate our house to ensure that all water that comes near our house would be drained into a set of pipes and pumped into the sewage system. We also had the plumber add two more sump pumps in our basement so that the total pumping capacity is enough for a house more than triple the size of ours. We replaced all of the carpet with tile so that if it ever flooded again, we would not need to replace the floor. Our home insurance company also told us we were too much of a liability and attempted to sever future ties, unless we increased our deductible to $2,500. Though it might not have been the best decision, we went through with it. However, our minds were slightly rested since we re-irrigated and added in the new sump pumps.  They say that the 3rd time is the charm. My house flooded AGAIN. After we installed 3 sump pumps, after we re-irrigated. It somehow managed to flood again. The only explanation I could think of is that my house lies on top of a waterbed. So any time it rains too much, the water level rises under the ground and starts seeping into my house too quickly. When we built this house, on this specific lot, shouldn't it have come with a warning label of some sort? Shouldn't the builders have tested to see if there's too much water in the area to build a house. Or shouldn't the lot have at least been devalued because of this?  I'm just not sure what exactly to do, if our house continues to flood every two years, we can't continue to pay for the damages each time. We have home insurance, but even after last time they threatened to leave us. New insurance companies won't come near us either due to our high risk and liability. Not entirely sure if this was the right subreddit to post on, but I just need a little advice.	No
321	Seven year old credit card coming back to haunt me!  Ok, I've never posted here before and doing this on my phone, so bear with me please.  I'm in Ohio, today my brother in Oklahoma called me and said someone had called him about needing to send me some documents.  I called the number they gave him, and it's in regard to this credit card, last activity was 2010.  They say they are attempting to serve me with papers to take me court for 2,705.49 plus 1,500 in attorney fees, or I could set up pymt plan and pay them 1,664.39.  My question is, how do I keep them from calling family members?  (He said it was an outside company)  He also said statute of limitations was 12 years in 2010.  The reason this card defaulted is initially I lost my job, then became ill and am now on disability.  Any advice would be appreciated.	No
322	Please no hotline numbers or any bullshit like that.  I want to make a will that will ensure that when I die that there is a DNR, my organs can be used for whatever purpose, that there is no funeral/wake/religious ceremony, that my body is donated to science, and that my body is cremated afterwards and flushed down a toilet for all I care.  https://www.slideshare.net/tomwinfrey/sample-last-will-and-testament    Is that link that has a sample a good way to start it out?  I'm 30, not married, never married, no children, etc.  Should I start it out like that?  I think the Personal Representative is an Executor, right?  Being brutally honest when I say I don't have a dollar to my name, so I can't get an attorney.  I also don't have any friends or anything similar.  Can I leave it to my mother to being the executor, even though she will be a witness to the will (hopefully...)?  The payment of debts is tricky for me because I am heavily indebted with credit card debt, school debt, and a Personal Guarantee for a failed business lease contract.   So its around 150k.  Unfortunately my mom is on the lease contract for the failed business, so she will be stuck with that (yeah, I know its shitty of me, but I give up).  Can someone chime in on this here?  The only thing under my name is a car.  Should I try to get that into my dad's name?  He is disabled, so I'm not sure if that is possible.  They would REALLY need to sell the car in order to make ends meet.  Is there anything else that I am missing?	No
323	Hi  In Melbourne, Australia. I signed a letter of acceptance to sell my house privately to a company that buys houses for clients, the offer letter but was bound by conditions (I had to pay for contracts and get the house inspection done).   I decided not to go through with the sale after finding out the buyers were a very dodgy company (owner has been sued for false information to both sellers and buyers).  Today I got a letter saying they will be seeking legal advice if I don't continue with the sale.  No contracts made by a solicitor / lawyer have been signed, only a offer letter signed that was made by the owner of the company.  Am I screwed and have I lost everything? I pretty much live with a bank account that's always $0, so hiring a real lawyer is not an option :'(	No
324	I live in CA, USA, and have a 15 foot hedge up against one side of our property. Our property is residential, but the neighbor is a large company headquarters. The hedge grows over a fence, about double the height and reaches over the fence by about 6 inches or a foot into our property from theirs (the roots are all on their side of fence). We had put curtain string lights into our side of the hedge just past the first set of leaves, to turn on at night and illuminate the yard. When the company hired gardeners to prune the hedge, they cut through our lights. I asked them for the measly 20 bucks to replace them, and was told rather rudely that it was their hedge and they were being nice by cutting it, we shouldn't have anything in their hedge in the first place. Is this true, even though it reaches over the fence into our property? Would I be able to take this to small claims?	No
325	I am in Washington state. I am on a year lease and am pretty sure it states I forfeit my deposit if I move out early. This is a long one, so I don't blame you for not reading.  So it all started upon moving in. We did a walk through, it was 5pm in February, so it was dark out (we found all sorts of things after the walk through that I know they're going to try to screw us on).  To spare you all the details, we didn't end up staying there until the next night. When we went to take a shower the next day, there was no hot water. We fucked around with the weird instant water heater but could not get it to work. By this time, it was after hours on a Friday. After harassing them all weekend, we finally had hot water that Wednesday.    Then, they freaked out on us that we got a puppy. Even though we had told them we had planned on getting a dog, at no point did they tell us it had to be pre-approved or that there were age restrictions. We managed to haggle our way into a trade-off because of the whole water fiasco.   Then, they call us all the time, at least once a week. About hey, someones gonna stop by to do this or, in the summer time someone is going to have to do this. They wouldn't tell us how to get the dog's paperwork all done, and then kept calling us when we had done it wrong.  They gave us a call saying someone was stopping by to look at some water damage noted in the walk through. We say it's not a good time and they're like oh shit. Look outside and there is a van pulling in. Not much of a 24 hour notice. They left right away though.   In rolls spring/summer, and surprise! they do quarterly inspections (for our benefit of course).  They give the time frame of 9-5 on a weekday and that they need full access to the house. Also, somebody is coming to seed the grass, oh and we need to water it in, but no one has shown us how to work the irrigation system.  Plus, the dog can't be out there. All day long.   They do the inspection, and we get a letter that some areas need the weeds pulled. The areas aren't in the lease, but I decide I'm capable of handling that. A few days later, I get an email saying that they found a pin hole in one of the blinds with a shit resolution picture and that the slat needs to be replaced. I go inspect all the blinds and not one of them is damaged. After going back and forth over these fucking blinds for a month about are you sure that's our house? which blinds are they? bedroom 1, which bedroom is bedroom1? okay, where on the blinds is it? having to deal with a whole bunch of bullshit, sending them 20 pictures of the blinds in detail, they finally send the inspector back out, she goes, says she doesn't know why they didn't just mark it as fixed, looks at blinds, scratches off a piece of dirt and says they're fine.   Then they say the landlord is stopping by for a few days to paint the house and do other outdoor work but no one needs to be home. While he was there, he needed us to open the gate, and he took off our front door, so we went a day without a door in the heat.   Then comes the final straw. We had someone over, roofing the house. Once again, all outdoor work, no one needs to be home. Good cus it's a Monday and we have jobs. Well, I got home and my dog was gone. They had unlatched a gate and left it open. I drove all over the neighborhood looking for her. Stressing out major. I tried calling them, to ask wtf, pissed at this point. Then I get a call from them, saying some neighbor had called the landlord saying they thing the dog got out and that the landlord had left the gate open for the workers when he left. They said they would call back through to see if they had my dog.  I went outside, about to go searching, when I heard her whining. She was next door. It took hours to get her to stop whining. The neighbor had watched her all day, took her swimming, and asked around the neighborhood about her.   I called the management company letting them know I had the dog but that I was still unhappy with all this shit. They basically said, oh we will just note this in your file so it doesn't happen again. This is not good enough. I am so tired of dealing with them. The house and area is alright, but I am so sick of having to deal with this company. I just want to live somewhere, pay rent, and then move on. Not be called or visited by them all the time and then have them screw up this badly.   What can I do?  TL;DR management company sucks, indirectly responsible for my dog going missing, and a whole host of other issues.	No
326	I'd like to file a motion for my ex and into only communicate through a court approved site like MFW. My ex is either hostile/vulgar or ignores important questions regarding custody. He lately will only communicate with me through the kids which is not beneficial to them in any way. How do I go about filing a motion without hiring a lawyer? Does anyone have experience with MFW?	No
327	I was caught on private property by police officers as I was exiting with other people I did not know. (popular spot for kids to hang out) There was signage on the property and an empty police car. I had assumed at the time of entering the property that there was a cop inside the car since the windows were tinted and he would have informed me that I should not be there but it turns out the car was empty. The police informed us to never come back and they claimed to have taken our cars' license plates and we may see a trespassing summons in the mail. No one gave any information, nor were they asked by the cops for it.  If they didn't personally take my information and just read plates, could I still be sent a summons? I am not the person the car is registered to and there would be no way to prove who was on the property since no information was taken.  Thank you	No
328	"I recently moved out of a house where I lived with the landlord. My other roommate moved out on the same day. The landlord looked over her room, said all was good, and paid her the security deposit in cash.  I had to wait for my landlord to take a phone call before she was able to check me out, which was fine because I wanted to do some last minute spot cleaning (wasn't necessary, but I like to leave things nice). After reviewing my room, she said that everything looked great and asked me for my Paypal information. She said she didn't have anymore cash and asked if Paypal was fine. I agreed.  I asked her if we could go ahead and make the transfer that night so I didn't have to worry about it and she followed up with a strong ""No."" and said she would be waiting for 30-90 days to refund my security deposit. I asked why she was doing that after just paying my other roommate in cash.  Her response was that her Ex's lawyer had contacted her lawyer to inform them that a ""friend of mine"" had contacted them and offered to stand as a witness against her character and also that I engaged in illegal activities in the home making it unsafe for their child to visit.  She currently has supervised visitation of the child and is fighting a kidnapping case (charged with kidnapping her own child). I was completely taken back because besides hearing her vent about the custody battle, I know very little details about the case and did not know she had a pending felony when I moved in.  She told me that she was holding onto my deposit for the maximum legally allowed time to deter me from testifying against her in her custody battle. A friend of mine that was helping clean the house was in the room when she said this, as well as the locksmith she hired to change the locks as we were checking out (I got his information after this happened).  This seems really really crazy to me and I'm not sure what to do. I never got involved in this case, never even thought about getting involved, and don't want to spend any more time dealing with this person, I just want my deposit back. I don't know who the person is that they have to testify that I make the house unfit for visitation, or if that is even a real possibility.  In Texas, the only laws I can see about deposit refunding is that the landlord has 30 days to return it.  What should I do? Just wait out the 30 days and hope it gets refunded?  Thank you for taking the time to read!"	No

330	My tenant / friend is moving into a new place. She just signed a contract to take over a lease from aug 1, 2016 - to aug 1, 2017. In the contract it states there is no pet rent fee. The new contract, for 2017-2018 states a pet rent fee but she hasn't signed it. She is told that if she decides not to rent the unit for a year that it will be a month to month lease, at a much higher rent and she is on the line for it. Either way, there would be a pet rent fee since they changed their policy in may... the old tenant / roommate is said to be grandfathered in, but since she signed the contract taking over from aug 1, 2016 - 2017 I thought she would be grandfathered as well. The apt says no because they never approved he dog - regardless of the lease agreement. Is this legal or right and what are our options? She has not paid anything yet... what are her options since the complex won't negotiate and is now demanding either pet rent or the months rent at a much higher price?	No
331	My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	No
332	Hi guys, I crossposted this on r/realestate &amp; r/homeowners but this subreddit was recommended to me as well. It's a strange situation, and we can't figure out who to contact or what to do to buy this house. We've never owned a house so it's all very confusing to us!  Yesterday, we watched a video about adverse possession, and a house that is in his parents' neighborhood came to mind: the common consensus is that a couple bought it from the developer when it was built (2003), lived in it for a year, then disappeared and it's been abandoned ever since. This is in Virginia, btw, and it's never been put up for sale.  We went yesterday to go look at it and there is a key lock on the door and signs from Wells Fargo saying that it was winterized in 2011. Otherwise, the trim is rotting off, the siding is moldy, etc. We asked the neighbors about it, and they said that they moved in 2 years ago, but the house has been abandoned for 5-6 years as far as they know. They said sometimes the bank comes to mow the grass and check the windows and door, but otherwise no one goes in it. We suspect that it's not the bank that does this but the HOA. We were able to look inside in the dining room/kitchen, and there's a few things strewn everywhere - a blanket on the floor, one picture left on the fridge, and literally all the cabinets open and empty.   We got the number off the notice and it led us to Wells Fargo's real estate division. The guy said that they don't own the house and that he couldn't find any record of it. So, we went to the court house to see who owns it.   It's still listed under the original owners, whose address is listed as a PO box in a different city. We were able to find documents about the house, and this is where it gets confusing. The documents state Bank of America as the trustee, who then signs it over to Wells Fargo, who then signs it over to ReconTrust, who then signs it over to Orlan. The last two are debt collector firms. At first we thought the house was indeed foreclosed (but why never put up for sale?), and so we called Orlan to find out how to buy it. Orlan told us they sold it in 2014, and they couldn't tell us anymore. We came to realize that they had just sold the mortgage, but the house was still in possession of the original owners.   The most recent documents are from the HOA releasing a $1000+ lien on the house back in 2014, made out to the original owners, whose address listed at that time was a smaller townhouse in the same neighborhood (wtf?). We went to that house and they no longer live there, if they ever did. But if the lien was released, the owners must have paid it, right?  Soooo, then we decided to see if perhaps the property tax was back paid and if we could buy the house from the county, since obviously no one was taking ownership of the house. I called the tax collectors, who told me that the property tax was all paid up to date by a loan servicing firm. I called them, and the lady was surprised by how long the house had been abandoned for, but she couldn't tell us why the firm was paying for the property tax - she said it was perhaps escrowed into the mortgage.   She told us to check with the county and see how long houses can legally be vacant for, but we're worried that if the county goes and assesses the property and decides that it is abandoned and can be auctioned off, we won't be able to afford it at auction. It's worth $500k+ and our budget is $350k. We did as much free research as we could online to find the original owners, but they seem to be ghosts. They're in their 60's now, though, so the lack of social media presence is understandable. Adverse possession is also out of the question since the property tax is paid.   At this point, I'm going to try to reach out to the HOA today to see if they have any contact number for the owners, but it seems like reporting the house to the county is the best option to free it up. But, does reporting it risk the fact that it may go to auction and we won't get it? Or will the county perhaps allow us to make an offer first? Can the county even do anything if the taxes are paid and it has a listed owner? We're entirely unsure if we should just give up or continue looking into this.   Tl;dr 6yr+ abandoned house's ghost owners live elsewhere and may still be paying the mortgage, property taxes are paid up to date by another firm, mortgage has been sold several times, house is rotting &amp; HOA put a lien on it that has since been released. How do we buy it?  Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. If anyone knows any other subreddits where I can xpost this for more advice, it would be appreciated as well.	No
333	I've been in my apartment for 2.5 years and have been a very good resident with no prior issues. Due to an accident (I'd rather not get specific but it was my fault and also injured me) I put a 5 inch hole right through a bedroom door. The door is cheap and hollow. My question is can I get evicted for this? I have been upset and fearful over it and ashamed to write into maintenance. Does this come out of my security deposit or do I have to pay more money for the door next time rent is due? I am in Arizona. I don't see this in my lease contract, only a small phrase about evictions for severe damage to property that endangers others (like driving into the building lol)  Thank you.	No
334	Hello, Im in Ontario, Canada.  I have an idea for a business (a solution to the adblock problem).  I am not in a position to make my own company or pay for a prototype to be built.  I was considering using the idea as leverage (lets assume the idea is good) to get a job with an advertising agency that could actually utilize it.  My issue is if I reveal my idea and the company just runs with it without me, would I have any legal recourse? (I am assuming not)  And if not, how could I approach this in a way to cover myself? Would provisional patent be relevant?  The idea in question is pretty basic (in fact I am shocked that no one is doing it) so it would be very easy to steal.  Any advice?	No
335	(Indiana and California, for the bot, but I think it's all federal.)   My former cell phone provider thinks I owe them $300. I disagree, but that's not really the issue here.  I sent a general dispute letter the first time it was sent to collections, asking for verification. Instead of verification, I got a letter back from the collection agency that they were returning it to the cell provider. Today, I got a new letter in the mail from a different agency.  I plan on disputing that one as well, but if the same thing happens, is there a point where I'm done? Or can the provider just keep sending it to a new collection agency every time I dispute it, rather than having them actually send the verifications they're required to provide by law?   Sending certified letters will eventually rack up more than the debt, but I'd hate for the one I don't send certified to be the one I actually have a solid FDCPA violation with.	No
336	Baby born in Canada, shared between parents. Court looks inevitable at least eventually. What should she do to protect herself and save on legal expenses? How is it determined where court happens?   There are so many questions but really we just don't want her blindsided and having to fight for custody (even shared) in the US. Also what is to stop her partner from taking her to the US and not bringing her back? I believe without some agreement in place the police can't really intervene, correct?	No
337	Current Custody is 70/30 with my ex husband.   Transfers are only delegated by Mother (myself)or Father.  The majority of the time his mother has our 2 daughters ever other weekend during the school year.  He is suppose to have the girl's during the summer.  But with the current conflict of my 6 year old stating grandmas boyfriend 'touched' her down there I refuse to let grandma do the transfer.  There's a DV case open with our current custody battle enforcing a restraing order against this man that the girls had spoke of touching them down there. First in 2015 and now 2017  Needless to say the father hasn't shown to pick them up after school ended. That was nearly two months ago. In alaska I know after 3 months of no contact with the kids is considered abandonment.   But I'm afraid the judge favors the father over the best interest of the children.  The fathers statement on why he wants his mother to pick up and drop off is that he has to work.  And he's not willing to co-parent.  But I know plenty of parents that wake up early to drop their kids off at day care and pick them up after. Or dropping them off with their family members for help but do their duediligance and pick up their kids and take them home. He refuses to do this.   Leaving the girls in his mothers care for nearly 25%-29% of his custody.   But yet the judge says if he doesn't come and get them on his physical custody during the summer and stay with me, he is not doing anything wrong?  I don't mind having them.  But its not fare to our daughters and I don't understand how this has gotten out of hand. How is it legal to do so??   I need further legal advice on where to go or what to do. We have our next court date on 08/07 but I have a feeling nothing will become of this.   Thank you.	No
338	My girlfriend and I live together and share a lease in an apartment. I believe I am the primary signature on the lease.   A few days ago my girlfriend and I were arguing, an argument which continued as we entered the bedroom. We were both in bed and I was facing away from her in an attempt to fall asleep, the lights were off and I was trying to end the conflict. The argument was continuing, and I wasn't helping things by telling her to shut up. She eventually started hitting me, which unfortunately has happened before and I told her don't hit me. She hit me again and I turned around in the dark and struck her back, in the chest.   Her immediate response was too cry out and jump from bed, saying she was calling the cops. It all happened very quickly. I got out of bed and got dressed, and waited for the police who arrived extremely quickly. I was fairly shocked at the speed of all this. The police questioned me, and I cooperated fully, explaining to them what I am typing to you now.   At the time I was in a daze. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. I struck my girlfriend out of frustration of her always hitting me. At the time I just wanted her to realize it wasn't fair what she was doing. I know there's no such thing as an excuse especially not in this situation.   Anyways the police cuffed me and took me to jail which I cooperated fully with. I am now being charged with assault. As a stipulation to being released, I was asked to sign a notice to appear, and to agree to fully cut off contact with my (now former) girlfriend. Finally I am not to return to my apartment, where I live and keep all my possessions.   I understand from the information that the police have given me that my ex girlfriend is leaving the apartment. She has a new place to live in the start of August. This means she will be able to start out again on her own, which I am fine with. I really do wish her the best and I look at this incident with sadness and regret.   But now I am under police order to not return to my apartment. Even in a week, once my ex moves out, I am apparently still not to return.   I need advice for, once my apartment has been vacated by my ex, how to regain access to my life and apartment.   I have a court date but it isn't until the 22nd of August. I am staying at a friend's but this whole debacle is weighing heavily on my conscience. I am almost positive that there are no injuries involved. I really hope now that my girlfriend still has compassion for me which I assume she does. I realize my mistake, especially during the moment when I justified my actions as self defense.   But now I am on charges without access to my apartment. Is there something I can do? I plan to, if the charges are not dropped before the 22nd, to lawyer up. I just need some advice about my position.   I am not going to contact my girlfriend because it's part of my release agreement. I just need to get my life back as soon as possible.   Please help!	No
339	"* Answered an ad on social media that offered paint correction on vehicles. The guy had ample pictures of his work(or so I thought lol) etc.  * Well he gets the car &amp; proceeds to paint it with what's looks to be a paint brush &amp; a roller. He lays the paint that looks to be house paint on so thick it never completely dried. Rendering all sorts of debris embedded, including I kid you not a butterfly stuck to the hood not unlike a hood ornament lol. There were gobs of paint on the glass, floor carpeting &amp; the chrome work.  * I contacted him several times afterwards only to get a run around &amp; he finally deleted all of his social media pages. He's also an active duty marine, so I don't know if they have a different/ faster venue other than small claims court.  * I had the car repaired &amp; the negligent work ended up costing me double what it would have prior to the botched work. I have an itemized invoice from the body shop detailing the flawed repair as well as ample pics.  * I'm seeking the money it cost me to rectify the damage caused by the improper repair. Should I file for ""Money Owed"" or ""Property Damage"".  * Thanks in advance"	No
340	I just moved in with my girlfriend and my name is freshly on the lease. Our AC has been on the fritz the last handful of days, and as we've had a lot of rain and thus temperature and humidity swings, I guessed correctly that the pipes had frozen. When I opened the closet to check I noticed the floor was wet and there was some water dripping from somewhere, and a strong musty, fungal odor. I didn't think anything of it and just tried to thaw the pipes with a hot rag. A few hours later, we both started to feel ill. Weak, fatigued, nauseous, dizzy, with headaches and body aches and a general feeling of disorientation and slowness of mind. We searched for our symptoms and made the connection to the mold and decided we should get out and stay in a hotel room for the night. We've informed our office of this and there response was that they would have maintenance check it out. We're out $200, is there anything we can/should do?  Thanks!	No
341	"Long story short, I made out checks to my ex (who lives in Maine) in the amount of $12,799 and a wire transfer of $3,000 when a check bounced because I forgot to transfer money from my savings to my checking account. Every check is clearly marked as a ""loan,"" and we have a previously signed contract for $10,000 of the $15,799.  I have a new contract reflecting the current amount that I plan to get notarized and sent to him immediately. He has been refusing to work with me on this and gets angry whenever I bring it up, so I imagine I am going to have problems with him signing the contract, let alone paying me on time.  If he continues to refuse, should I hire a lawyer or file on my own in small claims court? I don't know much about the process, and I don't want to screw this up."	No
342	"Apologies in advance, there's a lot going on and we've only just found out about this.  My grandmother (father's side) has slowly had her Alzheimer's get worse and worse.  Back in 2005, she was worried that she was starting to ""lose it"", and signed power of attorney over to my father in case it was actually Alzheimer's and not just her getting older.  I've checked the county clerk of courts website, and I see the document there granting power of attorney to my father.  About 3 years ago (2014-ish), my Uncle and my Aunt (and possibly other extended family) told my father that they convinced her to switch Power of Attorney over to them.    My father asked my Grandma if this was true, to which she replied yes.  Dad takes that as his cue to stay out of it from here on out.  At that point, my Aunt started living with my Grandmother.  My aunt has multiple felony drug convictions.  I would bet my house that she's been stealing from my grandmother since she moved in, but that isn't relevant to the question, sorry.    Fast forward to two weeks ago, and grandma is in really bad shape.  Almost non-responsive.  A different family member took her to see the family doctor who immediately admits her for dehydration and malnutrition.  She is now (as of late last week) in a senior care facility.  Monday of this week, another concerned family member got online and did some digging on the county clerk of courts site, and there are no records of Grandma signing Power of Attorney over to my Uncle or Aunt.  There are also no records of any Guardianship applications.  Dad realizes he's probably been lied to, purposefully by aunt and uncle (who have again almost assuredly been stealing her social security money) and almost assuredly unknowingly by my Grandmother.  My question is, had my Uncle actually filed for power of attorney, or for guardianship, would there be a record of that on the county clerk of courts website?  This was again supposedly a couple years back, not like last week where it wouldn't be updated.  Dad is now meeting with the current home, who was told not to allow him or my mother to make any decisions about Grandma by my Aunt / Uncle, to show them the 2005 documents.  They intend to move her to a better facility closer to them so that they can help.   I guess I'm just wondering if we're getting our hopes up?  Uncle and Aunt are obviously a mess, and we want to do what's best for Grandma, but we were under the impression (and that's on us for not checking) that Dad was no longer in control.  Also, if my dad still does have power of attorney, how can we get Grandma's financial information so that we can see how much they have been stealing from her, and make sure that her social security money gets used for her care?"	No
343	Background: Months of stalking &amp; bedroom peeping that resulted in a 6 month criminal ordeal in which I was the victim witness. I got a harassment prevention order. Criminal charges were dismissed due to prosecution making a clerical error. Currently, there are no active criminal charges, he's not on probation, all I have is the HPO. It was a traumatizing ordeal.  The other day I legally obtained physical(ish) proof that he recently went behind my house (not on property) while I was home, within 50 yds of me (HPO definition), and was in a place where you can see directly into my bedroom windows! Be clear, this was no accident- he went to the window peeping spot and turned around. I desperately don't want to trigger another criminal offense, go to court, etc. I'm trying to move out of state in six weeks and can't be another victim witness.   I was reading my HPO and it says that he can't contact me- but says nothing about me contacting him. Is this something that I can do to tell him to stay away? It would be a carefully worded e-mail (no harassment, want to explain the 50 yd radius and tell him to stay out of it in case he forgot). I'm not sure if I will do it, but just wanted to know if it's legal given the circumstances.  Can I get in trouble for doing that?	No
344	I am the biological father of a 16 y/o female. She has been living with me for over a year now since her mom died.  Her mother and I were never married.  Her mother did not complete a will. There is also a 24 year old brother.  I would like to establish guardianship so we can sell her mothers house. Can I do this without a lawyer? I'm her dad, always have been, do I need papers?	No
345	Hey All,  Back in beginning of June I moved into a new apartment with a roommate. I have been living in this apartment complex for a little over two years with no trouble with paying my rent.  Moving into this place my roommate and myself had an understanding that each of us would pay half of the rent and utilities. The first month rent (June) was paid by both of us jointly.  When July rolled around my roommate said her boss did not pay her and she was going through the state to claim the money. So I ended up lending her 30 dollars to initiate the process. When I looked at my bank statement it stated that the payment was for over payment collections. After doing some research I found out that over payment collections occurs when the state grants unemployment but after the fact denies it for fraudulent purposes. I ended up paying the full amount of rent for July after she told me she would be able to give me money from part time jobs she was working.  Roll into this month (August) she has only paid me 30% of the rent from July and has not paid this months rent which is due in five days. On top of this she has not paid any utilities for the time she has spent here.  At this point it seems like she is avoiding the apartment and avoiding her obligations. After talking to the leasing office they told me there is not much they can do since it is a joint lease. I have texted her about leaving so I can find a roommate to make the rent she is claiming she is paying the rent this month and will leave at the end of the month. It seems like she is dragging this out and taking advantage of the situation.  In terms of the legal side of things what can be done or what good advice can you give me? Can I physically remove her property from the apartment? After the fact I plan on going through small claims to collect the money owed, is there anything I should be doing now to document these issues?	No
346	We are in the process of buying a home where my husband's new job is (San Antonio). We are supposed to close soon, but one of his former employers(Austin)  isn't returning any of the contact from the lender and it has been weeks. The problem being, that closing is right around the corner and not hearing from this company will cause a delay. If there is a delay the seller can back out and we will lose the home. I fear that this could likely happen, as it is a military family that has orders to a new state and they need to sell their home. Do we have any legal recourse to compel his former employer to pick up the phone?   He left the employment on good terms, he explained that he was unable to support his family on the salary and gave proper notice.	No
347	"A former tenant, a married couple, have filed a restraining order against my father in law, claiming he harassed them by driving past their home. The woman further claimed that she was afraid of him, because he was acting crazy and laughing maniacally.   All of this is so drastically out of character for my FIL, that I believe they filed this out of spite to inconvenience him, or maybe even as a means to another end.   He had to evict them because they stopped paying rent and strung him along with promises of payment and the occasional payment of less than 10% of what they owed. He tried to work with them for about 6 months before he filed for eviction.   They rented two small commercial offices in a small town building. They contested the eviction, but then settled for being granted a few more weeks and in turn agreed to a payment plan, which afaik they have not honored.   When they finally moved out, the places weren't in great shape, but there was nothing obviously malicious.   However, they did claim at that time already towards a deputy, that he had been harassing them by tearing apart their shop sign and screaming at them. I do not believe for a second that he would scream at any person ever, and he probably did not tear apart their sign, because he could produce it intact immediately. But, he had gone there and taken it down when he posted a for-rent sign.   When they found new places, the owners called him for a reference. He is fairly active in the community, and many people know him. He did describe exactly what happened to the owners, and it is fairly likely that they lost their not yet signed lease because of that call.   Now, the restraining order is actually a problem, because it appears that the woman has found a new place within 500ft of his property. So when he goes in to show it, he would be violating the restraining order, if I understand everything correctly. I could also imagine that they're trying to somehow trick him into violating it, just out of revenge, or maybe even to establish a pattern for yet another frivolous suit later. I have personally not met them or witnessed anything, but again, everything they described in the restraining order does not fit at all to his character.   Now, my question is what would be the sensible steps to take?   He wants to go to the DA's office, and ""explain the situation"". I wouldn't think that would really achieve anything. (Though, maybe it would, because he might actually know someone in that office.).  I suggested he let his attorney handle it, who negotiated the payment plan with them. But really, right now he doesn't know how to effectively react, he's running more on instinct, which might just be wasting time."	No
348	My boyfriend has a 4 year old. On March 12, 2017, he was dropped off with us for 1 week, per verbal and written agreement. It was to be a one week on, one week off arrangement.   She neglected him, leaving him alone all day when he was little, resulting in him being behind mentally, emotionally and behaviorally. She passed him off to babysitters at random.  She has another child, a 7 year old that she did sign over her rights to the child's fathers sister.   I asked her to sign over her rights to me and our boys father, but she refused.   It has since been 17 months since she has had any contact whatsoever with her son, and he is to be enrolled in pre-k in a month. Legally, she can show up and take him.   I've been told that 6 months is abandonment, and to terminate rights you have to put something in the paper for 3 weeks to notify her. Being that it's been almost 18 months, is there any other way we can go to court without getting a lawyer and fighting?	No
349	He is the younger brother of my other roommate (who is on the lease along with myself), and we agreed to take him in because he was doing well with probation (unrelated crime) and needed a place to stay. He was living with us happily for almost a year.  Long story short, we found he was stealing from us and dealing drugs. Now he is the run from his probation officers. I do not currently know where he is. Some of his stuff is still here, and we havent touched it. My concern is he still has the key to our house.  We filed a police report and are working with them on the criminal matters. The police said we have to do a formal eviction if we want to kick him out whenever he returns. His parole officers said to continue with the eviction process.  I wanna know is there anyway we can change the locks in the meantime or get him kicked out faster?   I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid he will come in and take more stuff.  Also How do you start evicting someone not on the lease? Every resource I look at seems to be concerned with landlords evicting tenants on a lease.   Yes I've learned a very painful lesson concerning trusting people.	No
350	I received a ticket with court appearance over the weekend for Driving While Suspended. I was 81 days into serving a 90 day suspension for a DUI.   There was a cop on the road, ran my plates and I was pulled over. The rest is history, I'm a complete idiot and I regret driving. I was 9 days away from getting my license reinstated.   Wanted to know if r/legaladvice can give me any guidance	No
351	My wife filed for assistance when my son was born. I didn't know I had I son, two years later I received a letter to be DNA swabbed at DFS, which I obliged . Even before the results were in I knew he was mine so I contacted my wife and we got married 12 years later, present day, I get called into HR and was told there was a order for back child support to garnish my wages. Look at the paperwork and my son's name is on it. WTF! I've raised this kid and I owe child support. Apparently the case was never properly closed. My question is what is fastest way to resolve this and if any is there any recourse for the state fucking up?	No
352	Hey all,  I want to preface this by saying I’m a moron and I’m looking to get some direction on what to do next.  I live in durham, nc and moved down to Florida, I recently came back to North Carolina to move my stuff out of my apartment. The lease ends on August 6th.  I have set my payments on auto pay since I’ve lived there and haven’t had an issue. All of the sudden I get a phone call while I’m here today from management saying that they want me to come to the office to rectify an issue with my account I’m like okay. I go down and they said they started the eviction process on me and my girlfriend. I don’t even know what to think, we’ve paid rent every time on time and this baffled me. I look at our online portal and realize rent wasn’t paid this month. Something happened with the auto pay. Rent was due the 2nd, they gave a notice for it to be paid by the 11th and we got a phone call on the 21st today notifying us. When we came back to move last week we didn’t see anything on the door. We had a friend check our mail and leave it in the apartment. Low and behold we sort through all of the mail and there’s the notice.  They have charged us for eviction legal fees and all that.   I’m fine with paying the fines, I fucked up and all that. Once we found out we paid rent immediately. They said that once we paid they’ll dismiss it. But they were extremely unhelpful or sympathetic toward the situation.  What are my options? I have been a renter  for 10 years (at various properties) and have paid on time every single time. Having this eviction in my history is going to screw things up for me and my girlfriend.  What should I do? How do we avoid this from affecting us in the future?  Thanks,	No
353	Okay, so 8 years ago I moved into an apartment with a family member when I was 15. Being 15 I was never on the lease or anything like that so they were the only name on it. From 18 until now I have been paying the rent but in their name, now a month ago the family member passed away. My question would be if i had any rights to stay here? I know about succession rights and the relationship was grandparent/grandchild. During the time i lived here I mostly cared for my family member and did under the table work (nothing illegal or bad) so I don't have credit but I do have money in the bank. Also, based on the fact that I've been here for 8 years do you think the chances of being allowed to stay without a credit check and reapplication are at all good? Thanks	No
354	Really hoping someone can help me out on here. I'm living in a basement apartment on a one year lease that started Dec. 1st. I have a horrendous mold/mildew issue in my home that started around the same time the warm weather hit (early June) all due to ventilation not existing with it being a basement apartment. From my understanding, I know that mold growth can be blamed on the tenants (i.e. not using fans when cooking/showering, not opening windows, etc) but the day I moved in, my landlord had made it clear that 2/3 windows in the house do not have screens or locks, nor do they even open. He had stated that he was not going to fix the issue until next year because he had “spent so much money putting in hardwood floors”. Not long after, I came to discover that none of the fans in the bathroom or kitchen work either. Therefore, I have absolutely no way of airing out this place except by opening my front door and kitchen window. I made my landlord aware of the mold present, he said he would come by the next week to take a look. We had a discussion about the windows and fans needing to be fixed asap because the mold is getting out of control. I also showed him how my belongings were starting to get a little ruined which he didn’t say a thing about and didn’t seem to have much empathy but said that he would get to the process of fixing everything. The next day he dropped off a dehumidifier and said it should help with the moisture build up and what not. It is now almost August and the problem has not gotten better. My landlord has not further discussed anything with me about installing new windows or anything else since I mentioned the problem to him in June. I don’t know if the dehumidifier is his way of fixing the problem, but nothing here is fixed and I’ve made it clear. The dehumidifier stays on all day/every day, I have to constantly switch it from room to room or the levels will get too high and mildew will start to grow overnight. This problem has become its worst and it’s destroying me and just about everything I own! Everything, and anything is covered in some type of mold and mildew no matter how many remedies I use to clean it, it is growing back overnight. Being someone who has had many health problems, including allergies I know my body and there’s no doubt that this mold problem has affected and deteriorated my health over the course of 2 or 3 months. This is my first apartment and all of my furniture as well as every little thing I own was just bought this year as I started out with nothing but the clothes on my back in December. Having the distress of having to throw out all of my belongings after just getting them is breaking my heart. Couch, tv stand, dressers, ALL of my clothes in the dresser, shoes, bedding, papers/journals, cookware/utensils. You name it, it’s probably covered in mold like you wouldn’t believe. At one point, I had some difficulty breathing every night, which never existed before, come to find out my pillow is close to black underneath which I don’t understand how it could of happened so fast. Some of the mold on my belongings isn’t even coming off at this point that I’m going to have no choice but to throw it all out. I’ve had it living in this apartment with issues I can’t prevent from happening. Nothing but stress and if I were to move out to another place with no furniture, I’d basically be starting over again which is another stressful thought... I’m at the point where I’m ready to just live out of my car again since finances are tight and my health is getting worse. I just want to know a few things: can my landlord actually be held responsible for this and pay me for the cost to replace my damaged property? I have been taking pictures and documenting everything since it started and have every date &amp; conversation with my landlord. I’ve been looking at possibly sending in a “Tenant Application about Maintenance” form to the Ontario Landlord &amp; Tenant board which costs a fee of $45/$50 to send in. I just want to know how something like this works or if anyone has had a similar experience? If I do something like this is it just a waste of money or is it likely that I will win the case?	No
355	[CT] Hello, My mom had a bill from her dentist which was sent to collections. The dentist told her she would have to pay both the bill and the collections fee. So my mom pay the fee through the collections, but has not received a bill for the fee the dentist hired for collections. Will she receive a notice about this or is everything set? She no longer goes to this dentist.	No
356	Finished up my lease on an apartment with 3 other guys on the first of July and received the itemized list of charges against the security deposit. Some of the charges on it were $150 for labor in replacing a fist sized hole in the wall, 150 for parts and 225 for labor in replacing a broken door jam which I had already bought a door jam to be installed, and some other things. As of right now he said that he was being a nice guy and not charging the cleaning fee, which he priced at 400 and pretty much said that if we complained about the pricing he would apply that fee.   What I'm wondering is if there is some standard for pricing that a landlord can charge and if they are able to tack on more money after sending the itemized list because $150 to replace $10 of drywall and to paint that area seems absurd. Anything helps, thanks	No
357	"Before passing, my husband's grandfather made his son (my husband's uncle) the executor to his estate to help make sure bills were being paid on time etc. In doing so he added Uncle to his bank account. Grandma does not have a bank account nor is her name on Grandpa's bank account.  He started off by paying off Grandpa's $10,000 credit card (which he quickly maxed out over the limit to $15,000 + stating it was insured and would be paid off when Grandpa passed so he thought he'd just blow through it - all stuff for himself and his family / some purchases were made day of / day after Grandpa's passing.)   Grandpa was in the hospital for a little over a month and then placed into in home hospice before passing. When he was released from the hospital Uncle informed Grandma that the hospital bills were over $3,000,000 and insurance barely covered anything so they were putting a lien on all their accounts and assets. To me this raised a huge red flag because I've never heard of anyone leaving the hospital with a bill - and even if so wouldn't they give you a chance to pay your bill before trying to seize everything? Anyway....sounded like bullshit to me. He has yet to produce any proof of these liens. No letters, nothing.  Grandma and Grandpa had 2 CD accounts that Grandma is the beneficiary of - one was $50,000 and the other was $115,000 - Uncle suggested they cash the CDs out early so the hospital/insurance couldn't take the funds for Grandpa's bills. After fees they cashed the CDs out for $47,XXX and $112,XXX - the day they were deposited into Grandpa's account the funds were transferred into Uncle's personal savings account. We know this because my husband decided to set up online banking for Grandpa's accounts to try and help Grandma figure out what was going on.   Grandpa also had around $30,000 in his savings account and $5,000 in his checking account before the CDs were released. One day when Uncle was over at Grandma's house she decided to call the automated system to check the account balances. There was about $2,000 in each account. Shocked, she asked her son where all the money went and his response was ""Oh, uh, I don't know. I gotta go."" and promptly left her house.   We've estimated he's taken around $180,000 that was supposed to be left to Grandma to live the rest of her years out without having to rely on anyone. Grandpa worked very hard to make sure he was able to leave her money and all his kids and grand kids money.   Grandma babysits for Uncle every week and has noticed he purchased a new safe, new RV, playground, used cars, home improvements, packages showing up every day ""Uncle's Name C/O Grandpa's name) etc. She also noticed that every time he has someone over at the house doing work he goes to the safe and pulls envelopes of cash out to pay them.  To me it's pretty obvious he's taken the money for himself and is leaving her high and dry. What's not obvious is what we should do about it. We are scared that if we are not prepared when going to the cops and they speak to him that he's going to hide/get rid of the rest of the money that's left.  Please keep in mind Grandma is on a very tight budget so finding a lawyer to help for little to no money will more than likely be very tricky.  Since we do have online access to the Grandpa's bank accounts we have printed out the statements, transaction history, and check images. Grandma also has the letters stating she is the beneficiary of the CD accounts.  If it helps, we are located in Oregon."	No
358	We have been trying to close on this house for a while with aVA loan. We were at the closing date, but he didn't realize that he agreed to pay closing costs. What is my recourse here, he won't sign unless we give up another 1000 dollars.	No
359	"Sorry for formatting I am on my phone.   Location: Nebraska   Tl;dr: Apartment is nothing as it was advertised, missing stainless steel appliances that will be put in ""soon"" however I am still paying for them, and dryer completely burned my brand new comforter after 30 minutes on low. What are my options and would it be possibly to make the apartment pay for my new comforter that they broken appliance ruined?  Some background:   I am in a sorority so I had to move in early. I sent my   move in early application on July 14th and the deadline was July 15th. There was a strong lack of communication on the apartments side of informing me the process of move in. Example one email told me they needed forms but didn't tell me what forms they needed. Another said I would get a confirmation email with instructions which I never got.   My roommates and I toured in December and signed right before Christmas break. We were told when they recruited us that if we could find our own roommates they would cut us a deal. They ended up givings a furnished apartment free of charge $5/month. Anyways the break down of costs is $339/month for the apartment and all utilities with the exception of electrical. We opted for the upgraded apartment which was $20 more per month. This included hard wood floors, new stainless steel appliances, newer bathroom fixtures, and new carpet in the bedrooms. We were told every apartment would be freshly painted before we moved in and the model apartment had huge ""storage rooms"".   Reality:  So I moved in Wednesday. Since I never got a confirmation email, I called Tuesday afternoon and they said I was good to go and gave me instructions to go to the clubhouse to sign some paperwork and get my keys. I arrived around 2:00 get my keys and what not then head to my apartment. I pack up as much stuff as I can carry and walk up to the third floor only to find out my key doesn't work. Since I am by myself I have to carry all my stuff back down stairs to my car and then go back to the clubhouse to get the right key. Fast forward to when I am opening the door to my apartment. I walk in throw my stuff on the furnish couch and immediately notice the couch is all ripped up. Then I notice the ugly dented white fridge. At first I think okay maybe I am remember incorrectly and we only got the half upgraded model (just new floors) so I text my roommates and then explore. I notice most of the apartment has not been painted and what was painted was done very poorly (my dad has single handedly redone almost our entire house and is a perfectionist when it comes to painting). There is some sketchy black tarp hanging out of the dish washer. The stove is all beat up and dented and covered in rust. Both showers/baths, have several rust spots and tubs don't look like they've been cleaned recently. The toilets are much cheaper quality than the ones in the demo room. The only thing that seems to be right is the hardwood floors .   So back to the clubhouse I go to complain, politely of course, even though I am already very upset. I talk to some guy who I think is slightly above a receptionist. He tells me that yes I am getting stainless steel appliance but because I moved in early they hadn't been installed yet. I ask him when they will be installed and he says soon and that they will notify me and my roommate so we can remove our stuff from the kitchen and stay out of the apartment when it's being installed. This led me to believe that it's not happening any time before the normal move in date on the 17th. I ask if thy could give me an estimate of when the appliances would be in by, he goes and talks to the manager sand again tells me he can't give me a date but it will be soon.   Fast forward about 2 hours later when my mom shows up and goes to talk to management. Manager tells my mom and I they aren't installed because I turned in my early move in application ""too close to the deadline"" and that they are ""low on maintenance"" even though the property is crawling with people working on buildings and doing landscaping. I tell him I understand I moved in early but they should've left a note in the apartment or on the door or told me when I got my key that the appliances hadn't been installed. My mom then says that if the appliances aren't in by the 17th we aren't paying for them to while management says they can't guarantee anything but says they will credit our accounts $20 if the appliances aren't installed in August and then again blames me for moving in early.   At this point, I am just kind of sort of done and accepted what happened and was content enough to play the waiting game until tonight.   The comforter I brought with me turned out to be the wrong size in the wrong bag (most likely got switched with the twin since the full is more expensive).  Anyways I go out and splurge $69.99 bedding set from home goods. This is about double what I paid for the other set that included sheets from target. I figured I might as well buy a nice expensive set that will last me the rest of college. So I get back to my apartment and toss it in the wash. No big deal comes out clean. I move it to the dryer and set it on low as the tag described. Not even 30 minutes later I smell something burning only to find that about have the comforter had been burned/melted and one corner had been complete ripped up and destroyed. At this point I am completely livid.    Any suggestions on how to get my apartment to step up and give us what we were told we were getting. Also would they reimburse my comforter is I bring in my receipt showing I bought it yesterday and ask them to fix the dryer. Like not gonna lie I've ruined stuff doing laundry before but I've never had anything burn in the dryer let alone in under 30 minutes."	No

361	Hello all,  Basically embroiled in a dispute with landlord asking for more rent. We have documented proof of all payments made which are in exact accordance with the lease.   The amount they are claiming is 2.8k unpaid rent and they still have our deposit of 1.7k.  All attorneys that pop up are for landlords (not tenants), how would I go about finding an attorney to represent myself (the tenant) ?	No
362	I'm looking for a new job and am willing to contract.  Some recruiters, I'd say less than half, have language that states I agree to accept the position if the employer wants me (at the negotiated rate).   Is such a contract binding?   If so, if the job is at will anyway, what prevents me from joining for 1 day and then quitting, say if I don't like the office smell?  (promissory estoppel issues perhaps)  More curious than anything, because I occasionally agree to such terms, but only when the money is so good that I really would take the job.	No
363	Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	No
364	Ex and I were together for a decade. Ex broke it off two months ago. Fine. Ex says she'll remove her stuff from the apartment and get on with it.  Except the part where she never did. And she stopped paying rent.  We are co-tenants on a lease that ends in approximatemy four months. Out of the eight months we have been here, ex has only paid rent for three.   Because we were together so long, there is only a verbal agreement of splitting the rent in half. Maybe there's a saved text or something but I never got a written contract because love I guess.  The main thing here is I can't stand being around her anymore. We had a domestic violence incident in the last year that I did not report. Staying in this apartment now is mentally and physically destroying me but I don't trust ex to 1) not steal my shit and 2) not wreck the apartment.  The only silver living here is that the landlord allows for leases to be broken with notarized signatures of both co-tenants. I've sent this is ex multiple times and they've yet to complete it. To be fair, I haven't done it either because I've been waiting on her to sign it first.   My main question is: Is there any way I can potentially just get my name off the lease? This leaves ex with the hot potato, as they say, and is the easiest way to dodge. I'm just worried about this coming back to bite me in the ass later either via a small claim or a bad landlord reference. That's probably out of the question, though, considering the early leave.   Thanks for any help you can give.	No
365	"All,  I apologize if this is the wrong section to ask this question, but I felt like this was the most appropriate place since many of you have probably dealt with something like this in the past.  I have a friend that is currently living with me in a condominium I own, and he is not on a lease. At the end of the month, he is leaving to go live on his own with his girlfriend, but I am at a point now where I just want to end the tenure. For the past six or so months, his girlfriend has been basically living here not paying any bills, and giving a stressful passive aggressive attitude almost like being entitled to live here. I've brought it up a few times and we've mutually agreed on a few things like cleaning around the house, but I am at a breaking point since the attitude doesn't stop. Because of this, we mutually agreed to end the living situation based on the aforementioned timeline starting on September 1st.  A few days ago, I had a talk with him since he agreed to pay me a bit extra since she would ""officially"" be moving in for the month of August as a transition period from her lease ending to when their new lease starts on September 1st. The problem is, the passive aggressiveness is not stopping and now she is causing damage to one of my vehicles. I have a car in my parking garage that she has started parking next to and for the past three days, there have been three brand new, fresh, black door ding parks on my passenger side rear quarter panel. I know every mark on that car and I barely drive the vehicle, so I know it is her.  My question is, so I have a legal basis to kick them out regardless of the reason if there isn't a lease in place? Since I physically own the property, am I able to just ask them to leave and if they don't, it is considered trespassing? For what it's worth, I am located in Texas."	No
366	Throwaway because this has the potential to include a lot of personal details. /r/personalfinance suggested to xpost here.  My mom has been on disability for as long as I can remember, and she has had a really hard life. Her disability is mental: she has trouble with basic remembering, organizing, keeping track of information, etc. She also has depression which has been off and on, and it sounds like it's really starting to hit her full force.  She lives in NM, USA (I live in a different state) and her only income is disability, with a few small side gigs like teaching music and pet-sitting. She inherited her mom's house, so doesn't have to pay rent or mortgage, but it is starting to fall apart. She owns a paid-off car that's always on its last legs. Her credit is shot, but has no formal debt. She has enough money for really basic living expenses, but is also terrible managing her money (maybe partially due to her disability). Essentially, no matter how much or how little she has each month she gets by but spends it all, so her emergency fund is always drained.  The more I talk to her, the more I see she is really starting to have trouble:  * Her house is in complete disrepair and she barely manages to negotiate help with neighbors or scrapes together enough to pay for a cheap repair person, which isn’t a quality fix.  * She has been taking her car to the same family-owned shop for 10+ years and they just keep adding big costs to her “tab”--then when she asks how much she owes they don’t even know! There’s no way she’d be able to keep this car up without their clearly free labor/parts, and I’m not anticipating this business can stick around forever operating like this.  * She has trouble driving medium-long distances, which seems to be getting worse over time (now trips over about an hour long are not possible). She literally falls asleep. I think some of her meds do this, and part of this might be her disability too. I worry she’s close to losing her ability to transport herself anywhere.  * She told me she is five years behind on her taxes. Because of this, she cannot access any community services that require her to prove she’s low-income or to help her generally get and keep her life together (social workers, community house repair programs, etc.). I ask her what’s keeping her from doing her taxes… apparently she has a CPA volunteering her time but she’s missing extensive documentation from her side gigs. So… she’s completely stuck. Are there any options for a person who had lost documentation of (pretty low levels of) income? She estimates about $200-$400 per month she cannot document over those past few years, and her volunteer CPA is basically saying nothing can be done without complete information.  * She has a counselor (had two for a while) but her depression is really starting to wear on her. She admits she has trouble getting up in the mornings and doing basic self-care tasks some days. I truly don’t believe she’s a danger to herself but I do think she is just sad, and life is hard for her right now.  * She is mostly introverted but I have been really proud of her ability to make friends and contribute when possible to try to build a community net around her. But… those connections have been dropping like flies. The neighbors that used to check on her and help her have moved, gotten busy, or in one case there was a misunderstanding about money and they stopped talking to my mom altogether. Her friends have thinned out--I think they are drained by the kind of general support she needs. Her disability (or something…) has started to make her act really weird the last few years. She talks about pointless things, gets confused following conversation, etc.  * She’s asked me for help with managing her money before, but she never does the steps to get us a joint account (she has to be the one to set it up in person because I cannot travel there right now). I also don’t want to be forceful about this… I will help with what she requests but since she’s not taking the actual steps I believe she is still clinging to what autonomy she still has. She knows she has extreme problems but isn’t ready to change yet, even though I’m here ready when she is.  I am so stuck right now and I don’t even know how to help. I feel like there has got to be some kind of service for people who have disabilities and need to be sort of dug out of a hole like this so they can access other social services. She’s been trying to do all this by herself for so long and it just doesn’t look like it’s working well anymore.  Any advice, stories, resources, kind words, harsh truths, etc. are appreciated.	No
367	Today I found out that my company didn't contribute to my 401k for 3 years ever since I started working there. Even though I elected to have it maxed out and Fidelity has that on record, my employer simply has never carried out the contributions. When I asked HR about it they only said that there is nothing they can do. Is this true or am I legally entitled to some compense or solution to catch up on what I missed?	No
368	"We are under contract to purchase a property in NM built in 1929. We've just received the CCRs, which date to when the plot was originally sold in 1928. The CCRs state that ""No conveyance of the premises or any part thereof shall ever be made to any person or persons of Oriental or African descent.""  This is pretty sickening to us. I hope it's also illegal under current fair housing regulations. My questions are: * Can you kind law-talkin' folks confirm that this covenant is no longer binding due to current fair housing regulations? * If it is somehow still binding, how would we go about objecting to it? We will obviously discuss this with our Realtor too, but wanted to hear the opinion of /r/legaladvice as well. * Whether it is binding or not, is there a way to formally revoke it so that it is explicitly removed from the CC&amp;Rs going forward?  Thanks for your insight!"	No
369	First reddit post ever!    In Massachusetts.  Joined a 3 bedroom apartment as a subletter.  I'm about to sign a year-long lease (really love the place) and just discovered something I had never heard of after 12 years renting different apartments:  Electricity bill for each apartment is not metered... the total house usage is divvied up across apartments based on square footage.    My apartment takes up one full floor and is one of 4 apartments in multifamily house.  Roommates and I received a bill for $250 (!!!), which makes absolutely no sense given our limited A/C usage.  We do a lot to control utility costs here.  We're basically subsidizing the electricity of the other smaller apartments that each have 2 people living in them.  Is this a legal practice in MA?  I love the apartment, but this seems unfair.	No
370	"There are actually two different things related to the same situation that I could use some advice on. First some backstory. I'm sorry that it might be a long read but I think all the information is necessary to get a full scope of the situation. I am a woman and have been in a relationship for the past 6.5 years with another woman, we will called her Kaley, and she had a 2 year old daughter when we met who I've been co-parenting, and have been considered her other mom. We have lived together for the entire time, and in the apartment we are currently living in for the past 4-5 years. Her name is the only name on the lease. My mother lives with us because she is sick and on oxygen and can't live alone. Well, about a month ago my girlfriend comes to me saying that she has this friend, who we will call Jamie, who is involved in an abusive relationship and who is planning on leaving her boyfriend. She really needs a place to stay or she will be homeless. I feel for this girl and agree that she can stay with us until she finds other arrangements. Well, from the very start the situation was weird. My girlfriend and this girl spent every second together, and would leave together to go out with Jamie's friends all the time, sometimes even over night. When they were home they would spend most of the time in the basement supposedly smoking/hanging out. During this time I, and not to mention our daughter, might as well have been invisible to these girls. The excuse was that Jamie was depressed over the situation and needed support etc. Well, my and kaleys relationship had been a little rocky to begin with and I suspected that something was going on with them. My suspicions were confirmed when I found some comments online of Kaley referring to Jamie as her girlfriend. I confronted Kaley and she claimed that they were just joking around, and that they were not together, but did tell me that she wanted to break up. Okay. Wow, you know. It wasn't decided immediately who would move out. She was adamant that she still considered me to be her best friend and still our daughters other parent. Well, literal days later, on the fourth of July, we went swimming at the park and stayed for the fireworks. They were all over each other.  Now they were openly in a relationship. Needless to say this whole thing was very upsetting but I tried to keep my cool throughout every thing. Mainly for the sake of our daughter. I mean, if you were to ask my friends, I was being a saint when they said they would have flipped. Tbh, I think my friends thought I was being walked all over. What it really was was that I knew that I really didn't have any legal rights to my daughter, and I could not afford to piss Kaley off. Not only was I scared of losing my daughter, but I was also very worried for her. Kaley has some very serious diagnosed mental problems, and she has been very neglectful. There were years where kaley barely even spoke to our daughter. I am the one who mainly takes care of her and really the only one who plays with her, talks to her etc. I had a parenting agreement written up, and had her sign it and we took it to get notarized. I would like to do second parent adoption but I can't really afford that right now. It was decided that they would be the ones to move. They could afford it better than I, because supposedly Jamies grandparents were willing to pay the costs of moving. Well, this whole time I have been telling Kaley that we really need to sit our daughter down and explain this whole situation to her. She would always tell me that we will just not right now. I mentioned it almost on a daily basis. It occurred to me that they may have already told her all about it without involving me and thats why she keeps putting the talk off. This was confirmed when my friend and neighbor asked Jamie about the place they are getting and whether our daughter knew they would all be moving. She said yes. I was livid. I confronted Kaley and she got pissed and ended up telling me she was kicking me out and I had six days to leave. (Two days down, four to go.) That same day I texted my landlord, and told him that I wanted to add my name to the lease, which he said was fine. He has told me in the past that my mom and I both could add our names to the lease. He hasn't had a chance to come by yet, but I am hoping it's today. This may seem underhanded, but the thing is, my mom and I have been paying for the majority of the expenses for the apartment. Once my name is on the lease, I will tell her that now we can mutually come to a decision on who will be moving. A friend told me that they cannot kick us out in six days even if her name is the one on the lease. Because I have lived here so long that I have established residence. They would have to take me to court and evict me. Is this true? What should I do if my landlord does not end up coming before the six days is up?  The second thing happened two days ago. Kaley has always been very irresponsible with money, she is currently broke and has asked my mom for money to buy cigarettes etc. At this point my mom is understandably not willing to give her money, especially not for her and her new girlfriend to have cigarettes. This pisses kaley off because she goes on about how she has been letting us live here blah blah and we are all still family (even though she has not been acting like it) Well, the other night she asked my mom for some money again, which I'm pretty sure was to buy weed, but anyway she refused and kaley again got pissed and went off. The next day I took my mom's tablet, which she had been using back. She said wait I need to clear and I said that I knew how to do that. I opened the screen and a Facebook messenger conversation was on the screen. It was logged into Jamie's account. The conversation was with some person telling them that she was pissed because I hit kaley. What? She was saying that on the night she asked my mom for money afterwards, I hit her in the face. She was telling this to multiple people and even made a Facebook post about it. I immediately confronted them both together. I said, ""Kaley, did you tell Jamie that I hit you?"" She says that she didn't. But, obviously she did, that or Jamie made the whole thing up. But, I really wouldn't put it past Kaley to do this. I don't know if she's trying to get sympathy, trying to make Jamie hate me, make it appear that i was abusive so that she has an excuse to do all this to me, or just is a result of her many mental issues. I don't know. All I know is, that not only have I never laid a finger on this girl, but I have never even been in a fight before in my life. Sometimes I feel like I'm in the twilight zone honestly. They can't just spread around online that I assaulted her, can they? Isn't that a crime? To falsely accuse some one of a crime?  I'm so sorry for the long post. I would appreciate any and all advice."	No
371	My roommates and I had a few holes in the drywall in the house we rent. When the landlord discovered the holes, he told my roommates to not even bother fixing it and that he would just charge our account. We decided to fix it ourselves and the cost for the materials came out to under $50. Today we received a charge on our account for $1250 stating that that's the cost for the walls. We've had no one come to actually look at the walls to give an estimate - much less actually have someone repair the walls so it's absurd that they would have a repair cost already and especially one that high. It really just feels like our landlord is trying to take advantage of us but $1250 isn't really pocket change. What kind of recourse do we have?	No
372	The charge is for under 21 alcohol consumption in Deleware County Indiana  Successfully completed a diversion program months ago that involves community service, but not sure if it will show up on a background check for job interviews, etc.  Thank you for the advice.	No
373	My wife and I have rented a condo for the past 9 months. We are on the second floor with 1 downstairs neighbor. The neighbor has made several complaints to the HOA and has called the police prior about noise. She doesn't speak English (polish only) and will not communicate to us what is bothering her.  &amp;nbsp;  My wife and I both work 9-5 jobs. We get up at 7 and both go to bed around 11. HOA rules specify quite time as 10pm-8am. We are not loud people, we do not throw parties or do jumping jacks all day long. We have carpet, no hardwood except for tile in kitchen and bathroom. I've grown tired of this woman and i'm wondering if i have any legal ramifications since she keeps calling the police and sent her granddaughter upstairs to express she was about to call the police again today. The granddaughter did mention this was also a problem with the previous tenant which lived here for 11 years. Any input/help would be appreciated. Thank you.	No
374	"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_mealperiods.htm For reference.  The law, as I interpret it: If I don't get a lunch within the 1st 5 hours of work, they need to pay me an extra hour's worth of pay. So if I get to work at 6 AM, work until 1 PM, get a 30 minute lunch then, then keep working till 5:30, they need to pay(All numbers pre-tax):  1) 6 AM to 1 PM - 7 hours of straight pay. Say $20/hour for a total of $140   2) Nothing from 1 PM to 1:30 PM - Unpaid lunch   3) 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM - 1 hour of straight pay. Another $20/hour, total of $20   4) 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM - 3 hours of overtime @$30/hour  - Total of $90   5) Since I didn't get my lunch at the correct hour, one more hour of pay at regular time - $20    I learned about point 5 recently, and did the math - it ties out to within the dollar on pre-tax amounts if 1-4 are included, but 5 is nowhere to be seen. Am I correct in thinking that they're missing that pay?  Additional details, since so much about labor law is in the details:  1) I work for a bank   2) I'm salary non-exempt   3) I'm in an operations position   4) I don't oversee anyone   5) I'm not in the entertainment industry     Standard: If correct, the usual advice seems to be ""Go file a complaint with the labor board, be prepared for retaliation."" My current plan is this: I have a mentor who's midway up the food chain without a dog in the fight. I'd like to give the company a chance to fix it themselves. I figure I can talk with him, see if he can get a review of pay going, and hopefully everything will be fixed without needing to go to the labor board. Else, off to the labor board I go, most likely.   Is anything wrong about my reasoning? Have I made any fatal mistakes anywhere? Is my interpretation of the law incorrect? (The law in question I'm looking at is also on the break room board)  Thank you!"	No
375	"Posted from r/relationships  I've posted about this before but feel utterly stumped. Pretty short summary of everything going on, my abusive ex boyfriend has been harassing and blackmailing me. As he is currently in a different country (Australia), he's contacted me on several numbers telling me that if I don't speak to him he's going to release my personal information and a couple more intimate pictures. Ever since, I've woken up to messages from him, telling me that I've been ""exposed"" and has started to involve some mutual acquaintances. He'll claim that they've also seen my pictures because I'm whore who's passed them around. When I have enough proof that he hasn't even spoken to them, he gaslights me calling me a ""shady bitch"" or ""paranoid"", or will tell me that ""he just thought I had been exposed"".   Per r/legaladvice and many of the people on this particular subreddit, I took the advice to reach out to my local police station to file a police report. Upon discussing my issue with them however, I was told that I would not be able to do anything as police reports are for ""criminal matters"" only and I can't do anything about anything that might happen. Furthermore, I was told that ""my public information would be available online anyway"". An officer told me to try telling him that I was going to submit a report regarding his harassment which I have tried only to be told by him that, ""If something happens to him, there's going to be consequences for me"". I have also previously received other threats from him stating verbatim ""I know where you live, I'll see you soon"", ""If i want you dead, you will be. I know people in your state"", "" ""I want you dead"". I'm currently waiting for another call from the police regarding these threats, but I feel like I have no basis to take this any further. Please help"	No
376	"Background info that you need to know: My dad has physically abused me for basically my entire life, and my mom their entire marriage (has become a lot less frequent in the later years of their marriage, but he still threatens her with a raised hand. Also, she has kind of learned not to speak out against him because she understands the physical threat that he poses to her). Up until recently I just took the abuse and did nothing about it, but over the past year and a half or so I've been standing up for myself and threatening to dial 9-1-1 if he stepped closer (first time I did this was when he was threatening to beat me with a bat because i accidentally lost one of his papers -- locked the door and put the phone up to the window so he could see) and even using my own strength to stop him from hitting me - not hitting back, just using my arms to hold his down.  Also, my dad has been financially abusive his entire life. My mother works 5 days a week and makes almost as much money as he does on top of the countless hours of housework that she does and the abuse that she has to go through from him, and still she is barely ever allowed to spend money on anything for herself. Every penny she spends is policed by my dad and he goes so far as to make her return things that he does not approve of. He barely gives me any money to spend (probably has given me on average like 5 bucks every 2 months -- he hasn't even given me a birthday present or a graduation present or anything), which isn't such a big deal on its own and honestly it may seem like I'm complaining about a first-world problem and sound like a little brat but what makes it awful is that he did not allow my sisters and me to get jobs while each of us were in high school (although with some convincing I managed to get permission to get one near the end of my senior year of high school, but I couldn't find a job all throughout the summer), so basically we all wanted money to spend but he would not let us work nor would he give us money. He's even been known to take money from us that we received from other family members on special occasions, which is why we've learned to hide our money even around our own house.  Also, he makes every decision in the household for both himself and my mother and she plays a very small role in any of those decisions if any at all, even though she is a breadwinner just like he is. He threatens her with physical abuse or raises his voice at her if she doesn't comply with what he chooses to do, and eventually she just gives in like always.  I planned to move into my college dorm (university is in NJ) on the 31st of September to start my freshman year of college. The payment for my first semester costs, including tuition and housing and everything, is due on the 17th of August, and it's not small amount of money that I can pull out of nowhere in 7 days. --------------------------------------  So, over the past few months, things have been getting pretty heated between me and my dad. I don't see him much during the day, but on the occasion that I'd still be awake when he came back from work, we'd usually fight about something, and the fights have been getting more and more frequent.  Tonight, my whole family was in the car on the way back from an event, and he asks me about my roommate, and somehow, like always, one thing leads to another and we're arguing with each other again. He says to me ""Ok, well if this is how it's going to be, then we're not going to be paying for your college. You're on your own."" I told him to stop using the word ""we"" as if my mom had any choice to make in the first place -- I told him to say what he truly meant and use the word ""I"", because everyone knows it's only him that makes any big decision like that ever and speaks on behalf of both my parents. Even though my mom makes her own money, if she wanted to pay for my college fees, she wouldn't be able to because my dad would not allow her -- or at least she feels too threatened to try anything like that. We usually have this argument and it blows over in a few days, except this time I went even further and told him that he basically ruined my life and called him out for physically, mentally, and emotionally abusing me throughout my entire life and doing the same to my mother throughout their entire marriage. This got him especially upset, and as we were coming out of the car, he rushed to the back, clearly very angry, and I knew straight away what he was about to try and do, so I locked the door and punched in 9-1-1 on my phone and showed him. Eventually, I got out of the car safely, but he would not let me back in.   So yeah, after much threatening over the years, my dad had finally kicked me out of the house for the first time ever. I called up one of my friends but by the time he got to my house (about 2 hours ago) my mom told me she wanted me to come in and just say sorry to my dad, but there was no way I was going back inside there, so I just left for a little and my friend and I hungout and I planned to stay over his house for the night like he had offered, but my mom wanted me back home and had convinced my dad to let me stay, so I just went back. And now here I am, typing all of this that literally just happened and my dad's upstairs and things are extremely heated between us and this is the first time that I'm actually legitimately concerned about what's going to happen in my future after a threat from my dad, because our argument tonight actually went way beyond the level that it usually does.  I still have to get a new phone and laptop for college which my dad had promised me, so that's also a problem, because I doubt he's going to be paying for those things any time soon. I'm going to ask my mom to help me out on her own without my dad but I know it's possible she might not agree because she would not even think of going against my dad's word. As I mentioned before, the payment is due on the 17th of August and I do not think between now and then that my dad will change his mind about paying for it, and even if he does, I do not want to remain under his fiscal control like my sisters have all throughout their college years, because they go through hell whenever they want to make a decision about their lives and I don't want to put myself in that situation. I'm completely lost, I have no clue what to do. Please help.  P.S. sorry if there's a lot of useless information in here, I just wanted to put the stuff about my dad because it seemed to me like a lot of it was illegal and it might help. Also, I'm just a complete mess of emotions and my thoughts are running crazy right now."	No
377	Backstory is my girlfriend and I recently moved in together (in Colorado) in June but her lease for her last place doesn't end until August. To be able to move in with me she couldn't afford July's portion of rent which was $425 for her. Her and her ex roommate agreed both verbally and over text that she would pay June and July utilities but my girlfriend would only have to pay for June's rent.  Now July has come along and the ex roommate is demanding she pays or she will take her to court. My girlfriend talked to her old landlord and he does remember the situation but both my girlfriend and ex roommate have two different stories and he just wants to be paid. He said he has not been paid by ex roommate  yet and is willing to give an extension to my girlfriend if she needs. He just is confused by the situation and now not really sure what was agreed upon.   Does the ex roommate have a case against my GF? Does she have one if my GF does pay rent to landlord (even though wasn't decided previously) and still try and take her to court. What are the scenarios here? My GF cant afford this and is feeling screwed over but knows nothing was signed just verbal and text agreements. It is in Fort Collins CO. Any help would be appreciated	No
378	"**Scenario**  I  (car ""A"") had come to a complete stop near a busy intersection. Someone two cars up was turning which is why traffic was stopped so close to the intersection.  The car behind me (car ""B"") pulled up short. They weren't directly behind me, but I believe they were too close. The truck behind them (car ""C"") barely slowed down at all and slammed into them, totaling their car and damaging mine. I was at a complete stop for about 3 seconds before the accident.  1. My insurance is telling me that my best bet is to file through both car B &amp; C's insurances and let them fight it out. 2. Car C's insurance has told me that their policy was cancelled 7 days prior to the accident. They asked if I still wanted to make a claim and I told them I'd get back to them. 3. Car B is listed as insured via ""general insurance"", with no contact info. They do have a policy # listed (ex: ##-ST-#######).  My goal here is to get cash to cover the damage to my vehicle. Its mostly cosmetic, so will affect re-sale, but I don't otherwise care as long as it drives OK.  What is the best outcome for me to pursue here? Does having a cancelled insurance policy mean I need to pursue them civilly? Is ""general insurance"" a normal thing; it seems shady since I have no contact info or ways to file a claim against it (that I know of).  Thanks in advance!"	No

382	Good day /r/legaladvice!  I desperately seek advice in family law. My 'boy'friend had a girlfriend last year who - when he wanted to leave her - stopped taking the pill and got pregnant without telling him early on so then she couldn't have an abortion. Fast forward to today - she got the baby and he still lives extremely unhappy at her place not knowing what he should do, as this is also a financial matter for him. So to this point they are not really together anymore but he just keeps things up as they are - he has his own room in her apartment and also takes care of his baby. Now this takes place in switzerland where we have a law since this year that men don't only need to pay for the kid but also for the kid's mother even if they were not married before. Now for what she has done to him (and even more in the past) he doesn't want to pay money for her but only for his kid. Also because she works currently 60% and still earns more than he does when he works 100%. She could be completely self sustainable. Now she told him, if he leaves her for real, she will stop working just so he will have to pay her shitloads of money. He is now completely devastated and doesn't know how he wouldn't also become financially ruined by her.  Now I had this idea and I don't know if it would work and here I need your advice. I just bought an apartment and therefore I basically have a debt of 800'000$ - and as he and I anyway want to be together in case he manages to finally leave that place, I thought I could bring my 800'000$ debt into more use.  Now if I would let him join my debt, would he still have to pay her or could he get out like that? I mean he would probably not be able to get a loan after she would go after his money, but if he joins my debt before she has the chance to do so, he wouldn't be able to pay her aswell?  Or do you have any other idea what a guy could do to save himself from a corrupt girlfriend like this?  Also, what happens if he would leave, but gets at one point a new family. Will this reduce the payments to his current girlfriend because he needs more money to sustain his own family?	No
383	I'm mobile so I apologize in advance. So, after this post, things got worse.  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6fui41/tx_contractor_not_completing_work/  The contractor and crew stopped showing up completely, after a torn down deck and dock. $12,000 was paid in total. The 'contractor' kept leading my FIL on basically, saying he had an investor who was going to loan the money to him so my FIL could be paid back $9,000 plus lumber. Well, that didn't happen. He called FIL yesterday, said he sold off all his assets (truck, cell phone, handguns) and was filing bankruptcy, so FIL would get nothing if he tried to sue him. Obviously, get a lawyer, right? My FIL feels like it'll just be more expensive to get a lawyer since there's a good chance he'll never see his money again.	No
384	Hello,  I recently moved to DC for work, it was a very last minute move so I took an apartment after Skyping with the previous tenant who was moving out and trying to find his replacement.   Unfortunately when I arrived I discovered that one of the other housemates had a cat which was not not mentioned during the process. I am very allergic to cats and this was a small apartment so there is no way I could just avoid her.  I immediately e-mailed the landlord and explained the situation, and that I obviously couldn't live there. He got back to me and said if I wanted out of the apartment I could A. Find my own replacement B. Pay 3 months rent  C. Sign a new lease to another property he owns   He said that the cat being there was not his responsibility because it was clearly mentioned in the ad. However, I have a copy of the ad saved, and all my correspondence with the previous tenant and nowhere in there does it mention a cat. In fact it explicitly says that animals are not allowed for this very reason in the original ad.   My question is do I have any other options to get out of this lease?  I feel bad for the landlord's trouble and I realize that I should have been more thorough but I can't afford to pay 3 months rent and I really can't live with a cat.  Thanks	No

386	To elaborate: my parents are currently separated, and went to a mediator to settle the divorce terms rather than sue. In the meeting, my dad agreed not to touch the money in any of the joint bank accounts, but he is now saying that what he did was legal. Can he actually do this? It's a shitty thing to do, especially when my mom, sister, and I are on vacation together, and it could really hurt hurt her financially. We just moved money from her other accounts into one he can't access but we are not sure what else to do.	No
387	Hi everyone. Long story short, I moved into a new apartment complex a little less than one month ago. I have a work vehicle with commercial plates (nothing major, just a sedan) that was originally allowed to be parked in my parking spot assigned to me with the apartment. Yesterday I find out that the apartment complex just changed the rules so that no commercial vehicles can be parked in the lot (I found out as I come outside to them about to tow my car). I reached out to the main office and they said that in my lease it says that they can add an addendum at any time so I'm SOL. Do I have any recourse? I've considered just leaving but I'm worried about the legal implications as well as the effect on my credit but I'm kinda screwed if I can't park my car on the premises and there's no street parking within 2 miles.

388	Hi there, I am 14 years old, the son of recently divorced parents who have not made/filed official custody order. My dad left for a business trip this morning, and will return in three days. (I was staying with him last, obviously.)  My mom is pushing me to go to her place tonight, telling me that asking to stay here for three days is like asking for a yard when she gave me an inch. She says that I because I'm not 18, I have to follow her instructions.   Since there's no custody case, and my dad is out of town, what can I do? I have enough money to get meals for these next three days, and I want to stay at my dad's. He is okay with it, so long as I keep the house clean. If it helps at all, my mom is a pretty horrible mom, just look at my post history and you'll see. She said she's going to pick me up in an hour, so I need advice quick please!	No
389	Question on what I should encourage my in-laws to do.  My inlaws own about 50 feet into the neighbor's across the roads property.  This includes the neighbors well and they have documents indicating they have water rights to it.  Recently the neighbor offered them money to purchase this section but they declined the offer as they feel its worth more  I think they should of taken it for the following reasons.  Are these valid legal concerns  1.  Neighbor gets hurt on the 50ft strip, they are liable as it is on their property 2.  This strip has been openly viewed and used by the neighbor for around 30 years.  Could squatters rights play a part here? 3.  The strip has some overgrown trees on it, if they fall and hit the house, would my in-laws be liable for damages.  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WaMhR9V.jpg)	No
390	A little bit of information: I just bought a condo this spring, my neighbor above me is a housing inspector, so I know it's not terrible. But the buildings are in bad shape. The climate is not ideal for such stucco buildings and over the last couple years it's apparent that the winter maintenance people were over salting and rusting the stairways, discoloring walls, etc.. The buildings are 1980's stucco on frame, practically falling apart. There are floating board walks that are rotting, and walls that are cracking, holes in dry wall covered parking(fire code offense). There is just a general lack of maintenance that has this place practically falling apart.  The budget has me really shaking my head. My monthly HOA just went up 10% from $220 to $230.  I really want to post a photo of the budget, cause it seems really fishy. I will if anyone requests it.  Some examples: $500 for telephone and internet, yet that's all paid for by tenants... So why are they charging us, and for what??  $5k for pool maintenance plus $500 for chemicals and another $800 for repairs. Why would the HOA have to pay for chemicals if they are contracting out the pool maintenance?  And $14k in electrical, yet residents pay their own electricity... What the hell is that for? $29k for sewage? I don't know what I'm talking about but isn't all that paid for with Taxes?  The HOA president owns a couple condos and rents them out and his dad works for the HOA with a grounds management contract. Something just doesn't feel right here. Should I get umbrella home insurance to cover this place falling apart? What can I/should I do without pissing them off too much and going after me?	No
391	Hello! I am a landlord in NJ.   We have a rental property and our renter wants to kick out her ex-boyfriend. He is not on the lease, but she did get our permission to have him live there. He has been paying us the rent for the two of them - she has been paying him cash and he cuts us the check. My questions:  -- Can she remove him from the property?  -- Do we need to officially evict him, even though he not on the lease, or is this an agreement between the two of them with him subletting from her?   Essentially, they've broken up and she wants our help getting him out of the home she is renting from us.   Thanks for your help!	No
392	I need legal advice regarding the no contact order.  A friend got into argument with live in partner and she broke something.  He called the police and had her taken away on charge of domestic violence.  She had a no contact order put on her but she tried to see him after that to smooth things over.  However the court doesn't know that she broke the no contact order, only the live in partner.  My question is can he use knowledge and evidence of her breaking her no contact order down the road as a way to blackmail her into getting what he wants?  Thanks for your advice really appreciate it.	No
393	My girlfriend and I were wondering if in Indiana state she can transfer the deed to her house that's only in her name into my name so we can force him to stop coming over and causing trouble. Little background  State is Indiana  County is Allen  City is fort Wayne They have been separated 2 years, he's an abusive stalker with tons of money from a settlement from a death in his family.  Twice now he has put protective orders on her to get possession of the house temporarily and go through and steal our stuff.  The divorce is still a ways away as there is a lot of fighting of tons of assets.    Is it possible to put the house in my name to keep him from coming over?	No
394	"To preface, we live in Georgia in the United States. My girlfriend is 19 years old.   So my girlfriend was offered a job as a manager of a brand new store that was opening up at the beginning of July. This was the second of an already existing store in the town we live in. She was offered the manager position, $12 a hour, at least 40 hours a week, the freedom to make her own schedule, 5% of sales at the end of the year from both stores, and a bonus at the end of year.   So they hired her and no contracts were signed before or after hiring. No official papers stating what she would be doing or that she worked there at all. She starts the job during her two week notice at her previous job. They ""train"" her, which was really just teaching her how to run the register and computer system and using her for labor. She was told to find employees to run the new store that would open roughly four weeks after she started. So I help her set up an online ad for the position of part time employee and numerous (probably 30) applications came in.   She reached out to a few applicants to set up interviews only to be told it was completely up to her to hire these employees because they would be splitting her hours with her. So she decided to hire none and no interviews took place. During her time at the pre existing store she worked alone probably 80% of the time. Over 40 hours a week not by choice.   So the new store opens up. It's a good 40 minute drive to the new location for everyone involved. She's scheduled to work everyday its open for the first week. And she works there with the owners daughter. (The only employees are the owner, owners daughter, my girlfriend, and someone who was hired not long after her to cover at the pre existing location). The daughter mentioned how the other employee would not work at the new location because she ""didn't have the look for it."" The owners daughter is very rude to my girlfriend as well. Always complaining about what she did the night before and telling her she should know how to do her job. The problem with that is, she received very little training if you could even call it that. Every day she would tell me how she got in trouble and sometimes openly in front of customers.   Then comes the Fourth of July. She's running the store alone and is left a letter from the boss. The letter is two pages long front and back that states she has a learning curve and didn't train well. It also states that the boss never guaranteed 40 hours a week and that she wouldn't receive her bonus or percentage of sales. She even mentioned reducing her hours each week.   So she texts me the letter and asks her parents and we all agree she should quit the job because it was nothing what they offered her and we felt she wasn't being treated properly. We believe she was used to make the drive to the new store because the owner and her daughter had no interest in doing it daily. That's just a theory however.   So she texts the owners daughter that she quits and needs to come to the store to take over. She continued to work and help customers and make sales until the owners daughter arrived to relieve her.   She worked 8-10 hour shifts alone in busy towns. She wasn't given an opportunity to go grab food or take a break. She couldn't use the bathroom unless there were no customers, which was rare and when there weren't she had to run to make sure no one came in. She was never given any pay stubs for any of her checks and in the letter the boss stated that she guesstimates her pay and overtime pay. I correctly calculated her overtime pay and it was double what she was actually paid.   My question is: what here is illegal - if any of it is. I believe some of it may be and we're curious what we can do about it. Apparently someone heard about what happened to my girlfriend and said the same store and boss and did the exact same thing to another person previously.   Sorry for the long patchy story.   tl;dr: Girlfriend was offered a management job at a new store and was given zero management duties. She couldn't take a break to get food and eat and could rarely use the bathroom. Owner and her daughter were rude to her and told her another employee didn't have the look to work at the new store. She received zero pay stubs with checks and was underpaid for overtime hours. She also received a letter claiming she had a learning curve during training when they never properly trained her or worked with her enough to know how she was."	No
395	Am I entitled to a copy of a trust in the state of Arizona? I am a beneficiary of my grandfathers will and the trustees claim that I am not entitled to any paperwork, including the trust. Thinking of hiring an attorney if they do not provide these documents. They want me to sign a document written by a CPA (not an attorney) to relinquish my rights to question their authority, which I will not do without documentation. Thank you in advance.	No
396	Per the lease agreement I am required to cover the costs of all utilities including water/sewage. The way it works is that I get a bill in the mail (optionally an e-statement, opted out), but the payments get sent to the property manager to be deposited in my apartment's account along with rent. The bill is supposed to come from the third party that manages the place.   My first bill supposedly takes a few months, 2-3 months and not a day more according to the property manager, well it never came at all. After the 3rd month I walked into the office and talked to the property manager about why my bill hasn't showed up. She wasn't sure, so I asked if there's even a balance at all, there was. I paid what was due and was assured that this wouldn't happen again. Again after about a month I got no bill, told her still no bill, but she assured me it would come any day.   So 5 months into my lease I get a notice on my door, soaking wet, stating my account will go into collections if I don't pay the balance. Not a single bill telling me this is an issue, despite countless times being reassured that I'd get one. Now I can pay the bill and I'll probably drop the check off tomorrow as it's not due for a few more days. This, along with a few minor issues, have become very annoying.   Is there anything I can do aside from telling them to have my bills sent to me? Clearly that's not working.	No
397	I live in York County PA. Back in February I purchased a house after having a home inspection. A roof inspection was included in the inspection. Unfortunately the inspection was done while I was at work but once I got home I was given a walk around by the inspector. When it came to the roof he said it was in surprisingly good condition for its age and should last at least another 5 years. Fast forward this past Monday, we had a bad storm with hail, I went into the attic and found leaking spots. I called the claims adjuster and had him take a look. He told me the roof is totally shot and should have been replaced 5 years ago. I looked back over the inspection report and found no mention of the condition of the roof at all. Do I have any legal recourse to go back at the inspector for terrible job? Thank you	No
398	"5 years ago my step father and mother helped me get a mortgage for a farm business I started, somewhere in the purchase process it went from a Co-signer arrangement to my step father alone being the only one on the note.     However, we had an written agreement that he was just the intermediary of the property and it was a rent to own with a term of 30 years or until the mortgage was paid off.  I never pressed the issue for them to sign it as I was young and trusting, but they did make changes and return via email in the email stating ""Your mother and I are very comfortable with how this reads"".    Three years later, as agreed upon that if the first document jeopardized the good health of the business we would amend it, so I  presented a second contract that re-iterated the language in the first at that they verbally agreed and gave me enough reassurance that I proceeded with remodels and the creation of our bed and breakfast.   At this point I have spent 50k in improvements. remodels, landscaping and ect, most of which I did myself.  We are almost finished with the remodels for our bed and breakfast and were scheduled to open July 1st.    Now they are claiming that the first agreement is void due to some weird dates they defined as the term of the operating agents of the business and they are attempting an unjust eviction at the moment.   They presented a crazy lease, that tripled my rents and would have tricked me into surrendering the property and all my possessions, I refused to sign and stated my reasoning being that I cannot agree to theft.  A day later out of retaliation, they came up with the Sheriff and served what I believe to be a fraudulent ""Notice to Quit"".  In the notice they claim I must surrender all my property, and that my tenancy was only for 6 months.  (Pretty sure this is no good for them)  My question is, is their case history of promissory estoppel being upheld in a real estate transaction.  In addition, the language of our agreement stated it was to be a transfer not a sale.    I do not see how there is any way for them to pay me for the damages they have caused without selling the property (I believe they are broke and desperate).   This would additionally breach our agreement as we agreed that this land was not to be sold back to any banks.    Thanks,"	No
399	My friend had his parole transferred from another state to VA and is two months out on a 3 year parole after a lengthy prison sentence. His sister was supportive all through his sentence and offered to have him come live with her. Turns out his sister is a raging alcoholic, and her boyfriend who also live with them is an active junkie (my friend found him ODing in the kitchen one night). The sister and her bf fight nonstop keeping my buddy up all night when he has to work the next day (thankfully he found a decent job in the service industry). One night after asking them to keep it down at 4 a.m. the sister pushed my friend, hit him, and threatened to call his PO on him.  Now, the friend obviously wants out, he did not expect to be thrown into this hellhole, nor does he want to violate his parole, yet he is afraid to tell his PO the situation thinking they will throw him in a shelter (I believe the shelter here has a 10pm curfew which would cause him to lose his job). Nor does he want to live in a shelter.   I think he should just tell his PO everything, but will they actually throw him in a shelter, or are they more flexible than that. What does he do when living at the place his parole dictates can violate his parole. If anyone familiar with the system can give their best two cents that would be awesome.	No
400	I about to start process of trying to get custody of my child. I've never had a lawyer before, but I always hear they're expensive. My job has a work life program that connects you with a lawyer, gives you a free 60 minute first meeting, and then gives you 25% off their normal rate if you choose to hire them.  I've talked to a few lawyers through this program and their rates all hit around the $210-$225 range after the discount. They all request retainers.  There is one big difference between two of the lawyers. I asked them how much of a retainer will I need to get me to the point just before a court hearing... One lawyer told me $1000 and the other told me $2000.  Is $2000 too much? ...or is that common? I do understand that this can be a lengthy process and that once reaching court, it can get pretty expensive. I just want to make sure this is a fair rate.  I was originally working with the $1000 lawyer, until their communication got spotty and he didn't reply to my email. This lead me to the $2000 lawyer, who I've met with twice and seems a bit more invested in my case.  The $2000 lawyer had a few super minor qualities that raised my eye brow. We met half way a little after hours between my job and his office at a McDonald's. He was dressed in a t-shirt with a hole in it and jeans. He also took a call during our meeting. Maybe I'm reading too much into these things.   Any advice?	No
401	To provide some backstory, I moved up to Colorado a few years ago and when I did, my best friend's mother allowed me to stay at her house. I ate their food, and received some gifts from them. I did some chores, as well as assisted with a renovation of the house I leased with her son (again, my best friend). Fast forward to today, I've decided to move out and separate from my best friend for personal reasons. My move out date is August 4th and our landlord has been generous to allow us to stay past the end of lease date while we sort a few things out, presuming we pay another months rent. (no contract has been signed for this month's rent. The landlord could kick us out on the 31st and there is nothing preventing them from doing so.)   Their mother is now threatening to sue me if I do not pay my full half of the August rent, when I feel it's reasonable to leave with paying 1/3 instead. Based on what I've told you folks, does she have any reasonable course of action in a court of law?	No
402	My partner and I are divorcing in San Diego California.  We agreed to go our separate ways, divide our stuff on our own, and just end it.  I moved out and filed the paperwork, and they lawyer-ed up and are now asking for more than agreeing to.  My question is can I, as the petitioner, amend what I am asking for from the court?  There are no children together, or anything too complicated like property or large 401K's.  We make almost the same amount of money, the marriage lasted 2 years.  Just dept and assets acquired during the marrage.  I have an appointment with my own lawyer next week.	No
403	I gave my Landlord everything I had, applied to a new apartment  (got the call today that I got it) but now the Landlord is beating down my door, and I'm sure he threatened me through it a few times with coming in and ditching my stuff on the side of the road.  The pay rent or quit notice I was given is invalid, and they have not served me a Court Eviction paper, so I know what they're doing is illegal. I have reached out to a local firm to get legal back up in the situation but with the threatening and feeling terrified of leaving the apartment I am wondering if I should contact the police.	No
404	Hello, I had an apartment in Richmond, VA, with 3 other people.  We were all on the lease.  One decided to leave the state with no forewarning and another got pregnant and moved out.  after the two left, the other decided to not pay rent anymore.  I was the only one paying my quarter.  It has been 3 months now of just me paying and we have officially been evicted.  I know this will hurt my credit greatly.  I was wondering if there was anything I could do to change my credit.  Can I sue them and have my credit changed, or am I just screwed?  I have kept all my receipts from my payments, but I am not sure how to proceed.   Thank you	No
405	My landlord told me to leave the apartment by the end of the month because new renters have to move in. She has been bugging me for this month's rent since the very first week. She has came to my house unannounced on numerous occasions and even climbed over the backyard fence and opened the screen door to the dining room to see if I was home. I have been very polite to her but I am getting tired of the harassment. I told her today I did not appreciate the things she was doing.   She told me she was going to have the cops take me out of the house on the 31st. Is any of this legal? Can she tell me to get out by the end of this month without a court order? I have just started a new job and I can't afford a new place at the moment but I'll live on the streets if there is absolutely nothing I can do. I just want to know if any of this is illegal so I can do something about it and hopefully get at least 30 days from a judge.   Also, she told me at first she was personally living in the house but she keeps switching up the story and now she's saying renters will be moving in. I don't know if this is helpful.	No
406	"About two years ago my wife found out that she had an older sister from her father and an old girlfriend predating her parents marriage. She was excited to meet this older sister. Her father decided to take her out of state to meet her. Upon arival she was greeted by his ex-girlfriend of 30 years prior, who he had told my mother-in-law and wife would not be there.    During their stay they had decided to go out ""for dinner and a few drinks"" which turned out to be a swingers club.. My wife witnessed her father cheating on her mother with his ex in this sleazy place and was nearly in shock the entire time. They ended up staying longer than they had told my wife and she was very shocked the entire time and having panic attacks. She has been close to her father and neither I nor her would have ever expected this from her father, who was a seemingly cool guy before this. I have known them for 11 years.    A month after the trip back home the ex-girlfriend and older daughter moved to our same state, in the same town. The divorce ensued at nearly the same time, and then her father went to vegas with his ex and they remarried.. A shocking and tragic end to a 30-year marriage. The father continued to move in with the new/old family in the same town/same state as us.     He used my wife as an excuse to keep her mother from thinking anything fishy was happening. She has suffered greatly from this, after having been closer to her father than her mother her entire life. She has been diagnosed with anxiety disorders amongst other things and was rushed to the ER for trying to take her own life about a year ago..    He hasn't paid any child support the entire time, he didn't show up for court, they went and got him, he still didn't pay, according to my mother-in-law, for support per my underage sister-in-law. My mother-in-law got the house, he kept his truck, he gave his old truck to me before the divorce...He was also lying about how much he was getting from disability, while my mother-in-law worked two jobs to support them for nearly 10-20 years.. He remained on disability and got checks for each child and ""managed the money"" by lying about how much he actually got, and spent nearly all of it on his own personal interests. We found out he got a lot more from papers he left behind in the house..    We found online he was linked with an address out of state where his 'secret family' had stayed - it actually says it was in his name, and in the old truck he gave me we found dozens of reciepts spanning years for possibly rent for his secret families apartment(money orders to the same out of state town of his secret family). He also didn't give me the title to the truck, just a bill of sale saying he sold it to me for one dollar, and my mother-in-laws dad was the previous owner.. I don't think I have a way to get the title, but that's for another question..    He seriously messed up his whole family emotionally, and the older daughter is a crack head whore prescribed adderall and xanax bars, and tried to bribe me with drugs to sleep with her.. That's when my wife ended her relationship with her, while she was still visiting her dad after the divorce.. Her dad also supposedly has a painting that my wife made when she was 9 years old that was very sentimental to her, and some other personal posessions..    My mother-in-laws lawyer has cut off contact with her for whatever reason.. My wifes dad has done a lot of work for the state and city politicians here, like manual handyman stuff, and supposedly he has some kind of dirt on the lawyer.. I reccomended getting another lawyer, I'm just tired of all the drama and would like for her to get her stuff back and for him to pay child support.."	No
407	"TLDR; Can I recover a portion of my ""lease termination fee"" (equivalent to 2 months rent) through small claims court, if my landlord fills my apartment within those two months?   Background: My wife and I purchased a new home with 4 months remaining on our apartment lease. We asked for leniency, offered a fair deal (full month of rent + security deposit), etc. but were ultimately shot down by our apartment manager.  The two options presented were:  1) Pay a two month lease termination fee.  2) Prepay the remaining lease (4 months), then be reimbursed any amount once a new tenant was found.   We put in a 30 day notice in mid June and received our monthly rent bill for July 1 through our move out date. Moved out of the apartment in mid July without issue. Today received a final bill, which included regular cleaning fees and the lease termination fee. We weren't ever given the chance to select option 1 or 2, I think he just went with the cheapest out of pocket route. I'm wondering if we should just tell them to bill us for the 4 months instead of the two month ""fee""? It's more out of pocket, but we would be reimbursed later.   The apartment is in a very desirable location (&lt;1 mile from the beach) and is a relatively good deal in terms of other options in the area. Our now vacant apartment is the only one available in the 70 unit complex. I don't think there will be issues renting the place and the manager is telling people it'd be available as soon as 7/24 (seems like he's trying to get someone in ASAP).   I know in California that the lessor can't collect double rent. I'm worried that since it is stated as ""Termination Fee"" that we wouldn't be able to collect anything in small claims court if they were to have someone move in on say Aug 1.  Any help is greatly appreciated."	No
408	I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.  First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying. I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.  I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.  As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.  Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.  **TL;DR, sick, boss doesn't believe me, what do?**	No
409	"Specific location is Santa Monica, which has incredibly tight rent control and thus tenant rights. I've been in contact with the city attorney's office and the rent control board but all they can tell me is to file a complaint with them and see where it goes.   I am also already seeking counsel but am unsure what I can justify paying for a relatively small issue.   It is a three bedroom unit with three of us residing. One of my roommates and I have been in the complex since January in a 2br and switched to a 3br in March. The girl who joined us has been seeing a therapist for a while and was prescribed an emotional support animal. She chose a wonderful Doberman named Athena who moved in with us a little over a month ago. Due to her prescribed disability and an aggressive confrontation by the landlord (he attempted to enter the unit when he found out, then yelled at my roommate and threatened eviction) she was unable to communicate with them about Athena so I became the go between.   The courtyard of our building has three cabinets under the staircases. When I moved in one was in use by a tenant (locked) and the other two were abandoned, stuffed full of junk. I started cleaning out the two abandoned ones. I found files in them which indicate they had been in use by tenants for at least 20 years.   The tenant using the third cabinet moved out and relinquished it to me as I was moving into his unit (the 2 -&gt; 3br switch). At this point it was March and I had locks on all three cabinets. It had been a lot of work to empty and clean them - even the one I inherited had been essentially abandoned, he told me to keep or toss what he had left (which was all junk).   I didn't want to be greedy and started offering cabinets to my neighbors. None of them took me up on it, except for one lady who liked to maintain plants in the courtyard. Once I convinced her I really did want her to have it she put her gardening stuff in there. Soon after one of my other neighbors who I share a garage with realized she wanted some space, and one of the other neighbors put a little in there. I gave the remaining cabinet to my roommates and kept one for myself.   The cabinet I gave to my neighbors had a faulty hinge (old, rusting off) and the latch couldn't set unless you really struggled to lift it. I put in the time, materials and work to replace the door and hinges. Theirs and my roommates could only use a padlock (door is just a plywood sheet), I drilled out mine (proper door) and installed a deadbolt.   Yesterday my landlord left a note on the courtyard gate saying to vacate the cabinets. I called this morning and they seemed surprised to find out that other units besides mine used the cabinets. While I was listing who used which cabinet he said that I ""went into that one with the deadbolt a lot"" - clearly, they thought taking these away would hurt me. When I asked why they needed them back the property manager said to ask the property owner. When I asked the property owner they said to ask the manager. When I pressed them they said the common area was theirs and maintenance might need it. However I had already asked the maintenance guys and they said they had no knowledge or need of it. Plus, they've been in tenant use for at least 20 years.   So my landlord is trying to take away these cabinets because of the emotional support animal. What can I do?"	No
410	My contract ends on August 7th and on July 2nd, my landlord asked me whether I want to sign another contract or move out. I said I cannot decide just yet and we did not talk for one week. Last night (July 9th), he suddenly told me I have one day to make up my mind, if I don't respond today, he's going to assume that I will move out and my contract will not be renewed. His argument is it takes just as much time for him to get a new tenant as it takes for me to find a new house (which is utterly bs because his house is 1km away from the uni). How come I only get 1 week to find a new house and he gets a whole month to find a new tenant? Any legal document that can help me win this case?	No
411	So here's the deal, I was dead set on going to an event in the UK at the end of July, now I can't go for several reasons, both economical as well as the fact that I'll be going to a marriage.   I haven't ordered a flight yet, but I did book and pay for a hotel months ago and it was non-refundable, I'm not sure whether or not I should reach out to the hotel and ask for a refund since it's still weeks left and last year, all hotels were pretty much booked full and they can probably still get it back, but in case of a policy against such things, am I doing anything legally wrong if I were to do a chargeback via the bank? The card I paid with isn't eligible any longer also.	No
412	I'm a university student who will be living off-campus for the first time; I am signing a lease for an apartment with some of my friends (we are all going to be on separate leases, just living in the same apartment). I have looked through the lease pretty carefully and I'm pretty content with all the terms. I have not heard anything bad about the management from friends who have previously lived in the complex, so I am not worried that they will try to screw me over at all.  I am just coming here looking for advice on what to expect, what my rights as a tenant are, and whether there is anything specific I should do before signing and moving in. Thanks!  Location is Indiana.	No
413	I'm not sure this is the right sub, but someone told me I need a civil attorney, and the ones I've called about my issue have told me they don't handle this kind of thing. Not sure where to go.  So, in January I went on terminal/ transition leave (a period of vacation time accrued during your enlistment and used at the end of your contract to help your transition from active duty to civilian life). During this time you are still technically in the military and therefore covered by Tricare (the military's health insurance). I planned to start my new civilian job during my leave specifically so my health insurance would overlap and I wouldn't be left without.  I had just moved to my new location and was unexpectedly rushed to the ER, because of inadequate care previously provided to me at the military hospital I was stationed at. An improperly placed IUD that caused massive amounts of bleeding and needed to be removed. My primary military hospital denied the claim to Tricare (even though they were the ones who fucked up), leaving me with a $3,000 medical bill. I tried calling my primary care provider multiple times to get this fixed, I tried looking for a Tricare representative at the hospital and was told there wasn't one. I was even lied to at one point, told the necessary paperwork was sent in- only to follow up with Tricare for them to tell me they hadn't received a damn thing.  Conveniently everyone's voicemail box is full or they're not answering. Been given the runaround over and over again. Emails and promises gone unanswered, calls not returned, and no one of any use that I have talked to. I have been trying for five months in between my 10 hour work days and with the difficulty of a 3 hour time difference. I finally had to pay the damn bill, so now I'm in debt.  This is a breach of contract. I signed with the knowledge that I would have health insurance until I got out of the military. I feel like I've been taken advantage of; since I was so close to getting out, they probably figured there wasn't anything I could do about it. If you have ANY advice, I would greatly appreciate it.	No
414	I recently purchased a property and there is a community driveway for the  houses next to my property and the neighbors told me that my backyard was also once apart another  community driveway for the other three plots. It is no longer a community driveway because the owner next to the entrance of my community driveway blocked access for my next door neighbor and me. Is there any way I can verify that there was a community driveway there before and bring legal action to rebuild the community driveway? Thank you for your time.	No
415	"Backstory: I ""sponsor"" a family of Syrian refugees who live in my area. Basically my husband and I have become friends with them and help them them out with adjusting to life in the U.S.   Recently while translating their mail I noticed that their water bill is unusually high. They are six people in a 2-bedroom apartment but their bill is $100/month. That is more than I pay for a 3-bed, 3-bath house with a yard. I tried calling the company listed on the bill, PC Water Co, and it was just some woman's voicemail. She never returned my messages. I asked the property manager about the rate and they said they charge $25/person with a maximum payment of $100/month. The units aren't individually metered, to my knowledge; everyone pays this flat rate, and the property management company turns around and pays the utility. It seems that PC Water Co isn't a real company-- it's just the billing arm of the property management company.  I'm pretty sure this policy is stated in the lease, but it feels unethical. And if the property management company is profiting off its tenants, isn't that illegal?   Several of the other people in my sponsor-family group have noticed this issue and we want to do something about it. It strikes me as a ""poor tax"" that is exploiting these people who don't even understand their bills. Do we have any options?"	No
416	Just recently transferred a car from my dad to me and they copied my address down wrong and my new title should be 2700 my street address but it is 2706 my street address. Does this really matter, and if so are they going to try and charge me for their mistake?   Don't know if it makes a difference but the address they put on it does not technically exist.	No
417	An officer came to my home to speak to me after I specifically told him on the phone that I wanted to speak to him the following day instead of the day that he called me. When we spoke he asked me a broad question to which I replied yes. He took that as an admission of guilt and said I was guilty to everything. Now a police report is going to be filed. Everything was in person, I never wrote a statement and there is no real solid evidence against me besides that I'm a suspect. This is about a texting harassment case.  Basically my question is what will be in this police report? Will he say I'm guilty even though I answered a broad question?  Montgomery County-MD	No
418	Edit: Please read the entire thing before passing judgement  Hello, yesterday I was arrested for child endangerment because I took the keys out of the vehicle so we could stop arguing and to make sure I didn't go to jail for domestic abuse. (I was really pissed, it's a long story) yes, it was hot, but my wife was in the vehicle supervising my son. There was no harm to my son, this all happened in 5 minutes give or take. I got back in the vehicle, and offered her the keys, she told me to get out, so I got back out, and was then arrested for child endangerment. I looked at what the statutes are and my son was never unsupervised, and wasn't hurt in any way. (Less than 5 minutes in a vehicle, the AC had been going for a while, and at any time my wife could have taken my son out of the car) and I'm curious why I was arrested?	No
419	So, I met these guys my first year of college and we got along great and decided to room together the following year. We've had the typical roommate troubles, nothing too major. However, this Summer, I moved back with my parents to work a better paying job for a few months. Well, it turns out that neither of my roommates ever had anyone co-sign for them and my dad is still the only co-signer. I had still been paying my share of all the bills at this point.  Now, I have found out that they were given a 60-day notice to vacate because they did not inform the apartment complex of their intentions to stay. I had already made it very clear to all parties that I was finding my own place. Well, they needed all 3 of our signatures on the piece of paper in order for it to be valid. I was not at that apartment during this time (I have the time cards from work to prove it), so, they did what any sensible adult would do and forged my signature. Upon inspecting the notice when we were packing the rest of my stuff, I told my parents it wasn't my signature and it is VERY clearly not. We compared it to the lease and they are ENTIRELY different. We have not said anything about it to the apartment complex yet.  My roommates have since gotten another co-signer, but are not cooperating in signing the final lease when I asked about it. They don't know that we have seen the notice to vacate. So I guess my question is, what should I do with the forged signature? I'd rather not go to court, but I'm very sick of being dragged around by them about rent and electricity and if they never sign the paper, my dad (me) would be responsible for paying for any damage done to the apartment. Im sorry for poor formatting, I'm still quite heated. I can answer any questions if needed. Thanks in advance	No
420	"I was arrested approx. 12 months ago due to DUI. However, I blew barely above the legal limit, and only failed the field sobriety test because it was extremely cold outside and I was shivering, something the officer noted in the police report. On my court date, the cold, along with discovery that the breathalyzer was far past calibration date resulted in the DUI being dropped and I received a ""Failure to Reduce Speed"" charge. As my lawyer explained it, this was very good because usually if the DUI gets dropped, which is rare, you receive a Reckless Driving. Regardless, my license was suspended due to the DMV being a separate entity as I understand it. My question now is, I've now graduated college and am applying for serious jobs that inquire about previous arrests and such. Is there a particular way to go about explaining what happened? I will definitely seek legal advice in person ASAP, was just curious what Reddit would advise. Thanks!"	No
421	I requested to use my PTO and sick days instead of short term disability or FMLA after I give birth in a month because I will need to take FMLA later in the year when I will have no family help and therefore need to be at home.  My employer says they have never had this type of request before (taking PTO instead of FMLA) and that they will dock my vacation days since I do not want to take FMLA at this time.  Is this OK to do? I know they can't legally dock my sick time as per NY law you are required to provide 40 hours of sick time but is it OK for them to dock the vacation time they provided me as well?  Seems weird.  My husband is taking parental leave from his company and he gets to take his full PTO (his is accrued). My PTO is not accrued, I get it the first day of the year.	No
422	My wife and I rent an apartment with central air.  The unit wasn't working correctly last week and we had to ask the property manager several times to get someone out there to take a look at it.  The technician came out, looked at it, and said that it needed to be replaced.  The property manager brought out a window air conditioner that we can use.  It cools the living room, but the bedrooms are still very hot.   We asked when the air conditioner was going to be replaced.  It's mid-July and we are under a heat advisory.  He told us that he was going to bring us a better window unit this week.  We asked him again when the air was going to get fixed.  He got snapping with us and said it would be fixed eventually.   Is there anything that we can do to get a new air conditioner?  Should we contact the city?     We signed a twelve month lease last year.  That ends next month and then we go month to month.  We are talking about moving out, but we also don't want to deal with that hassle.  We don't want to move our son to a different school.	No

424	"My roommates and I are in a complex that allowed us to each separately lease out a room with them and the original version of the lease under the old owners was very reasonable as far as rules on what was allowed, and when they would enter our apartment and such. The new owners are trying to force out a new lease with some odd, and in my opinion overstepping rules. The new lease includes things such as:  -they can enter and search the apartment and our rooms whenever they please without prior notice   -monthly ""cleanliness"" inspections that don't require a notice  -no tobacco/alcohol/drugs of any kind on apartment property unless prescribed  -must register all non culinary weapons with them to receive written consent to keep them on property(even things like airsoft guns, and pocket knives)  -no using the only storage space we were provided to store personal belongings (it's just a water heater closet, but its like 8ftx5ft so that's a lot of space for us since its a small apartment)  -and they have included huge ""fees"" for every infraction (example: if they find beer cans in our place it would be $200 flat fee + $50 for each can).  Now I wouldn't be bothered by the new lease because they have to honor my original, however a roommate signed a new version (and again, we each have our own individual leases with the complex). So since one of us is on the newer lease that gives up the right to a 48 hour notice upon entry, among their other new rules, which lease has priority so to say? Can they just enter our unit without notice since one of us has a lease saying so, but the others require 48hrs.? Can they fine all of us the new fees for infractions that are only part of the new lease most of us didn't sign? And if they do end up using the fact that one of us signed a new lease to ignore our old leases is that allowed? Sorry for the wall of text but the situation is confusing (hopefully just for me) and I just want to know what rights I retain and can defend if they try to start enforcing stuff I never signed on or agreed to."	No
425	**Background**  Hi, I live in California. I have a month to month rental agreement in a rental unit and I pay my landlord every 1st of the month.   I gave the landlord a 30 day notice on July,24th and I will be moving out on August,14th    **Question**  Am I supposed to pay the rent for only the 14 days of August or am I supposed to pay the rent for the whole month of August?	No
426	Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my personal account.   Tonight, I was pulled over for speeding and just given a verbal warning. I was incredibly freaked out and didn't ask the officer any of my questions when he asked if I had any, so now I really need a little peace of mind.   What are the consequences of a verbal warning? Is it possible to receive a ticket after the fact, like the officer changes his mind and decides I should have been ticketed? Does anyone have to find out about this verbal warning (future employers, insurance company, parents)? How will my driving record be affected (I've never been pulled over before)?   Sorry for all the questions that probably seem obvious, I've been trying to do a ton of research but I'm having a hard time figuring out a solid answer. I saw a post on this sub from 2 years ago that someone was pulled over, issued a verbal warning, then got a ticket in the mail later, which has me all kinds of worried.	No
427	https://np.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/6ntlaw/manager_assigned_a_second_rep/  I'm unsure what to do, the client didn't buy anything anyways. This manager came in from corporate because she's the best in the company. All the managers are telling me that its all about making money, I kind of feel uneasy about it.	No
428	How bad of legal penalties would I face if I changed the locks and didn't let my partner back in the house? We are both on the lease but he is abusive and I'm afraid of him, and I am totally fine with paying him back his half of the security deposit and all of his stuff. But I need time, at least for the money part. I'd have to find another tenant to take his room, charge them the larger portion of the rent, and contribute the difference to him as a monthly payment. I'm willing to do this but I don't know if I have any way that I can, legally.  I can't say where I am, as I don't want him to find out about this post. USA though.	No
429	I got a ticket a month back for not stopping at a stop sign and driving 1-10 mph over the speed limit. I did not commit either of these. The information on the ticket in wrong. Although my licence information is correct, the police wrote down the wrong year, make, model, and license plate of the car. I went to court to fight the ticket but the police officer did not show up so the judge dismissed the ticket. I did not disclose to the court or police department that the ticket contained the wrong information. I received a letter in the mail saying the officer that did not show up to the informal hearing in front of the magistrate is appealing the ruling and that I am required to come to a formal hearing in front of a judge. What are the chances that the judge will rule in my favor? Does the fact that the ticket was originally dismissed influence the decision of the judge? What should I look out for during the formal hearing? I will hire a lawyer tomorrow.	No
430	Is there any way I can get my money back? 2 days have gone by and this guy hasn't done **ANY** work to my car. I'm [pretty sure](https://imgur.com/a/QCVc8) he has ran off with my money... What can I do to recover my money?	No
431	I'm in Amarillo, TX. I paid my rent online an hour after midnight on the third. The deadline is the third, so I was technically late by an hour. The total fees are $100, and the letter I received on my door yesterday says I have to pay with a cashier's check or face further penalties, and my lock will be changed. My rent is $620. Is this fee excessive? I was given the notice Friday. Can they continue to charge penalties until I can pay the fee on Monday? Do I have any recourse? Thanks in advance for any help.	No
