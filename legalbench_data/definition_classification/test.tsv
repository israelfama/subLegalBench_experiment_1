See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 132 (1986) (defining an “assignee” as “one to whom a right or property is legally transferred”); Black's Law Dictionary 118-119 (6th ed. 1990) (defining an “assignee” as “[a] person to whom an assignment is made” and an “assignment” as “[t]he act of transferring to another all or part of one's property, interest, or rights”); cf. 26 CFR § 301.6036-1(a)(3) (1991) (defining an “assignee for the benefit of ... creditors” as any person who takes possession of and liquidates property of a debtor for distribution to creditors). 	Yes

2	A prisoner's voluntary decision to deliver property for transfer to another facility, for example, bears a greater similarity to a “bailment”—the delivery of personal property after being held by the prison in trust, see American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 134—than to a “detention.”	Yes
3	Publishing by outcry, in the market-place and streets of towns, as suggested by Chitty, has, we apprehend, fallen into disuse in England. It is certainly unknown in this country.

4	In Bouvier's Law Dictionary, (1 Bouv. Law Dict. p. 581,) ‘hearing’ is thus defined: ‘The examination of a prisoner charged with a crime or misdemeanor, and of the witnesses for the accuser.’ In 9 Amer. & Eng. Enc. Law, p. 324, it is said to be ‘the preliminary examination of a prisoner charged with a crime, and of witnesses for the prosecution and defense.’ See, also, Whart. Crim. Pl. & Pr. § 70.	Yes
5	The Court's references to “process” in Utah & Northern R. Co. and Kagama, and the Court's concern in Kagama over possible federal encroachment on state prerogatives, suggest state authority to issue search warrants in cases such as the one before us. (“Process” is defined as “any means used by a court to acquire or exercise its jurisdiction over a person or over specific property,” Black's Law Dictionary 1084 (5th ed.1979), and is equated in criminal cases with a warrant, id., at 1085.) 	Yes
6	The documents at issue here, while denominated by Massachusetts law “certificates,” are quite plainly affidavits: “declaration [s] of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths.” Black's Law Dictionary 62 (8th ed.2004). They are incontrovertibly a “ ‘solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.’ ” Crawford, supra, at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)).	Yes
7	Just as the words “person entitled to recovery” suggest greater breadth than “individual [who has sustained] actual damages,” so the term “recovery” ordinarily encompasses more than “ ‘get[ting] or win[ning] back,’ ” Brief for Respondent 26 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1898 (1966)). 	Yes
8	"""Indeed, this administrative use of the phrase fits well with the word 'expiration,' which in its most natural sense in this context refers to the close of a formal accounting period."" Barber v. Thomas, 560 U.S. 474, 497, 130 S.Ct. 2499, 2514 (2010) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). "	Yes

Bouvier, Law Dictionary 392 (1839) (defining the term to mean the “costs which are generally allowed to the successful party”); id., at 244 (excluding from the definition of “costs” the “extraordinary fees [a party] may have paid counsel”).

16	Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word “appropriate” is inherently context dependent. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining “appropriate” as “specially suitable: FIT, PROPER”). The context here—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests, if anything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or “proper.” 	Yes

22	 The relief sought here is properly termed a “stay” because it suspends the effect of the removal order.	Yes
23	One commentator has explained that “the derivative suit may be viewed as the consolidation in equity of, on the one hand, a suit by the shareholder against the directors in their official capacity, seeking an affirmative order that they sue the alleged wrongdoers, and, on the other, a suit by the corporation against these wrongdoers.” Note, Demand on Directors and Shareholders as a Prerequisite to a Derivative Suit, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 746, 748 (1960).

27	We turn to the phrases “keep arms” and “bear arms.” Johnson defined “keep” as, most relevantly, “[t]o retain; not to lose,” and “[t]o have in custody.” Johnson 1095. Webster defined it as “[t]o hold; to retain in one's power or possession.” No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of “keep Arms.” Thus, the most natural reading of “keep Arms” in the Second Amendment is to “have weapons.”	Yes
28	"""As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 1402, the word 'administrative' is more capacious, potentially reaching not only federal, state, and local government sources but also disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979)"" "	Yes

35	On definitions, “carry” in legal formulations could mean, inter alia, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be infectious, or wear or bear on one's person.	Yes
36	The argument made in this connection by the railway company would confine the term ‘mineral lands' to lands bearing gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper, which would exclude all other metalliferous lands, such as contain iron, lead, tin, nickel, platinum, aluminum, etc.,-a limitation wholly inconsistent with the use of the word ‘mineral’ in the 1st section.	Yes
37	The first was presentment, which, like an indictment, was a grand jury's formal accusation “of an offence, inquirable in the Court where it [was] presented.” 5 G. Jacob, The Law–Dictionary 278–279 (1811).	Yes
38	‘Business' is a very comprehensive term and embraces everything about which a person can be employed. Black's Law Dict. 158, citing People ex rel. Hoyt v. Tax Comrs. 23 N. Y. 242, 244. ‘That which occupies the time, attention, and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or profit.’ 1 Bouvier's Law Dict. p. 273.	Yes
39	The argument that the term “employed,” as used in § 701(f), is commonly used to mean “[p]erforming work under an employer-employee relationship,” Black's Law Dictionary 525 (6th ed.1990), begs the question by implicitly reading the word “employed” to mean “is employed.” But the word “employed” is not so limited in its possible meanings, and could just as easily be read to mean “was employed.”	Yes

50	Likewise, “violence” implies force, including an “unjust or unwarranted use of force.” Black's Law Dictionary, at 1564; accord, Random House Dictionary, at 2124 (“rough or injurious physical force, action, or treatment,” or “an unjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power, as against rights or laws”).	Yes
51	"Had Congress wanted to toll supervised release during pretrial confinement, it could have chosen an alternative to the word 'imprisoned' that more readily conveys that intent, such as 'confined' or 'detained.' See Black's Law Dictionary 362 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “confinement” as “the quality, state, or condition of being imprisoned or restrained”); id., at 543 (defining “detention” as “[t]he act or an instance of holding a person in custody; confinement or compulsory delay"").""

91	One of its “principal tools,” ibid., is a levy, which is a “legally sanctioned seizure and sale of property,” Black's Law Dictionary 926 (8th ed.2004); see also § 6331(b) (“The term ‘levy’ as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means”).	Yes
92	A copyright, as the term imports, involves the right of publication and reproduction of works of art or literature. A copyright, as defined by Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawles's edition … is the exclusive privilege, secured according to certain legal forms, of printing, or otherwise multiplying, publishing, and vending copies of certain literary or artistic productions	Yes
93	"""We normally characterize this interpretive maxim as a presumption in favor of “scienter,” by which we mean a presumption that criminal statutes require the degree of knowledge sufficient to “mak[e] a person legally responsible for the consequences of his or her act or omission.” Black's Law Dictionary 1547 (10th ed. 2014)."" "	Yes
94	A “matter” is “a subject under consideration, esp. involving a dispute or litigation” or “[s]omething *580 that is to be tried or proved; an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.” Black's Law Dictionary 992 (7th ed. 1999); The Oxford English Dictionary 481 (2d ed. 1989) (“matter” means “[a]n event, circumstance, fact, question, state or course of things, etc., which is or may be an object of consideration or practical concern; a subject, an affair, a business”); seeante, at 1775 – 1776 (embracing this view). 	Yes
95	The term ‘privies' is not confined to persons interested in real estate (3 Tomlin, Law Dict. 218; 2 Bouv. 382), nor is it true that only the same parties, eo nomine, are bound by a judgment.	Yes
96	"""The word 'under' can mean [i]n accordance with. 18 Oxford English Dictionary 950 (2d ed.1989). See also Black's Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed. 1990) ('according to')."""	Yes
97	"""'Discharge' can be used to signify various means of extinguishing a legal duty. See generally Black's Law Dictionary 463 (6th ed. 1990)"" "	Yes
98	The Court's use of the label “nontestimonial” is meaningful, for “[t]estimony properly means only such evidence as is delivered by a witness . . . , (either orally or in the form of affidavits or depositions.” Black's Law Dictionary 1324 (5th ed. 1979). Testimony is a statement of knowledge or belief by a witness as opposed to the mere display of a physical characteristic.	Yes
99	At the time of the founding, as now, to “bear” meant to “carry.” See Johnson 161; Webster; T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1796); 2 Oxford English Dictionary 20 (2d ed.1989) (hereinafter Oxford). When used with “arms,” however, the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for a particular purpose—confrontation.	Yes
100	And ordinarily “trafficking” means some sort of commercial dealing. See Black's Law Dictionary 1534 (8th ed.2004) (defining *54 to “traffic” as to “trade or deal in (goods, esp. illicit drugs or other contraband)”)	Yes
101	Jail is a “local government's detention center where persons awaiting trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.” Black's Law Dictionary 910 (9th ed. 2009).	Yes
102	These legal terms of art refer to formal procedures by which one person gains a degree of control over property otherwise subject to the control of another, and generally involve some form of judicial authorization. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 123 (7th ed.1999) (defining “provisional attachment” as a “prejudgment attachment in which the debtor's property is seized so that if the creditor ultimately prevails, the creditor will be assured of recovering on the judgment .... 	Yes
103	At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black's Law Dictionary defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substantial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a complainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or injury” and as “[s]ynonymous with ‘compensatory damages.’ ” Black's Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed.1968) (hereinafter Black's).	Yes
104	"""…one might look to contemporaneous dictionaries, which defined “levy” as the legislative function of laying or imposing a tax and the executive functions of assessing, recording, and collecting the amount a taxpayer owes. See Black's Law Dictionary 1093 (3d ed. 1933)"""	Yes
105	Similarly, a “law-enforcement *583 agency” is charged with “the apprehension of alleged offenders as well as crime detection and prevention.” R. De Sol, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis added).	Yes
106	"""The ordinary meaning of 'notwithstanding' is 'in spite of,' or 'without prevention or obstruction from or by.'"" (then cites to both Ordinary and Legal D)  "	Yes
107	It has aptly been said that “good faith” “ ‘is an elusive idea, taking on different meanings and emphases as we move from one context to another.’ ” Black's Law Dictionary 836 (11th ed. 2019).	Yes
108	The ordinary meaning of these words is a broad one—“to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with,” Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)—and the words thus express a broad pre-emptive purpose. 	Yes
109	The term “political gerrymander” has been defined as “[t]he practice of dividing a geographical area into electoral districts, often of highly irregular shape, to give one political party an unfair advantage by diluting the opposition's voting strength.” Black's Law Dictionary 696 (7th ed.1999).	Yes
110	To “incur,” one *must “ suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).” Black's Law Dictionary 836 (9th ed.2009); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1146 (1976) ( “to ... become liable or subject to: bring down upon oneself”); Random House Dictionary 722 (1966) (“to become liable or subject to through one's own action; bring upon oneself”).	Yes
111	Thus, the employer has an “interest ... conflicting with that of the beneficiaries,” the type of conflict that judges must take into account when they review the discretionary acts of a trustee of a common-law trust. Restatement § 187, Comment d; see also Firestone, supra, at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948 (citing that Restatement comment); cf. Black's Law Dictionary 319 (8th ed.2004) (“[C]onflict of interest” is a “real or seeming incompatibility between one's private interests and one's public or fiduciary duties”). 	Yes
112	Ordinarily, “tolled,” in the context of a time prescription like § 1367(d), means that the limitations period is suspended (stops running) while the claim is sub judice elsewhere, then starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off. See Black's Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (“toll,” when paired with the grammatical object “statute of limitations,” means “to suspend or stop temporarily”). 	Yes
113	Though “shall” generally means “must,” legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, “shall” to mean “should,” “will,” or even “may.” See D. Mellinkoff, Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage 402–403 (1992) (“shall” and “may” are “frequently treated as synonyms” and their meaning depends on context); B. Garner, Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 939 (2d ed. 1995) (“[C]ourts in virtually every English-speaking jurisdiction have held—by necessity—that shall means may in some contexts, and vice versa.”). 	Yes
114	[Black's Law Dictionary] reads as follows: “False making. An essential element of forgery, where material alteration is not involved. Term has reference to manner in which writing is made or executed rather than to its substance or effect. A falsely made instrument is one that is fictitious, not genuine, or in some material particular something other than it purports to be and without regard to truth or falsity of facts stated therein.” Black's Law Dictionary 602 (6th ed. 1990). 	Yes
115	"""The Act's use of the phrase 'falsely represents,' moreover, connotes a knowledge requirement. See Black's Law Dictionary 1022 (8th ed.2004)"" "	Yes
116	The defense of laches “requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense.” Costello v. United States, 365 U.S. 265, 282, 81 S.Ct. 534, 543, 5 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961); see also Black's Law Dictionary 875 (6th ed. 1990) (“ ‘Doctrine of laches,’ is based upon maxim that equity aids the vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights. It is defined as neglect to assert a right or claim which, taken together with lapse of time and other circumstances causing prejudice to the adverse party, operates as bar in court of equity”). 	Yes
117	The ordinary meaning of “interest” surely encompasses a right to profits or proceeds. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1178 (1976), broadly defining “interest,” among other things, as a “good,” “benefit,” or “profit.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1979) defines interest to include “profit,” “welfare,” or “benefit.” Black's Law Dictionary 729 (5th ed., 1979) provides a significant definition of “interest”: “The most general term that can be employed to denote a right, claim, title or legal share in something.” It is thus apparent that the term “interest” comprehends all forms of real and personal property, including profits and proceeds.	Yes
118	Black's Law Dictionary 910 (7th ed.1999) (defining “legislate” as “[t]o make or enact laws”).	Yes
119	As a verb, “conduct” means to lead, run, manage, or direct. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 474 (1976).	Yes
120	Moreover, the word “efficient,” which was defined as “characterized by effective activity,” may have been intended to require an effective remedy. See Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 819 (2d ed. 1934).	Yes
121	The common-law defense at issue in this case derives from the Latin, in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis: “In a case of equal or mutual fault ... the position of the [defending] party ... is the better one.”	Yes
122	"""Valuable entitlements like these are 'property' as that term ordinarily is employed… ; Black's Law Dictionary 1382 (4th ed.1951) (defining 'property' as 'extend[ing] to every species of valuable right and interest')"	Yes
123	Of’ is a word of many meanings, one of which indicates ‘the thing or person whence anything originates, comes, is acquired or sought.’ 7 Oxford English Dictionary (definition III).	Yes
124	In the generic sense of the term, the “common law” has been defined as: “‘the body of those principles and rules of action relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts recognizing, affirming and enforcing such usages and customs; and, in this sense, particularly the ancient unwritten law of England.’” Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Call Pub. Co., 181 U.S. 92, 102, 21 S.Ct. 561, 564, 45 L.Ed. 765 (1901) (citing Black's Law Dictionary).	Yes
125	"""In support of this proposition, the Secretary points out that the '[t]erm [action] in its usual legal sense means a suit brought in a court; a formal complaint within the jurisdiction of a court of law.'"" "	Yes
126	“The market value of ... a  piece of property is the price which it might be expected to bring if offered for sale in a fair market; not the price which might be obtained on a sale at public auction or a sale forced by the necessities of the owner, but such a price as would be fixed by negotiation and mutual agreement, after ample time to find a purchaser, as between a vendor who is willing (but not compelled) to sell and a purchaser who desires to buy but is not compelled to take the particular ... piece of property.” Black's Law Dictionary 971 (6th ed. 1990).	Yes
127	The phrase, “real party in interest,” is a term of art utilized in federal law to refer to an actor with a substantive right whose interests may be represented in litigation by *935 another. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a); see also Cts.Crim.App. Rule Prac. & Proc. 20(b), 44 M.J. LXXII (1996) (“When an accused has not been named as a party, the accused ... shall be designated as the real party in interest”); Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at 1154 (defining a “real party in interest” as “[a] person entitled under the substantive law to enforce the right sued upon and who generally ... benefits from the action's final outcome”). 	Yes
128	“Restrain,” standing alone, can have several meanings. One is the broad meaning given by the Court of Appeals, *13 which captures orders that merely inhibit acts of “assessment, levy and collection.” See Black's 1548. Another, narrower meaning, however, is “[t]o prohibit from action; to put compulsion upon ... to enjoin,” ibid., which captures only those orders that stop (or perhaps compel) acts of “assessment, levy and collection.” To resolve this ambiguity, we look to the context in which the word is used. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). The statutory context provides several clues that lead us to conclude that the TIA uses the word “restrain” in its narrower sense.	Yes
129	The standard dictionary definition of the term “rate” (as used with reference to prices) is “[a]n amount paid or charged for a good or service.” Black's Law Dictionary 1452 (10th ed. 2014); see, e.g., 13 Oxford English Dictionary 208–209 (2d ed. 1989) (“rate” means “price,” “cost,” or “sum paid or asked for a ... thing”). 	Yes
130	"""There is no dispute that the district is a political subdivision of the State of Texas in the ordinary sense of the term."""	Yes
131	Under the most natural reading of this provision, discrimination violates Title IX only if it is authorized by, or in accordance with, the actions, activities, or policies of the grant recipient. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2487 (1981) (defining “under” as “required by: in accordance with: bound by”); American Heritage Dictionary 1395 (New College ed.1981) (defining “under” as “[w]ith the authorization of; attested by; by virtue of”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2059 (2d ed.1987) (defining “under” as “authorized, warranted, or attested by” or “in accordance with”); see also 43 Words and Phrases 149–152 (1969) (citing cases defining “under” as, inter alia, “ ‘in accordance with’ and ‘in conformity with’ ”; “indicating subjection, guidance or control, and meaning ‘by authority of ’ ”; “ ‘by,’ ‘by reason of,’ or ‘by means of’ ”; and “ ‘by virtue of,’ which is defined ... as meaning ‘by or through the authority of’ ”). This reading reflects the common legal usage of the *660 term “under” to mean pursuant to, in accordance with, or as authorized or provided by. See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 469, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991) (“Because Congress nowhere stated its intent to impose mandatory obligations on the States under its § 5 powers, we concluded that Congress did not do so”); ante, at 1666 (“Among petitioner's claims was a claim for monetary and injunctive relief under Title IX ...”).	Yes
132	"""That is particularly true of a word as 'use,' whose meanings range all the way from 'to partake of' (as in 'he uses tobacco') to 'to be wont or accustomed' (as in 'he used to smoke tobacco')."" Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 241-42, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2061 (1993) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citation omitted). "	Yes
133	Their functions and duties pertain chiefly to the affairs of state in the county”); 3 J. Bouvier, Bouvier's Law Dictionary 3058 (8th ed.1914) (defining sheriff as “[a] county officer representing the executive or administrative power of the state within his county”).	Yes
134	[Thus, Black's Law Dictionary] defines “dismissal without prejudice” as “[a] dismissal that *506 does not bar the plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit within the applicable limitations period,” ibid.	Yes
135	“Redress” means “reparation of, satisfaction or compensation for, a wrong sustained or the loss resulting from this.” Oxford English Dictionary (1933). 	Yes
136	The clause requires the charterer to designate a “safe” berth: That means a berth “free from harm or risk.” Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1030 (10th ed. 1994); see also New Oxford American Dictionary 1500 (E. Jewell & F. Abate eds. 2001) (“safe” means “protected from or not exposed to danger or risk”).	Yes
137	In the 1930's, “scrip” could refer to “[c]ertificates of ownership, either absolute or conditional, of shares in a public company, corporate profits, etc.” Black's Law Dictionary, at 1588; C. Alsager, Dictionary of Business Terms 321 (1932) (“A certificate which represents fractions of shares of stock”); 3 F. Stroud, Judicial Dictionary 1802 (2d ed. 1903) (“a [c]ertificate, transferable by delivery, entitling its holder to become a Shareholder or Bondholder in respect of the shares or bonds therein mentioned”).	Yes
138	“[S]hall be made” is a form of the verb “to make,” which means “to bring into existence,” “to produce,” “to render,” and “to cause to be or become.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language, at 866. Thus, “shall be made” means “shall be produced,” etc. And the imperative mood, denoting a duty, see Black's Law Dictionary 1233 (5th ed. 1979), emphasizes the importance of avoiding the taint.	Yes
139	Relevancy is that ‘quality of evidence which renders it properly applicable in determining the truth or falsity of the matter in issue between the parties to a suit.’ 1 Bouvier Law Dict. Rawle's Revision, 866.	Yes
140	To deprive another of his property forever by deliberately disposing of it without semblance of authority is certainly an injury thereto within common acceptation of the words. Bouvier's Law Dict., ‘Injury.’ 	Yes
141	"""A mistried count is therefore nothing like the other forms of record material that Ashe suggested should be part of the preclusion inquiry. Ibid.; see also Black's Law Dictionary 1301 (8th ed.2004) defining 'record' as the “official report of the proceedings in a case, including the filed papers, verbatim transcript of the trial or hearing (if any), and tangible exhibits” "	Yes
142	And still, we can further delineate that issue just by plugging in the widely (universally?) *968 understood definition of an arm's-length transaction: a transaction conducted as though the two parties were strangers. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 1726 (10th ed. 2014). 	Yes
143	See Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979) (“Relate. To stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with”). 	Yes
144	Mr. Williams, for Lane County, plaintiff in error, laid down and pressed upon the attention of the court, seeking to maintain them by argument and authority, these two propositions...He cited Bouvier's Law Dictionary, title ‘Debt;’	Yes
145	To “endeavor” means to strive or work for a certain end. Webster's New International Dictionary 844 (2d ed. 1950); 1 New *611 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 816 (1993). 	Yes
146	The legal meaning of “land” when Congress enacted the relevant statutes was “any ground, soil, or earth whatsoever.” Black's Law Dictionary 1019 (4th ed. 1968). The ordinary meaning of land was much the same. Webster's New International Dictionary 1388 (2d ed. 1949) (“The solid part of the surface of the earth, as distinguished from water”; “Any ground, soil, or earth whatsoever ... and everything annexed to it, whether by nature ... or by man”).	Yes
147	"Generally, a treaty is defined as ‘a compact made between two or more independent nations, with a view to the public welfare.’""  (quoting 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1136)."	Yes
148	But if this transaction is held not to be such a sale as passed the title absolutely to Mrs. Mahan, it must be held to be a gift inter vivos. The learned Dr. Bouvier in his Law Dictionary2 states the rule to be, that such a gift, when  completed by delivery, passes the title to the thing, so that it cannot be recovered back by the giver; and such is no doubt the rule.	Yes
149	The dictionary defines “impede” as “to interfere with or get in the way of the progress of” or “hold up” or “detract from.” Webster's 3d 1132.	Yes
150	"The term “plaintiff” is among the most commonly understood of legal terms of art: It means a “party who brings a civil suit in a court of law.” Black's Law Dictionary 1267 (9th ed. 2009) see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1729 (1961)"""	Yes
151	A “service” refers to “duty or labor ... by one person ... bound to submit his will to the direction and control of [another].” Black's Law Dictionary 1607 (3d ed. 1933).	Yes
152	One definition of the word “substantial” is “being largely but not wholly that which is specified.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, at 1176. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 564, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (describing different meanings of the term “substantial”). In other words, “substantial” can mean “almost all” of the thing denominated.	Yes
153	Thus, under the plain terms of the 1905 Compact, each State had “jurisdiction”—the “authority of a sovereign power to govern or legislate,” Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language 806 (1898)—over wharfing out on “its own side of the river.”	Yes
154	The phrase “with respect to” means “referring to,” “concerning,” or “relating to.” Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide 853 (1999 ed.); accord, Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 1640 (2003 ed.); American Heritage Dictionary 1485 (4th ed. 2000). 	Yes
155	The term pilots is equally applicable to two classes of persons,—  tothose whose employment is to guide vessels in and out of ports, and to those who are intrusted with the management of the helm and the direction of the vessel on her voyage.	Yes
156	The ordinary dictionary definition of “employee” includes any “person who works for another in return for financial or other compensation.” American Heritage Dictionary **454 604 (3d ed.1992). See also Black's Law Dictionary 525 (6th ed.1990) (an employee is a “person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed”). The phrasing of the Act seems to reiterate the breadth of the ordinary dictionary definition, for it says “[t]he term ‘employee’ shall include any employee.” 29 U.S.C. § 152(3) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added).	Yes
157	And the term “ ‘[o]ffence’ was commonly understood in 1791 to mean ‘transgression,’ that is, ‘the Violation or Breaking of a Law.’ ” Grady, 495 U.S. at 529, 110 S.Ct. 2084 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Dictionarium Britannicum (Bailey ed. 1730)).	Yes
158	In 1 Rap. & L. Law Dict. p. 109, ‘banishment’ is thus defined: ‘A punishment by forced exile, either for years or for life, inflicted principally upon political offenders; ‘transportation’ being the word used to express a similar punishment of ordinary criminals.'	Yes
159	"""The suggestion that a wrong state-court 'decision' - a legal judgment rendered 'after consideration of facts, and … law,' - may no longer be redressed through habeas (because it is unreachable under the 'unreasonable application' phrase) is based on a mistaken insistence that the § 2254(d)(1) phrases have not only independent, but mutually exclusive, meanings."" "	Yes
160	“willfully” requires proof only “that the law imposed a duty on the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty,” Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 201, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991)	Yes
161	The interpretation advocated by respondents and adopted by the CAAF finds support at first blush in contemporaneous dictionary definitions of the term “punishable.” (cites numerous dictionaries). But upon inspection, definitions shed little light on the dispute because they largely re-raise the question over which the parties divide: capable of being punished under what law?	Yes
162	The word “matter” simply means “an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,” Black's Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014)—a term that could readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation.	Yes
163	In fact, the word “per” simply means “[f]or each” or “for every.” Black's Law Dictionary 1171 (8th ed.1999); see Webster's Third 1674.	Yes

165	"To ""exercise"" in the sense relevant here means ""to bring into play"" or ""make effective in action."" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 795 (1993). And to ""exercise"" something like control is ""to put in practice or carry out in action."" Webster's New International Dictionary, at 892. "	Yes
166	‘Purpose’ is listed as a synonym for ‘intention’ in Black's Law Dictionary, at 948 (4th ed. 1968).	Yes
167	Contemporaneous definitions further support a link between occupation and settlement. See W. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 725 (1889) (defining “occupy” as “[t]o hold in possession; to hold or keep for use” and noting that the word “[i]mplies actual use, possession or cultivation by a particular person”); id., at 944 (defining “settle” as “[t]o establish one's self upon; to occupy, reside upon”).	Yes
168	The word “any” is of no help because all speakers (including writers and legislators) who use general words such as “all,” “any,” “never,” and “none” normally rely upon context to indicate the limits of time **850 and place within which they intend those words to do their linguistic work.	Yes
169	“Personnel management” is similarly “the phase of management concerned with the engagement and effective utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of human resources.” Webster's 1687. 	Yes
170	The word “willful” is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as “voluntary” or “intentional.” Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed.1979).	Yes

172	And “violence,” when used in a legal context, also implies an intentional act. See Black's Law Dictionary 1564 (“violence” is the “[u]njust or unwarranted use of force, usu. accompanied by fury, vehemence, or outrage; physical force unlawfully exercised with the intent to harm”).	Yes
173	"""But like the majority, I reject T–Mobile's contention that the term “decision” inherently demands a statement of reasons. Dictionary definitions support that conclusion."""	Yes
174	Disgorgement as a remedy in its own right is also absent from legal publications until the 20th century. Leading legal dictionaries did not define the term until the turn of the 20th century. See, e.g., Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 143 (1996); Black's Law Dictionary 480 (7th ed. 1999).	Yes
175	It interpreted that phrase as applying § 405(h) “mutatis mutandis,” i.e., “[a]ll necessary changes having been made.” Black's Law Dictionary 1039 (7th ed.1999).	Yes

177	But the commonly understood definition of a property “interest” is “[a] legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property .... Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of [such] rights.” Black's Law Dictionary 828 (8th ed.2004).	Yes
178	The Oxford English Dictionary defines the verb “pander,” as “to minister to the gratification of (another's lust),” 11 Oxford English Dictionary 129 (2d ed.1989). And Black's Law Dictionary provides, as relevant, this definition of “pandering”: “The act or offense of selling or distributing textual or visual material (such as magazines or videotapes) openly advertised to appeal to the recipient's sexual interest.” Black's Law Dictionary 1142 (8th ed.2004) (hereinafter Black's).	Yes
179	The concept of “associat[ion]” requires both interpersonal relationships and a common interest. See id., at 132 (defining “association” as “an organization of persons having a common interest”); Black's Law Dictionary 156 (rev. 4th ed.1968) (defining “association” as a “collection of persons who have joined together for a certain object”).

184	Bouvier's Law Dictionary, vol. 2, p. 506, defines ‘seaworthiness' to be: ‘In maritime law, the sufficiency of the vessel in materials, construction, equipment, officers, men, and outfit for the trade or service in which it is employed.’ And the same author further says: ‘It can never be settled by positive rules of law how far this obligation of seaworthiness extends in any particular case, for the reason that improvements and changes in the means and modes of navigation frequently require new implements or new forms of old ones; and these, though not *9 necessary at first, become so when there is an established usage that all ships of a certain quality, or those to be sent on certain voyages or used for certain purposes, shall have them.’ 	Yes

192	From the dawn of English common law through the present, the word “use” has been employed to refer to various forms of trust arrangements. See 1 G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees § 2, p. 9 (1935); Black's Law Dictionary 1382 (5th ed. 1979) (“Uses and trusts are not so much different things as different aspects of the same subject.

Then, as now, courts disfavored repeals by implication. See, e.g., Warder v. Arell, 2 Va. 282, 299 (1796) (opinion of President Judge); 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law-Dictionary (2d ed. 1771) (defining “Statute”); 4 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 638 (3d ed. 1768).	Yes

200	Although the age of consent for statutory rape purposes varies by jurisdiction, see infra, at 1571, reliable dictionaries provide evidence that the “generic” age—in 1996 and today—is 16. See B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 38 (2d ed. 1995) (“Age of consent, usu[ally] 16, denotes the age when one is legally capable of agreeing ... to sexual intercourse” and cross-referencing “statutory rape”); Black's Law Dictionary 73 (10th ed. 2014) (noting that the age of consent is “usu[ally] defined by statute as 16 years”).	Yes
201	That understanding is consistent with the original meaning of “regulate” at the time of the Constitution's ratification, when “to regulate” meant “[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,” 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); “[t]o adjust, to direct according to rule,” 2 J. Ash, New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1775); “to put in order, set to rights, govern or keep in order,” T. Dyche & W. Pardon, A New General English Dictionary (16th ed. 1777).	Yes
202	Even by itself, the world 'violent' in § 924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Webster's Second 2846 (defining ‘violent’ as ‘[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement ...’); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989) (‘[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength’); Black's [Law Dictionary] 1706 [ (9th ed. 2009) ] (‘[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force’). When the adjective ‘violent’ is attached to the noun ‘felony,’ its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188 (defining ‘violent felony’ as ‘[a] crime characterized by extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon’); see also United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221, 225 (C.A.1 1992) (Breyer, C.J.) (‘[T]he term to be defined, “violent felony,” ... calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closely related, active violence’).” 559 U.S., at 140–141, 130 S.Ct. 1265.

203	“corruptly” requires proof that the defendant “act[ed] with an intent to procure an unlawful benefit either for [himself] or for some other person,” United States v. Floyd, 740 F.3d 22, 31 (C.A.1 2014) (collecting cases); see also Black's Law Dictionary 414 (rev. 4th ed. 1951) (“corruptly” “generally imports a wrongful design to acquire some pecuniary or other advantage”). In other words, “corruptly” requires proof that the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an “unlawful benefit” but that his “objective” or “purpose” was to obtain that unlawful benefit. See 21 Am.Jur.2d, Criminal Law § 114 (2016) (explaining that specific intent requires both knowledge and purpose).	Yes

207	"""A 'concrete' injury must be 'de facto '; that is, it must actually exist. See Black's Law Dictionary 479 (9th ed. 2009). When we have used the adjective 'concrete,' we have meant to convey the usual meaning of the term—'real,' and not 'abstract.'"""	Yes
208	The word 'procedure' has been defined by Anderson, in his Dictionary of Law as follows: 'rpocedure. The body of rules, whether of practice or pleadings, whereby rights are effectuated through the successful application of proper remedies. Opposed to the sume of the legal principles which constitute the substance of the law, and also distinguished from the of evidence. The term is so broad that is is seldom employed as a word of art; it including whatever is embraced by the three technical terms, ‘pleadings,’ ‘evidence,’ and ‘practice;’ ‘practice’ here meaning those legal rules which direct the course of proceeding to bring parties into court, and the course of the court after they are brought in; and ‘evidence’ meaning those rules of law whereby we determine what testimony is to be admitted and what rejected in each case, and what is the weight to be given to the testimony admitted.'	Yes
209	From the time of the founding to the present, the word “seizure” has meant a “taking possession,” 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 67 (1828); 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 510 (6th ed. 1856); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2057 (1981).	Yes
210	For one thing, we do not doubt that the setoff matter is “under dispute” or “in question” in Case No. B/61, and those words typically define the term “at issue.” Black's Law Dictionary 136 (8th ed.2004).	Yes
211	Moreover, common-law damages actions of the sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty, and it is difficult to say that such actions do not impose “requirements or prohibitions.” See W. Prosser, Law of Torts 4 (4th ed. 1971); Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “tort” as “always [involving] a violation of some duty owing to plaintiff”).	Yes
212	At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the word “punishment” referred to the penalty imposed for the commission of a crime [cites to both legal and ordinary dictionaries from the founding era]….  That is also the primary definition of the word today. As a legal term of art, 'punishment' has always meant a 'fine, penalty, or confinement inflicted upon a person by the authority of the law and the judgment and sentence of a court, for some crime or offense committed by him.' Black's Law Dictionary 1234 (6th ed. 1990). And this understanding of the word, of course, does not encompass a prisoner's injuries that bear no relation to his sentence.	Yes
213	The addition of “actual” in § 1113(2) signals that the plaintiff 's knowledge must be more than “potential, possible, virtual, conceivable, theoretical, hypothetical, or nominal.” Black's Law Dictionary 53 (4th ed. 1951). 	Yes
214	"In ordinary English, a lawyer who regularly tries to obtain payment of consumer debts through legal proceedings is a lawyer who regularly 'attempts' to 'collect' those consumer debts.

215	"""But neither of those claims about the bare term 'described in' can resolve this case. Like many words, “describe” takes on different meanings in different contexts"" "	Yes
216	What is the common law?...In Black's Law Dictionary, page 232, it is thus defined: ‘As distinguished from law created by the enactment of legislatures, the common law comprises the body of those principles and rules of action relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts...’	Yes
217	"Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act in 1978 defined “interpreter” as one who translates spoken, as opposed to written, language. (listing a number of dictionaries)… Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the word ""interpreter"" and ""interpret"" in terms of oral translation."	Yes
218	"Section 518 does not define “surcharge,” but the Court of Appeals looked to the ordinary meaning of the term: “a charge in excess of the usual or normal amount.” 808 F.3d, at 127 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2299 (2002); internal quotation marks omitted). Where a seller posts a single sticker price, it is reasonable to treat that sticker price as the “usual or normal amount” and conclude, as the court below did, that a merchant imposes a surcharge when he charges a credit card user more than that sticker price. In short, we cannot dismiss the Court of Appeals' interpretation of 518 as ""clearly wrong."" "	Yes
219	According to the 1934 edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, plain means “clear” or “manifest,”	Yes
220	It reduces the value of a lienholder's equitable interest in a debtor's property to the property's liquidation value, but it does not insure the debtor an opportunity to “redeem” the property at that price, i.e., to “free [the] property ... from [the] mortgage or pledge by paying the debt for which it stood as security.” Black's Law Dictionary 1278 (6th ed. 1990).	Yes
221	Contribution  is defined as the “tortfeasor's right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.” Black's Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed.2004).	Yes
222	Similarly, “if one person intends to harm a second person but instead unintentionally harms a third, the first person's criminal or tortious intent toward the second applies to the third as well.” Black's Law Dictionary at 1504 (defining transferred-intent doctrine)	Yes
223	 The term “bear arms” is a familiar idiom; when used unadorned by any additional words, its meaning is “to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight.” 1 Oxford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed.1989). 	Yes
224	In defining the word “fine,” some 18th–century dictionaries did not mention to whom the money was paid. See, e.g., T. Sheridan, A Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1796) (unpaginated) (“a mulct [or] a pecuniary punishment”); S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785) (unpaginated) (“a mulct [or] pecuniary punishment,” a “penalty,” or “money paid for any exemption or liberty”). To the same effect are some 19th–century dictionaries. See, e.g., 1 C. Richardson, A New Dictionary of the English Language 796 (1839) ( “any thing (as a sum of money) paid at the end, to make an end, termination or conclusion of a suit, of a prosecution”).	Yes
225	A “fine signifieth a percuniarie punishment for an offence, or a contempt committed against the king.” 1 E. Coke, Institutes *126b. The second edition of Cunningham's Law–Dictionary, published in 1771, defined “fines for offences” as “amends, pecuniary punishment, or recompence for an offence committed against the King and his laws, or against the Lord of a manor.” 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law–Dictionary (unpaginated). See also 1 T. Tomlins, Law–Dictionary 796–799 (1836) (same); 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 525 (4th ed. 1852) (same).	Yes
226	To “insure” something—as the court below recognized—means “ ‘[t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).’ ”	Yes
227	Contemporaneous dictionaries from the time of the TIA's enactment define assessment in expansive terms. They would broaden any understanding of the term, and so the Act's bar. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 139 (1927) (providing three context relevant definitions for the term assessment: It is the act of apportioning or determining an amount to be paid; a valuation of property for the purpose of taxation; or the entire plan or scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing).	Yes

But § 2409a authorizes civil actions in cases in which neither the Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to the land at issue."" at 235"	Yes
229	And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.” Ibid.*** (it = Black's Law Dictionary)	Yes
230	It is well settled that, in order to render a matter res adjudicata, there must be a concurrence of the four conditions, viz: (1) Identity in the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of persons and parties to the action; and (4) identity of the quality in the persons for or against whom the claim is made. 2 Bouv. Law Dict. 467.	Yes
231	At that time, the word from which it derived, “employ,” simply meant to “apply (a thing) to some definite purpose.” 3 J. Murray, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 129 (1891). 	Yes
232	"""In short, employing the word 'interpreters' to include translators of written as well as oral speech, if not “the most common usage,” ante, at 2003, is at least an 'acceptable' usage""Moreover, the word “interpret” is generally understood to mean “to explain or tell the meaning of: translate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,” while “translate” commonly means “to turn into one's own or another language.” Webster's 1182, 2429. See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744, 1505 (1973) (defining the transitive verb “interpret” as, inter alia, “to translate,” and “translate” as “to turn (something written or spoken) from one language into another”)."	Yes
233	In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates “a time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when the claim accrued.” Black's Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed. 2009) (Black's)	Yes
234	While many of the lexicographers, such as Webster, Worcester, and the Imperial Dictionary, still define ‘freight’ as the sum paid by a party hiring a ship or **488 part of a ship, or for the carriage of goods, in the Century Dictionary it is said to be, in a more general sense, the price paid for the use of a ship, including the transportation of passengers. Similar definitions are given in the law dictionaries of Burrill, Bouvier, and Anderson. See, also, Ben. Adm. §§ 283, 286, and 288.	Yes
235	The statute does not define what is meant by ‘organize.’ Dictionary definitions are of little help, for, as those offered us sufficiently show, the term is susceptible of both meanings attributed to it by the parties here.	Yes
236	A bailment is the “delivery of personal property by one person (the bailor ) to another (the bailee ) who holds the property for a certain purpose.” Black's Law Dictionary 169 (10th ed. 2014); J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments § 2, p. 2 (1832) (“a bailment is a delivery of a thing in trust for some special object or purpose, and upon a contract, expressed or implied, to conform to the object or purpose of the trust”). A bailee normally owes a legal duty to keep the item safe, according to the terms of the parties' contract if they have one, and according to the “implication[s] from their  conduct” if they don't. 8 C.J. S., Bailments § 36, pp. 468–469 (2017). 	Yes
237	Thus, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1675 (1961) (Webster's Third) defines “percentile” as “the value of the statistical variable that marks the boundary between any two consecutive intervals in a distribution of 100 intervals each containing one percent of the total population.”	Yes
238	"""Under the American decisional law, the phrase ‘personal injury’ denotes primarily an injury to the body of a person. At least some of the courts, however, have not narrowly limited the term, and have concluded that a personal injury or an injury to the person, within the meaning of the law, does not necessarily involve physical contact with the person injured or mere bodily or physical injuries, but may embrace all actionable injuries to the individual himself.” 1 S. Speiser, C. Krause, & A. Gans, American Law of Torts 6 (1983) See also Black's Law Dictionary 786 (6th ed. 1990). -"	Yes
239	"""the term 'felony' is commonly defined to mean a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year."" at 130."	Yes
240	And the noun “address,” in the sense relevant here, means “the designation of a place (as a residence or place of business) where a person or organization may be found or communicated with.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 25 (1971) (Webster's Third); see also Webster's Second New International Dictionary 30 (1957) (“the name or description of a place of residence, business, etc., where a person may be found or communicated with”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 17 (1966) (“the place or the name of the place where a person, organization, or the like is located or may be reached”); American Heritage Dictionary 15 (1969) (“[t]he location at which a particular organization or person may be found or reached”); Oxford English Dictionary 106 (1933) (OED) (“the name of the place to which any one's letters are directed”). 	Yes
241	The same dictionaries defined ‘blasphemy,’ a peculiarly verbal offense, in much broader terms than ‘sacrilege,’ indeed in terms which the New York court finds encompassed by ‘sacrilegious.’ For example, Barclay said ‘blasphemy’ is ‘an offering some indignity to God, any person of the Trinity, any messengers from God, his holy writ, or the doctrines of revelation.	Yes
242	"""That absurdity is not only at war with the English language, it is flatly inconsistent with definitions of “domestic violence” from the period surrounding § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii)'s enactment.""At the time, dictionaries defined “domestic violence” as, for instance, “[v]iolence between members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault or other violent act committed by one member of a household against another,” Black's Law Dictionary 1564 (7th ed. 1999), and “[v]iolence toward or physical *180 abuse of one's spouse or domestic partner,” American Heritage Dictionary 534 (4th ed. 2000)."	Yes
243	Thus, a ‘gift enterprise’ *215 has been defined to be ‘a scheme for the division or distribution of certain articles of property, to be determined by chance, amongst those who have taken shares in the scheme.’ Bouvier's Law Dict. (Rawle's Rev.) p. 884; Black's Law Dict. p. 539; Anderson's Law Dict. p. 488. See also Lohman v. State, 81 Ind. 15, 17; Winston ston v. Beeson, 135 N. C. 271, 279, 65 L.R.A. 167, 47 S. E. 457; Randle v. State, 42 Tex. 580	Yes
244	 The word, “proceeding,” means “[t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including all acts and events between the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.” Black's Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed.1999) (emphasis added). 	Yes

246	In this context, “design” means purpose or plan; i.e., the intended aim of the transportation. See Am. Hert. 491 (“[t]o formulate a plan for; devise”; “[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or effect”); Black's 478 (“[a] plan or scheme”; “[p]urpose or intention combined with a plan”); see also Brief for United States 14 (“ ‘to conceive and plan out in the mind’ ” (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 611 (1993))).

247	In sum, “physical force,” or “force capable of causing physical pain or injury,” Johnson, 559 U.S., at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265 includes the amount of force necessary to overcome a victim's resistance.	Yes
248	Though § 1259 does not define the term [relief], its familiar meaning encompasses any “redress or benefit” provided by a court. Black's Law Dictionary 1317 (8th ed.2004).	Yes
249	Rather, we find persuasive the determination of the First Circuit that the definition of 'termination' also includes 'cessation in time.' The First Circuit noted that this definition is included in both Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2359 (1976) (definition of 'terminate') and Black's Law Dictionary 1319 (5th ed. 1979) (definition of 'termination')	Yes
250	Specifically, a right-of-way grants the limited “right to pass ... through the estate of another.” Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (4th ed. 1968).       1) right-of-way  A right-of-way may include not just a right of passage, but also the land itself. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 521e(3) (providing that certain “rights-of-way” are “lands”); Black's Law Dictionary 1587 (11th ed. 2019) (“rightof-way” can refer to “[t]he strip of land”); Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (4th ed. 1968) (similar)  United States Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass'n, 140 S. Ct. 1837, 1857, 207 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2020)  2) Land  The legal meaning of “land” when Congress enacted the relevant statutes was “any ground, soil, or earth whatsoever.” Black's Law Dictionary 1019 (4th ed. 1968). The ordinary meaning of land was much the same. Webster's New International Dictionary 1388 (2d ed. 1949) (“The solid part of the surface of the earth, as distinguished from water”; “Any ground, soil, or earth whatsoever ... and everything annexed to it, whether by nature ... or by man”).  United States Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass'n, 140 S. Ct. 1837, 1852, 207 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2020)	Yes
251	"""Although the phrase 'public domain' appears infrequently in our precedents, this Court has used it interchangeably with references to 'public land[s].' Black's Law Dictionary 1229 (6th ed. 1990) defines the public domain as “[l]and and water in possession of and owned by the United States and the states individually."" "	Yes
252	That interpretation is inconsistent with ordinary English usage and is incompatible with the rest of the statute. To be sure, “for” can sometimes mean “in preparation for or anticipation of.” 6 Oxford English Dictionary 24 (2d ed. 1989). But “for” can also mean “[d]uring [or] throughout,” id., at 26, as well as “with the object or purpose of,” id., at 23; see also American Heritage Dictionary 709 (3d ed. 1992) (“Used to indicate the object, aim, or purpose of an action or activity”; “Used to indicate amount, extent, or duration”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 747 (2d ed. 1987) (“with the object or purpose of”; “during the continuance of”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 886 (1993) (“with the purpose or object of”; “to the ... duration of”). And here, only that second set of definitions makes sense in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole.	Yes
253	“Subject matter jurisdiction defines the court's authority to hear a given type of case,” United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 828, 104 S.Ct. 2769, 81 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984); it represents “the extent to which a court can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of things,” Black's Law Dictionary 870 (8th ed.2004). 	Yes
254	It is noteworthy that the term “enjoin” has not just its meaning in the restrictive sense but also has meaning in an affirmative sense. The Black's Law Dictionary current at the TIA's enactment gives as a definition of the term, “to require; command; positively direct.” Black's Law Dictionary 663 (3d ed.1933). 	Yes
255	"Whether one consults a dictionary or common sense, the meaning of “original sentence” is plain: The term refers to the initial judgment imposing punishment on a defendant. “Original” is commonly understood to mean “initial” or “first in order.” (then goes on to define the word ""original"" in ordinary dictionaries and law dictionaries)  "	Yes
256	It is certainly correct that the word “conviction” can mean either the finding of guilt or the entry of a final judgment on that finding. The word has many other meanings as well, including “[a]ct of convincing of error, or of compelling the admission of a truth”; “[s]tate of being convinced; esp., state of being convicted of sin, or by one's conscience”; “[a] strong persuasion or belief; as, to live up to one's convictions; an intensity of thorough conviction. ” Webster's New International Dictionary 584 (2d ed. 1950).	Yes
257	Tomlin says that 'the word conspiracy was formerly used almost exclusively for an agreement of two or more persons falsely to indict one, or to procure him to be indicted, of felony;' but that 'now it is no less commonly used for the unlawful combinations of journeymen to raise their wages, or to refuse working, except on certain stipulated conditions.	Yes
258	When this Court has interpreted statutes that include a list of terms or phrases followed by a limiting clause, we have typically applied an interpretive strategy called the “rule of the last antecedent.” See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26, 124 S.Ct. 376, 157 L.Ed.2d 333 (2003). The rule provides that “a limiting clause or phrase ... should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.” Ibid.; see also Black's Law Dictionary 1532–1533 (10th ed. 2014) (“[Q]ualifying words or phrases modify the words or phrases immediately preceding them and not words or phrases more remote, unless the extension is necessary from the context or the spirit of the entire writing”)	Yes
259	"A review of that period reveals substantial support for the view that the term 'witness' meant a person who gives or furnishes evidence, a broader meaning than that which our case law currently ascribes to the term."" "	Yes
260	With respect to subparagraph (E), the statutory context makes clear that the prepositional phrase—“under section 1311”—is most naturally read to mean that the effluent limitation or other limitation must be approved or promulgated “pursuant to” or “by reason of the authority of” § 1311. See St. Louis Fuel and Supply Co., Inc. v. FERC, 890 F.2d 446, 450 (C.A.D.C.1989) (R.B. Ginsburg, J.) (“ ‘under’ means ‘subject [or pursuant] to’ or ‘by reason of the authority of’ ”); cf. Black's Law Dictionary 1368 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “under” as “according to”). 	Yes

263	Tonnage, in our law, is a vessel's ‘internal cubical capacity in tons of one hundred cubic feet each, to be ascertained’ in the manner prescribed by Congress. Act of May 6, 1864, 13 Stat. pp. 70, 72; Rev. Stat. U. S. 804, § 4153. ‘Tonnage duties are duties upon vessels in proportion to their capacity.’ Bouv. Law Dict., ‘Tonnage.’	Yes
264	Justice GINSBURG suggests that “at the time the Constitution was framed, to ‘regulate’ meant, among other things, to require action.” Post, at 2621 (citing Seven–Sky v. Holder, 661 F.3d 1, 16 (C.A.D.C.2011); brackets and some internal quotation marks omitted). 	Yes
265	The idea of monopoly involves something more than a mere acquisition of the whole, or of the major part, of a commodity or of shares of stock. It involves the idea of exclusion of other supply, as well as inclusion of what is actually acquired. Re Greene, 52 Fed. 104; Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 606, 9 L. ed. 847; 20 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, p. 846; 2 Bouvier, Law Dict. Rawle's ed. p. 435; 4 Bl. Com. 159; Century Dict. Monopoly; United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. 171 U. S. 505, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25. 	Yes
266	The word 'file' is derived from the Latin word 'filum,' and relates to the ancient practice of placing papers on a thread or wire for safe-keeping and ready reference. Filing, it must be observed, is not complete until the document is delivered and received. 'Shall file' means to deliver to the office, and not send through the United States mails. A paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper official and by him received and filed.	Yes
267	All the definitions of misprision imply such a personal knowledge of the fact as would be legal evidence. 4 Jac. Law Dict. 295; Staundf. P. C. lib. 1, c. 19; Hawk. P.C. c. 20, § 4; 1 Hale's P. C. 375; Termes de la Ley 291; 3 Inst. 36; 1 Chitty's Crim. Law, 2.	Yes
268	Finally, “collection” is the act of obtaining payment of taxes due. See Black's 349 (defining “collect” as “to obtain payment or liquidation” of a debt or claim). 	Yes
269	"""If, as the Director asserts, the term 'assessment,' by itself, signfified '[t]he entire plan or scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing, the TIA would not need the words 'levy' or 'collection,' the term 'assessment,' alone, would do all the necessary work."" Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 101, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 2286 (2004). "	Yes
270	The ordinary meaning of “relief” in the context of a lawsuit is the “redress[ ] or benefit” that attends a favorable judgment. Black's Law Dictionary 1161 (5th ed. 1979). 	Yes
271	"""The last four words in that list—'cause,' 'suit,' 'proceeding,' and 'controversy'—connote a formal exercise of governmental power, such as a lawsuit, hearing, or administrative determination."" See, e.g., Crimes Act of 1790, § 21, 1 Stat. 117 (using “cause,” “suit,” and “controversy” in a related statutory context to refer to judicial proceedings); Black's Law Dictionary 278–279, 400, 1602–1603 (4th ed. 1951) (defining “cause,” “suit,” and “controversy” as judicial proceedings); 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(3) (using “proceeding” to refer to trials, hearings, or the like “before any court, any committee of either House or both Houses of Congress, or any agency, commission, or officer”)."	Yes
272	The sovereign is, by definition, the entity “in which independent **1644 and supreme authority is vested.” Black's Law Dictionary 1395 (6th ed.1990).	Yes
273	"""The two linguistic forms ('cognizable by'; 'has jurisdiction') mean about the same thing. See Black's Law Dictionary 991 (4th ed.1951) (defining 'jurisdiction' as 'the authority by which courts and judicial officers take cognizance of and decide cases' (emphasis added)); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1038 (3d ed.1933) (similarly using the term 'cognizance' to define 'jurisdiction')."	Yes
274	To “injure” is, among other things, “to impair.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 623 (1983).	Yes
275	Reform' means to correct; to make anew; to rectify.	Yes
276	"""In legal parlance, the term 'damages' refers to money awarded as reparation for injury resulting from breach of legal duty."" "	Yes
277	Moreover, because the harassment must occur “under” “the operations of” a funding recipient, see 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); § 1687 (defining “program or activity”), the harassment must take place in a context subject to the school district's control, Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 2487 (defining “under” as “in or into a condition of subjection, regulation, or subordination”; “subject to the guidance and instruction of”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language, supra, at 1543 (defining “under” as “subject to the authority, direction, or supervision of”).	Yes
278	"""What is similar to a 'record' or 'document' but yet is not one?"" Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 550, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1089 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring)…. An e-mail, after all, might not be a “document” if, as was “traditionally” so, a document was a “piece of paper with information on it,” not “information stored on a computer, electronic storage device, or any other medium.” Black's Law Dictionary 587–588 (10th ed. 2014)."	Yes
279	Although in ordinary usage both “individual” and “person” often refer to an individual human being, see, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1152, 1686 (1986) (“individual” defined as a “single human being”; “person” defined as “an individual human being”), “person” often has a broader meaning in the law, see, e.g., 1 U.S.C. § 1 (“person” includes “corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals”).	Yes
280	According to Black's Law Dictionary 566 (6th ed. 1990), “excusable neglect” is: “[A] failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in consequence of the party's own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident, or reliance on the care and vigilance of his counsel or on promises made by the adverse party. As used in rule (e.g. Fed.R.Civil P. 6(b)) authorizing court to permit an act to be done after expiration of the time within which under the rules such act was required to be done, where failure to act was the result of ‘excusable neglect’, quoted phrase is ordinarily *403 understood to be the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances.”	Yes
281	 At the time of the founding, “to liquidate” meant “to make clear or plain”; “to render unambiguous; to settle (differences, disputes).” Nelson, Stare Decisis and Demonstrably Erroneous Precedents, 87 Va. L. Rev. 1, 13, and n. 35 (2001) (Nelson) (quoting 8 Oxford English Dictionary 1012 (2d ed. 1991); (internal quotation marks omitted)).	Yes

283	 'Clear' error can simply mean an obvious, plain, gross, significant, or manifest error or miscalculation. See Black's Law Dictionary 250 (6th ed. 1990).	Yes
284	The word ‘association’ appears to be used in the Act in its ordinary meaning. It has been defined as a term ‘used throughout the United States to signify a body of persons united without a charter, but upon the methods and forms used by incorporated bodies for the prosecution of some common enterprise.’ 1 Abb. Law Dict. 101 (1879); 1 Bouv. Law Dict. (Rawle's 3d Rev.) 269; 3 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law (2 Ed.) 162; and Allen v. Stevens, 33 App. Div. 485, 54 N. Y. Supp. 8, 23, in which this definition was cited with approval as being in accord with the common understanding. Other definitions are: ‘In the United States, as distinguished from a corporation, a body of persons organized, for the prosecution of some purpose, without a charter, but having the general form and mode of procedure of a corporation.’ Webst. New Internat. Dict.	Yes
285	"""Next, the majority repeats Texas' dictionary-based contention that in using the word “relief” Congress meant to “connot[e] equitable relief.” Ante, at 1660. This proposition suffers from three flaws. First, it is not established by the dictionary to which the majority cites...Second, it is inconsistent with our precedent."""	Yes
286	It seems to me that the method of arriving at and distributing the damages pertains to procedure or remedy,—that is to say, to the course of the court after parties are brought in, and the means of redressing the wrong,—and I think the general rule that procedure and remedy are regulated by the law of the forum is applicable.	Yes
287	The term “assist” is defined as “to give support or aid,” Webster's Ninth 109, or “to help,” Oxford American Dictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford). See *544 also Black's Law Dictionary 111 (5th ed.1979) (hereinafter Black's) (defining “assist” as “[t]o help; aid; succor; lend countenance or encouragement to; participate in as an auxiliary”).  	Yes
288	 The dictionary informs that to “toll” means “[t]o take away, bar, defeat, [or] annul.” See 18 Oxford English Dictionary 204 (2d ed. 1989); Webster's New International Dictionary 2662 (2d ed. 1957) (“[t]o take away; to vacate; to annul”); Oxford Latin Dictionary 1947 (1982) ( “tollere,” the Latin origin, means to “remove” or “lift”). So when a statute speaks of tolling a limitations period it can, naturally enough, mean either that the running of the limitations period is suspended or that the effect of the limitations period is defeated. 	Yes
289	Indeed, as the D.C. Circuit observed, “[a]t the time the Constitution was [framed], to ‘regulate’ meant,” among other things, “to require action.” 	Yes
290	That suit related to a Maine attachment law which, of course, is governed by the same rule as garnishment law. See ‘garnishment,’ Bouvier's Law Dictionary	Yes
291	"""In explaining its interpretation of 'physical force,' the Court in Johnson expressly rejected the common law's definition of 'force,' see 559 U.S., at 139, 130 S.Ct. 1265 instead recognizing that the phrase should be 'give[n] ... its ordinary meaning...Rather, ;context determines meaning,' ibid., and, 'in the context of a statutory definition of ‘violent felony,’' the ordinary rather than the common-law meaning of 'force' was what fit, id., at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265."" (quoting Johnson v. United States (2015)) "	Yes
292	But the appellation of magistrate ‘is not confined to justices of the peace, and other persons, ejusdem generis, who exercise general judicial powers; but it includes others whose duties are strictly executive.’ Anderson's Law Dict. 643, 644. 	Yes
293	It seems clear to me, however, that the “boycott, coercion, or intimidation” language of § 3(b) was intended to refer, not to the practices defined and condemned by the Sherman Act, but to the narrower range of practices involved in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440, the case that prompted Congress to enact the McCarran-Ferguson Act.	Yes

295	To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of “carry,” a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column “carries” the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, at 919, 921.	Yes
296	petitioner's admission to “breaking” was therefore critical to that element, as well. Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 236 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (“Breaking” denotes the “tearing away or removal of any part of a house or of the locks, latches, or other fastenings intended to *296 secure it, or otherwise exerting force to gain an entrance, with the intent to commit a felony”).

299	"As San Antonio notes, the word ""taxable"" can be used to describe something that may, but need not necessarily, be taxed. See, e.g., Random Hosue Dictionary of the English Language 1947 (2d ed. 1987) (defining ""taxable"" as ""capable of being taxed""); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2345 (1976) (same)....

302	At the time Hughes was decided, damages were understood only as compensation for injury. See T. Blount, Law–Dictionary (1670) (Blount) (unpaginated) (defining “damages” as “a recompense for what the Plaintiff or Demandant hath suffered, by means of the wrong done him by the Defendant or Tenant”) (emphasis added)	Yes
303	The 18th-century meaning is no different from the meaning today. The 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary defined “arms” as “[w]eapons of offence, or armour of defence.” 1 Dictionary of the English Language 106 (4th ed.) (reprinted 1978) (hereinafter Johnson). Timothy Cunningham's important 1771 legal dictionary defined “arms” as “any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.” 1 A New and Complete Law Dictionary; see also N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1989) (hereinafter Webster) (similar).	Yes

307	The word “redistricted” also is not hard to comprehend. Id., at 980 (defining “redistrict” to mean “to divide anew into districts”); Black's Law Dictionary 1283 (7th ed.1999) (defining “redistrict” to mean “[t]o organize into new districts, esp. legislative ones; reapportion”). 	Yes
308	"""Moving closer to home, recall that demand-response participants must choose either to pruchase a unit of energy at the prevailing retail price (say $10) or to withhold from purchasing that unit and receive instead an incentive payment (of say $5). The two options thus present a choice between having a unit of energy, on the one hand, and having $15 more in the bank, on the other. To repeat: take the energy, be $15 poorer; forgo the energy, be $15 richer. Is that not the very definition of price?"" F.E.R.C. v.

310	The term “ discriminatory” means characterized by differential treatment that lacks a sound justification. See The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 564 (2d ed. 1987) (“discriminatory” means “characterized by or showing prejudicial treatment esp. as an indication of racial, religious, or sexual bias”); B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 191 (1987) (“discriminatory” means “applying discrimination in treatment, esp. on ethnic grounds”); Black's Law Dictionary 479 (“discrimination” means characterized by “[d]ifferential treatment; esp., a failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored”). 	Yes
311	" A common definition of 'finding of fact' is, for example, '[a] conclusion by way of reasonable inference from the evidence.'"" "	Yes
312	Thus, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1227 (1976) broadly defines “jurisdiction” as, among other things, “the limits or territory within which any particular power may be exercised: sphere of authority.”	Yes
313	It also creates a “contract” as defined by federal regulations, namely, a “mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services ... and the buyer to pay for them,” including “all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and” (as a general matter) “are in writing.” 48 CFR § 2.101 (2015).

314	“Discrimination” is the “failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored.” Black's Law Dictionary 534 (9th ed.2009); accord, id., at 420 (5th ed.1979); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 648 (1976) (“discriminates” means “to make a difference in treatment or *287 favor on a class or categorical basis in disregard of individual merit”). 	Yes
315	The meaning of the word “until” is not difficult to understand, nor is it some specialized term of art. See Webster's New International Dictionary 2794 (2d ed.1957) (defining “until” to mean “[d]uring the whole time before”); Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1297 *299 10th ed.1993) (defining “until” to mean “up to such time as” or “[b]efore”). 	Yes
316	n its numerous uses throughout the Code, it is clear that the term “assessment” refers to little more than the calculation or recording of a tax liability. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 6201 (assessment authority); § 6203 (method of assessment); § 6204 (supplemental assessments); 26 CFR § 601.103 (2003). See also Black's Law Dictionary 111 (7th ed.1999) (defining “assessment” as the “[d]etermination of the [tax] rate or amount of something, such as a tax or damages”). “	Yes
317	Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawles Third Revision, p. 2247, defines ‘moral turpitude’ as ‘an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.’	Yes
318	That is, the deliberate indifference must, at a minimum, “cause [students] to undergo” harassment or “make them liable or vulnerable” to it.

319	the term would have been understood by laymen to require some sort of evil or dissolute intention. See Stormonth's English Dictionary 1146 (1885); Webster's Dictionary 1490 (1869); Worcester's Dictionary 1645 (1860). “Wantonly” most frequently was defined as “lewdly” which in turn was regarded as synonymous with “wickedly.” Webster's Dictionary 768 (1869); Worcester's Dictionary 834 (1860). 	Yes
320	A “question” could mean any “subject or aspect that is in dispute, open for discussion, or to be inquired into,” and a “matter” any “subject” of “interest or relevance.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1394, 1863 (1961). If those meanings were adopted, a typical meeting, call, or event would qualify as a “question” or “matter.” A “question” may also be interpreted more narrowly, however, as “a subject or point of debate or a proposition being or to be voted on in a meeting,” such as a question “before the senate.” Id., at 1863.Similarly, a “matter” may be limited to “a topic under active and usually serious or practical consideration,” such as a matter that “will come before the committee.” Id., at 1394. To choose between those competing definitions, we look to the context in which the words appear. 	Yes

323	When the President “direct[s]” someone to serve as an officer pursuant to the FVRA, he is “appoint[ing]” that person as an “officer of the United States” within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. Around the time of the framing, the verb “appoint” meant “[t]o establish anything by decree,” 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language *313 (def. 3) (6th ed. 1785); T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (To Appoint) (6th ed. 1796), or “[t]o allot, assign, or designate,” 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (def. 3) (1828). When the President “direct [s]” a person to serve as an acting officer, he is “assign[ing]” or “designat [ing]” that person to serve as an officer.	Yes
324	An “aggravated” offense is one “made worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another crime.” Id., at 75, 127 S.Ct. 625. 	Yes
325	The classic definition of the crime of battery is the “intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another.” Ante, at 1270 (citing 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 7.15, p. 301 (1986 and Supp.2003); Black's Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed.2009)). 	Yes
326	"""Actual possession exists when a person has direct physical control over a thing. See Black's Law Dictionary"" at 626"	Yes
327	The key word here is “deemed.” That term is used in legal materials “[t]o treat (something) as if ... it were really something else.” Black's Law Dictionary 504 (10th ed. 2014).	Yes
328	That interpretive practice of applying the modifier to the whole list boasts a fancy name—the “series-qualifier canon,” see Black's Law Dictionary 1574 (10th ed. 2014)—but, as my opening examples show, it reflects the completely ordinary way that people speak and listen, write and read.	Yes
329	A number of other common-law commentaries shared Hawkins's broad reading of Holyday. See The Law of Arrests 205 (2d ed. 1753) (In light of Holyday, “an Arrest of an Offender ... for any Crime prejudicial to the **1546 Publick, seems to be justifiable”); 1 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (1771) (definition of “arrest”) (same); 1 G. Jacob, The Law Dictionary 129 (1st Am.ed., 1811) (same). See generally C. Greaves, Law of Arrest Without a Warrant, in The Criminal Law Consolidation Acts, p. lxiii (1870) (“[Holyday] is rested upon the broad ground that ‘it is pro bono publico to stay such offenders,’ which is equally applicable to every case of misdemeanor ... ”).	Yes
330	And “participate” means simply “to take part,” Webster's Ninth 858, or “to have a share, to take part in something,” Oxford 487; see also Black's 1007 (defining “participate” as “[t]o receive or have a part or share of; to partake of; experience in common with others; to have or enjoy a part or share in common with others”).	Yes
331	An alien has been defined to be ‘one born out of the jurisdiction of the United States, and who has not been naturalized under their Constitution anl laws.’ 2 Kent, Com. 50; 1 Bouvier's Law Dict. 129.	Yes

333	"""We explained in Lopez that 'ordinarily ‘trafficking’ means some sort of commercial dealing."" "	Yes
334	"At the founding, 'search' did not mean a violation of someone's reasonable expectation of privacy. The word was probably not a term of art, as it does not appear in legal dictionaries from the era. And its ordinary meaning was the same as it is today...""  (then Thomas goes on to cite ordinary dictionaries) "	Yes
335	Further, it appears that the phrases “gives evidence” and “furnishes evidence” were not simply descriptions of the act of providing testimony. For example, in King v. Purnell, 1 Black. 37, 96 Eng. Rep. 20 (K.B.1748), the phrase “furnish evidence” is repeatedly used to refer to the compelled production of books, records, and archives in response to a government request. Id., at 40, 41, 42, 96 Eng. Rep., at 21, 22, 23. See also, e.g., King v. Cornelius, 2 Str. 1210, 1211, 93 Eng. Rep. 1133, 1134 (K.B.1744) (compelling discovery of books “is in effect obliging a defendant ... to furnish evidence against himself”); 1 T. Cunningham, New and Complete Law–Dictionary (2d ed. 1771) (evidence “signifies generally all proof, be it testimony of men, records or writings”); 1 G. Jacob, The Law–Dictionary (T. Tomlins ed. 1797) (defining “evidence” as “[p]roof by testimony of witnesses, on oath; or by writings or records”).	Yes
336	The execution of the bond included its signing, sealing, and delivery	Yes
337	"To the contrary, 'administer' is consistently defined in purely nondiscretionary terms."" See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 27 (1961) (“to manage the affairs of,” “to direct or superintend the execution, use, or conduct of ”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 26 (2d ed.1987) (“to manage (affairs, a government, etc.); have executive charge of”); Black's Law Dictionary 44 (6th ed. 1990) (“To manage or conduct”).

338	"""Both before and after the time when the Dictionary Act and § 1983 were passed, the phrase 'bodies politic and corporate' was understood to include the States."" "	Yes
339	" In fact 'proximate' causation simply means 'direct' causation."" (Then Scalia cites defintions in both Black's Law Dictionary and Webster's) "	Yes
340	A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it, Black's Law Dictionary 431, and a court's subject-matter jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210. 	Yes
341	". 'Solicitation,' commonly understood means . . ."" "	Yes
342	 The phrase “resulting from” means “proceed[ing], *221 spring[ing], or aris[ing] as a consequence, effect, or conclusion.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1937 (1971). 	Yes
343	The principle that a civil conspiracy plaintiff must claim injury from an act of a tortious character was so widely accepted at the time of RICO's adoption as to be incorporated in the common understanding of “civil conspiracy.” See Ballentine's Law Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 1969) (“It is the civil wrong resulting in damage, and not the conspiracy which constitutes the cause of action”); Black's Law Dictionary 383 (4th ed. 1968) (“[W]here, in carrying out the design of the conspirators, overt acts are done causing legal damage, the person injured has a right of action” (emphasis added)).	Yes
344	And “remuneration” means “a quid pro quo,” “recompense” or “reward” for such services. Id., at 1528. 	Yes
345	A lease, if not terminable at will by the State or terminable automatically upon sale or condemnation, is clearly an 'encumbrance.' 7 G. Thompson, Real Property s 3183, p. 277 (1962); 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1530 (8th ed. 1914).	Yes
346	"""Schindler argues that 'report' in the FCA's public disclosure bar carries its ordinary meaning and that the DOL's written responses to Mrs. Kirk's FOIA requests are therefore 'reports.' We agree."" Schindler Elevator Corp. v. U.S. ex rel. Kirk, 563 U.S. 401, 407, 131 S.Ct. 1885, 1890 (2011). "	Yes
347	The verb “harm” has a range of meaning: “to cause injury” at its broadest, “to do hurt or damage” in a narrower and more direct sense. See, e.g., 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (“Harm, v.t. To hurt; to injure; to damage; to impair soundness of body, either animal or vegetable”) (emphasis added); American College Dictionary 551 (1970) (“harm ... n. injury; damage; hurt: to do him bodily harm ”). In fact the more directed sense of “harm” is a somewhat more common and preferred usage; “harm has in it a little of the idea of specially focused hurt or injury, as if a personal injury has been anticipated and intended.” J. Opdycke, Mark My Words: A Guide to Modern Usage and Expression 330 (1949). See also American Heritage Dictionary 662 (1985) ( “Injure has the widest range.... Harm and hurt refer principally to what causes physical or mental distress to living things”). 	Yes
348	But this exercise in isolated definition is ultimately inconclusive, for, depending on where one looks, “remedy” can mean either specific relief obtainable at the end of a process of seeking redress, **1824 or the process itself, the procedural avenue leading to some relief. See Black's Law Dictionary 1296 (7th ed.1999) (defining “remedy” alternatively as “[t]he means of enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong,” or as “REMEDIAL ACTION.... Cf. RELIEF”).	Yes
349	Regardless, the formal “medium of exchange” definition is not the only dictionary definition of “money,” now or then. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, included in its definition “property or possessions of any kind viewed as convertible into money,” 6 Oxford English Dictionary 603 (1st ed. 1933); Black's Law Dictionary said that money was the representative of “everything that can be transferred in commerce,” Black's Law Dictionary 1200 (3d ed. 1933); and the New Century Dictionary defined money as “property considered with reference to its pecuniary value,” 1 New Century Dictionary of the English Language 1083 (1933).	Yes
350	"""...the majority [of the New York Court of Appeals] held, first, that 'sacrilegious' was an adequately definite standard, quoting a definition from Frunk & Wagnalls' Dictionary and referring to opinions in this Court that in passing used the term 'profane,' which the New York court said was a synonym of 'sacrilegiious.'"" "	Yes
351	That the statutory phrase uses the term “solicitation” in a more general sense that includes not merely the ultimate act of inviting an order but the entire process associated with the invitation is suggested by the fact that § 381 describes “the solicitation of orders” as a subcategory, not of in-state acts, but rather of in-state “business activities ”-a term that more naturally connotes courses of conduct. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 22 (1981) (defining “activity” as “an occupation, pursuit, or recreation in which a person is active-often used in pl. <business activities>”).	Yes
352	An appraised valuation is the market value of property. See id., at 129, 115 S.Ct. 557 (defining “appraise” as “to fix and state the true value of a thing”)	Yes
353	"""It would be incronguous to read [§ 188.029] to read this provision, especially the word 'necessary,' to require the performance of tests irrelevant to the expressed statutory purpose of determining viability."" Webster v. Reproductive Health Serv., 492 U.S. 490, 515 n.13, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 3055 n.13 (1989). "	Yes
354	Indeed, the word 'smuggling,' as used, carries with it the implication of knowledge.	Yes
355	A vacation is defined by Bouvier to be the period of time between the end of one term and the beginning of another.	Yes
356	In Brown's Law Dictionary (Eng., 1874), smuggling is defined as ‘importing goods which are liable to duty so as to evade payment of duty,’ and in McClain's Criminal Law (section 1351), as importing dutiable goods without payment.... In the Encyclopedia Britannica ‘smuggling’ is said to denote ‘a breach of the revenue laws, either by the importation or the exportation of prohibited goods, or by the evasion of customs duties on goods liable to duty’; and Stephen, in his Summary of the Criminal Law (page 89), defines smuggling as the ‘importing or exporting of goods without paying the duties imposed thereon by the laws of customs and excise, or of which the importation or exportation is prohibited.’ Similar definitions are given by Lord Hume in his Commentaries on the Laws of Scotland, as well as in Bell's Dictionary of Scottish Law, p. 225. In Tomlin's Law Dictionary, where smuggling is defined as ‘the offense of importing or exporting goods without paying the duties imposed thereon by the custom or excise laws,’ a list of some 30 or 40 acts connected with the unlawful and fraudulent importation of goods is given, but in none of them is the word ‘smuggle’ mentioned as an offense.	Yes
357	An embargo is “a prohibition imposed by law upon commerce either in general or in one or more of its branches,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 738 (1981), a “[g]overnment order prohibiting commercial trade with individuals or businesses of other nations,” Black's Law Dictionary 468 (5th ed. 1979), an “[a]uthoritative stoppage of foreign commerce or of any special trade,” Funk & Wagnalls New International Dictionary of the English Language 411 (1984).	Yes
358	“In the United States, a body of men appointed for the advancement and protection of business interests. Cf. chamber of commerce.”	Yes
359	"Color of law' does not mean actual law. 'Color,' as a modifier, in legal parlance, means 'appearance, as distinguished from reality.' Color of law means 'mere semblance of legal right.'"" "	Yes
360	"We thus think it likely that Congress had comparable scope in mind when it used the term “facilitate,” a word with equivalent meaning (then compares definition of ""aid and abet"" to ""faciliate"") "	Yes
361	"""Alternatively, however, the term may also be used to encompass persons with other mental conditions, so long as they are 'severe enough [to] prevent[ ] a person from having legal capacity and excuse[ ] the person from criminal or civil responsibility.' Black's Law Dictionary 914 (10th ed. 2014). In that different understanding, 'insanity' connotes a general standard of legal competency rather than a more limited description of delusional disorders."" "	Yes
362	And “[t]his understanding of the Sixth Amendment language—‘accused’ as distinct from ‘convicted’ ...—endures today.” Betterman, 578 U. S., at ––––, 136 S.Ct., at 1614 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 26 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “accused” as “a person who has been arrested and brought before a magistrate or who has been formally charged” (emphasis added))). at 2392	Yes
363	A proviso in deeds, or laws, is a limitation or exception to a grant made, or authority conferred, the effect of which is to declare that the one shall not operate, or the other be exercised, unless in the case provided.	Yes
364	 But whether “ownership” is the “[c]ollection of rights to use and enjoy property, including [the] right to transmit it to others,” or “[t]he complete dominion, title, or proprietary right in a thing,” or “[t]he entirety of the powers of use and disposal allowed by law,” id., at 997, the parent corporation—not the subsidiary whose every decision it controls—better fits the bill as the true owner of any property that the subsidiary nominally possesses.	Yes
365	“[D]etention” is defined by legal and nonlegal dictionaries alike as a “compulsory,” “forced,” or “punitive” containment. Black's Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed.1999) (compulsory); American Heritage Dictionary 494 (4th ed.2000) (forced or punitive).	Yes
366	“Every order thereafter made in that court [is] coram non judice,” meaning “not before a judge.” Steamship Co. v. Tugman, 106 U.S. 118, 122, 1 S.Ct. 58, 27 L.Ed. 87 (1882); Black's Law Dictionary 426 (11th ed. 2019).

368	"An ""act"" is ""[s]omething done or performed…; a deed."" Black's Law Dictionary 30 (11th ed. 2019); see also Webster's New International Dictionary 25 (2d ed. 1934) (""that which is done,"" ""the exercise of power,"" a ""deed""). "	Yes

370	This understanding of the Sixth Amendment language—“accused” as distinct from “convicted,” and “trial” as separate from “sentencing”—endures today. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 26 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “accused” as “a person who has *1615 been arrested and brought before a magistrate or who has been formally charged ” (emphasis added)); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32 (governing “Sentencing and Judgment,” the rule appears in the chapter on “Post–Conviction Procedures,” which follows immediately after the separate chapter headed “Trial”).	Yes
371	"After citing to numerous legal authorities and the law dictionary, ""I omit further citations of authorities, which are numerous, to prove that, according to the settled usages and modes of proceeding existing under the common and statute law of England at the settlement of this country, information in capital cases was not consistent with the ‘law of the land’ or with due process of law.'"" at 296"	Yes

378	Stare decisis (“to stand by things decided”) is the legal term for fidelity to precedent. Black's Law Dictionary 1696 (11th ed. 2019).	Yes
379	"""Given that the ordinary meaning of 'restitution' is restoring someone to a position he occupied before a particular event, the repeated focus in § 3579 on the offense of which the defendant was convicted suggests strongly that restitution as authorized by the statute is intended to compensate victims only for losses caused by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction.""

Webster's *229 defines “to use” as “[t]o convert to one's service” or “to employ.” Webster's New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed. 1939).

405	In limine' has been defined as '[o]n or at the threshold; at the very beginning; preliminarily.' Black's Law Dictionary 708 (5th ed. 1979). We use the term in a broad sense to refer to any motion, whether made before or during trial, to exclude anticipated prejudicial evidence before the evidence is actually offered.	Yes
406	it is defined: ‘A relative term without technical meaning. It may be employed as meaning disqualification; inability; incapacity; lack of ability, legal qualifications, or fitness to discharge the required duty.’ In Black's Law Dictionary, 3rd edition, page 945, and in 1 Bouv.Law Dict., Rawle's Third Revision, p. 1528, it is defined as ‘Lack of ability or fitness to discharge the required duty.’ Cases construing the word to the same effect are found in 4 Words and Phrases, First Series, page 3510, and 2 Words and Phrases, Second Series, page 1013.* Webster's New International Dictionary defines it as ‘want of physical, intellectual, or moral ability; insufficiency; inadequacy; specif., want of legal qualifications or fitness.’ Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary defines it as ‘General lack of capacity of fitness, or lack of the special qualities required for a particular purpose.‘‘	Yes
407	A key feature of insurance is that it indemnifies loss. See Black's Law Dictionary 802 (6th ed. 1990) (first definition of insurance is “contract whereby, for a stipulated consideration, one party undertakes to compensate the other for loss on a specified subject by specified perils”). 	Yes
408	The transitive verb “ ‘award’ ” has a settled meaning in the litigation context: It means “[t]o give or assign by sentence or judicial determination.” Black's Law Dictionary 125 (5th ed.1979) (emphasis added); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 152 (1993) (“to give by judicial decree” (emphasis added)).	Yes
409	"A person is entitled to do something only if he has a ""right"" to do it. Black's Law Dictionary 477 (5th ed. 1979); see also American Heritage Dictionary 437 (def. 3a) (198a) (to ""allow"" or to ""qualify""). "	Yes
410	...the latter was then informed ... that he could file an answer and apply for the discharge of the writ immediately. ... It could have meant but one thing, namely, that it was in the power of Durant to obtain, without objection, if not of right, a discharge of the writ, after answering, by executing a bond of some kind. A party arrested upon ne exeat may obtain the discharge of the writ, upon motion or petition...	Yes
411	“Prosecution,” as Blackstone used the term, referred to “instituting a criminal suit,” id., at *309, by filing a formal charging document—an indictment, presentment, or information—upon which the defendant was to be tried in a court with power to punish the alleged offense. And, significantly, Blackstone's usage appears to have accorded with the ordinary meaning of the term. See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (defining “prosecution” as “[t]he institution or commencement and continuance of a criminal suit; the process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender *222 before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment,” and noting that “[p]rosecutions may be by presentment, information or indictment”).	Yes
412	“Corrupt” and “corruptly” are normally associated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil. See Black's 371; Webster's 3d 512; Am. Hert. 299–300. 	Yes
413	When a sovereign furnishes an opportunity to appeal (as state and federal governments now do), it necessarily invites an appellate court to revisit an initial merits determination. See J. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 148–153 (5th ed. 2019) (describing development of the appeal at common law); G. Jacob, A New Law-Dictionary (1729) (defining “appeal”).	Yes
414	See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 1188 (7th ed.1999) (potential: “[c]apable of coming into being; possible”); id., at 1328 (risk: “[t]he chance of injury, damage, or loss; danger or hazard”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1775 (1971) (potential: “existing in possibility: having the capacity or a strong possibility for development into a state of actuality”); id., at 1961 (risk: “the possibility of loss, injury, disadvantage, or destruction”).	Yes
415	Prison, by contrast, is a “state or federal facility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp. felons.” Id., at 1314.	Yes
416	And though there is some controversy whether, in reference to personal property, the consideration is not to be paid in money, the use of the old phrase ‘bargain and sale,’ in regard to land, never required that the consideration should be exclusively a money payment. 2 Bouv. Law Dict. p. 494, cl. 6, ‘Sale.’	Yes
417	At the time of both the 1948 and 2008 amendments to the Act, the primary definition of “offense” in Black's Law Dictionary referred to crime. Black's Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed. 2004) (Black's) (“A violation of the law; a crime, often a minor one. See CRIME”); id., at 1232 (4th ed. 1951) (“A crime or misdemeanor; a breach of the criminal laws”); id., at 1282 (3d ed. 1933) (same). The 1942 edition of Webster's similarly states that “offense” “has no technical legal meaning; but it is sometimes used specifically for an indictable crime ... and sometimes for a misdemeanor or wrong punishable only by fine or penalty.” Webster's New International Dictionary 1690 (2d ed.). See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1566 (1976) (Webster's Third) (“an infraction of law: CRIME, MISDEMEANOR”); American Heritage Dictionary 1255 (3d ed. 1992) (“A transgression of law; a crime”). It is true that the term “offense” is sometimes used more broadly. For instance, the 1948 edition of Ballentine's Law Dictionary cautions: “The words ‘crime’ and ‘offense’ are not necessarily synonymous. All crimes are offenses, but some offenses are not crimes.” Ballentine's Law Dictionary 900.	Yes
418	According to legal as well as standard dictionary definitions available in 2005, a “defendant” is a “person sued in a civil proceeding,” Black's Law Dictionary 450 (8th ed. 2004), and the term is “opposed to” (contrasted with) the word “plaintiff,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 591 (2002) (Webster). 	Yes
419	This mere recital of the facts concerning that action at law seems sufficient answer to the plea of res judicata, for among the essentials of an estoppel by judgment is identity of the cause of action. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Commissioners of Jefferson Co., 12 Kan. 127; 2 Bouv. Law Dict. tit. ‘Res Judicata.’ 	Yes

421	Contemporaneous editions of legal dictionaries defined “maturity” as “[t]he time when a ... note becomes due.” Black's Law Dictionary 1170 (3d ed. 1933); Cyclopedic Law Dictionary 649 (2d ed. 1922).	Yes
422	The simplest and first definition of “contrary to” as a phrase is “in conflict with.” Webster's *389 Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 285 (1983). 	Yes
423	That would be a term of breadth indeed, for “aid and abet” “comprehends all assistance rendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, or presence.” Black's Law Dictionary 68 (6th ed. 1990).	Yes
424	We have recognized that the modifier “any” can mean “different things depending upon the setting,”  Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541 U.S. 125, 132, 124 S.Ct. 1555, 158 L.Ed.2d 291 (2004), but in the context of 29 U.S.C. § 203(k), it is best read to mean “ ‘one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,’ ” United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)).	Yes
425	The word 'impound,' in its application to funds, means to take or retain in 'the custody of the law.' Black's Law Dictionary 681 (5th ed., 1979); Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1515 (8th ed., 1914).	Yes
426	"Usufructuary rights are 'a real right of limited duration on the property of another.'"" at 217-18. "	Yes

428	It is supposed that courts-martial were intended originally to be a partial substitute for the court of chivalry of former times. 3 Christian's Bl. 68, 108; Bouv. Law Dict., tit. Courts-martial. 	Yes
429	Though the Rule no longer describes such parties as “necessary,” “necessary party” is a term of art whose meaning parallels *603 Rule 19(a)'s requirements. See Black's Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed.1979) (defining “necessary parties” as “those persons who must be joined in an action because, inter alia, complete relief cannot be given to those already parties without their joinder,” and citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)).	Yes
430	“Capable” means “susceptible” or “having attributes ... required for performance or accomplishment” or “having traits conducive to or features permitting.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 203 (1983); see also Oxford American Dictionary and Thesaurus 180 (2d ed. 2009) (“having the ability or quality necessary to do”).	Yes
431	"""The Court seems to rely in part on 'common usage' of the word 'willful' in adopting the 'knowing or reckless' standard, citing Roget's International Thesaurus...The Court fails to acknowledge, however, that the dictionary includes a wide variety of definitions of 'willful,' ranging from 'malicious' to 'not accidental,' and including precisely the intermediate definition urged by the Secretary—under which an act is willful if it is 'done without ground for believing it is lawful.' Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979)"" "	Yes
432	On the one hand, a law dictionary in use in 1867 defines the word “defalcation” as “the act of a defaulter,” which, in turn, it defines broadly as one “who is deficient in his accounts, or fails in making his accounts correct.” 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 387, 388 (4th ed. 1852). See also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 369 (2d ed. 1989) (quoting an 1846 definition that defines the term as *272 “ ‘a breach of trust by one who has charge or management of money’ ”). Modern dictionaries contain similarly broad definitional language. Black's Law Dictionary, for example, defines “defalcation” first as “EMBEZZLEMENT,” but, second, as “[l]oosely, the failure to meet an obligation; a nonfraudulent default.” Black's Law Dictionary 479 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black's). See also American Heritage Dictionary 474 (5th ed. 2011) (“To misuse funds; embezzle”); 4 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 369 (“monetary deficiency through breach of trust by one who has the management or charge of funds; a fraudulent deficiency in money matters”); Webster's New International Dictionary 686 (2d ed. 1954) (“An abstraction or misappropriation of money by one, esp. an officer or agent, having it in trust”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 590 (1986) (“misappropriation of money in one's keeping”).

437	Instead, the fifth definition of that word—“[c]harge, oversight, or management”—is clearly the relevant one. The point is only that context, as well as common sense, matters when selecting among possible definitions.	Yes
438	Evans described this damage as “neurotoxicity,” which is “the quality of exerting a destructive or poisonous effect upon the nerve tissue.” The Sloane–Dorland Annotated Medical–Legal Dictionary 498 (1987).	Yes
439	For example, it is unclear why a physician's nonbinding commitment to prescribe a drug in an appropriate case cannot qualify as a sale under this test. The broad term “transaction” easily encompasses such a commitment. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2425 (2002) (hereinafter Webster's Third) (defining “transaction” to mean “a communicative action or activity involving two parties or two things reciprocally affecting or influencing each other”). 	Yes
440	Even by itself, the word “violent” in § 924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Webster's Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement ... ”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.1989) ( “[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength”); Black's 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force”).	Yes
441	"The latest edition of Black's Law Dictionary available when Congress enacted the Privacy Act defined 'actual damages' as…..."" But this general (and notably circular) definition is of little value here because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed, the precise meaning of the term 'changes with the specific statute in which it is found.'"""	Yes
442	See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–27; see also, e.g., 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 5.1, p. 333 (2d ed.2003) (hereinafter LaFave) (explaining that some common-law crimes require that the crime be done “ ‘maliciously’ ”); Black's Law Dictionary 968 (7th ed.1999) (defining malice as “[t]he intent, without justification or excuse, to commit a wrongful act”).	Yes
443	Dr. Johnson, with his customary disregard of conventionalities, defines the verb ‘to smuggle’ as ‘to import or export goods without paying the customs,’ and a smuggler as ‘a wretch who, in defiance of justice and the laws, imports or exports goods, either contraband or without paying the customs.’	Yes
444	In common legal parlance, the word “court” can mean “[t]he judge or judges, as distinguished from the counsel or jury.” Webster's New International Dictionary 611 (2d ed.1949) (def. 10d). But it also has a broader meaning, which includes both judge and jury. See, e.g., ibid. (def. 10b: “The persons duly assembled under authority of law for the administration of justice”); Black's Law Dictionary 318 (5th ed.1979) (“... A body organized to administer justice, and including both judge and jury”). 	Yes
445	“Elements” are the “constituent parts” of a crime's legal definition—the things the “prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.” Black's Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014).  	Yes
446	It refers to a dictionary that defines an amortization plan as ‘one where there are partial payments of the principal, and accrued interest, at stated periods for a definite time, at the expiration of which the entire indebtedness will be extinguished.'	Yes
447	They begin with the object of § 109(b)(1)' s focus, the “public health.” When the term first appeared in federal clean air legislation—in the Act of July 14, 1955 (1955 Act), 69 Stat. 322, which expressed “recognition of the dangers to the public health” from air pollution—its ordinary meaning was “[t]he health of the community.” Webster's New International Dictionary 2005 (2d ed.1950). Respondents argue, however, that § 109(b)(1), as added by the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, meant to use the term's secondary meaning: “[t]he ways and means of conserving the health *466 of the members of a community, as by preventive medicine, organized care of the sick, etc.” Ibid. 	Yes
448	" ""A mistake is '[a]n error, misconception, or misunderstanding; an erroneous belief.' Black's Law Dictionary 1092 (9th ed.2009); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1446 (2002) (defining 'mistake' as 'a misunderstanding of the meaning or implication of something'; 'a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment,  inadequate knowledge, or inattention'; 'an erroneous belief'; or 'a state of mind not in accordance with the facts')."" "	Yes
449	In other legal usage, the word ‘color,’ as in ‘color of authority,’ ‘color of law,’ ‘color of office,’ ‘color of title,’ and ‘colorable,’ suggests a kind of holding out and means ‘appearance, semblance, or simulacrum,’ but not necessarily the reality. See H. Black, Law Dictionary 331—332 (rev.4th ed. 1968).	Yes
450	The term “confidential” meant then, as it does now, “private” or “secret.” Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 174 (1963).Contemporary dictionaries suggest two conditions that might be required for information communicated to another to be considered confidential. In one sense, information communicated to another remains confidential whenever it is customarily kept private, or at least closely held, by the person imparting it. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 476 (1961) (“known only to a limited few” or “not publicly disseminated”); Black's Law Dictionary 370 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (“intended to be held in confidence or kept secret”).  	Yes
451	“Context” here means the text of the Act of Congress surrounding the word at issue, or the texts of other related congressional Acts, and this is simply an instance of the word's ordinary meaning: “[t]he part or parts of a discourse preceding or following a ‘text’ or passage or a word, or so intimately associated with it as to throw light upon its meaning.” Webster's New International Dictionary 576 (2d ed. 1942). 	Yes
452	f the grand jury  was “satisfied of the truth of the accusation,” it endorsed the indictment, id., at *305–*306, which was then “publicly delivered into court,” id., at *306, “afterwards to be tried and determined,” id., at *303, “before an officer having power to punish the [charged] offence,” 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).	Yes

457	lthough we have never undertaken to define “forthwith” as it is used in the SAA, it is clear that the term “connotes action which is immediate, without delay, prompt, and with reasonable dispatch.” Amella v.

461	This commonsense principle of construction is sometimes referred to as the canon of ejusdem generis: “[W]hen a general word or phrase follows a list of specific persons or things, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only persons or things of the same type as those listed.” Black's Law Dictionary 535 (7th ed. 1999) (Black's); see, e.g., Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 384–385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003).  	Yes
462	That is because the words “own” and “ownership”—neither of which is defined in the FSIA—are not technical terms or terms of art but common terms, the precise legal meaning of which depends upon the statutory context in which they appear. See J. Cribbet & C. Johnson, Principles of the Law of Property 16 (3d ed. 1989) (“Anglo–American law has not made much use of the term ownership in a technical sense”); Black's Law Dictionary 1049, 1105 (6th *482 ed. 1990) (“The term [‘owner’] is ... a nomen generalissimum”—a “term of the most general meaning” or “of the most general kind”—“and its meaning is to be gathered from the connection in which it is used, and from the subject-matter to which it is applied”).	Yes
463	Rather, the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs (whatever the motive behind them) are the type of actions by which a private party engages in “trade and traffic or commerce,” Black's Law Dictionary 270 (6th ed. 1990). 	Yes
464	Different words are certainly employed in the two provisions, but it is difficult to see ... in what respect the difference of phraseology supports the theory of the defendants, as ‘a suit by a plaintiff against a defendant’ must mean substantially the same thing in the practical sense as ‘a suit in which there is controversy between the parties,’ as each provision includes the word suit, which applies to any proceeding in a court of justice in which the plaintiff pursues his remedy to recover a right or claim. 	Yes

470	A supervised-release revocation proceeding is not part of the criminal prosecution that landed a defendant in prison in the first place because “[a] ‘criminal prosecution’ ... ends when sentence has been pronounced on the convicted or a verdict of ‘Not guilty’ has cleared the defendant of the charge.” F. Heller, Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 54 (1951). This follows from the early understanding that a “prosecution” concludes when a court enters final judgment. See, e.g., Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (defining a prosecution as the “process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment” (emphasis added)); The Universal English Dictionary 465 (J. Craig ed. 1869) (“[T]he institution of legal proceedings against a person; the process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment” (emphasis added)); H.

472	When Congress passed ERISA, the word “actual” meant what it means today: “existing in fact or reality.” Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 10 (1967); accord, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 13 (11th ed. 2005) (same); see also American Heritage Dictionary 14 (1973) (“In existence; real; factual”); id., at 18 (5th ed. 2011) (“Existing in reality and not potential, possible, simulated, or false”). So did the word “knowledge,” which meant and still means “the fact or condition of being aware of something.” Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 469 (1967); accord, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 691 (2005) (same); see also American Heritage Dictionary 725 (1973) (“Familiarity, awareness, or understanding gained through experience or study”); id., at 973 (2011) (same). Thus, to have “actual knowledge” of a piece of information, one must in fact be aware of it.	Yes
473	A “certification” requires one “[t]o attest” that the accompanying statements are true. Black's Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed.2009) (definition of “certify”); see also id., at 147 (defining “attest” as “[t]o bear witness; testify,” or “[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to authenticate by signing as a witness”).

477	"""The word 'services' ordinarily refers to 'labor performed for another.' "	Yes
478	The word “try,” both in 1787 and later, has considerably broader meanings than those to which petitioner would limit it. Older dictionaries define try as *230 “[t]o examine” or “[t]o examine as a judge.” See 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (1785). In more modern usage the term has various meanings. For example, try can mean “to examine or investigate judicially,” “to conduct the trial of,” or “to put to the test by experiment, investigation, or trial.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2457 (1971). 	Yes
479	Neither the statute nor the regulations define “disposition,” but dictionary definitions of the term range from “relinquishment or alienation” to “arrangement.” See Webster's New International Dictionary 644 (def. 1(b)) (1927) (“[t]he getting rid, or making over, of anything; relinquishment or alienation”); ibid. (def. 1(a)) (“[t]he ordering, regulating, or administering of anything”); 3 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 493 (def. 4) (“[t]he action of disposing of, putting away, getting rid of, making over, etc.”); ibid. (def. 1) (“[t]he action of setting in order, or condition of being set in order; arrangement, order”).

487	Facts, by contrast, are mere real-world things—extraneous to the crime's legal requirements. (We have sometimes called them “brute facts” when distinguishing them from elements. Richardson, 526 U.S., at 817, 119 S.Ct. 1707.) They are “circumstance[s]” or “event[s]” having no “legal effect [or] consequence”: In particular, they need neither be found by a jury nor admitted by a defendant. Black's Law Dictionary 709.	Yes
488	In its customary and preferred sense, “fail” connotes some omission, fault, or negligence on the part of the person who has failed to do something. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 910 (2d ed.1939) (defining “fail” as “to be wanting; to fall short; to be or become deficient in any measure or degree,” and “failure” as “a falling short,” “a deficiency or *432 lack,” and an “[o]mission to perform”); Webster's New International Dictionary 814 (3d ed.1993) (“to leave some possible or expected action unperformed or some condition unachieved”). See also Black's Law Dictionary 594 (6th ed.1990) (defining “fail” as “[f]ault, negligence, or refusal”). To say a person has failed in a duty implies he did not take the necessary steps to fulfill it.	Yes
489	See Black's Law Dictionary 1198 (3d ed. 1933) (defining “modification” as “A change; an alteration which introduces new elements into the details, or cancels some of them, but leaves the general purpose and effect of the subject-matter intact”).	Yes

492	"""Since an 'affiant' is simply a person who makes an affidavit and an artificial entity can make an affidavit through an agent, it is hardly unreasonable to understand the word 'affiant' in § 1915(a) as a reference not to the agent but to the entity on whose behalf the affidavit is made."" "	Yes
493	Federal courts may issue nunc pro tunc orders, or “now for then” orders, Black's Law Dictionary, at 1287, to “reflect[ *701 ] the reality” of what has already occurred, Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 49, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 109 L.Ed.2d 31 (1990). 	Yes

495	Now a ‘return’ implies the prior existence of some state or condition. Webster defines it ‘to turn back; to go or come again to the same place or condition.’ In the Standard dictionary it is defined ‘to cause to take again a former position; put, carry, or send back, as to a former place or holder.’ A technical meaning in the law is thus given in Black's Law Dictionary: ‘The act of a sheriff, constable, or other ministerial officer, in delivering back to the court a writ, notice, or other paper.’	Yes

505	"""And it certainly derives no support from the use of the word 'send,' whose ordinary meaning is broad enough to cover the transmission of any judicial documents (including litigation-initiating documents)"""	Yes
506	Everyone agrees, however, that “under” is often used to mean “authorized by.” See, e.g., Webster's New World College Dictionary 1453 (3d ed. 1997) (“authorized ... by”); American Heritage Dictionary 1945 (3d ed. 1992) (“With the authorization of”); see also Brief for Respondent 24 (agreeing that “under” can mean “subject to,” “governed by,” or “issued under the authority of”); Brief for Petitioner 28. 	Yes
507	An “enactment” is the product of legislation, not adjudication. See Webster's New International Dictionary 841 (2d ed.1949) (defining “enact” as “[t]o make into an act or law; esp., to perform the legislative act with reference to (a bill) which gives it the validity of law”);	Yes

509	A ‘condition subsequent is one annexed to an estate already vested, * * * and by the failure or non-performance of which it is defeated.'	Yes
510	The term “action,” however, refers to a judicial “proceeding,” or perhaps to a “suit”—not to the general content of claims. See Black's Law Dictionary 41 (3d ed. 1933) (defining “action” as, inter alia, “an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice”); see also id., at 43 (“The terms ‘action’ and ‘suit’ are ... nearly, if not entirely, synonymous”).

511	The phrase “scope of employment” is a well-known common-law concept that includes “[t]he range of reasonable and foreseeable activities that an employee engages in while carrying out the employer's business.” Black's Law Dictionary 1465 (9th ed. 2009).	Yes
512	"""Nor does it advance the ball very far to recognize from the statute's later reference to 'the cause of action alleged in such suit or process,' that the term 'claim' is used here synonymously with 'cause of action,' see Black's Law Dictionary 247 (6th ed. 1990) (defining 'claim' as 'cause of action'), since, as both parties admit, 'cause of action,' like 'claim,' can carry a variety of meanings..."	Yes
513	When used as an adjective, as it is here to modify “rules and practices,” that term refers to human resources matters. “Personnel,” in this common parlance, means “the selection, placement, and training of employees and ... the formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees or their representatives.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinafter Webster's). 	Yes
514	The framers understood the term “offence” to mean a “transgression.”	Yes
515	a remedy is the “legal means to recover a right ... or obtain redress for ... a wrong.” Webster's New International Dictionary **1231 of the English Language 819, 1878, 2106, 2418 (2d ed. 1934).	Yes
516	In usage, ‘statute’ is a term which has both a restricted and a broad signification. This is reflection in the following excerpt from Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawle's Revision: ‘Statute.-A law established by the act of the legislative power. An act of the Legislature. The written will of the Legislature, solemnly expressed according to the forms necessary to constitute it the law of the state.	Yes
517	According to the practice of legislation in England and America, (says Judge BOUVIER, 2 Law Dict. 363,) the copyright is confined to the exclusive right secured to the author or proprietor of a writing or drawing which may be multiplied by the arts of printing in any of its branches.	Yes
518	First, the word “use” in that provision is best read to require intentional conduct. As the majority recognizes, the noun “use” means “the ‘act of employing’ something.” Ante, at 2278 (quoting dictionaries). A “use” is “[t]he act of employing a thing for any ... purpose.” 19 Oxford English Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 1989). To “use” something, in other words, is to employ the thing for its instrumental value, i.e., to employ the thing to accomplish a further goal. See United States v. Castleman, 572 U.S. 157, 171, 134 S.Ct. 1405, 1414–1415, 188 L.Ed.2d 426 (2014). A “use,” therefore, is an inherently intentional act—that is, an act done for the purpose of causing certain consequences or at least with knowledge that those consequences will ensue. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 8A, p. 15 (1965) (defining intentional acts).	Yes
519	Some sources define ‘firm’ as ‘[t]he persons composing a partnership, taken collectively.’ II Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1232 (1914); see also Ballentine's Law Dictionary 507 (2d ed. 1948); Black's Law Dictionary 761–762 (4th ed. 1951); Crowell's Dictionary of Business and Finance 225 (rev. ed. 1930); Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance 238 (Garcia, 5th ed. 1949). But other dictionaries, while recognizing that narrow definition, also state that the word has a broader meaning in popular usage, connoting any business entity, including individual proprietorships. For example, the standard American reference defines ‘firm’ both as ‘a partnership of two or more persons not recognized as a legal person distinct from the members composing it’ and as any ‘business unit or enterprise.’ Webster's Third New International Dictionary—Unabridged 856 (1961). Accord, Clark & Gottfried, Dictionary of Business and Finance 152 (1957) (‘Strictly, an unincorporated business carried on by more than one person, jointly; a partnership. * * * In popular usage, any business, company, or concern, incorporated or not.’); Dictionary of Business and Industry 218 (Schwartz ed. 1954) (‘A business partnership; any business house or organization, no matter what its legal form * * *’); Dictionary of English Law 807 (1959) (‘the style or title under which one or several persons carry on business'); Dictionary of Foreign Trade 308 (Henius, 2d ed. 1947) (‘the name or title under which one or more persons do business').	Yes
520	Although the word “authorize” sometimes means simply “to permit,” it ordinarily denotes affirmative enabling action. Black's Law Dictionary 122 (5th ed. 1979) defines “authorize” as “[t]o empower; to give a right or authority to act.”	Yes
521	This Court has time and again recognized that “any” has “an expansive meaning,” bringing within a statute's reach all types of the item (here, “tangible object”) to which the law refers.	Yes
522	A judgment is normally said to have been rendered “on the merits” only if it was “delivered after the court ... heard and evaluated the evidence and the parties' substantive arguments.” Black's Law Dictionary 1199 (9th ed. 2009) 	Yes
523	When Rule 42(a) was adopted, the term was generally defined, as it is now, as meaning to “unite, as various particulars, into one mass or body; to bring together in close union; to combine.” Webster's New International Dictionary 570 (2d ed. 1942). Consolidation can thus sometimes signify the complete merger of discrete units: “The company consolidated two branches.” But the term can also mean joining together discrete units without causing them to lose their independent character. The United States, for example, is composed of States “unite[d], as various particulars, into one mass or body,” “br[ought] together in close union,” or “combine[d].” Yet all agree that entry *1125 into our Union “by no means implies the loss of distinct and individual existence ... by the States.” 	Yes
524	Specifically” can mean “explicitly, particularly, [or] definitely,” Black's Law Dictionary 1398 (6th ed.1990), thereby contrasting a specific reference with an implicit reference made by more general language to a broader topic. 	Yes
525	One would not expect general-usage dictionaries to have a separate entry for “falsely made,” but some of them do use precisely the phrase “to make falsely” to define “forged.” See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 990 (2d ed. (1945); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 891 (1961). 	Yes
526	As a matter of English usage, you cannot confirm that an event happened without already having some reason to believe at least that it might have happened. Black's Law Dictionary 298 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “confirm” as meaning “[t]o complete or establish that which was imperfect or uncertain”).  	Yes
527	A true “direct action” suit is “[a] lawsuit by a person claiming against an insured but suing the insurer directly instead of pursuing compensation indirectly through the insured.” Black's Law Dictionary 491 (8th ed.2004). 	Yes
528	In ordinary usage, “to procure” something is “to get possession of” it. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1809 (2002); accord, Black's Law Dictionary 1401 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “procure” as “[t]o obtain (something), esp. by special effort or means”). So to “procure ... naturalization” means to obtain naturalization (or, to use another word, citizenship).	Yes
529	The word ‘seized’ is not here used in that secondary sense in which it serves to describe the condition of a remainderman or reversioner in respect to his estate, when such estate, not discontinued by any act or neglect of the freeholder having the precedent estate, is perfect and unharmed, and simply awaits the determination of the precedent estate to vest in possession.	Yes
530	An insolvent is one who cannot pay, or who does not pay, his debts, or whose debts cannot be collected out of his means by legal process.	Yes
531	 Reversion signifies the returning of the land after a particular estate is ended. Jacobs' Law Dict., Tit. Reversion.	Yes
532	The word “substantive” in § 1395hh(e)(1) modifies the word “change,” and the phrase “substantive change” has a known meaning in the law. It refers to a change to the substance of a rule, rather than a technical change to its form. See, e.g., Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 572 U.S. 273, 282, 134 S.Ct. 1422, 188 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014) (noting that statutory recodification “did not effect any ‘substantive change’ ” to the law); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1469 (8th ed. 2004) (defining “substance” as, inter alia, “the essential quality of something, as opposed to its mere form” (emphasis added)).	Yes
533	Black's Law Dictionary cautions that the word ‘damage,’ meaning ‘loss, injury, or deterioration,’ is ‘to be distinguished from its plural,—’ damages,'—which means a compensation in money for a loss or damage.'	Yes
534	A treaty in its legal sense is defined by Bouvier as ‘a compact made between two or more independent nations with a view to the public welfare’ (2 Law Dict. 1136), and by Webster as ‘an argeement, league, or contract between two or more nations or sovereigns, formally signed by commissioners properly authorized, and solemnly ratified by the several sovereigns or the supreme power of each state.’	Yes
535	An “application” is a “putting to, placing before, preferring a request or petition *649 to or before a person. The act of making a request for something.” Black's Law Dictionary 98-99 (6th ed. 1990); see also Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 97 (1991) (application is a “request, petition ... a form used in making a request”).	Yes
536	A student of English lexicography would despair of finding the meaning attributed to ‘sacrilege’ by the New York court.(citing many dictionary definitions)	Yes
537	No business can establish good will -“ ‘[s]omething in business which gives reasonable expectancy of preference in race ... of competition’ ”- merely by broadcasting that it, as all businesses are expected to do, conducts itself in conformance with applicable state law. Black's Law Dictionary 625 (5th ed. 1979) (quoting In re Witkind's Estate, 167 Misc. 885, 895, 4 N.Y.S.2d 933, 947 (1938)).	Yes
538	"""The act of 'amending,' however, in both ordinary parlance and legal usage, has its own meaning separate and apart from the act of 'interpreting.' (See Black's Law Dictionary) "" "	Yes
539	"A child ""resides"" where she lives. See Black's Law Dictionary 1176 (5th ed. 1979) "	Yes
540	After all, the word “confidential” sometimes refers, at least in the national security context, to information the disclosure of which would cause harm. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 476 (1966) (defining “confidential” to mean “characterized by or relating to information considered prejudicial to a country's interests”); Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 237 (1974) (defining “confidential” to mean “containing information whose unauthorized disclosure could be prejudicial to the national interest”).	Yes
541	Dictionaries consistently define the noun “use” to mean the “act of employing” something. Webster's New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed. 1954) (“[a]ct of employing anything”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2097 (2d ed. 1987) (“act of employing, using, or putting into service”); Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990) (“[a]ct of employing,” “application”).	Yes
542	"Individual demands for relief within a lawsuit, by contrast, are ""claims."" See Black's Law Dictionary, at 311 (2019) (defining a ""claim"" as ""the part of a complaint in a civil action specifying what relief the plaintiff asks for""); Black's Law Dictionary, at 333 (1933) (defining a ""claim"" as ""any demand held or asserted as of right"" or ""cause of action"")."

543	A void judgment is a legal nullity. See Black's Law Dictionary 1822 (3d ed.1933); see also id., at 1709 (9th ed.2009).	Yes
544	And the berth must allow the vessel to come and go “always” safely afloat: That means afloat “at all times” and “in any event.” Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, at 35; see also New Oxford American Dictionary, at 47 (“always” means “at all times; on all occasions”). 	Yes
545	"""An application is 'filed,' as that term is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record. See...

Yes
548	The word 'license' means permission or authority; and a license to do any particular thing is a permission or authority to do that thing, and, if granted by a person having power to grant it, transfers to the grantee the right to do whatever it purposes to authorize. It certainly transfers to him all the right which the grantor can transfer to do what is within the terms of the license.' A license is a contract. 'It is a right given by some competent authority to do an act which, without such authority, would be illegal.'	Yes
549	An act is defined in the Century Dictionary as ‘an exertion of energy or force, mental or physical; anything that is done or performed; a doing or deed; an operation or performance.’ 	Yes
550	When used to modify the nouns “report, hearing, audit, or investigation,” in the context of a statutory provision about “the public disclosure” of fraud on the United States, the term is most naturally read to describe the activities of governmental agencies. See Black's Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black's) (defining “administration,” “[i]n public law, [as] the practical management and direction of the executive department and its agencies”).	Yes

552	A thing “results” when it “[a]rise[s] as an effect, issue, or outcome from some action, process or design.” 2 The New *211 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993). “Results from” imposes, in other words, a requirement of actual causality. 	Yes
553	An “inference” is generally understood to be a “conclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a logical consequence from them.” Black's Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed.1999).	Yes
554	Although the word “citizen” may imply (and in 1789 and 1875 may have implied) the enjoyment of certain basic rights and privileges, see Black's Law Dictionary 237 (7th ed.1999) (defining “citizen” as “entitled to enjoy all its civil rights and protections” of a community), 	Yes
555	In a general sense a magistrate is a public civil officer, possessing such power-legislative, executive, or judicial-as the government appointing him may ordain. In a narrow sense, a magistrate is regarded-perhaps, commonly regarded-as an inferior judicial officer, such as a justice of the peace. 2 Bouvier's Law Dict. 92. 	Yes
556	Renvoi is “[t]he doctrine under which a court in resorting to foreign law adopts as well the foreign law's conflict-of-laws principles, which may in turn refer the court back to the law of the forum.” Black's Law Dictionary 1300 (7th ed.1999).	Yes
557	The dictionary defines “impair” as to weaken, make worse, lessen in power, diminish, relax, or otherwise affect in an injurious manner. 	Yes

Yes
559	Although 'note' is often used generically to refer to any written promise to pay a specified sum on demand or at a specified time, it is also used more narrowly, to refer to any written promise to pay a specified sum on demand or at a specified time, it is also used, more narrowly, to refer to a particular kind of capital-raising debt instruement distributed under an indenture agreement, like bond or debentures but of shorter maturity.

560	"[""So""] refers to a stated, identifiable proposition from the ""preceding"" text; indeed, ""so"" typically ""[r]epresent[s]"" a ""word or phrase already employeed,"" thereby avoiding the need for repetition. 15 Oxford English Dictionary, at 887; see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2160 (1986) (so ""often used as a substitute... to express the idea of a preceding phrase"")."	Yes
561	 In more general usage it means “[s]trength or energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of strength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical relations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint exerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black's Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed.2009) (hereinafter Black's) defines “force” as “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.”  There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the word “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp.2003); accord, Black's 173.  	Yes

563	Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (“keep and bear Arms”) (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: “wear, bear, or carry ... upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose ... of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.”	Yes
564	In ordinary usage, the term “enjoin” means to “require,” “command,” or “direct” an action, or to “require a person ... to perform, or to abstain or desist from, some act.” Black's Law Dictionary 529 (6th ed.1990) (hereinafter Black's). See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 754 (1993) (defining “enjoin” to mean “to direct, prescribe, or impose by order”; “to prohibit or restrain by a judicial order or decree”).	Yes
565	A “collateral attack” is “[a]n attack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct appeal.” Black's Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed.2009) (emphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev.Code § 10.73.090(2) (2008) (defining “collateral attack” as “any form of post-conviction relief other than a direct appeal”).	Yes
566	A witness is one who “gives evidence in a cause.” T. Cunningham, 2 New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).	Yes
567	An ‘aggravated’ offense is one ‘made worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, *394 or the intent to commit another crime.’ ” Carachuri–Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.S. 563, 574, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 75 (9th ed. 2009)). 	Yes
568	 A 'right' is '[a] power, privilege, or immunity guaranteed under a constitution, statutes or decisional laws, or claimed as a result of long usage.' Black's Law Dictionary 1189 *702 (5th ed. 1979). 	Yes
569	 Taken literally, its “contributing-cause” test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or omission that makes a positive incremental contribution *218 , however small, to a particular result. See Brief for State of Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black's Law Dictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) **892 (defining “contributing cause” as “[a] factor that—though not the primary cause—plays a part in producing a result”).	Yes
570	Third, we know that when you purposefully seek or aim “to satisfy” an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full. (citing numerous dictionaries)	Yes
571	As a general matter, the meaning of “sanction” is spacious enough to cover not only what we have called punitive fines, but coercive ones as well, and use of the term carries no necessary implication that a reference to punitive fines is intended. 	Yes
572	In everyday speech, the closest synonyms of the verb “request” are “ask,” “petition,” and “entreat.” See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 1929 (3d ed. 1981); Black's Law Dictionary 1172 (5th ed. 1979). There is little reason to think that Congress did not intend “request” to bear its most common meaning when it used the word in § 1915(d). Although “request” may double for “demand” or “command” when it is used as a noun, particularly when employed as a term of art in connection with wills, trusts, and probate proceedings, its ordinary and natural signification when used as a verb was precatory when Congress enacted the provision now appearing at 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) in 1892. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 1027 (1st ed. 1891); 2 B. Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English Jurisprudence 415 (1879); 7 Judicial and Statutory Definitions of Words and Phrases 6120–6122 (West 1905).	Yes
573	"""We find no basis for petitioners' restriction of this term from its more common meaning, i.e., that 'tidelands' are lands 'over which the tide ebbs and flows ... land as is affected by the tide.' Black's Law Dictionary 1329 (5th ed. 1979)."" "	Yes
574	“Intent” is “[a] state of mind in which a person seeks to accomplish a given result through a course of action.” Black's Law Dictionary 810 (6th ed.1990).	Yes
575	First, in ordinary English and in light of the history of bail, the word “detain” is ambiguous in respect to the relevant point. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), surveying the history of the word, notes that Edward Hall, a famous 16th-century legal scholar and author of Hall's Chronicle, wrote: “A traytor ... is apprehended and deteigned in prisone for his offence,” a use of the word, as we know from Blackstone, that is consistent with bail. See supra, at 863 – 864 OED (3d ed., Dec. 2012), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176 (annot. to def. 1). David Hume, the famous 18th-century historian and philosopher, writes of being “detained in strict confinement,” thereby implying the existence of detention without strict confinement. Ibid. A 19th-century novelist writes, “ ‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ said the constable, ... ‘I shall be obliged to detain you till this business is settled’ ”—again a use of “detain” that we know (from Blackstone) is consistent with bail. Ibid. And the OED concludes that the primary meaning of “detain” is “[t]o keep in confinement or under restraint ; to keep prisoner.” Ibid. (emphasis added). 	Yes
576	efficient means “characterized by effective activity,” 	Yes
577	A condition precedent is one which must happen or be performed before the estate to which it is annexed can vest’ or which must be performed ‘before some right dependent thereon accrues.	Yes

579	"""Virtually every dictionary we are aware of says that “to modify” means to change moderately or in minor fashion."""	Yes
580	The last two verbs, “falsif[y]” and “mak[e] a false entry in,” typically take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “falsify” as “[t]o make deceptive; to counterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a document, record, etc.)”). It would be unnatural, for example, to describe a killer's act of wiping his fingerprints from a gun as “falsifying” the murder weapon. But it would not be strange to refer to “falsifying” data stored on a hard drive as simply “falsifying” a hard drive.	Yes
581	By contrast, an “assessed valuation” is the “[v]alue on each unit of which a prescribed amount must be paid as property taxes.” Id., at 149, 115 S.Ct. 557.	Yes
582	"""The common law of fraud confirms this characterization of Canada's right to excise taxes. Consistent with that understanding, fraud at common law included a scheme to deprive a victim of his entitlement to money. For instance, a debtor who concealed his assets when settling debts with his creditors thereby committed common-law fraud."" at 356."	Yes
583	“[T]he divergence between law and psychiatry is caused in part by the legal fiction represented by the words ‘insanity’ or ‘insane,’ which are a kind of lawyer's catchall and have no clinical meaning.” J. Biggs, The Guilty Mind 117 (1955); see also 2 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 1590 (8th ed. 1914) (“The legal and the medical ideas of insanity are essentially different, and the difference is one of substance”).	Yes
584	"""The plain language of the statute supports this straightforward approach."" . The word “describe” means to “express,” “portray,” or “represent.” See Black's Law Dictionary 445 (6th ed. 1990); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1986). A description may be “detailed” or it may be general, setting forth only the “recognizable features, or characteristic marks,” of the thing described while leaving the rest to the imagination. 4 Oxford English Dictionary 512 (2d ed. 1989)."	Yes
585	Webster's Dictionary defines “pitiless” to mean devoid of, or unmoved by, mercy or compassion. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1726 (1986). 	Yes
586	They are all ‘securities' of the United States; or, as Mr. Justice Bouvier defines that term, ‘instruments which render certain the performance of a contract.’	Yes
587	In constitutional terms, ‘veto’ is used to describe the President's power under Art. I, § 7, of the Constitution.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 925, n. 2, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 2771, n. 2, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983) (citing Black's Law Dictionary 1403 (5th ed.1979)).	Yes
588	A principle is a 'fundamental truth or doctrine, as of law; a comprehensive rule or doctrine which furnishes a basis or origin for others.' Black's Law Dictionary 1417 (3d ed. 1933); Black's Law Dictionary 1357 (4th ed. 1951).	Yes
589	Laws that purportedly regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts are laws having the “appearance of” regulating or “intending” to regulate insurance companies or contracts. Black's Law Dictionary 1236 (6th ed.1990).	Yes
590	The dictionary cited by the dissent, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), defines “detain” as follows: “[t]o keep in confinement or under restraint; to keep prisoner.” 4 OED 543 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis added); see also OED (3d ed. 2012), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176 (same). Other general-purpose dictionaries provide similar definitions. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 616 (1961) (“to hold or keep in or as if in custody {ed by the police for questioning}”); Webster's New International Dictionary 710 (2d ed. 1934) (“[t]o hold or keep as in custody”); American Heritage Dictionary 508 (def.2) (3d ed. 1992) (“To keep in custody or temporary confinement”); Webster's New World College Dictionary 375 (3d ed. 1997) (“to keep in custody; confine”). And legal dictionaries define “detain” the same way. See, e.g., Ballentine's Law Dictionary 343 (3d ed. 1969) (“To hold; to keep in custody; to keep”); Black's Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed. 1999) (“The act or fact of holding a person in custody; confinement or compulsory delay”).	Yes
591	In 1864, when the NBA was enacted, “visitation” was generally defined as “[i]nspection; superintendence; direction; [and] regulation.” 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 598 (1860); see also 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 633 (1852) (defining “visitation” as “[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation”). 	Yes
592	"Tangible object' in § 1519, we conclude, is better read to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world."" Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1081 (2015). "	Yes
593	The term “pending” means “[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision.” Black's 1314 (10th ed. 2014). See also Webster's Third 1669 (1976) (defining “pending” to mean “not yet decided: in continuance: in suspense”). If the reference to a “pending” action in the FCA is interpreted in this way, an earlier suit bars a later suit while the earlier suit remains undecided but ceases to bar that suit once it is dismissed. 	Yes
594	"""A court proceeding is defined as “[a]n act or step that is part of a larger action” and “an act done by the *219 authority or direction of the court.” "	Yes
595	The ordinary meaning of the term “discovery,” after all, is “the act, process, or an instance of gaining knowledge of or ascertaining the existence of something previously unknown or unrecognized.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 647 (1993). See also Black's Law Dictionary 465 (6th ed. 1990) (“[t]o get first sight or knowledge of”).	Yes
596	Respondent, by definition, collaterally attacked his previous convictions; he sought to deprive them of their normal force and effect in a proceeding that had an independent purpose other than to overturn the prior judgments. See Black's Law Dictionary 261 (6th ed. 1990); see also Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 58, 65, 100 S.Ct. 915, 917, 920, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980) (challenge to uncounseled prior conviction used as predicate for subsequent conviction characterized as “collateral”). 	Yes
597	The securities other than attachment referred to in this section were manifestly embraced in the class known at common law as ‘personal’ security, as distinguished from ‘real’ security, or security upon property. Sweet, Law Dict. verbo ‘Security.’	Yes
598	“Cold blood” is used “to designate a willful, deliberate, and premeditated homicide.” Black's Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990). As such, the term is used to differentiate between first- and second-degree murders.	Yes
599	In the sense relevant here, the term “structure” means “[t]he way in which parts are arranged or put together to form a whole” *946 and “[t]he interrelation or arrangement of parts in a complex entity.” American Heritage Dictionary 1718 (4th ed.2000); see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1410 (1967) (defining structure to mean, among other things, “the pattern of relationships, as of status or friendship, existing among the members of a group or society”).	Yes
600	That an agreement to pay $1,200 a ton for shucks, actually worth not more than $35 a ton, is a grossly unconscionable bargain, defined in Bouvier's Law Dictionary to be ‘a contract which no man in his senses, not under delusion, would make, on the one hand, and which no fair and honest man would accept on the other,’ nobody can doubt.	Yes
601	Of what use would the immunity be when there was no property to which it could apply? Further than this, there would be ground to argue that in a stricter sense the word appurtenances would include the immunity.	Yes
602	While § 216(b) provides *695 that an action “may be maintained ... in any ... State court of competent jurisdiction,” the word “maintain” enjoys a breadth of meaning that leaves its bearing on removal ambiguous at best. “To maintain an action” may mean “to continue” to litigate, as opposed to “commence” an action.1 Black's Law **1885 Dictionary 1143 (3d ed.1933). But “maintain” in reference to a legal action is often read as “bring” or “file”; “[t]o maintain an action or suit may mean to commence or institute it; the term imports the existence of a cause of action.” Ibid.; see 1A J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 0.167[5], p. 472 (2d ed.1996)(calling the “ ‘may be maintained’ ” language an “ambiguous phrase” and “certainly not an express provision against removal within the meaning of § 1441”); 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3729, p. 235 (1998)(referring to “use of the ambiguous term ‘maintain’ in the statute”).	Yes
603	“force” generally connotes the use of violence against another. Black's Law Dictionary, for example, defines “force” to mean “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.” Black's Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999). Other dictionaries offer similar definitions. E.g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 748 (def. 5) (2d ed. 1987) (“force,” when used in law, means “unlawful violence threatened or committed against persons or property”); 6 Oxford English Dictionary 34 (def. I(5)(c)) (“unlawful violence offered to persons or things”).	Yes
604	n/a- The majority purports to derive this limitation from the dictionary, but then finds itself unable to proceed: After all, Black's Law Dictionary contains no entry defining what it means to be “similarly situated” for the purpose of subsection (b)(4).	Yes
605	 Although definitions between jurisdictions vary, a company ordinarily is a place of public accommodation if it provides “lodging, food, entertainment, or other services to the public ... in general.” Black's Law Dictionary 20 (11th ed. 2019) (defining “public accommodation”); accord, 42 U.S. C. § 2000a(b)(3) (covering places of “entertainment”). 	Yes
606	"In 1980, as today, ""habitual"" referred to something that was ""[c]ustomary"" or ""usual."" Black's Law Dictionary 640 (5th ed. 1979); see also 6 Oxford English Dictionary 996 (2d ed. 1989) (""existing as a settled practice or condition; constantly repeated or continued; customary”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1017 (1976) (similar)."	Yes
607	Finding no direct guidance in the statute, the court applied the maxim noscitur a sociis (“[i]t is known from its associates,” Black's Law Dictionary 1209 (Rev. 4th ed. 1968))	Yes
608	"""In the legal parlance of the times, a 'merely colorable' claim was one that existed 'in appearance only, and not in reality.'"""	Yes
609	A non obstante provision thus was a useful way for legislatures to specify that they did not want courts distorting the new law to accommodate the old. ...G. Jacob, A New Law Dictionary (J. Morgan ed., 10th ed. 1782) (definition of “statute,” ¶ 6: “[W]hen there is a seeming variance between two statutes, and no clause of non obstante in the latter, such construction shall be made that both may stand”).	Yes
610	"""The courts and the IRS long since have recognized that § 104(a)(2)'s reference to “personal injuries” encompasses, in accord with common judicial parlance and conceptions, see Black's Law Dictionary 786 (6th ed. 1990)"""	Yes
611	The Maine property tax at issue here is almost certainly not an impost, for, as 18th-century usage of the word indicates, an impost was a tax levied on goods at the time of importation. See, e.g., The Observer-No. XII, Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer, Jan. 7, 1790, p. 1, col. 2 (“[I]mpost is a tax on merchandize, payable at the port of entry”);19 N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26 ed. 1789) (defining “impost” as “a tax or tribute, but more especially such as is received by a prince or state, for goods brought into any haven from other nations”)	Yes
612	In ordinary usage, “award” most often means “give by judicial decree” or “assign after careful judgment.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002); see also, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (“grant by formal process or by judicial decree”)....  But “award” can also mean “grant,” or “confer or bestow upon.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same).	Yes
613	The same author defines ‘exile’ as banishment, and ‘transportation’ as ‘a species of punishment consisting in removing the criminal from his own country to another (usually a penal colony), there to remain in exile for a prescribed period.’In Rapalje & Lawrence's Law Dictionary (vol. 1, page 109), ‘banishment’ is called: ‘A punishment by forced exile, either for years or for life; inflicted principally upon political offenders, ‘transportation’ being the word used to express a similar punishment of ordinary criminals.' In 4 Bl. Com. 377, it is said: ‘Some punishments consist in exile or banishment, by abjuration of the realm, or transportation.’ Vattel, Nations, bk. 1, § 228, declares: ‘As a man may be deprived of any right whatsoever by way of punishment; exile, which deprives him of the right of dwelling in a certain place, may be inflicted as a punishment; banishment is always one; for a mark of infamy cannot be set on any one but with a view of punishing him for a fault, either real or pretended.’	Yes
614	The trial court's decree, we noted, had the effect of individually resolving each constituent case. Ibid. (“The same decree ... is entered as in the case of separate suits.”); see Black's Law Dictionary 532 (3d ed. 1933) (“decree” is a “judgment of a court of equity or admiralty, answering for most purposes to the judgment of a court of common law”).	Yes
615	"""'Per curiam' is a Latin phrase meaning '[b]y the court,' which should distinguish an opinion of the whole Court from an opinion written by any one Justice."""	Yes
616	In the latter instance, the property is the actual means by which the criminal act is committed. See Black's Law Dictionary 801 (6th ed. 1990) (“Instrumentality” is “[s]omething by which an end is achieved; a means, medium, agency”).	Yes
617	Second, the ordinary meaning of the word “entitle” indicates that the “person entitled to compensation” must at the very least be qualified to receive compensation. Black's Law Dictionary 532 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “entitle” as “To qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming”).	Yes
618	“[A] board or association to protect the interests of commerce, chosen from among the merchants and traders of a city. The term chamber of commerce is by some distinctively used of the bodies that are intrusted with the protection of general commercial interests, esp. in connection with foreign trade and board of trade for those dealing primarily with local commerce.”	Yes
619	The proper characterization of governmental power should generally depend on the nature of the power, not on the identity of the person exercising it. See Black's Law Dictionary 899 (6th ed.1990) (defining “legislation” as, inter alia, “[f]ormulation of rule[s] for the future”); 1 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise § 2.3, p. 37 (3d ed. 1994) (“If legislative power means the power to make rules of conduct **921 that bind everyone based on resolution of major policy issues, scores of agencies exercise legislative power routinely by *489 promulgating what are candidly called ‘legislative rules' ”).	Yes
620	 The lead entry for “cold-blooded” gives coordinate definitions. One, *472 “marked by absence of warm feelings: without consideration, compunction, or clemency,” id., at 442, mirrors the definition of “pitiless.” The other defines “cold-blooded” to mean “matter of fact, emotionless.” Ibid. It is true that “cold-blooded” is sometimes also used to describe “premedita[tion],” Black's Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990)—a mental state that may coincide with, but is distinct from, a lack of feeling or compassion.	Yes
621	The dictionary definition of the word “arise” does not compel such a reading; to the contrary, it can be used to support either party's position. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 117 (1966) (arise defined as “to come into being”; “to come about”; or “to become apparent in such a way as to demand attention”); Black's Law Dictionary 138 (rev. 4th ed.1968) (“to come into being or notice”). 	Yes
622	The word “use” in the statute must be given its “ordinary or natural” meaning, a meaning variously defined as “[t]o convert to one's service,” “to employ,” “to avail oneself of,” and “to carry out a purpose or action by means of.” Smith, supra, at 228–229, 113 S.Ct., at 2054 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Webster's New International Dictionary of English Language 2806 (2d ed.1949) and Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed.1990)). These various definitions of “use” imply action and implementation. 	Yes
623	he dictionary definitions of these terms suggest, if *536 anything, specific actions mandated or disallowed by a formal governing authority. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1929 (1981) (defining “require” as “to ask for authoritatively or imperatively: claim by right and authority” and “to demand as necessary or essential (as on general principles or in order to comply with or satisfy some regulation)”); Black's Law Dictionary 1212 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “prohibition” as an “[a]ct or law prohibiting something”; an “interdiction”).	Yes
624	In Tomlin's Law Dictionary are these definitions: ‘Hawkers. Those deceitful fellows who went from place to place, buying and selling brass, pewter, and other goods and merchandise, which ought to be uttered in open market, were of old so called; and the appellation seems to grow from their uncertain wandering, like persons that, with hawks, seek their game where they can find it. They are mentioned in St. 33 Hen. VIII. c. 4.’ ‘Hawkers, pedlars, and petty chapmen **369 Persons travelling from town to town with goods and merchandise.	Yes
625	Most legal dictionaries of the era of the National Bank Act did not place such a limitation upon “interest.” See, e.g., 1 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 652 (6th ed. 1856) (“The compensation which is paid by the borrower to the lender or by the debtor to the creditor for ... use [of money]”); 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 90 (2d ed. 1860); 11 American and English Encyclopedia of Law 379 (J. Merrill ed. 1890). But see J. Wharton, Law Lexicon or Dictionary of Jurisprudence 391 (2d Am. ed. 1860). 	Yes
626	"instead, 'debt for' is used throughout to mean 'debt as a result of,' 'debt with respect to,' 'debt by reason of,' and the like, see American Heritage Dictionary 709 (3d ed.1992); Black's Law Dictionary 644 (6th ed.1990), connoting broadly any liability arising from the specified object"" "	Yes
627	Deterrence, however, has traditionally been viewed as a goal of punishment, and forfeiture of the currency here does not serve the remedial purpose of compensating the Government for a loss. See Black's Law Dictionary 1293 (6th ed. 1990) (“[R]emedial action” is one “brought to obtain compensation or indemnity”).	Yes
628	But the Secretary of War was not an arbitrator. An arbitrator is defined as ‘a private extraordinary judge chosen by the parties who have a matter in dispute, invested with power to decide the same.’ The Secretary of War acted ministerially. The resolution conferred no judicial power upon him.	Yes
629	‘Tonnage duties,’ as defined by the learned Bouvier, are ‘duties on vessels in proportion to their capacity.’	Yes
630	Both at the time of enactment and today, the adjective “such” means “[o]f the kind or degree already described or implied.” H. Fowler & F. Fowler, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English 1289 (5th ed. 1964); Black's Law Dictionary 1661 (10th ed. 2014) (“[t]hat or those; having just been mentioned”). 	Yes
631	 One leading dictionary stated that “[t]o defraud is to withhold from another that which is justly due to him, or to deprive him of a right by deception or artifice.” 1 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 530 (1897). Another dictionary defined “defraud” as “[t]o cheat; to deceive; to deprive of a right by an act of fraud ... to withhold from another what is justly due him, or to deprive him of a right, by deception or artifice.” W. Anderson, A Dictionary of *371 Law 474 (1893). See also 1 Burrill's Law Dictionary 658-659 (1859).8	Yes
632	...forgery was looked upon as one of the subdivisions of the crimen falsi, which included forgery, perjury, the alteration of the current coin, dealing with false weights and measures, etc. 1 Bouv. Law Dict. 411.	Yes
633	"Obtaining property requires ""not only the deprivation but also the acquisition of property."" (citing cases) That is, it requires that the victim ""part with"" his property… and that the extortionist ""gain possession of it,""… see also Webster's New International Dictionary 1682 (2d ed. 1949) (defining ""obtain"")"	Yes
634	A disclaimer is a refusal to accept property.	Yes
635	Among the most common definitions of mens rea is “criminal intent.” Black's Law Dictionary 1137 (rev. 4th ed.1968). That dictionary unsurprisingly defines “purpose” as synonymous with intent, id., at 1400, and “intent” as, among other things, “a state of mind,” id., at 947.  	Yes
636	The statutory words “obstruct or impede” are broad.

638	"At the time Congress enacted § 853(a)(1), the verb “obtain” was defined as “to come into possession of” or to “get or acquire.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language 995 (1966); see also 7 Oxford English Dictionary 37 (1933) (defining “obtain” as “[t]o come into the possession or enjoyment of (something) by one's own effort, or by request; to procure or gain, as the result of purpose and effort”). That definition persists today. See *450 Black's Law Dictionary 1247 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “obtain” as “[t]o bring into one's own possession; to procure, esp. through effort”); cf. Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 734, 133 S.Ct. 2720, 2725, 186 L.Ed.2d 794 (2013) (“Obtaining property requires ‘... the acquisition of property’ ”).Neither the dictionary definition nor the common usage of the word “obtain” supports the conclusion that an individual “obtains” property that was acquired by someone else."""	Yes
639	They need only both be subsumed under the term “sentence,” which, for the reasons previously stated, they are. See Black's Law Dictionary, at 1362 (defining “sentence” as a judgment imposing punishment, which may include “a fine, incarceration, or probation”).	Yes

641	Constructive possession is established when a person, though lacking such physical custody, still has the power and intent to exercise control over the object. See Black's 1047; 2A O'Malley § 39.12, at 55.	Yes
642	Section 518 can be interpreted in several ways. On first read, its prohibition on “impos[ing] a surcharge” on credit card customers appears to prohibit charging customers who pay with a credit card more than those who pay by other means. See Black's Law Dictionary 1579 (9th ed. 2009) (“surcharge” means “[a]n additional tax, charge, or cost”). That is, 518 may require a merchant to charge all customers the same price, no matter the form of payment. 	Yes
643	A “consummated transaction” is simply a transaction that has been fully completed. See id., at 490 (defining “consummate” to mean “to bring to completion”).	Yes
644	In 1966, when § 2415(a) was enacted, a commonly used legal dictionary defined the term “right of action” as “[t]he right to bring suit; a legal right to maintain an action,” with “suit” meaning “any proceeding ... in a court of justice.” Black's Law Dictionary 1488, 1603 (4th ed.1951)	Yes
645	The dictionary definition of the verb form of “harm” is “to cause hurt or damage to: injure.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1034 (1966).	Yes

647	The term, when used as a noun, is defined by the majority's chosen dictionary as, for example, “carrying forward” or “carrying out,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 473 (1976), phrases without any implication of direction or control. 	Yes
648	The first word, “portion,” is defined as “[a] share or allotted part (as of an estate).” Black's Law Dictionary 1182 (7th ed. 1999). “Portion” thus inherently conveys an indeterminate amount. ....Similarly, in this context, referencing a “portion” of the judgment tells us that some amount of the judgment up to 25 percent of the whole is to be applied to the attorney's fee award, but not exactly what amount. 	Yes
649	That an “enterprise” must have a purpose is apparent from the meaning of the term in ordinary usage, i.e., a “venture,” “undertaking,” or “project.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 757 (1976).	Yes
650	Both in legal and general usage, the normal meaning of entitlement includes a right or benefit for which a person qualifies, and it does not depend upon whether the right has been acknowledged or adjudicated. It means only that the person satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right. See generally Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (discussing property interests protected by the Due Process Clause and contrasting an entitlement to an expectancy); Black's Law Dictionary 532 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “entitle” as “To qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming”).

654	When we have stated that sovereignty is a political question, we have referred not to sovereignty in the general, colloquial sense, meaning the exercise of dominion or power, see Webster's New International Dictionary 2406 (2d ed.1934) (“sovereignty,” definition 3), but sovereignty in the narrow, legal sense of the term, meaning a claim of right, see 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, supra, § 206, Comment b, at 94 (noting that sovereignty “implies a state's lawful control over its territory generally to the exclusion of other states, authority to govern in that territory, and authority to apply law there”).	Yes
655	we held that “certificates of analysis,” completed by employees of the State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, id., at 308, 129 S.Ct., at 2530–2531, were testimonial because they were “incontrovertibly ... ‘ “solemn declaration[s] or affirmation [s] made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact,” ’ ” id., at 310, 129 S.Ct., at 2532 (quoting Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), in turn quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)).	Yes
656	The term [expense], standing alone, encompasses wide-ranging “expenditure[s] of money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a result,” Black's Law Dictionary 698 (10th ed. 2014), “charges or costs met with in ... doing one's work,” Webster's New World College Dictionary 511 (5th ed. 2014), and “outlay[s]” for labor, Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 180 (1996); see also N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 319 (3d ed. 1830) (defining the term broadly to include “the employment and consumption, as of time or labor,” or the “disbursing of money”). 	Yes
657	Excessive means surpassing the usual, the proper, or a normal measure of proportion. See 1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (defining excessive as “beyond the common measure or proportion”); S.

662	Service of process refers to a formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action. 1 Ristau § 4–5(2), p. 123 (interpreting the Convention); Black's Law Dictionary 1227 (5th ed. 1979); see 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1063, p. 225 (2d ed. 1987). 	Yes
663	A “ ‘device,’ ” we have observed, is simply “ ‘[t]hat which is devised, or formed by design’ ”; a “ ‘scheme’ ” is a “ ‘project,’ ” “ ‘plan[,] or program of something to be done’ ”; and an “ ‘artifice’ ” is “ ‘an artful stratagem or trick.’ ” Id., at 696, n. 13, 100 S.Ct. 1945 (quoting Webster's International Dictionary 713, 2234, 157 (2d ed. 1934) (Webster's Second)).	Yes
664	Literally, to intervene means, as the derivation of the word indicates [inter, between, and venire, come], to come between. Such is the primary definition of the word given in Webster's Dictionary and in the Century Dictionary. When the term is used in reference to legal proceedings, it covers the right of one to interpose in, or become a party to, a proceeding already instituted	Yes
665	The concept of “insider” generally rests on the presumption that a person or entity alleged to be an insider is so connected with the debtor that any business conducted between them necessarily cannot be conducted at arm's length. See Black's Law Dictionary 915 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “insider” as “[a]n entity or person who is so closely related to a debtor that any deal between them will not be  considered an arm's-length transaction and will be subject to close scrutiny”).	Yes
666	The term ‘minerals' used in an act of Parliament, reserving to the lord all mines and minerals, ... in its proper sense includes all fossil bodies or matters dug out of mines; ... and mines, according to Jacob's Law Dictionary, are quarries or places where anything is digged	Yes

668	The “low-water mark” of a river is “the point to which the water recedes at its lowest stage.” Black's Law Dictionary 1623 (8th ed.2004).	Yes
669	So, also, ‘toll’ is the word used to express the compensation allowed by law or custom to a miller for grinding grain. 2 Bouv. Law Dict. 598.	Yes
670	A “violation” is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or conduct that is contrary to law. Black's Law Dictionary 1570 (6th ed.1990).	Yes
671	“Capacity,” used in this sense, means “[o]utward condition or circumstances; relation; character; position.” Webster's New International Dictionary 396 (2d ed. 1934); see also 2 Oxford English Dictionary 89 (def. 9) (1933) (“Position, condition, character, relation”). 	Yes
672	It is also significant that service under § 1608(a)(3) requires a signed returned receipt, a standard method for ensuring delivery to the addressee. Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 1096 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “certified mail” as “[m]ail for which the sender requests proof of delivery in the form of a receipt signed by the addressee”). 	Yes
673	“Review” is best understood as an “act of inspecting or examining” or a “judicial reexamination.” Webster's 1944; see also Black's, supra, at 1434 (“[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a subject or thing”); 13 OED 831 (“[t]o submit (a decree, act, etc.) to examination or revision”).	Yes

By definition, something that is “collateral” is “indirect,” not *552 direct. 3 OED 473.	Yes
675	Thus the “standard rule” is that a claim accrues “when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.” ... And that definition appears in dictionaries from the 19th century up until today. See, e.g., 1 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 17 (1850) (“an action accrues when the plaintiff has a right to commence it”); Black's Law Dictionary 23 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “accrue” as “[t]o come into existence as an enforceable claim or right”).	Yes
676	Typically, “prima facie evidence” is defined as: “Such evidence as, in the judgment of the law, is sufficient to establish a given fact ... and which if not rebutted or contradicted, will remain sufficient. [Such evidence], if unexplained or uncontradicted, is sufficient to sustain a judgment in favor of the issue which it supports, but [it] may be contradicted by other evidence.” Black's Law Dictionary 1190 (6th ed.1990).	Yes
677	The term “accident” has at least two plausible yet distinct definitions. On the one hand, as noted in Saks, “accident” may be defined as an unintended event. See Webster's New World College Dictionary 8 (4th ed.1999) (“a happening that is not ... intended”); see also American Heritage Dictionary 10 (4th ed.2000) (“[l]ack of intention; chance”); Saks, 470 U.S., at 400, 105 S.Ct. 1338. On the other hand, as noted in Saks, the term “accident” may be defined as an event that is “unusual” or “unexpected,” whether the result of intentional action or not. Ibid. See Black's Law Dictionary 15 (6th ed.1990) (“an unusual, fortuitous, unexpected, unforeseen, or unlooked for event, happening or occurrence” and “if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens”); see also American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 10 (“[a]n unexpected and undesirable event,” “[a]n unforeseen incident”).	Yes
678	 and to “alienate” is “[t]o convey; to transfer the title to property,”	Yes
679	In everyday use, “prevail” means “gain victory by virtue of strength or superiority: win mastery: triumph.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1797 (1976). 	Yes
680	In defining ‘theft’ Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1953) says: ‘Stealing and theft, esp. in popular use, are broader terms than larceny, and may include swindling as well as embezzlement.’ ‘The term ‘theft,’ sometimes used as a synonym of larceny, is in reality a broader term, applying to all cases of depriving another of his property whether by removing or withholding it, and includes larceny, robbery, cheating, embezzlement, breach of trust, etc.' 13 Encyclopaedia Britannica, Larceny (1953), 720. And see 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary (3d rev. ed. 1914) 3267.	Yes
681	"If the Rule applies only to sworn statements, it does so not because adversarial fairness implies a limitation, but simply because the word 'testimony' refers only to statements made under oath or affirmation. See Black's Law Dictionary 1476 (6th ed. 1990)."" at 322."	Yes
682	In Bouvier's Law Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 651, ‘interest’ is defined: ‘The benefit which a person has in the matter about to be decided and which is in issue between the parties. By the term ‘benefit’ is here understood some pecuniary or other advantage, which, if obtained, would increase the witness's estate, or some loss which would decrease it.' In Black's Law Dictionary the definition is (p. 636): ‘A relation to the matter in controversy, or to the issue of the suit, in the nature of a prospective gain or loss, which actually does, or presumably might, create a bias or prejudice in the mind, inclining the person to favor one side or the other.’	Yes
683	Bouvier says (Law Dict.) in giving a definition of the word 'court' and the different styles of court, 'that the one common and essential feature in all courts is a judge or judges, -so essential, indeed, that they are even called the court, as distinguished form the accessory and subordinate officers.' So, too in Bacon's Abridgement a court is defined as an incorporeal political being, which requires for its existence the presence of the judges.	Yes
684	Giving the words used their “ordinary meaning,” Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990), we find that the word “maximum” most naturally connotes the “greatest quantity or value attainable in a given case.” Webster's New International Dictionary 1396 (2d ed. 1958); Black's Law Dictionary 979 (6th ed. 1990) (“The highest or greatest amount, quality, value, or degree”).	Yes
685	“[D]etermine” can mean “[t]o fix conclusively or authoritatively,” Webster's New International Dictionary 711 (2d ed.1954) (2d definition), but it can also mean “[t]o set bounds or limits to,”	Yes
686	"Similarly, a 'liability' is 'an obligation one is bound in law or justice to perform.'"" Id., at 823  Salinas v. United States R.R. Ret. Bd., 141 S. Ct. 691, 702 (2021). "	Yes
687	"""To put the same fairly obvious point in the language of the regulations of § 3(k) of the FLSA, the detailer does not 'sell' anything to the doctor."" Christopher v. Smithkline Beechman Corp., 567 U.S. 142, 172, 132 S.Ct. 2156, 2176 (2012) (Breyer, J., dissenting). "	Yes
688	"""…'entity' typically refers to an organization, rather than an individual. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed.2009)."" at 315"	Yes
689	When the 1933 Act was drawn and adopted, the term “prospectus” was well understood to refer to a document soliciting the public to acquire securities from the issuer. See Black's Law Dictionary 959 (2d ed. 1910) (defining “prospectus” as a “document published by a company ... or by personsacting  as its agents or assignees, setting forth the nature and objects of an issue of shares ... and inviting the public to subscribe to the issue”).	Yes
690	both “scrip and merchandise orders” were frequently used at the time to purchase goods at company stores. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 2249 (defining “scrip” as a “certificate ... issued to circulate in lieu of government currency” or “by a corporation that pays wages partly in orders on a company store”);	Yes
691	The “Supreme Court of Alabama, in Carpigiani v. Hall, 55 So.	No
692	In sum, the evidence of the early incarnations of § 1681p, like the “liability arises” language on which Congress ultimately settled, fails to convince us that Congress intended sub silentio to adopt a general discovery rule in addition to the limited one it expressly provided.	No
693	So, “ if granted by a bishop, where the intestate had bona notabilia, or by an archbishop, of effects in another province.”	No
694	It is only “riparian structures and operations of extraordinary character” over which Delaware retains “overlapping authority to regulate.”	No
695	In the same month was enacted an Act of Settlement providing for a Provincial Council and Assembly and reciting the letters patent to Pennsylvania and the deeds of release and feoffment from the Duke of York.	No
696	I continue to agree with Justice Kennedy that Almendarez-Torres constituted a clear repudiation of the rule the Court adopts today.	No
697	On a practical level, today’s ruling would cause less disruption if the States’ hearsay rules had already required analysts to testify.	No
698	To use a familiar example, under the federal parole system in place until the enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines, an inmate could not be released on parole unless he established that his “release would not jeopardize the public welfare.”	No
699	A witness’s testimony against a defendant is thus inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.	No
700	Concerning the rights of the States, the 1877 arbitration award, not the 1785 compact, was definitive.	No
701	In the half century following publication of Bishop’s treatise, numerous courts applied his statement of the common-law understanding; most of them explicitly relied on his treatise.	No
702	When the principal dissent at long last confronts the actual statute at issue in this case in the final few pages of its opinion, it offers in response to this interpretation only that our reading is contrary to “settled precedent” in Mitchell.	No
703	When done by one alone it is but a civil injury, but it assumes a formidable or aggravated character when it is. to be effected by the powers of the combination.”	No
704	United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 640-641 (2004) (plurality opinion); see generally Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 797 (2009); Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 772 (2003) (plurality opinion).	No
705	For example, is a police officer’s investigative report describing the crime scene admissible absent an opportunity to examine the officer?	No
706	Justice Stevens points out, post, at 126 (opinion concurring in judgment), that in Minnick, actual pre-reinterrogation consultation with an attorney during continued, custody did not suffice to avoid application of Edwards.	No
707	Nor is it true as an accepted axiom of criminal law that ‘the wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.’” Alberty v. United States, 162 U. S. 499, 511 (1896).	No
708	This case involves little more than the application of our holding in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36.	No
709	The State here introduced Caylor’s statements, which included his transcription of a blood alcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chroma-tograph printout, along with other statements about the procedures used in handling the blood sample.	No
710	I do not find it necessary at this time to pass on the validity of the statutory provision concerning “custom or usage” or on the trial court’s views, concurred in by the Court of Appeals, on the proper interpretation of that term.	No
711	The remaining question concerning this aspect of the present case is what nexus between § 2046.5 and respondent’s alleged discrimination petitioner must show to establish that that discrimination is state action violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.	No
712	To the contrary, it makes all the difference in the world.	No
713	A general assembly having been summoned, an Act of Union was passed, December 7, 1682, whereby the three counties of Delaware territory were annexed to Pennsylvania.	No
714	This statute, whenever applied, must derogate from the direct right of the ship owner against the other ship owner.	No
715	Although United concedes that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to enter the order confirming Espinosa’s plan, United contends that the court’s judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) because United did not receive adequate notice of Espinosa’s proposed discharge of his student loan interest.	No
716	See Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S., at 196 (actual damages are “traditional form of relief offered in the courts of law”); Tull v. United States, 481 U. S., at 422 (“Remedies intended to punish culpable individuals ... were issued by courts of law, not courts of equity”).	No
717	This Court subsequently characterized the 1892 Act at issue in Seymour as an example of Congress’ using “clear language of express termination when that result is desired.”	No
718	In this case, the jury was instructed to apply a high standard of constitutional right (“physical abuse of such base, inhumane and barbaric proportions as to shock the sensibilities”).	No
719	And the people had real sour looks on their faces, nobody was joking, or being corny, or carrying on.	No
720	Until this, or some other, reasonable accommodation is implemented, I remain in dissent.	No
721	But the gentlemen who represent her before us expressed with great candor their own opinion that a true interpretation of the King’s concession would divide the river between the States by a line running in the middle of it.	No
722	Neither the Code nor the Rules prevent the parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship, and neither prevents the creditor from waiving service of a summons and complaint.	No
723	Iran accuses the United States of breaking its promise, made in the Algiers Accords, to “arrange ... for the transfer to Iran of all Iranian properties” located in the United States on January 19, 1981.	No
724	The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the testimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic unconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial.	No
725	Similarly, in Jones, we held (in addition to the procedural due process holdings described above) that there was no substantive due process bar to holding an insanity acquittee beyond the period for which he could have been incarcerated if convicted.	No
726	This case, however, concerns the distinct question of when a fact that bears on a defendant’s punishment, but which the legislature has not classified as an element of the charged offense, must nevertheless be treated as an offense element.	No
727	There is not even a sufficient basis for a claim of practical construction.	No
728	Contrary to respondent’s and the dissent’s suggestion, there is little reason to believe that confrontation will be useless in testing analysts’ honesty, proficiency, and methodology— the features that are commonly the focus in the cross-examination of experts.	No
729	Article VIII provides that nothing in the Compact “shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State .. . except as herein expressly set forth.”	No
730	As we noted in Lewis, the official conduct “most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level” is the “conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.”	No
731	For one thing, petitioner may be able to show that the police subjected her to false arrest for vagrancy for the purpose of harassing and punishing her for attempting to eat with black people.	No
732	Today’s opinion itself gives the phrase no content other than to say that “Delaware’s classification of the proposed LNG unloading terminal as a ‘[hjeavy industry use’ and a ‘bulk product transfer facilit[y]’ . . . has not been, and hardly could be, challenged as inaccurate.”	No
733	We have declined to accord it “talismanic power,” because Miranda is to be enforced “only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are impli cated.”	No
734	We have explained at length why we think that the policies of that statute call for our holding today.	No
735	If the arrestee were convicted, he would be confined as a criminal proved guilty; if he were acquitted, he would go free.	No
736	Indeed, the Black-Jenkins Award confirms this understanding; under Article Fourth, Virginia “has a right to such use of the river beyond the line of low-water mark as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian ownership ... .”	No
737	In fact the trial judge conceded, “I certainly don’t dispute that it could be shown that there was a custom and usage of discrimination in the past.	No
738	Delaware similarly relied on the DCZA to deny permits for construction of the Crown Landing unloading facility at issue in this case.	No
739	Accordingly, Blankenship ended the interview, and Shatzer was released back into the general prison population.	No
740	As originally enacted, § 1983 was modeled on the precursor of § 242, with differences of coverage not material here.	No
741	The Court’s opinion in that case held the report inadmissible because no one was present at trial to testify to its contents.	No
742	In any case, the purported distinctions respondent and the dissent identify between this case and Sir Walter Raleigh’s “conventional” accusers do not survive scrutiny.	No
743	As the moving party, respondent had the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact, and for these purposes the material it lodged must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party.	No
744	On balance, we conclude, the phrase “liability arises” is not particularly instructive, much less dispositive of this case.	No
745	The language of the complaint might, if read generously, support the contention that petitioner was alleging a violation of Title II, the Public Accommodations provisions, of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. § 2000a.	No
746	In 1989, petitioner was charged in Utah state court with distribution of a controlled substance.	No
747	Moreover, the rationale that underlies the Court’s rule suggests a principle — jury determination of all sentencing-related facts — that, unless restricted, threatens the workability of every criminal justice system (if applied to judges) or threatens efforts to make those systems more uniform, hence more fair (if applied to commissions).	No
748	Virginia pursued MDE administrative appeals for more than two years, arguing at each stage that it was entitled to build the water intake structure under the 1785 Compact and the Black-Jenkins Award.	No
749	It is true that the act requiring an oath provides a penalty for falsely taking it.	No
750	Fourth, because there is no ambiguity in New Jersey’s statutory scheme, this case does not raise any question concerning the State’s power to manipulate the prosecutor’s burden of proof by, for example, relying on a presumption rather than evidence to establish an element of an offense, cf.	No
751	See, e. g., United States v. Price, supra, at 794 n. 7. But the loose and vague phrase “under color of law” has always been used by the Court in the context of cases in which reliance was put on something other than “custom or usage.”	No
752	The general proposition, for example, that an unreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment is of little help in determining whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.	No
753	The official with responsibilities in many jurisdictions may face ambiguous and sometimes inconsistent sources of decisional law.	No
754	The practical effect of the Court’s ruling is to turn the purpose of the VTVPA on its head.	No
755	Morris did ultimately decide that Maryland’s 1632 charter included the Potomac River from shore to shore, 174 U. S., at 225, but this conclusion, reached in 1899, hardly negates our statements in that and other cases recognizing that the dispute over the interstate boundary continued well into the 19th century.	No
756	And courts admitted copyists’ affidavits in criminal as well as civil trials.	No
757	The provision’s reference to “legal... relief” also strongly suggested a statutory right to jury trial.	No
758	Yet, apparently oblivious to this, the Court today reads into the silent, inhospitable terms of § 1983 a remedy that is designed to serve as a “bounty” to encourage private litigation.	No
759	A majority agreed that in order for a conspiracy to qualify it need not involve any “state” action.	No
760	The plaintiff excepted to the opinion of the court, and has sued out a writ of error to the judgment.	No
761	It is anomalous, at best, to fashion a different rule for the subcategory of “show of force” arrests.	No
762	A second person interprets the graph the machine prints out — perhaps by comparing that printout with published, standardized graphs of known drugs.	No
763	The dissent notes that that factor was given “substantial weight” in Davis, post, at 345, but in fact that decision disproves the dissent’s position.	No
764	The Court has failed to offer any meaningful justification for deviating from years of cases both suggesting and holding that application of the “increase in the maximum penalty” rule is not required by the Constitution.	No
765	Both factors are traditional bases for increasing an offender’s sentence and, therefore, may serve as the grounds for a sentence enhancement.	No
766	Illustrations of this kind could be multiplied indefinitely, but they are unnecessary.	No
767	The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.	No
768	In so doing, it observed that the more recent federal grants to newly admitted States, including Arizona, “make clear that the United States has a continuing interest in the administration of both the lands and the funds which derive from them.”	No
769	Seeking to collect some of the money, he has tried to attach an asset belonging to Iran, namely, a $2.8 million judgment that Iran obtained against a California company called Cubic Defense Systems, Inc. (Cubic Judgment).	No
770	I cannot join the majority’s opinion, however, because it unnecessarily “resolve[s] [a] difficult and novel questio[n] of constitutional ... interpretation that will ‘have no effect on the outcome of the case.’ ” Ante, at 735 (quoting Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009)).	No
771	Not only were there crimes of recklessness or negligence (such as reckless homicide), but even crimes of intent commonly required only intent to do the criminal act (and, in some eases, knowledge that the injury would likely follow), rather than actual ill will or purpose to inflict an injury.	No
772	In a country that harbors a large number of repeat offenders, this consequence is disastrous.	No
773	Consequently, then, there has been no final determination of the case.	No
774	The Special Master rejected that argument, Report 96, and Maryland does not pursue it before this Court.	No
775	Further, the statute opened by referring simply to “the of-fence of larceny,” suggesting, at least from the perspective of our post-McMillan cases, that larceny was the crime whereas the value of the stolen property was merely a fact for sentencing.	No
776	We have likewise established the Miranda exclusionary rule as a prophylactic measure to prevent violations of the right protected by the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause — the admission into evidence in a criminal case of confessions obtained through coercive custodial questioning.	No
777	The Court then turned to the standard of compensation Arizona must employ to recompense the trust for the interests the State acquired.	No
778	Thus, the state constitutional protections that would attach were a “crime” at issue did not apply.	No
779	Of eourse the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not codify common-law procedure wholesale.	No
780	The same approach should apply to seizures; the character of the citizen’s response should not govern the constitutionality of the officer’s conduct.	No
781	The act which has just been declared to be unconstitutional is nothing more than a statute which requires of all lawyers who propose-to practise in the national courts, that they shall take the same oath which is exacted of every officer of the government, civil or military.	No
782	The Oklahoma Enabling Act thus clearly provides for the result which the majority finds so illogical and which it declines for that reason alone to attribute to Congress under the New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act passed only four years later.	No
783	In Perley, supra, the defendant was indicted for and convicted of robbery, which was punishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years.	No
784	It extends across at least 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals.	No
785	Under our precedents, the New Mexico Supreme Court was correct to hold that the certified BAC report in this case is testimonial.	No
786	On the other hand, the constitutional right to equal protection of the laws, unelaborated by any statute, can be violated only by action involving a State.	No
787	Finally, the Court fails utterly to grapple with the cogent and persuasive criticisms that have been offered of punitive damages generally.	No
788	The California Supreme Court addressed only the Wheeler/Batson claim, and, after reversing on that ground, remanded “for further proceedings consistent with [its] opinion.”	No
789	Proceedings of the Conventions of the Province of Maryland, held at the City of Annapolis, in 1774, 1775, 1776, pp. 292-293 (J. Lucas & E. Deaver eds.	No
790	In fact the word punishment is used by the court in a sense which would make a great number of laws, partaking-in no sense of a criminal character, laws for punishment, and therefore ex post facto.	No
791	The protection of constitutional rights may not be watered down because some members of the public actively oppose the exercise of constitutional rights by others.	No
792	The complainant builds another argument upon a compact with the defendant which was ratified by the parties in March, 1905, and approved by Congress in January of 1907.	No
793	The District Court instructed the jury that it could award punitive damages in favor of the plaintiff if it concluded that the defendant’s conduct constituted “reckless or callous disregard of, or indifference to, the rights or safety of others.”	No
794	The Court contends that in Virginia v. Maryland the arbitration award, rather than the compact, “was definitive,” because it recognized the right of Virginia “ ‘qua sovereign,’ ” and nowhere made the right “ ‘subject to Maryland’s regulatory authority.’” Ante, at 618 (quoting 540 U. S., at 72).	No
795	New Jersey threatened Apprendi with certain pains if he unlawfully possessed a weapon and ■with additional pains if he selected his victims with a purpose to intimidate them because of their race.	No
796	Between 1957 and 1996, Maryland issued, without objection, at least 29 water withdrawal permits to Virginia entities.	No
797	The terms of § 1983 make plain two elements that are necessary for recovery.	No
798	Moreover, the legislative history of the provision indicates that throughout most of its consideration of pre-emption, Congress was primarily concerned about areas of possible overlap between federal and state requirements.	No
799	The trial judge appointed a two-member sanity commission made up of the same two doctors who had conducted the pretrial examination.	No
800	There was no treaty or convention fixing the boundary between them.	No
801	The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, saying that Congress had expressly barred removal in “direct, unequivocal language” in other statutes, 292 F. 3d 1308, 1310 (2002), but was not comparably prohibitory in § 216(b).	No
802	Ii\ the opinion some citations are made from early instructions of Secretaries of State, emphasizing the right and duty of consuls to administer upon the effects of citizens of the United States dying in foreign lands.	No
803	As noted earlier we read both counts of petitioner’s complaint to allege discrimination based on race in violation of petitioner’s equal protection rights.	No
804	Via the 1785 Compact, Article Seventh, both States promised the other rights to use the River that presuppose neither could exclude the other from the River.	No
805	The proceeds from the sale of lands restored to the public domain were to be used for the benefit of the Indians.	No
806	In State v. Conlin, 27 Vermont, 318, 323, the court sustains the right of the legislature to provide for the punishment of minor offences, having reference to the internal police of the State, “ with fine only, or imprisonment in the county jail for a brief and limited period.”	No
807	However, the State now claims that it may continue to confine Foucha, who is not now considered to be mentally ill, solely because he is deemed dangerous, but without assuming the burden of proving even this ground for confinement by clear and convincing evidence.	No
808	In our most recent diminishment case, we unanimously rejected the argument adopted by the majority here — that “Congress would refer to opened lands as being part of the public domain only if the lands had lost all vestiges of reservation status.”	No
809	Absent a showing that the analysts were unavailable to testify at trial and that petitioner had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, petitioner was entitled to “‘be confronted with’ ” the analysts at trial.	No
810	Just last Term, nine Justices all proceeded from the premise that a present, completed violation of the Self-Incrimination Clause could occur if an incarcerated prisoner were required to admit to past crimes on pain of forfeiting certain privileges or being assigned harsher conditions of confinement.	No
811	Generally, an action to enforce any liability created by the Act may be brought “within two years from the date on which the liability arises.”	No
812	In one bold stroke the Court today casts aside our traditional cautious approach and instead embraces a universal and seemingly bright-line rule limiting the power of Congress and state legislatures to define criminal offenses and the sentences that follow from convictions thereunder.	No
813	A month after the passage of the 1902 Act, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to set apart sufficient land to serve the grazing needs of the Indians remaining on the reservation.	No
814	Justice Stevens, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Ginsburg join Part II of this opinion.	No
815	The actual principle underlying the Court’s decision may be that any fact (other than prior conviction) that has the effect, in real terms, of increasing the maximum punishment beyond an otherwise applicable range must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.	No
816	Once an immunity waiver is signed, the signatory is unable to assert a Fifth Amendment objection to the subsequent use of his statements in a criminal case, even if his statements were in fact compelled.	No
817	Like Judge Waterman, we think the District Court viewed the matter too narrowly, for under petitioner’s complaint the relevant inquiry is whether at the time of the episode in question there was a longstanding and still prevailing state-enforced custom of segregating the races in public eating places.	No
818	In addition to the foregoing enactments of 1956, numerous other statutes, in force in 1956 and not thereafter repealed, manifest Mississippi’s segregation policies.	No
819	The only logical endpoint of Edwards disability is termination of Miranda custody and any of its lingering effects.	No
820	United States v. Boisdoré’s Heirs, 8 How. 113, 122 (1849) (Taney, C. J.); Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB, 350 U. S. 270, 285 (1956); Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 11 (1962); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 517 (1970) (Maeshall, J., dissenting).	No
821	I would have held, therefore, that it was within Maryland’s power to prevent the construction of the water intake facility that Fairfax County, Virginia, wished to build.	No
822	There is still to be considered whether events during the years of statehood have worked a change of ownership.	No
823	Second, an analyst observes neither the crime nor any human action related to it.	No
824	Thus, in Commonwealth v. McDonald, 59 Mass. 365 (1850), which involved an indictment for attempted larceny from the person, the court saw no error in the failure of the indictment to allege any value of the goods that the defendant had attempted to steal.	No
825	Thus, under the plain terms of the 1905 Compact, each State had “jurisdiction” — the “authority of a sovereign power to govern or legislate,” Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language 806 (1898) — over wharfing out on “its own side of the river.”	No
826	There was no possessory act nor other act of dominion to give to the boundary in bay and river below the circle a practical' location, or to establish a prescriptive right.	No
827	The railroads are all engaged in interstate commerce, and into their affairs and methods of doing business the commission might be, and is, lawfully authorized by the commerce act to make investigation.	No
828	Section 1983 in effect authorizes the federal courts to protect rights “secured by the Constitution and laws” by invoking any of the remedies known to the arsenal of the law.	No
829	The Constitution provides that the President “ shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.”	No
830	The seat of Ute tribal government is in Fort Duchesne, which is situated on Indian trust lands.	No
831	The right to confrontation was not invented in response to the use of the ex parte examinations in Raleigh’s Case, 2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603).	No
832	Similarly, in Rauch v. Commonwealth, 78 Pa. 490 (1876), the court applied its 1826 decision in Smith v. Commonwealth, 14 Serg.	No
833	Maryland suggests that this language indicates her continuing regulatory authority over Virginia’s exercise of her riparian rights.	No
834	Could it be the size of the wharf, which is 2,000 feet long, see ante, at 606, and extends some 1,455 feet into Delaware territory, see Brief for BP America Inc. et al. as Amici Curiae 1-2?	No
835	In other words, establishing what punishment is available by law and setting a specific punishment within the bounds that the law has prescribed are two different things.	No
836	The case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.	No
837	In 2000, Congress enacted a statute that offers some compensation to certain individuals, including Elahi, who hold terrorism-related judgments against Iran.	No
838	Section 523(a)(8) renders student loan debt presumptively nondisehargeable “unless” a determination of undue hardship is made.	No
839	We simply do not expect defense attorneys to believe that their clients’ interests (or their own) are furthered by objections to analysts’ reports whose conclusions counsel have no intention of challenging.	No
840	Based on those allegations, it is not at all clear that it would have been “impracticable to secure [al-Kidd’s] presence ... by subpoena” or that his testimony could not “adequately be secured by deposition.”	No
841	The right to maintain an action may indeed be a right to fight to the finish, but removal does nothing to defeat that right; far from concluding a case before final judgment, removal just transfers it from one forum to another.	No
842	The range for his underlying crime could be 0 to 10 years, with the mandatory minimum of 5 years, and he could be sentenced to 7. (Of course, a similar scenario is possible with an increased maximum.)	No
843	The judge, however, rejected the jury’s recommendation and sentenced Williams to death on the basis of additional facts that he learned through a pre-sentence investigation report and that had neither been charged in an indictment nor presented to the jury.	No
844	To contravene the statute’s clear design, the Court surmises that Congress also had a “more complicated” purpose, namely, to “protee[tj property that the United States might use to satisfy its potential liability to Iran.”	No
845	The ever-present Inspector James McLaughlin, who negotiated the Rosebud and DeCoteau agreements that this Court found to contain express language of disestablishment, used no comparable language here.	No
846	They doomed themselves to a lifetime of guarding that line, fearing it would be breached.	No
847	If Congress meant to create a right to recover punitive damages, then it chose singularly inappropriate words: both the reference to injured parties and to redress suggests compensation, and not punishment.	No
848	See Cooper, supra, at 1248 (“There is a second Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process yardstick available to Cooper as a theory of § 1983 liability.	No
849	The complaint also stated FCRA claims against Trans Union Corporation, another credit reporting agency involved in the Impostor’s conduct.	No
850	The pauses in the interrogation, however, do not indicate any error in the trial court’s findings and conclusions.	No
851	We find persuasive the Special Master’s reconciliation of his recommendations in the two actions.	No
852	"As we made clear in Winship, the ""reasonable doubt” requirement “has [a] vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons.”"	No
853	The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted Espinosa’s motion in relevant part, denied United’s cross-motion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their collection efforts.	No
854	That answer, however, is plainly insufficient given the holding in Terry that the Fourth Amendment applies to stops that need not be justified by probable cause in the absence of a full-blown arrest.	No
855	That is quite different from saying that what constitutes an arrest (a seizure of the person) has changed.	No
856	Far more probative here are those cases in which the prosecution sought to admit into evidence a clerk’s certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particular relevant record and failed to find it.	No
857	Nothing in the “face of the Act,” its “surrounding circumstances,” or its “legislative history” establishes a clear congressional purpose to diminish the Uintah Reservation.	No
858	The Court read § 28 of the Enabling Act with particularity.	No
859	M.: I am not telling you anything until they treat me.	No
860	See App. 138-140; ante, at 623, n. 1. Second, the officer’s chase amounted to a “show of authority” as soon as respondent saw the officer nearly upon him.	No
861	We concluded, therefore, that because the purpose of the certificates of analysis was use at trial, they were not properly admissible as business or public records under the hearsay rules, id., at 321-322, nor were they admissible under the Confrontation Clause, id., at 324.	No
862	The government may not, however, penalize public employees and government contractors to induce them to waive their immunity from the use of their compelled statements in subsequent criminal proceedings.	No
863	Congress intended by ERISA to “establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern.”	No
864	They all had on, what looked like a light blue denim skirt.	No
865	I do not know what to make of the Court’s response that the instances of dredging that I have cited involved “public works.”	No
866	The risk of that consequence ought to tell us that something is very wrong with the Court’s analysis.	No
867	In August 2003, a social worker assigned to the Child Advocacy Center in the Criminal Investigation Division of the Hagerstown Police Department referred to the department allegations that respondent Michael Shatzer, Sr., had sexually abused his 3-year-old son.	No
868	Title 42 U. S. C. § 1983 derives from § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, entitled, “An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes.”	No
869	Under these circumstances, both the requirements that congressional intent must be explicit and that ambiguous provisions must be construed in favor of the Indians compel a resolution in favor of petitioner Hagen.	No
870	Moreover, the sole citation supporting the Monge Court’s proposition that “the Court has rejected” such a rule was none other than Almendarez-Torres; as we have explained, that case simply cannot bear that broad reading.	No
871	The Court today fashions a federal standard for punitive damages, see 42 U. S. C. §1988 (1976 ed., Supp. V), yet steadfastly refuses to follow those of our decisions speaking to that point.	No
872	It is doubtful whether the Johnson reasoning would allow recovery under § 1983 for Kress’ alleged violation of § 201, and indeed the petitioner does not otherwise contend.	No
873	Even if the 1902 Act’s public domain language were express language of diminishment, I would conclude that the Uintah Valley Reservation was not diminished because that provision did not remain operative in the 1905 Act.	No
874	The holding of today’s majority fails to recognize the coercive and intimidating nature of such behavior and creates a rule that may allow such behavior to go unchecked.	No
875	Had it been the intention to commit the administration of estates of citizens of one country, dying in another, exclusively to the consul of the foreign nation, it would have been very easy to have declared that purpose in unmistakable terms.	No
876	Similarly, nothing in the Low Flow Allocation Agreement reached by Maryland and Virginia pursuant to the WRDA suggested that Maryland had authority to regulate Virginia’s riparian rights in the River.	No
877	The Court never establishes, however, that these instances of Delaware’s assertion of jurisdiction related to wharves of “extraordinary character,” which is the only jurisdiction that the Court’s decree confers upon Delaware.	No
878	Nevertheless, even if one were willing to assume that Mullaney and McMillan lend some support for the Court’s position, that feeble foundation is shattered by several of our precedents directly addressing the issue.	No
879	Both the fact and conditions of confinement here are attributable to petitioner’s criminal conduct and subsequent decision to plead insanity.	No
880	See ante, at 72 (“The arbitrators did not differentiate between Virginia’s dominion over the soil and her right to construct improvements beyond low-water mark”).	No
881	Hence Elahi could not take advantage of the “engaged in commercial activity” exception.	No
882	Custom, it is said, must have “the force of law” ; and “law,” as I read the opinion, is used in the Hamiltonian sense.	No
883	The formality inherent in the certification further suggests its evidentiary purpose.	No
884	Locating the victim of a kidnaping, ascertaining the whereabouts of a dangerous assailant or accomplice, or determining whether there is a rogue police officer at large are some examples.	No
885	At bottom, this case requires the Court to decide when a particular remedy is available under § 1983.	No
886	Indeed, under today’s opinion the States bear an even more onerous burden than they did before Crawford.	No
887	Quite relevant to the present case, however, was our decision in Brower v. Inyo County, 489 U. S. 593, 596 (1989).	No
888	He appealed, contending, among other, things, that admission of the certificates violated his Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.	No
889	When federal courts enforce punitive damages awards against local officials they intrude into sensitive areas of sovereignty of coordinate branches of our Nation, thus implicating the most basic values of our system of federalism.	No
890	Indeed, Batson held that because the petitioner had timely objected to the prosecutor’s decision to strike “all black persons on the venire,” the trial court was in error when it “flatly rejected the objection without requiring the prosecutor to give an explanation for his action.”	No
891	I also have difficulty with the majority’s emphasis on the conditions of petitioner’s confinement.	No
892	A construction of the deemer clause that exempts employee benefit plans from only those state regulations that encroach upon core ERISA concerns or that apply to insurance as a business would be fraught with administrative difficulties, necessitating definition of core ERISA concerns and of what constitutes business activity.	No
893	Turning then, as the appeals court had, to McMillan, as well as to Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), the court undertook a multifaetor inquiry and then held that the hate crime provision was valid.	No
894	I do not contend that reading “court” to include “jury” is necessarily the best interpretation of this statutory text.	No
895	Two years and six months later, the same social worker referred more specific allegations to the department about the same incident involving Shatzer.	No

899	It is a right of which he can only be deprived by tbe judgment of tbe court, for moral or professional delinquency.	No
900	Section 504(c), in contrast, does not make explicit reference to another statute that has been uniformly interpreted to provide a right to jury trial and does not use the word “legal” or other language denoting legal relief or rights.	No
901	Edwards was arrested pursuant to a warrant and taken to a police station, where he was interrogated until he requested counsel.	No
902	In the present case, if Officer Pertoso had succeeded in tackling respondent before he dropped the rock of cocaine, the rock unquestionably would have been excluded as the fruit of the officer’s unlawful seizure.	No
903	If, as Justice Souter apparently believes, the opinion below did not address respondent’s “substantive due process” claim, that claim has been forfeited.	No
904	Enterprises, Inc., ante, at 207-208 (interpreting the term “employees” in § 701(b), 42 U. S. C. § 2000e(b)).	No
905	The year after § 1983 was enacted, the New Hampshire Supreme Court declared: “The idea of [punitive damages] is wrong.	No
906	Civil commitment as we know it would almost certainly be unconstitutional; only in the rarest of circumstances will a State be able to show a “compelling interest,” and one that can be served in no other way, in involuntarily institutionalizing a person.	No
907	The majority raises no objection to traditional pre-Guidelines sentencing procedures under which judges, not juries, made the factual findings that would lead to an increase in an individual offender’s sentence.	No
908	Thus, it both delays the point at which “the Fourth Amendment becomes relevant” to an encounter and limits the range of encounters that will come under the heading of “seizure.”	No
909	United States, pursuant to the 34th Buie of that court; or until the further order of this court, upon notice by said complainant . after twenty days from the date of this order.”	No
910	As a predicate for that holding, Justice White, in his opinion for the plurality, explained that the citizen “may not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for doing so; and his refusal to listen or answer does not, without more, furnish those grounds.	No
911	Shatzer pleaded not guilty, waived his right to a jury trial, and proceeded to a bench trial based on an agreed statement of facts.	No
912	In the early years of the Republic, “great inconveniences were experienced by citizens of both Maryland and Virginia from the want of established and recognized regulations between those States respecting the jurisdiction and navigation of the river Potomac.”	No
913	We held in Roberson that just because different police come to speak about a different investigation, that presumption does not change: “[T]here is no reason to assume that a suspect’s state of mind is in any way investigation-specific.”	No
914	The District Court denied Feltner’s request for a jury trial on statutory damages, ruling instead that such issues would be determined at a bench trial.	No
915	"In sum, it may be said of the various statutes and resolutions that constituted Mississippi’s response to Brown that ""they are bound together as the parts of a single plan."	No
916	There is no conceivable reason why he cannot similarly be compelled to exercise his Confrontation Clause rights before trial.	No
917	There we held that an accident report provided by an employee of a railroad company did not qualify as a business record because, although kept in the regular course of the railroad’s operations, it was “calculated for use essentially in the court, not in the business.”	No
918	In the earlier fray, the Special Master persuaded the States to settle their dispute.	No
919	From among their numbers are necessarily selected the judges who expound the laws and the Constitution.	No
920	A contrary view was expressed by the surrogate court of New York County in In re Logiorato’s Estate, 69 N. Y. Supp. 507, and by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in Lanfear v. Ritchie, 9 La. Ann. 96.	No
921	Congress’ use of the word does not indicate that it directed the deemer clause solely at deceit that it feared state legislatures would practice.	No
922	We conclude that such an extension of Edwards is not justified; we have opened its “'protective umbrella/” Solem, 465 U. S., at 644, n. 4, far enough.	No
923	Upon closer examination, it is possible that the Court’s “increase in the maximum penalty” rule rests on a meaningless formalism that accords, at best, marginal protection for the constitutional rights that it seeks to effectuate.	No
924	By its clear language, Article Seventh creates a right for citizen landowners to have some access to the River territory by, for example, the construction of improvements appurtenant to the shore.	No
925	The States, however, have some latitude in determining how these rules should be defined.	No
926	The sentences on counts 3 and 22 have no more relevance to our disposition than the dismissal of the remaining 18 counts.	No
927	We have also recognized that governments may penalize public employees and government contractors (with the loss of their jobs or government contracts) to induce them to respond to inquiries, so long as the answers elicited (and their fruits) are immunized from use in any criminal case against the speaker.	No
928	The Attorney General filed two answers in the cause, neither of which asserted any beneficial title in the Crown, but merely prayed that the court might “Preserve all such Rights Title and Interest of in or to the Premises ns shall appertain or belong to his Majesty.”	No
929	Rather, we remanded the case for farther proceedings because the trial court failed to demand an explanation from the prosecutor — i. e., to proceed to Batson’s second step— despite the fact that the petitioner’s evidence supported an inference of discrimination.	No
930	Espinosa’s failure to serve United with a summons and complaint deprived United of a right granted by a procedural rule.	No
931	The Court of Appeals also found clearly established law lurking in the broad “history and purposes of the Fourth Amendment.”	No
932	The only sworn statement at issue was that of the witness who was present and who testified.	No

936	And, by that time I was up close to the candy counter, and I had a wide open view there.	No
937	Certainly this pos sibility will not be held to .justify a denial of legal right, if such right exists in the shareholder.	No
938	As I read § 1983 together with the other sections, against the background of the congressional debates, I understand them to protect the exercise of constitutional rights by reaching three kinds of interference that are sufficiently “major” in their effects to have warranted congressional action.	No
939	In the event the objectionable provision is discovered, United claims, the debtor can withdraw the plan and file another without penalty.	No
940	The signal, according to Powell, was a nod of his head.	No
941	New Jersey then withdrew its complaint and this Court dismissed the case without prejudice.	No
942	For example, under one reading, the Court appears to hold that the Constitution requires that a fact be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt only if that fact, as a formal matter, extends the range of punishment beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.	No
943	Pursuant to these procedures, and based upon testimony of experts, the Louisiana courts determined not to release Foucha at this time because the evidence did not show that he ceased to be dangerous.	No
944	Justice Marshall took no part in the decision of this case.	No
945	But the affidavits do not qualify as traditional official or business records, and even if they did, their authors would be subject to confrontation nonetheless.	No
946	It scarcely needs repeating that punitive damages are not a “favorite of the law,” see supra, at 58, owing to the numerous persuasive criticisms that have been leveled against the doctrine.	No

951	There the statute involved (18 U. S. C. § 241) proscribed all conspiracies to impair any right “secured” by the Constitution.	No
952	While his view has prevailed in a substantial minority of American jurisdictions, see supra, in many States it concededly has not been followed.	No
953	Although this Court has never explicitly decided this question, we do not interpret the statute against an amorphous backdrop.	No
954	Section 1983 does not in general impose strict liability on all who come within its prohibitions; certain broad immunities are recognized.	No
955	And while it is certainly unusual for this Court to set forth precise time limits governing police action, it is not unheard of.	No

958	Ironically, in passing the British Nationality Act, 1981, c. 61, § 36, the United Kingdom identified one goal as “reducing statelessness.”	No
959	I have written of this presumption elsewhere that it “has little if any independent legal force beyond what would be dictated by normal principles of contract interpretation.	No
960	To succeed in her defense, Maryland must “ ‘show by a preponderance of the evidence ... a long and continuous ... assertion of sovereignty over’ ” Virginia’s riparian activities, as well as Virginia’s acquiescence in her prescriptive acts.	No
961	The court, after reciting the proceedings and reviewing prior cases, concluded its opinion as follows:	No
962	The title to the soil of the lower river and the bay is unaffected by any grant to the Duke of York or others.	No
963	Conversely, where a fact was not the basis for punishment, that fact was, for that reason, not an element.	No
964	For purposes of this opinion I assume that the linguistic differences between the original § 1 and present § 1983 are immaterial.	No
965	And if, as here, the defense is not that the substance was harmless, but instead that the accused did not possess it, the testimony of the technician is a formalism that does not detract from the defense case.	No
966	Neither a break in custody nor the passage of time has an inherent, curative power.	No
967	The text books are to the same effect as the decided cases.	No
968	Respondent Martinez s claim under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 for violation of his privilege against compelled self-incrimination should be rejected and his case remanded for further proceedings.	No
969	A petition for certiorari must demonstrate to this Court that it has jurisdiction to review the judgment.	No

978	Virginia sought a declaratory judg ment that Maryland may not require Virginia, her governmental subdivisions, or her citizens to obtain a permit in order to construct improvements appurtenant to her shore or to withdraw water from the River.	No
979	In striking down Louisiana’s scheme as a violation of substantive rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause, the Court today ignores this well-established analytical framework.	No

986	Id., at 7. Although after Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 553 (1903), Congress unquestionably had authority to terminate reservations unilaterally, we relied heavily on the presence of tribal consent in Rosebud and De-Coteau to find a contemporaneous intent to diminish.	No

997	It is well established that the government may compel witnesses to testify at trial or before a grand jury, on pain of contempt, so long as the witness is not the target of the criminal case in which he testifies.	No
998	That such a limitation was intended for § 1 can be seen from an examination of the statements and actions of both the supporters and opponents of the Ku Klux Klan Act.	No

1004	Holmberg thus stands for the proposition that equity tolls the statute of limitations in cases of fraud or concealment; it does not establish a general presumption applicable across all contexts.	No
1005	The petitioner, Reed, was the clerk of a paymaster in the navy of the United States.	No
1006	Thus, with respect to the criminal law of felonious conduct, “the English trial judge of the later eighteenth century had very little explicit discretion in sentencing.	No

1009	In addition, United filed a proof of claim regarding Espinosa’s student loan debt, thereby submitting itself to the Bankruptcy Court’s jurisdiction with respect to that claim.	No
1010	It is further to be’observed that treaties are the subject of careful consideration before they are entered into, and are drawn by persons competent to express their meaning and to choose apt words in which to embody the purposes of the high contracting parties.	No
1011	In contrast, other provisions in Chapter 13 provide that certain other debts are not dischargeable under any circumstances.	No
1012	Consideration of the purposes underlying the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee further demonstrates why our acceptance of judge-made findings in the context of discretionary sentencing suggests the approval of the same judge-made findings in the context of determinate sentencing as well.	No
1013	The last sentence of that definition could have been written with this case in mind.	No
1014	The commentators tell us of times when the doctrine of the Thalweg was still unknown or undeveloped.	No
1015	By allowing a witness to insist on an immunity agreement before being compelled to give incriminating testimony in a noncriminal case, the privilege preserves the core Fifth Amendment right from invasion by the use of that compelled testimony in a subsequent criminal case.	No

1029	Neither party to Case No. B/61 questions the judgment or requests the Claims Tribunal to interpret it — much less to alter, enforce, or invalidate it.	No
1030	The facts of this case are for the most part undisputed.	No
1031	The court stressed that Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), left to state courts the task of establishing the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of defendants’ prima facie cases.	No
1032	See, e, g., Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 (1884); United States v. Waddell, 112 U. S. 76 (1884); Logan v. United States, 144 U. S. 263 (1892); In re Quarles, 158 U. S. 532 (1895).	No
1033	But, to comply with § 523(a)(8)’s directive, the bankruptcy court must make an independent determination of undue hardship before a plan is confirmed, even if the creditor fails to object or appear in the adversary proceeding.	No
1034	Our construction of the deemer clause is also respectful of the presumption that Congress does not intend to pre-empt areas of traditional state regulation.	No
1035	In fact, there appear to be several plausible interpretations of the constitutional principle on which the Court’s decision rests.	No
1036	It is difficult to understand, and the Court does not explain, why the Constitution would require a state legislature to follow such a meaningless and formalistic difference in drafting its criminal statutes.	No
1037	This purpose (fostering compliance with the United States’ obligation under the Algiers Accords) is more in keeping with the statute’s text than is the Court’s “revenue-saving” purpose.	No

1039	Only then was Cubic “in a position to reasonably, comprehensively and precisely account for the reuse of components originally manufactured for Iran and for any modification costs.”	No
1040	He argues that too low a standard of exposure to punitive damages in cases such as this threatens to undermine the policies of his qualified immunity as a prison guard.	No
1041	Like the suspect in Mincey, Martinez was “at the complete mercy of [his interrogator], unable to escape or resist the thrust of [the] interrogation.”	No
1042	Consider just two — establishing the chain of custody and authenticating a copy of a document.	No
1043	The defendant’s intent in committing a crime is perhaps as close as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense “element.”	No
1044	Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 657 (West Supp. 1991), Foucha had the burden at this hearing to prove that he could be released without danger to others or to himself.	No
1045	The fourth clause not only includes those who gave a cordial aud active support to the hostile government, but also those who yielded a reluctant obedience to the existing order, established without their co-operation.	No
1046	In resuming the title to uncultivated lands, its people had no thought of modifying the ancient boundaries, of relinquishing a foot of soil above the waters or below.	No
1047	Robinson thus stands for the proposition that state discouragement of a particular kind of privately chosen integration renders that kind of privately chosen segregation unconstitutional state action.	No
1048	Trial by affidavit is no substitute for trial by jury which so long has been the hallmark of ‘even handed justice.’ ” Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting, 368 U. S. 464, 473 (1962).	No
1049	I am not so rash as to suggest, however, that these factors had nothing to do with the Court’s decision.	No
1050	Martinez has thus stated a prima facie case that Sergeant Chavez violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from police coercion in pursuit of a confession.”	No
1051	The Zerbst inquiry takes into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the waiver — including any improper pressures by police.	No
1052	While the 1785 Compact resolved certain jurisdictional issues, it did not determine the boundary between the States.	No

1054	Applying Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001), the Ninth Circuit first concluded that Chavez’s actions, as alleged by Martinez, deprived Martinez of his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.	No
1055	Absent a “plain and unambiguous” statement of congressional intent, United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co,, 314 U. S. 339, 346 (1941), we find diminishment only “[w]hen events surrounding the [Act’s] passage . . . unequivocally reveal a widely held, contemporaneous understanding” that such was Congress’ purpose.	No
1056	The Compact accommodated both States’ concerns on matters over which the States had crossed swords: service of civil and criminal process on vessels and rights of fishery within the twelve-mile zone.	No
1057	He takes the validity of the warrant as a given, and argues that his arrest nevertheless violated the Constitution because it was motivated by an illegitimate purpose.	No
1058	Specifically, the judge opined that the black venire members had offered equivocal or confused answers in their written questionnaires.	No
1059	It is true, he may appoint an executor, which appointment it is provided is to be at once communicated to the testamentary judge.	No
1060	Two rules of construction govern our interpretation of Indian surplus-land statutes: we must find clear and unequivocal evidence of congressional intent to reduce reservation boundaries, and ambiguities must be construed broadly in favor of the Indians.	No
1061	But as indicated in the text, this is not consistent with our present system of justice.	No
1062	Indeed, since the arbitrators disclaimed “authority for the construction of [the 1785] compact.	No
1063	The words “under color of any . . . custom ... of any State” do no more than describe the geographical area or political entity in which the “custom” originates and where it is found.	No

1065	John H. Williams, Jr., a representative of Genesco, owners of S. H. Kress and Company, who requested that I make a statement concerning alleged conspiracy in connection with the aforesaid arrest.	No
1066	As with his first argument, Smith gives us no good reason to depart from the common-law rule in the context of § 1983.	No
1067	In these cases the misuse of authority alone is enough to warrant recovery.	No
1068	Mendenhall establishes that the test for existence of a “show of authority” is an objective one: not whether the citizen perceived that he was being ordered to restrict his movement, but whether the officer’s words and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person.	No
1069	Moreover, he referred to “discriminations which were legitimated by a state or community sanction sufficiently powerful to deserve the name ‘custom.’ ” Id., at 457.	No
1070	Prosecutors did so “to bolster the persuasive power of [the State’s] case[,] . . . [even] when the defense would have preferred that the analyst did not testify.”	No

1072	Monge was another recidivism case in which the question presented and the bulk of the Court’s analysis related to the scope of double jeopardy protections in sentencing.	No
1073	The second point to be made about the Court’s holding is that it places no new restriction on the States’ freedom to determine whether, and to what extent, mental illness should excuse criminal behavior.	No
1074	The reasons upon which a different-rule rests in England with reference to other than mercantile contracts, do not outweigh this consideration.	No
1075	Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223 (Holmes, J., dissenting).	No
1076	We agree with this statement, but we do not see how it adds anything but new phraseology to the dissent’s basic claim, namely, that arguments before the Tribunal about “setoffs” do not count as “issues.”	No
1077	Id., at 534; see also The Federalist No. 80, p. 536 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (“[A]n unjust sentence against a foreigner [may] be an aggression upon his sovereign” rendering alienage jurisdiction “essential to . . . the security of the public tranquility”).	No
1078	The second point is one of more doubt and greater intricacy.	No
1079	The State promptly filed a new information charging respondent with incest, and proceeded to trial.	No
1080	Its ruling has vast potential to disrupt criminal procedures that already give ample protections against the misuse of scientific evidence.	No
1081	The provisions of that instrument, relied on to sustain this doctrine, are those which forbid Congress and the States, respectively, from passing bills of attainder and ex post facto laws.	No
1082	The findings of the Special Master, well supported by the evidence, overcome the argument thus drawn from physical conditions.	No
1083	The corporation in question was created to construct a railroad from a point in the city of St. Louis to the Iron Mountain and Pilot Knob, in Missouri, with liberty to extend the road to the Mississippi River, or to the southern part of the State.	No
1084	The Court today transforms that turn of phrase into a new and sweeping legal rule, by holding that anyone who makes a formal statement for the purpose of later prosecution — no matter how removed from the crime— must be considered a “witnes[s] against” the defendant.	No
1085	Hor is any party supposed to he charged with any offence in the only proceeding which the law provides.	No
1086	There was an eyewitness, local farm worker Eluterio Flores, to the encounter between the police and Martinez.	No
1087	Her claims alleged willful violations of § 1681e(a) and are thus governed by § 1681n.	No
1088	They hold their office during good behavior, and can only be deprived of it for misconduct ascertained and declared by the judgment of the court after opportunity to be heard has been afforded.	No
1089	More is at stake, however, than offsetting the litigants’ entitlement to be heard on the merits against our desires to avoid increasing the workload.	No
1090	In such a case, there is no reason that compliance with the undue hardship requirement should impose significant costs on the parties or materially delay confirmation of the plan.	No
1091	If so, that action was reasonable “whatever the subjective intent” motivating the relevant officials.	No
1092	In late 1997, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) refused to issue the permit, holding that Virginia had not demonstrated a sufficient need for the offshore intake.	No
1093	This yiew is strengthened by a consideration of the effect of the pardon produced by the petitioner, and the nature of the pardoning power of the President.	No
1094	Our own Court enjoys weeks, often months, of notice before cases are argued.	No
1095	Contrary to the principal dissent’s suggestion, post, at 580-532, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 198 (1977), posed no direct challenge to this aspect of Mullaney.	No
1096	If a State had a law requiring a private person to refuse service because of race, it is clear beyond dispute that the law would violate the Fourteenth Amendment and could be declared invalid and enjoined from enforcement.	No
1097	New Jersey in particular has been liberal in according such a license (State v. Jersey City, 25 N.J.L. 525), and so, it seems, has Delaware (Harlan & Hollingsworth Co. v. Paschall, 5 Del. Ch. 435; State v. Reybold, 5 Harr.	No
1098	If by any possibility it can be said to provide for conviction and sentence, though not found in the act itself, it leaves the party himself to determine his own guilt or innocence, and pronounce his own sentence.	No
1099	If an officer effects an arrest by touching a citizen, apparently the Court would accept the fact that a seizure occurred, even if the arrestee should thereafter break loose and flee.	No
1100	The facts of this case show the injustice of the Court’s interpretation.	No
1101	Section 1681p’s exception is not involved in this case; the complaint does not allege misrepresentation of information that the FCRA “required] ... to be disclosed to [the plaintiff].”	No
1102	Not even the petitions of jealous rivals, egging the Crown on, were of avail to wake it into action.	No
1103	That is because § 1325(a)(1) instructs a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan only if the court finds, inter alia, that the plan complies with the “applicable provisions” of the Code.	No
1104	The opening of these lands under the allotment Acts, on the other hand, necessarily restored all such lands to the public domain, in the sense that the lands were made available for entry and sale.	No
1105	In describing our decision in Jones, the majority relies on our statement that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity establishes that the defendant “ ‘committed the act because of mental illness/” Ante, at 76, quoting Jones, 463 U. S., at 363.	No
1106	Had they been employed against Foucha when he assaulted other inmates, there is little doubt that if then sane he could have been convicted and incarcerated in the usual way.	No
1107	It is possible to read the Court’s opinion, however, to say that all four must testify.	No
1108	Further, in the event that “the court finds” the infringement was willful or innocent, “the court in its discretion” may, within limits, increase or decrease the amount of statutory damages.	No
1109	Powell, the store manager, claimed in his deposition that he had not seen or communicated with a policeman prior to his tacit signal to Miss Baggett, the supervisor of the food counter.	No
1110	For state action purposes it makes no difference of course whether the racially discriminatory act by the private party is compelled by a statutory provision or by a custom having the force of law — in either case it is the State that has commanded the result by its law.	No
1111	As we explained in Jones: “A criminal defendant who successfully raises the insanity defense necessarily is stigmatized by the verdict itself, and thus the commitment causes little additional harm in this respect.”	No
1112	Their joint report does not list the Cubic Judgment among the properties “at issue.”	No
1113	That concern, Delaware said, was misguided because the 1905 Compact “recognized the rights of riparian owners in the river to wharf out.”	No
1114	If, as the concurrence argues will often be the case, post, at 124, a break in custody does not change the suspect’s mind, he need only say so.	No
1115	The most, then, that Breuer can claim simply from the use of the term “maintain” is that any text, even when ambiguous, that might be read as inconsistent with removal is an “express” prohibiting provision under the statute.	No
1116	In Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. 305 (2009), this Court held that a forensic laboratory report stating that a suspect substance was cocaine ranked as testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause.	No
1117	Virginia asserts that an agreement and an award set out in two documents establish that Maryland ceded Virginia an unqualified right to enter upon Maryland’s territory.	No
1118	Marine Railway & Coal Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 47, 64 (1921); Morris, supra, at 224; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 724 (1838).	No
1119	Trial judges, Justice Kennard argued, should not speculate when it is not “apparent that the [neutral] explanation was the true reason for the challenge.”	No
1120	Thus, with respect to past sentences handed down by judges under determinate-sentencing schemes, the Court’s decision threatens to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted defendants seeldng to invalidate their sentences in whole or in part on the authority of the Court’s decision today.	No
1121	The decision in Brown antedated the incorporation of the Clause and the ensuing understanding of its fundamental role in our legal system.	No
1122	By the time officers arrived the assault had ended, but the victim’s statements — written and oral — were sufficiently close in time to the alleged assault that the trial court admitted her affidavit as a “present sense impression.”	No
1123	Justice Rehnquist also cites Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852), in support of an actual-intent requirement.	No
1124	The above analysis, of course, does not depend on the conclusion that Maryland’s acquiescence was the sole basis for the Black-Jenkins Award, as the majority contends.	No
1125	That the court could revise its former sentence only on the ground of mistake, and that there was no mistake, and consequently no power of revision.	No
1126	In every case relied upon by the majority for this contention, the relevant public domain language was accompanied by express additional language demonstrating such intent.	No
1127	In 1904, Congress passed another statute that appropriated additional funds to “carry out the purposes” of the 1902 Act, and deferred the opening date “as provided by the [1902 and 1903 Acts]” until Mar. 10, 1905.	No
1128	Wade brought suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 against Smith and four other guards and correctional officials, alleging that his Eighth Amendment rights had been violated.	No
1129	That statute, like § 1983, was a Reconstruction civil rights statute.	No
1130	It argued that the Cubic Judgment, as property of the sovereign state of Iran, was immune from attachment or execution.	No
1131	As to the third, we can find nothing that shows Elahi was unfairly surprised by the scope of his waiver — certainly not to the point of violating any due process rights.	No
1132	We have previously considered, and rejected, this ivory-towered analysis of the real world for it fails to describe the experience of many residents, particularly if they are members of a minority.	No
1133	The Court’s opinion in Brower suggests that the officer’s responsibility should not depend on the character of the victim’s evasive action.	No
1134	The same view was taken in the Supreme Court of California.	No
1135	The Special Master we appointed to superintend the proceedings filed a report recommending a determination that Delaware has authority to regulate the proposed construction, concurrently with New Jersey, to the extent that the project reached beyond New Jersey’s border and extended into Delaware’s domain.	No
1136	We thus decline to abandon our traditional approach to diminishment cases, which requires us to examine all the circumstances surrounding the opening of a reservation.	No
1137	Undoubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating discrimination from our civic institutions suffers whenever an individual is excluded from making a significant contribution to governance on account of his race.	No
1138	Prior to the most recent wave of sentencing reform, the Federal Government and the States employed indeterminate-sentencing schemes in which judges and executive branch officials (e. g., parole board officials) had substantial discretion to determine the actual length of a defendant’s sentence.	No
1139	In sum, no authority supports the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion that an Iranian interest in the training system itself would be a “blocked asset.”	No
1140	INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 227 (1984) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).	No
1141	One fundamental distinction is essential to an understanding of the differences among the various standards for punitive damages.	No
1142	If one were to design, ex ante, the socially optimal allocation of the power to permit and forbid wharfing out, surely that power would be lodged with the sovereign that stands most to gain from the benefits of a wharf, and most to lose from its environmental and other costs.	No
1143	See also n. 6, supra (dissent’s confusion of knowledge with intent); n. 9, infra (concerning “criminal indifference”).	No
1144	No one questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda purposes during the interviews with Detective Blankenship in 2003 and Detective Hoover in 2006.	No
1145	Indian Appropriation Bill, 1906, Hearings before the Senate Subcommittee of the Committee on Indian Affairs, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., 30 (1905).	No
1146	The confidence of that conclusion belies any argument that our ruling would have been different had the Pennsylvania statute instead increased the maximum penalty to which the petitioners were exposed.	No
1147	There is simply no basis in our society’s history or in the precedents of this Court to support the existence of a sweeping, general fundamental right to “freedom from bodily restraint” applicable to all persons in all contexts.	No
1148	The Court of Appeals seems to have cherry-picked the aspects of our opinions that gave colorable support to the proposition that the unconstitutionality of the action here was clearly established.	No
1149	The bags of cocaine were in court, available for him to test, and entered into evidence.	No
1150	It is unlikely to change the fact that a detainee “considers himself unable to deal with the pressures of custodial interrogation without legal assistance.”	No
1151	There must be a purpose or intent to harass, oppress, or injure another.	No
1152	We agree with these contentions and find that they support the inclusive interpretation of “employees” in § 704(a) that is already suggested by the broader context of Title VII.	No
1153	These statutes do not support Justice Rehnquist’s speculation that Congress acted expressly when it intended to approve punitive damages, since both statutes created new remedies not available at common law; moreover, they undercut his argument that Congress was hostile to punitive civil remedies in favor of private parties.	No
1154	But nowhere in Title VII is either phrase used — even where the specific context otherwise makes clear an intent to cover current or former employees.	No
1155	As the object of the statute was to curtail the amount that would otherwise be recoverable, it should not be construed to abridge the rights of the owner of the injured vessel to a greater extent than its language will fairly warrant.	No
1156	The court further held that it had the power to reform and correct the judgment .so as to bring it into accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.	No
1157	In a case like this one, recovery should be available under § 1983 if a complainant can demonstrate that an officer exploited his pain and suffering with the purpose and intent of securing an incriminating statement.	No
1158	None of the history contained in the Court’s opinion requires the rule it ultimately adopts.	No
1159	Despite the suspect’s clear and repeated indications that he did not want to talk, the officer persisted in questioning him as he drifted in and out of consciousness.	No
1160	The Court cites no authority to justify this expansive new interpretation.	No
1161	Nor should we entertain the proposition that this case differs from a conviction of guilty because petitioner has been adjudged “not guilty by reason of insanity,” rather than “guilty but insane.”	No
1162	But to say that ulterior motives do not invalidate a search that is legitimate because of probable cause to believe a crime has occurred is not to say that it does invalidate all searches that are legitimate for other reasons.	No
1163	It is alleged that this pretextual detention policy led to the material-witness arrest of al-Kidd, a native-born United States citizen.	No
1164	In determining whether a reservation has been diminished, “[o]ur precedents in the area have established a fairly clean analytical structure,” id., at 470, directing us to look to three factors.	No
1165	The opinion by the arbitrator, which was announced in January, 1849, is a careful and able statement of the conflicting claims of right.	No
1166	Not like the local outbreaks sometimes appearing in particular districts, where a mob or a band of regulators may for a time commit crimes and defy the law, but having every mark and attribute of a systematic, persistent, well-defined organization, with a fixed purpose, with a regular plan of action.	No
1167	Our answer is in line with controlling precedent: As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testimonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.	No
1168	Bqt it is urged that treaties are to be. liberally construed.	No
1169	Indeed, at the time Walton was decided, the author of the Court’s opinion today understood well the issue at stake.	No
1170	It is too early to know the consequences of the Court’s holding.	No
1171	If the Court is not so satisfied, it shall promptly order a hearing to determine whether such person may safely be discharged or released.	No
1172	See, e. g., Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 465 (1991).	No
1173	We granted certiorari in this case to review a decision of the Supreme Court of California interpreting Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986).	No
1174	The present-day Ute Indian Tribe includes the descendants of the Indians who settled on the Uintah Reservation.	No
1175	It was not the absence of probable cause that triggered the invalidating-purpose inquiry in Edmond.	No
1176	But the matter was quite simple for the Massachusetts high court.	No
1177	The problem for the Government, however, is that Iran does not agree that the relevant parts of its Ministry of Defense fall within the scope of the State Department’s designation.	No
1178	The former is characterized by advertence, and the latter by inadvertence.”	No
1179	D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §3.1 (1973); C. McCormick, Law of Dam ages 1 (1935).	No
1180	Determining whether a regulation is either (1) a legitimate River regulation of riparian use, or (2) a wrongful exclusion, under the Compact, of the riparian owner from the River, may implicate some limitations based on a reasonable prediction of consequences to the River’s flow.	No
1181	A defendant’s actual punishment can be affected in a very real way by facts never alleged in an indictment, never presented to a jury, and never proved beyond a reasonable doubt.	No
1182	In this case, we consider whether § 504(e) or the Seventh Amendment grants a right to a jury trial when a copyright owner elects to recover statutory damages.	No
1183	It also explains why the text of the Award — which after all is of greater significance than the arbitrator’s attached opinion — distinguishes between Virginia’s full dominion up to the low-water line and its use rights beyond, that point, a distinction consistent with Article Seventh.	No
1184	One of the principal themes of our immunity decisions is that the threat of liability must not deter an official’s “willingness to execute his office with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good.”	No
1185	See ante, at 480-481 (quoting J. Arehbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 51,188 (15th ed. 1862)).	No
1186	An analyst’s certification prepared in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution, the Court held, is “testimonial,” and therefore within the compass of the Confrontation Clause.	No
1187	The Court rejects a “wrongful intent” standard, instead requiring a plaintiff to show merely “reckless . . . indifference to the federally protected rights of others.”	No
1188	Petitioner did not argue, and the Court properly does not decide, whether the $1,000 limit in 42 U. S. C. § 3612(c), also should apply in actions under § 1983.	No
1189	The testimony shows that the coal companies making the contracts are principally owned by. the railroad companies.	No
1190	There are, we recognized, “important differences between the class of potential civil-commitment candidates and the class of insanity acquittees that justify differing standards of proof.”	No
1191	They conclude that a violation of the Self-Incrimination Clause does not arise until a privileged statement is introduced at some later criminal proceeding.	No
1192	Like the 1902 Act, the House version of the 1905 bill, H. R. 17474, provided “[t]hat so much of said lands as will be under the provisions of said acts restored to the public domain shall be open to settlement and entry” under the general land laws.	No
1193	A party offered his ballot, which was rejected, and he thereupon sued the inspectors of the election for their refusal to receive his vote.	No
1194	Courts should think carefully before expending “scarce judicial resources” to resolve difficult and novel questions of constitutional or statutory interpretation that will “have no effect on the outcome of the case.”	No
1195	Indeed, the defendant in Patterson characterized Mullaney exactly as the Court has today and we rejected that interpretation:	No
1196	However, the concept of “arising from” was given a very narrow construction in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 (1876).	No
1197	This view of the relationship seems especially reasonable when such a corporation is engaged in an international transaction, since the United Kingdom acts on the BVI’s behalf in the international arena.	No
1198	My question in respect to this holding is, simply, “why would the Constitution contain such a requirement”?	No
1199	But even assuming such a short prescriptive period would be adequate to overcome a sovereign right granted in a federally approved interstate compact, Maryland’s claim fails because it has not proved Virginia’s acquiescence.	No
1200	I find these cases unilluminating, at least in part because I am unprepared to attribute to the 42d Congress the truly extraordinary foresight that the Court seems to think it had.	No
1201	Congress’ extension of tribal jurisdiction to reservation lands owned by non-Indians served pragmatic ends.	No
1202	As this Court recently said in construing another of the early civil rights statutes, “We think that history leaves no doubt that, if we are to give [the statute] the scope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language.”	No
1203	A. The conclusion was that white persons — it was a custom and usage not to serve white persons in the company of Negroes.”	No
1204	If the oath required as a condition to practising law is not a punishment, as I think I have showu it is not, then the pardon of the President has no effect in releasing him from the requirement to take it.	No
1205	Similar to the boundary between New Jersey and Delaware settled in 1934 in New Jersey v. Delaware II, the 1834 accord located the New Jersey-New York boundary at “the low water-mark on the westerly or New Jersey side [of the Hudson River].”	No
1206	As to the rights beyond this full dominion, that is to say beyond the low-water line, Virginia has only the rights of a riparian owner.	No
1207	The torrent of frivolous claims under that section threatens to incapacitate the judicial system’s resolution of claims where true injustice is involved; those claims which truly warrant redress are in a very real danger of being lost in a sea of meritless suits.	No
1208	See Walton, 497 U. S., at 709 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (“[U]nder Arizona law, as construed by Arizona’s highest court, a first-degree murder is not punishable by a death sentence until at least one statutory aggravating circumstance has been proved”).	No
1209	Such a fact increases a defendant’s punishment but is not subject to the constitutional protections to which elements are subject.	No
1210	The relevance of the first category of evidence can be easily dismissed.	No
1211	The strength of Delaware’s claim to sovereign ownership of the riverbed within the twelve-mile circle, however, is comprehensively described in New Jersey v. Delaware II, 291 U. S., at 364-378.	No
1212	See, e. g., Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971) (statement admissible for purposes of impeachment).	No
1213	For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.	No
1214	The police may have legitimate reasons, borne of exigency, to question a person who is suffering or in distress.	No
1215	Sueh a construction is not possible here, for we cannot discern “any congressional intent to grant... the right to a jury trial,” 481 U. S., at 417, n. 3, on an award of statutory damages.	No
1216	The Special Master pertinently observed that, as New Jersey read the 1905 Compact, Delaware had given up all governing authority over the disputed area while receiving nothing in return.	No
1217	A dismissive footnote, see ante, at 76-77, n. 4, cannot overcome these fundamental defects in the majority’s opinion.	No
1218	The need to take the express exception requirement seriously is underscored by examples of indisputable prohibitions of removal in a number of other statutes.	No
1219	Here, our previous statements as to the standard for a recovery of punitive damages are inconsistent with the Court’s formulation.	No
1220	See also Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U. S. 432, 435 (1957) (reiterating that evidence obtained through conduct that “ ‘shock[s] the conscience’ ” may not be used to support a criminal conviction).	No
1221	The statute is directed against parties who have offended in any of the particulars embraced by these clauses.	No
1222	Seeking to harmonize Article VII with the boundary determination, the Special Master reached these conclusions.	No
1223	S. Cl. Trib. Rep., at 278, ¶ 10 (dismissal of Iran’s claim against Cubic was “without prejudice to any findings it may make concerning [the Cubic contract] in Case No. B61”).	No
1224	A further purpose is to alleviate the danger of one-sided inter rogations by adversarial government officials who might distort a witness’ testimony.	No
1225	The writ should not be granted for speculative purposes or to gratify idlé curiosity or to aid a blackmailer, but .it may not be denied to the stockholder who seeks the information for legitimate purposes.	No
1226	In any event, it is not apparent why interim advice matters.	No
1227	Addington, supra, at 427-432; Jones, supra, at 363-368; Benham v. Ledbetter, 785 F. 2d 1480, 1486-1488 (CA11 1986).	No
1228	Key provisions were declared unconstitutional or given an unduly narrow construction wholly out of keeping with their purposes.	No
1229	The legislative history of § 1983 provides no direct guidance for the interpretation of the phrase “custom or usage.”	No
1230	The 1956 session of the Mississippi Legislature produced many statutes and resolutions, including § 2046.5, dealing with the separation of the races.	No
1231	After the hearing, and upon filing written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court may order the committed person discharged, released on probation subject to specified conditions for a fixed or an indeterminate period, or recommitted to the state mental institution.	No
1232	During the course of the litigation, Columbia dropped all claims against all parties except its copyright claims against Feltner.	No
1233	It is not plausible that a laboratory analyst will retract his or her prior conclusion upon catching sight of the defendant the result condemns.	No
1234	Section 523(a) provides that “[a] discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of [the Code] does not discharge an individual debtor from” the debts described in §523(a)’s enumerated paragraphs.	No
1235	Equally well founded is the companion right to have the jury verdict based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.	No
1236	After commitment, if the acquittee or the superintendent begins release proceedings, a review panel at the hospital makes a written report on the patient’s mental condition and whether he can be released without danger to himself or others.	No
1237	Virginia’s claims under Black-Jenkins rise as high as the Compact but no higher.	No
1238	Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U. S. 705, 715 (1962) (“Congress might have considered it appropriate to provide compulsory commitment for those who successfully invoke an insanity defense in order to discourage false pleas of insanity”).	No
1239	Under the FLSA, the Secretary of Labor may file a suit on behalf of an employee to recover unpaid wages or overtime compensation, and when the Secretary files such a suit, an employee’s right to bring a comparable action terminates, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. § 216(c).	No
1240	See also id., at 241 (“[Tjhere is a gradation of offences of the same species” where the statute sets out “various degrees of punishment”).	No
1241	Inspector McLaughlin’s picturesque phrase reflects the contemporaneous understanding, by him conveyed to the Indians, that the reservation would be diminished by operation of the 1902 and 1903 Acts notwithstanding the failure of the Indians to give their consent.	No
1242	We do not suggest that trial practices cannot change in the course of centuries and still remain true to the principles that emerged from the Framers’ fears “that the jury right could be lost not only by gross denial, but by erosion.”	No
1243	But this concern, of which earlier courts were well aware, does not make the traditional understanding of what an element is any less applicable to the fact of a prior conviction.	No
1244	Like the earlier practice with regard to common-law copyright claims for damages, actions seeking damages under the Statute of Anne were tried in courts of law.	No
1245	In rare cases in which the analyst is no longer employed by the laboratory at the time of trial, “the prosecution makes the effort to bring that analyst ... to court.”	No
1246	Nor can a prisoner easily “seek advice from an at torney, family members, and friends,” ante, at 107, especially not within 14 days; prisoners are frequently subject to restrictions on communications.	No
1247	The 1905 Act repealed the provision of the 1903 Act limiting the grazing lands to areas south of the Strawberry River.	No
1248	For the foregoing reasons I concur in the judgment reversing the Court of Appeals and remanding for a new trial on both counts.	No
1249	One such exception provides that “a complaint to revoke an order confirming a plan may be filed only within the time allowed by” 11 U. S. C. § 1330.	No
1250	Thus, while the Article Seventh right to build improvements was not explicitly subjected to any sovereign regulatory au thority, the fishing right in the same article was subjected to mutually agreed-upon regulation.	No
1251	Traffic Stream insists that because it is legally nothing more than a collection of noncitizen individuals, the corporation itself cannot be treated as deserving of access to the courts of the United States under a statute that opens them to foreign citizens and subjects.	No
1252	There was no question of treating the statutory aggravating faet as merely a sentencing enhancement — as a nonelement enhancing the sentence of the common-law crime.	No
1253	Brief for New Mexico Department of Health, SLD, as Amicus Curiae 2-5.	No
1254	Thus, contrary to the Court of Appeals’ assertion, the Code makes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority — indeed, the obligation — to direct a debtor to conform his plan to the requirements of §§ 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).	No
1255	Clearly, the concerns animating the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee, if they were to extend to the sentencing context at all, would apply with greater strength to a discretionary-sentencing scheme than to determinate sentencing.	No
1256	The Court’s apparent belief that this is a “fallacy” only underscores my concern that its analysis is insufficiently sensitive to the concerns that motivated the Edwards line of cases.	No
1257	The Court attempts to explain away this historical exception to its rule by noting that a copyist’s authority is “narrowly circumscribed.”	No
1258	Then, as if this 1877 determination were not enough, this Court independently reviewed the question in 1899.	No
1259	Second, the Court endorses the rule as restated in Justice Scalia’s concurring opinion in Jones.	No
1260	Insanity ac-quittees, in sharp and obvious contrast to pretrial detainees, have had their day in court.	No
1261	I just knew that something was going to break loose there.”	No
1262	Today, in what will surely be remembered as a watershed change in constitutional law, the Court imposes as a constitutional rule the principle it first identified in Jones.	No
1263	Counsel can curb an officer’s overbearing conduct, advise a suspect of his rights, and ensure that there is an accurate record of any interrogation.	No
1264	In Leland v. Oregon, we upheld a state law that required the defendant to prove insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, observing that this burden had no effect on the State’s initial burden to prove every element of the underlying criminal offense.	No
1265	A forensic analyst responding to a request from a law enforcement official may feel pressure — or have an incentive — to alter the evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution.	No
1266	As to the second, Elahi at most points to a ground for disputing the propriety, under Tribunal rules, for granting a setoff; he does not deny that the Tribunal sometimes can do so, see, e. g., Futura Trading Inc. v. National Iranian Oil Co., 13 Iran-U.	No
1267	Courts also, again just as in the pre-Bishop period, applied the same reasoning to the fact of a prior conviction as they did to any other fact that aggravated the punishment by law.	No
1268	The Court offers no principles or historical precedent to determine which of these persons is the analyst.	No
1269	But it is not arguable that, just because one thinks it is a better system, it must be, or is even more likely to be, the system envisioned by a Constitution-that guarantees trial by jury.	No
1270	We thus require this, among other, procedural protections in order to “provid[e] concrete substance for the presumption of innocence,” and to reduce the risk of imposing such deprivations erroneously.	No
1271	A declarant in Martinez’s circumstances may want to tell his story even if it increases his pain and agony to do so.	No
1272	As Justice Stevens implicitly acknowledges, we have jurisdiction over this petition under 28 U. S. C. § 1257(3).	No
1273	Given the virtual identity of the two standards, a Court that held that “gross negligence” was too imprecise a standard to warrant a punitive damages award would not likely have intended its dicta to be read as adopting “recklessness” as an alternative standard.	No
1274	The one, like the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, is inalienable.	No
1275	The 1905 Act does not purport to fulfill the “purposes” of the 1902 Act nor to preserve its public domain language; the Act instead simply opens the lands for settlement under the homestead and townsite laws.	No
1276	Given these omissions and misrepresentations, there is strong cause to question the Court’s opening assumption — a valid material witness warrant — and equally strong reason to conclude that a merits determination was neither necessary nor proper.	No
1277	Chavez nonetheless continued to question him, “ceas[ing] the interrogation only during intervals when [Martinez] lost consciousness or received medical treatment.”	No
