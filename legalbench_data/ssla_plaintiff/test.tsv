potential buyout of the rest of the Company.  This position, which they held for a substantial 
portion of the sales process of the Company, is evidence that Kairouz, McCormick, and Rho 
Ventures sought to use their positions within the Company to extract great er consideration in any 
potential strategic alternative for themselves.  
5. Additionally, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger 
Agreement, the vesting of all unvested options and unvested restricted stock units of the Company 
will be a ccelerated to be vested in full converting millions of dollars of currently illiquid stock into 
cash for certain Directors and Insiders of the  Company.  Furthermore, several Everyday Health  
Directors and officers have lucrative change -in-control, or “golde n parachute” clauses in their 
employment contracts, which, when triggered by their termination due to the consummation of the 
Proposed Transaction, will result in payment to them of, at the very least, hu ndreds of thousands 
of dollars.  
6. In the Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement filed by the Company on Schedule 
14D-9 with the SEC on November 2 , 2016 (the “ Recommendation Statement ”), D efendants failed 
to disclose all material information necessary for Everyday Health’s  stockholders to make an 
informed decision regarding the Proposed Transaction .  Specifically, the Recommendation 
Statement  omits and/or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (1) 
the background of the Proposed Transaction ; (2) t he data and inputs underlying the financial 
valuation exercises that purportedly support the so -called “fairness opinion s” provided by 
Everyday Health’s  financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners  (“Qatalyst ”); and (3) Everyday Health’s  
financial projections, rel ied upon by Qatalyst .  The failure to adequately disclose such material Case 1:16-cv-08768   Document 1   Filed 11/11/16   Page 3 of 47 4 information constitutes a violation of Sections"
51	['Not named']	" including the 
material terms and conditions of the proposal and the identity of the party making the 
proposal; (iii) “matching rights” that allow Cavium four (4) business days to match 
any su perior offer; and (iv) a provision requiring QLogic to pay a termination fee of 
$47.8 million if the Company decides to pursue a competing offer.  The collective 
effect of these provisions is to chill any potential post -deal market check.  Case 8:16-cv-01363   Document 1   Filed 07/22/16   Page 3 of 54   Page ID #:3

 5. Additionally, QLo gic insiders stand to gain handsomely from the 
Proposed Transaction.  Motivated by the lucrative incentives of substantial payments 
upon closing, the Board voted unanimously to approve the Proposed Transaction.   
6. Finally, compounding the unfairness of the Proposed Transaction, on 
July 13, 2016, QLogic filed a Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D -9 (the 
“Recommendation Statement”) with the SEC.  The Recommendation Statement, 
which recommends that QLogic stockholders tender their shares in support of the 
Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, 
among other things: (i) QLogic’s management’s projections, utilized by Qatalyst 
Partners LP (“Qatalyst”) in its financial analyses; (ii) the valuation analyses prepared 
by Qataly st in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion; and (iii) material 
information concerning the sale process leading up to the Proposed Transaction.  The 
failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of     
§§ 14(d)(4), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act as stockholders need such 
information in order to make a fully -informed decision regarding tendering their 
shares in connection with the Proposed Transaction.   
7. In short, the Proposed Transaction is design ed to unlawfully divest

8. Warren is an energy company that develops and produces onshore crude oil and
natural gas reserves. Prior to 2014, Warren primarily operated an oil recovery property in the
Wilmington field in south Los Angeles, and natural gas properties located in Wyoming. On July
7, 2014 Warren announced that it had agreed to buy a position in the hydraulic fracturing
Marcellus Shale gas region in northeastern Pennsylvania from Citrus for $352.5 million,
consisting of $312.5 million in cash and $40 million in Warren common stock, with a valuation
of $6 per share. Peterson, a co-founder of Citrus and its President and CEO, also joined
Warren’ s board of directors. The deal was effective, for economic purposes, as of July 1, 2014.
9. The Citrus acquisition was a transformative deal for Warren, as it doubled the
Company’ s reserves and tripled production. However, the acquisition would also greatly
increase the Company’ s sensitivity to market fluctuations for natural gas, and Warren’ s debt
would dramatically increase, as the Company funded the cash portion of the Citrus purchase byCase 1:16-cv-02037-CBS   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   "

to match any superior offer , plus an additional two (2) day period following a material amendment Case 1:16-cv-11844   Document 1   Filed 09/09/16   Page 2 of 43 3 to the terms and conditions of a superior offer or the submission of a new offer ; and ( iv) a provision 
requiring Monst er to pay a termination fee of $ 9 million if the Company decides to pursue a 
competing offer.  The collective effect of these provisions is to chill any potential post -deal market 
check.  
5. Finally , compounding the unfairness of the  Proposed Transaction, on S eptember 6 , 
2016, Monster  filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement  on Schedule 14D -9 (the 
“Recommendation Statement” ) with the SEC.  The Recommendation Statement , which 
recommends that Monster  stockholders tender their shares  in favor of the Proposed Transaction, 
omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i ) Monster’s 
financial projections, relied upon by Monster’s financial advisor, Evercore Group L.L.C. 
(“Evercore”) ; (ii) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analyses  that purportedly 
support the so- called “fairness opinion” provided by  Evercore; and  (iii) the background process 
leading to the Proposed Transaction.  The failure to adequately disclose such material information 
constitutes a of S ections 14(d), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act as stockholders need such 
information in order to make a fully informed decision whether to tender their shares in support of

21. Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. is a publicly -held corporation based in 
Wayzata, Minnesota . Its business is shipping North Dakota crude oil by rail. Dakota 
Plains Holdings, Inc. was created on March 22, 2012 when its predecessor, Dakota 
Plains Inc., merged into a company, MCT, which had publicly traded shares. Its 
shares of common stock were registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the relevant period. On July 11, 2016, Dakota Plains stock was delisted from 
the stock market on which it had traded. The shares of Dakota Plain s and its 
predecessor, MCT, constitute “securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of 
the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1)] and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act 
[15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)].  
22. Michael L. Reger, age 40, is a resident of Wayzata, Minn esota. 
Reger co-founded Dakota Plains along with Ryan Gilbertson. At the time it went CASE 0:16-cv-03779-DWF-HB   Document 1   Filed 10/31/16   Page 6 of 29Case 1:16-cv-09727   Document 1-2   Filed 12/16/16   Page 7 of 30 7  public, Reger controlled 21.4% of Dakota Plains’ stock and 33.3% of its promissory 
notes.  
FACTS  
About Dakota Plains  
23. In 2008, Gilbertson and Reger founded Dakota Plains. To avoid 
disclosing their involvement in the Company , Gilbertson and Reger named their 
fathers as CEO and President. The fathers were mere figureheads, who signed 
documents presented to them by their sons or the Company ’s lawyer , or their 
signatures were stamped or forged. Gilbertson and Reger later replaced their fathers 
with other handpicked officers. The roles of Gilbertson and Reger were never 
disclosed to the public.  
24. In 2011, Gilbertson and Reger hired one of their friends to replace 
Reger’s father as Dakota Plains’ CEO. In addition to the compensation he received from Dakota Plains, Gilbertson and Reger also provided the new CEO  with 
additional, secret benefits in the form of stock in another company Gilbertson and 
Reger controlled and "
97	['Not named']	"produce documents.  (Declara tion of Craig McShane (“McShane Decl.”), 
¶ 4). 
In the course of its investigation, the SEC staff determined that Dakota Plains 
became a publicly traded company as a result of a reverse merger on March 22, 2012.  
Prior to that reverse merger, Dakota Plains is sued promissory notes to several individuals 
and entities who loaned the company a total of $9 million.  These promissory notes 
provided that the noteholders would receiv e bonus payments based on the average price 
of the company's stock in its first 20 days of public trading.  (McShane Decl., ¶ 5). 
Upon being publicly listed, the stock pri ce of Dakota Plains almost immediately 
rose to $12 per share on very light volume and stayed at or near $12 per share for almost 
exactly 20 days.  The price then declined gra dually until September 24, 2012.  Since 
September 24, 2012, Dakota Plains has neve r traded above $4.24, and it is currently 
trading under $1.  As a result of the stock price during the initial 20-day period, Dakota 
Plains disclosed that the noteholders were en titled to receive payments of approximately 
$32.9 million.  (McShane Decl., ¶ 6).

 B. Jessica Gilbertson’s Relevance to the Investigation  
Based upon the SEC’s investigation to date, it appears that Jessica Gilbertson was 
involved in a number of transact ions in Dakota Plains stock or promissory notes that may 
have been made by or at the direction of her former husband , Ryan Gilbertson.  Although 
Ryan Gilbertson had no publicly disclosed ro le with Dakota Plains, he had substantial 
involvement with the company.  Among othe r things, Ryan Gilbertson, a foundation 
controlled by him, and Ryan and Jessica’s mi nor child collectively held approximately 
$3.5 million of the promissory  notes containing the additi onal payment provisions.

Thus, although CVR agreed to a fiduciary out provision, it still obtained its desired result of shutting out any potential third parties from coming in and making a superior offer.  The termination fee and other deal protection provisions substantially  and improperly 
limit the Board’s ability to act with respect to investigating and pursu ing superior proposals and 
alternatives to the Merger.  
9. In addition, in connection with the Merger, on September 17, 2015, CVR  filed a 
Form  S-4 Registration Statement (“Registration Statement”) with the SEC that failed to make all 
material disclosures and contained materially misleading statements about the Merger.  As explained below, the Registration Statement exposes some details of the highly flawed sales process, but fails to disclose a myriad of material facts concerning the Merger  and provides 
unithol ders with materially misleading information, thereby rendering unitholders unable to 
make an informed decision on whether to vote in favor of the Merger.

Class Action Complaint for Violation of th"
134	['Not named']	" In conjunction with the 
strategic review of the Wawa facility, Rentech is also exploring strategic 
alternatives for the Company as a whole. In addition to the
se announcements, 
Rentech is providing updates on its other operating businesses.
 
 
Wawa Facility
 
 
As noted in prior communications, the Wawa facility experienced equipment and 
operating challenges subsequent to the replacement of problematic conveyors last
 
fall. These issues have persisted.
 
 
On February 16, 2017, our board made the decision to suspend operations at the 
facility. This decision is based in part on our review of the work by a third
-
party 
engineering firm to identify necessary capital improveme
nts. While we believe that 
the issues we have been experiencing at the facility can be resolved with additional 
capital investments, we have concluded that it is not economical to pursue those 
investments or to continue to operate the facility at this time
. Rentech’s other 
businesses, including its Atikokan facility, continue to operate without interruption.
 
 
As a result of this decision, the Wawa operations team will immediately begin a 
safe and orderly idling of the facility, which the Company expects to 
complete in Case 2:17-cv-00997   Document 1   Filed 02/22/17   Page 8 of 17 PageID #: 89
 
approximately two weeks. When the facility is successfully idled, a small 
workforce will remain in place to maintain the plant so that it can resume operations 
with minimal cost and time if there is interest from a third party to invest in or 
p
urchase the facility. The remainder of the workforce will be placed on a temporary 
layoff while options for the facility are explored.
 
 
Rentech expects to incur a significant asset impairment charge relating to the Wawa 
and Atikokan facilities in its fourt
h quarter 2016 results.

another party had offered to buy the Company for $22.50 per share, that AMRI shares had 
previously traded as high as $23.95 per share, and that the Company was on course for significant 
growth and profits.  Thus, in order to make the Merger price  appear attractive to AMRI’s outside 
stockholders, the defendants issued a proxy statement recommending approval of the Merger (the 
“Proxy Statement”) that contained materially false and misleading information and omitted other 
material information that wa s necessary to make the information that was disclosed not misleading.  
5. Most notably, the financial projections contained in the Proxy Statement, and relied 
upon by the Board’s financial advisor in opining that the Merger price was fair to stockholders, 
are inconsistent with the Company’s true plans for growth, as shown by defendants’ own prior 
statements.  While the Company had told investors it would reach $1 billion in revenue within the 
next few years, the projections used to justify the Merger forecast that the Company’s revenue 
would not have reached $1 billion even by the post -2021 “terminal year.”  These downwardly 
manipulated financial projections were central to the Proxy Statement and to the Individual 
Defendants’ advocacy of the Merger.  Projectio ns that were honest ( i.e. , showed higher growth) 
would have made clear to stockholders that they would have been better off rejecting the Merger 
Agreement and either continuing to own AMRI as an independent public company or holding out 
for a better offer.  Case 1:17-cv-01179-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page"

258	['Not named']	19. Plaintiff, as set forth in the attached shareholder certification, purchased ADT shares pursuant or traceable to the IPO and was damaged thereby. 20. Defendant ADT is an electronic security system company incorporated under the laws of Delaware.  ADT’s history traces back to the American District Telegraph Company, formed in 1874 as a consortium of 57 telegraph operators.  After over a century in business and a series of acquisitions and mergers, ADT became a public company in September 2012.  Throughout its prior tenure as a public company, ADT characterized its business as a recurring revenue business, where approximately 90% of its revenue is generated from its multi-year customer contracts, and emphasized five key value drivers for its subscription-based business model: customer additions, costs to add a new customer (known as subscriber acquisition costs or “SAC”), average revenue per customer, costs incurred to provide service to customers, and customer tenure.  In May 2016, Defendant Apollo Global, a private equity firm, acquired ADT in a leveraged buyout, after which ADT became a privately owned company and thus ceased trading publicly.  Through the IPO, ADT was spun off by Apollo Global and again became a public corporation, trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “ADT.”   21. Defendant Apollo Global is the private equity firm that took ADT private in a leveraged buyout in May 2016 and then quickly took ADT public again via the January 2018 IPO.  Apollo Global exercises control over ADT, its officers, and its board of directors.  Apollo Global appointed a majority of ADT’s board of directors and, through affiliated funds, continues to own a majority of the voting power of ADT’s outstanding common stock. As a result, ADT is a “controlled company” – i.e., controlled by Apollo Global - under the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies and for purposes of the federal securities laws.

preclusive no solicitation clause , that , after a short 30 -day “ window shop period ”, the Company 
cannot terminate the Proposed Transaction should a third party offer a deal that the Board considers 
to be a superior offer.   This is particularly prejudicial give n the lack of any actual market check

CBL denies all allegations of wrongdoing and asserts th at its actions have at all 
times been lawful and proper. However, given the class certification, the 
accelerated trial schedule, the inherent risk of any trial, and the potential cost of an 
adverse resolution of the litigation, the Company believes that me diation was the 
prudent path. Furthermore, it maintains that the proposed settlement is in CBL’s 
best interest and in the best interests of its shareholders.  
 
Proposed Settlement Structure  
 
Details of the proposed settlement structure and anticipated accounting impact are 
available on CBL’s Form 8 - K filed with the SEC today.  
 
As part of the proposed settlement, CBL will suspend payment of its common 
dividend for two quarters: the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (payable in third quarter 
2019), and the quarter ended September 30, 2019 (payable in fourth quarter 2019). 
The suspension of the dividend for two quarters will preserve approximately $26.0 
million in cash at the current quarterly dividend rate. Based on the current 
projection of taxable income for 2019, which includes the impact of the settlement, 
CBL believes it will satisfy all required REIT distributions for the 2019 taxable 
year. The proposed settlement does not restrict CBL’s payment of common 
dividends thereafter. CBL anticipates re suming a quarterly distribution with its 
Case 1:19-cv-00149   Document 1   Filed 05/17/19   Page 6 of 23   PageID #: 67  
 dividend payable in January 2020 (subject to Board approval) in an amount to be 
determined at that time based on updated taxable income projections for 2020. 
CBL’s common dividend previously declared on February 25,  2019, and payable 
on April 16, 2019, will be paid as declared.

common stock trades  on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)  under  the symbol  “CYH. ” 
13. Defendant  Wayne T. Smith  (“Smith ”) was the Chief  Executive Officer and 
Chairman of the Board of Directors of  the Company  at all relevant times . 
14. Defendant Larry Cash  (“Cash ”) was the Chief Financial Officer of the  Company 
from September 1997 to May 2017.  
15. Defendant Thomas J. Aaron (“Aaron”) has been the Chief Financial Officer since 
May 2017.  
16. Defendant s Smith, Cash , and Aaron (collectively  the “Individual  Defendants ”), 
because of their positions  with the Company, possessed  the power  and authority  to control  the 
contents  of the Company ’s reports  to the SEC,  press  releases  and presentations  to securities  
analysts,  money  and portfolio managers  and institutional investors, i.e., the market.   The  Individual  
Defendants  were provided with copies  of the Company ’s reports  and press  releases  alleged  herein  
to be misleading  prior to, or shortly  after,  their issuance and had the ability  and opportunity  to 
prevent  their issuance  or cause  them  to be corrected.   Because of their positions  and access  to 
material  non-public  information  available to them , the Individual  Defendants  knew  that the 
adverse facts  specified  herein  had not been  disclosed to, and were being  concealed  from,  the public, 
and that the positive  representations  which  were  being  made were  "
523	['Not named']	"to a merger decide to 
proceed in this way, the companies involved, and their directors, becom e virtual guarantors of 
the accuracy and completeness of the Proxy Statement.   The standard for liability under section 
14(a)  and Rule 14a -9 is simple negligence.   
10. The Joint Proxy  contained the Merger Agreement, which included a 
representation that M &T was not in violation of “any applicable law,”  including the Bank 
Secrecy Act.  Merger Agreement, § 4.9 (“ M&T and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all 
material respects with, and are not in default or violation in any material respect of, (i) any 
applicable law, including all laws related …the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act… 
and any other law relating to… money launder ing prevention….”).  
11. The Joint Proxy was dated February 2 2, 2013, and mailed to shareholders on or 
about February 27, 2013.  By April 12, 2013, many shareholders would have already cast their 
ballots, and only four business days remained until the formal meeting in April 18, 2013.  On 
that date, however, Hudson C ity and M &T jointly announced that regulators had expressed 
“concerns”  with M &T’s procedures, systems and processes related to BSA/AML.  This was 
followed by a Proxy Supplement which was completely vague regarding these matters, omitted 
all particulars, and in any event provided proxy voters with insufficient time to evaluat e the 
situation.  
12. The materially incomplete and inadequate Proxy Supplement was followed by a 
publi c conference call convened by M &T on Monday, April 15, 2013 which was designed to 
ensur e concerned shareholders that M &T had violated no laws (a n assertion th at has turned out 
to be incorrect) and that the matter  was not a very serious one.  M &T CFO Jones stated on that 
call that the regulatory issues would delay the close of the Merger in the “near term”, and that the Case 1:15-cv-00897-UNA   Document 1   Filed 10/07/15   Page 4 of 40 PageID #: 44

5. In approving the Proposed Transaction,  the Individual Defendants have breached 
their fiduciary duties  of loyalty, good faith, due care and disclosure by, inter alia , (i) agreeing to 
sell ZAGG  without first taking steps to ensure that Plaintiff and Class members (defined below)

engineering the Proposed Transaction  to benefit themselves and/or the Evercel  without regard for

and compel the Individual Defendants to properly exercise their fiduciary duties to ZAGG  
stock holders .

procure for itself  and senior management of the Company significant and immediate benefits with 
no thought to the  Company’s public stockholders.  For instance, pursuant to the terms of the

Members and executive officers will be able to exchange all Company equity awards for the 
merger consideration.

Transaction .  The  Preliminary Proxy is materially deficient, deprives ZAGG’s stockholders  of the 
information they need to make an intelligent, informed and rational decision of whether to vote 
their shares in favor of the Proposed Transaction, and is thus in breach of the Defendants fiduciary 
duties .  As detailed be low, the Preliminary Proxy  omits and/or misrepresents material information

6.  Plaintiff , as set forth in the accompanying cert ification incorporated by refere nce 
herein,  purchased Ruhnn  ADSs  pursuant and/or traceable to the IPO and was damaged thereby . 
7. Defendant Ruhnn describes itself as an e -commerce retailer and so -called “key  
opinion leader” facilitator based in H angzhou, China. Ruhnn conducted the IPO in New York 
and the ADSs sold in the IPO trade in New York  on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 
“RUHN.” The  Company maintains a dual voting class structure designed to concentrate control 
of the Company in  the ha nds of Company insiders out of proportion to their economic stake in 
Ruhnn. Class B shares,  which wer e exclusively held by Company insiders, each have ten votes 
per share, as compared to  Class A shares, which entitle their holders to only one vote per shar e. 
Each Ruhnn ADS sold in the  IPO represents five Class A ordinary shares of the Company. After 
the IPO, Class B shareholders  were estimated to control 88.2% of the Company’s voting control, 
and thus to dominate Ruhnn’s  activities and affairs.  
8. Defendant Min Feng (“Feng”) was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of 
Ruhnn  (the “Board”) at the time of the IPO. He is also a founder of the Company. Prior to the 
IPO, defendant Feng owned over 29% of the voting power of the Company. Through his 
owner ship of  Class A and Class B shares, defendant Feng maintained 50.1% voting control of

24. Plaintiff  brings  this action as a class action on behalf of himself  and t he other public 
stockholders of TiVo (the “Class ”).  Excluded from the Class "
717	['Not named']	"entering into 
the Merger  Agreement, the Merger Consideration  represented approximately $10.31  in value for 
each share of  Gilat common stock.  By compari son, based on the closing price of Comtech  
common stock on the NAS DAQ on March 2, 2020, the Merger Consideration represented 
approximately $9.56 in value for each  share of  Gilat common stock.  
3. On March  2, 2020, in order to convince Gil at’s stockholders to vote in favor of the 
Proposed Transaction, Defendants filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary S-4 
Registration Statement (the “Registration Statement”) w ith the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“S EC”) and sent same to stockholders  of Gil at. 
4. The Registration  Statement omits  material information  with respect  to the Proposed 
Transaction, which  renders  the Regi stration  Statement  false  and misleading.  Accordingly, plaintiff 
alleges herein  that defendan ts violated Sections  14(a)  and 20(a)  of the Securities  Exchange  Act of 
1934 (the “1934 Act”) in connection with the Regis tration  Statement.  
5. In addition, a special m eeting of Gil at’s stockholders will be held to vote on the 
Proposed Transaction (the “Stockh older Vote”).  It is therefore imperative that the material 
information that has been omitted from the Registration Statement is disclosed prior to the 
Stockholder Vote so Gilat stockholders can prop erly exercise their corpora te voting rights and 
make an i nformed decision on whether to vote in favor of the merger.  
JURISDICTION & VENUE  
6. This Court has jurisdiction over the claims asserted herein pursuant to Section 27 
of the 1934 Act and 28 U.S.C. §1331 because the claims asserted  herein  arise  under  Sections  14(a)  
and 20(a)  of the 1934 Act and Rule  14a-9. Case 1:20-cv-01944   Document 1   Filed 03/04/20   Page 2 of 143

CASE NO. ______________ , PAGE 5 Chief Science Officer, and inventor of Co- Diagnostics’ technology, Brent Satterfield, Ph. D., was 
absent from the call and did not address the allegations after boasting to the market about Co-
Diagnostics’ Covid- 19 testing accuracy in press releases in the weeks leading to the company’s 
earnings announcement.   
14. That evening, in response to other drug companies’ widely- reported test accuracy 
struggles, financial news services began reporting that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
announced publicly that no Covid- 19 test is 100% accurate . Of course, this announcement by the 
FDA undermined Co- Diagnostics’ claims about its tests’ perfect accuracy.  
15. When  markets opened on May 15, 2020, the stock slid to $15.80 per share.  The 
stock never rebounded, and today trades at severely reduced volume for between $15 and $16 per share, with expectations that the stock will trend lower due to the company’s product not being what it promised, public skepticism, and the realization by investors that Co- Diagnostics was a 
flash -in-the-pan company that achieved astronomical gains by deceiving the public while it was 
wrestling with an unprecedented global pandemic.   
16. Durin g this time, and with a cloud of doubt hanging over the company’s claims of 
accuracy, Co -Diagnostics’ directors and officers have been rapidly exercising stock options for 
pennies per share and immediately selling their shares into the market reaping millions of dollars from the fraud -inflated price of the stock. The Officers and Directors, knowing the truth of the 
company’s products and its future prospects, are taking their profits at cost to the public markets before the company inevitably becomes a penny stock once more.  The investing public at large does not have the luxury of purchasing its shares at penni"

6. Such a sales process, or lack thereof, clearly indicates that the only end -goal 
acceptable to the Defendants was an acquisition of China XD  by Faith Dawn  and Han.

their fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith, due care and disclosure by, inter alia , (i) agreeing to

China XD ’s public stockholders .  Accordingly, this action seeks to enjoin the Proposed 
Transaction  and compel the Individual Defendants to properly exercise their fiduciary duties to 
China XD  stock holders .

stockholders  of the information they need to make an intelligent, informed and rational decision 
of whether to vote their shares in favor of the Proposed Transaction, and is thus in breach of the 
Defendant s fiduciary duties .  As detailed below, the Preliminary Proxy  omits and/or misrepresents

Plummeting stock prices are particularly problematic for cannabis 
companies for whom traditional debt financing is  either inaccessible 
or prohibitively expensive. Rather, cannabis companies must typica lly 
issue equity. When their  share prices decline, they are forced to issue 
equity at lower prices, further depressing their share price and further  
increasing their cost of capital. It creates a vicious cycle.
