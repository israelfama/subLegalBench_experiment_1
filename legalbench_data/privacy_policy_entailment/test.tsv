966	Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and other Public Information: Twitter is primarily designed to help you share information with the world.

Depending on the capabilities of the device, location is determined using satellite global positioning service (GPS), detecting nearby cell towers and/or Wi-Fi access points and comparing that information against a database that Microsoft maintains of cell towers and Wi-Fi access points whose location is known, or deriving location from your IP address. When the location service is active on a Windows device, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. Microsoft may also share this de-identified location data with third parties to provide and improve location and mapping services.

The aggregate statistics that describe our online audience-which are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites-help us sell advertising by, among other things, describing the demographics of our visitors, and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and our brands. In addition, we make some information collected by our B2B, emedia and Salesify divisions, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address-and in certain circumstances their employer's name, company size and other industry data-available on a rental or other basis (e.g. sale) to third party providers of goods and services when such information is provided in connection with webcasts and white papers or other sponsored downloads. Please note that we only take such actions in connection with emails collected by Toolbox.com, Inside CRM, Inside-ERP, IT Management, IT Security, and VoIP-News. Please see the sections Webcasts and White Papers/Other Sponsored Downloads below to learn more.

In most cases, the IP addresses collected when you run a test on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest App, or through the Speedtest feature of the browser extension are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information. For some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and mobile carriers, Ookla will provide full IP addresses, as well as and network, hardware and device identifiers, for that company's customers upon request for use in customer insights and assistance.
