0	Hey everyone. My boyfriend is in the process of hopefully getting a job in the USA. We have been dating for around 4 years and always said we'd get married if we relocated so we can be together. I am worried about a couple of things that might cause problems  - I am diagnosed with Anxiety, this in itself isn't the problem. I have went through a few diagnoses' to get to this one though but it's settled on that. I am considered in remission but a couple years ago I got into a fight with a girl over something stupid. I punched her in the face but the police weren't contacted. I did, however, talk to my therapist about it and worked through it with them. If this is on my medical records could it cause problems? (Btw just a note that me and the girl resolved it and were both kind of douchebags)  - This is the one I'm really worried about. My mother is currently awaiting conviction on a charge of possession with intent to supply multiple substances and one charge of conspiracy to convey drugs into a prison. I did not know about this or profit from it. Will this cause problems? If so, how do I prove myself and what are my options?  Thank you guys in advance, worried sick here.	Yes
1	I have a opportunity to work outside of my country for two years. Anyways I would still apply each year for DV lottery while I'm outside of Croatia. And if I happen to be chosen for the further selection, do I have to be in my home country or can I do an interview anywhere in the world through USCIS and just go to the nearest US embassy?	Yes
2	Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	Yes
3	So i have a friend that has some VISA problems and was hoping someone on here could give us some advice.  She lives in MA and her VISA is up in a month. She's been looking for a new job for a while now and now it looks like the awkward timeline between not being able to transfer the visa in time before it expires.  Any thoughts?	Yes
4	"Now that we have just applied for my wife’s 10-year green card I suspect she may file for divorce. The ~3 marriage has struggled, due largely to factors stemming from unemployment (at times *both* of us have been unemployed). Finally and thankfully, we both have good jobs now, though they are in different states (I am in CA, where we married, she is in NY) so it’s now a long-distance marriage. I love her but I think she has checked out and I have to agree that with our new jobs if there were ever a time for a ""fresh start,"" now is it. If she files, I anticipate a ""peaceful"" separation. There's no rancor between us and not much to divide up--no kids, few assets, just a few thousand $ in the bank. If she took everything in the bank it would just be an inconvenience, really.    However, if there is one thing I have learned from this sub it’s that relying on the goodwill of an ex-spouse is asking for a disaster, and I wonder if I should be on-guard for something? For instance, could she somehow come after my future wages? Also, during one particularly difficult stretch, my parents gave us some financial support, can she go after them somehow? I think it impossible she would ever attempt such a thing even if she had recourse, but really sad things are reported on this sub every day.    One last thing: If I've accepted the inevitability of divorce, why don't I just file for it myself and get it over with? One is that I do hope this marriage might rebound and her family is emphatically behind me. Another is that I want to put all my energy into my new job and don’t anticipate acquiring much in savings or significant assets this year, I personally would prefer to defer the divorce until it has to happen.    Thanks and blessings.    TL/DR. I feel divorce is inevitable. Can I just wait for it to happen or is it urgent that I pre-emotively lawyer-up?"	Yes
5	I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?   I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.	Yes
6	Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	Yes
7	We were hoping to ask anyone with good knowledge on US immigration law on how we should proceed as a couple? I [20F] was born in the USA [MO] and have a passport, birth certificate and a SSN but moved when I was just a baby. I do not have family in the USA and don't have established residency in any state.   My partner [23M] was born in the UK and we now want to eventually move to the USA. However, I feel like I'm currently too young to get married and will probably be aiming to get married in 2-4 years.  I will be moving home to Hong Kong this year whilst he will be staying in the UK to finish the final year in his degree.    1) My partner wants to know how he can live and work in the USA legally without a marriage green card/visa. We are looking into him getting a masters in the USA as we know some masters courses allow their graduates to stay in the country to find work for the next 3 years but we know that chances of scholarships are slim.    2) I have read about how it is easier to get the marriage green card if he was already in the states at the time. Would him not being in the USA when applying for the green card/visa be a detriment?   3) Is it possible to get a marriage visa/green card if we got married outside of the USA and **both** parties are not present in the USA at the time of the application and will this affect his ability to enter the country?    4) My partner also wants to know if it's possible for him to eventually get a dual citizenship between UK/USA?   We have several other options ranging from him getting a masters in the USA, getting a masters in Hong Kong where grants and scholarships are much easier to get (and he can live with me), or him working in the UK for a few years whilst we get our act together. We are just very confused as to how the whole process of immigration works and the requirements for it.   TLDR - Boy and girl want to move to America to live the American dream. Girl is American by birth but doesn't live there and boy is from UK. How this work?	Yes
8	"Hi! My question is related to visas/immigration stuff/employment. I am not a U.S. citizen and as an international student I completed a bachelors degree in education at an american college. I have a valid teaching license from a state. Currently I'm teaching at a private English-speaking school in South America and I'm thinking about wanting to return to the states and continue my teaching career there.  I'm not looking for some sort of teacher exchange/""cultural experience"" for myself... I am perfectly fluent in English and fully part of the culture (minus the rodeos; went to one and was terrified #peta). Ideally I'd like some sort of permanent resident situation but I'm not quite sure how to get there. All I've been seeing online is a lot of lists of forms but I have no clue what the actual process looks like.  I'm not sure if this is a common or uncommon thing, but if anyone has any advice please comment below!"	Yes
9	So I recently was kicked out of my house in Ontario, and housing here is expensive and there aren't too many Computer Science jobs, which is why I wanted to move to the US. I hold US citizenship and a US passport. In Ontario, we do not have an emancipation process so I'm not sure if I'd be able to sign legal contracts here or in the United States. I'm sure I'd be able to get a CS job but signing a contract is slightly confusing.  Thanks, Ashar	Yes
10	My friend moved to Canada to be with this girl, and has been married to her for 2 years and 2 months. Now, she's saying she wants a divorce. Starting next week, he's going to be visiting friends and family for 3 weeks. Is leaving on a trip a bad idea for him right now? If not, are there any precautions he should take before he leaves? And can she do anything to have him deported now that they've been married for over 2 years?  The only assets they have is their condo, which is paid off. It's their registered marital home and is in both their names.	Yes
11	"tl;dr:  - Moved to US in 2010 as mom's dependent on H4 Visa  - Applied for Change of Status to F1 in December 2016 - Aged out of H4 this year (2017) aka H4 status expired the day before my 21st birthday since children over 21 cannot be defendants  - Received an RFE from USCIS in June in reference to the gap between the expiration of my nonimmigrant status (H4) to F1 start date (June 5th)  - Responded to RFE, and was suggested by the attorney with the option to leave to go to home country (India) to go for an in person visa interview for F1  - Don't want to take that option because of the lack of strong ties to home country  - need advice on next steps   ---   I (then 14yrs old) moved to US in 2010 with my mom as her  dependent on H4 visa. H1B and H4 were set to be renewed every 3yrs, and ours was renewed in 2010, then 2013, and then 2016. When it was renewed in 2016, my H4 expiration date was set to the day before my 21st birthday, which was earlier this year (2017).   I applied for change of status (I-539) in late Dec 2016 to F1 visa with the Vermont Service Center, so I can continue to reside in US to finish my studies, since one can no longer be a dependent after they turn 21 hence why my H4 visa expired the day before my birthday.   My initial start date for my F1 visa was Jan 9th (beginning of Spring Semester), which was then deferred to June 5th (beginning of the summer semester) since F1 wasn't approved by the time registration period had ended for the spring semester. And my start date was again deferred to Aug 21st (beginning of Fall semester) because F1 still hadn't been approved by the time registration ended for the summer semester. This deferral process is necessary to prevent the automatic cancellation of my change of status application.   USCIS processing times for change of status is currently at the least 6 months but can take up to 9 months. I continued to attend school and patiently waited for USCIS to process my case and get back to me. I had been checking my status and the processing times periodically and was hoping to get an approval by mid or late July. Instead, on June 8th, USCIS sent a Request for Evidence (RFE). The RFE was issued because there is more than 30 days gab between the end of my non-immigrant status (H4) that I am switching from and the start date of my F1 - which at this time was June 5th, but was then moved to Aug 21st. The request had referred to guidances April 6th and on May 10th ""reaffirming that nonimmigrants seeking to change their status to F1, M1, or J1 maintain their nonimmigrant status up to 30 days before their program start date by filing additional Form(s) I-539 to extend their nonimmigrant status while their change of status is pending."" We looked up these guidances and found them to be specific to B1/B2 visas, and even then, as someone that has aged out of H4, I cannot file additional forms to extend that nonimmigrant status.   We worked with an attorney to respond to the RFE (the response was due by July 10th). USCIS can take up to 60 days to respond to the RFE, so I can expect a response by Sept 10th - which unfortunately happens to be after the beginning for the Fall semester and if the response is a denial, then I have to leave the country right away leading to me having to abandon my studies and having to try to return back for Spring semester. The argument made in the RFE response is that (1) when I filed the I-539 in Dec with a stare date in Jan, I was more than 30 days away from the expiration of my nonimmigrant status; (2) The school had to defer my start date to the start date of the next semester in compliance with SEVP guidances; and (3) I aged out of my H4 status and thus cannot apply for an extension; thus USCIS should grant my change of status should be approved. I also have a chronic ear condition that I am under care for and had a surgery in May for, and will need another surgery soon for cochlear implants. I need to be under periodic long term car for my ear condition. In addition to supporting documents from school, etc. regarding the response we also sent in my medical records.  The secondary advice provided by my attorney is that if my change of status application is not approved or even before they have a chance to reject my application that I travel to my home country (India) and go for a visa interview there to get my F1 approved and return back to US.   The problem I have with this suggestion is that I believe that it's going to complicate the scenario. As mentioned previously, I moved to US in 2010 and have not been back to India since. I have very little ties in India. Even my Indian passport has my US address on it because I had to renew it here in US and we didn't have enough proof to retain our Indian address on there. I do not have a bank account in India, or I might have a minor account under my mom. I have family in India, but don't have any contact with them because of family drama/ problems. I do not have a driver's license or any other sort of identification. One of the major requirements when applying for a nonimmigrant visa is to show strong ties to your home country, which I severely lack. This is the main reason why I am terrified to go with this option of going to India to go for a visa interview for F1. There are other time constraints as well, like for instance, I need to return back to US by Aug 21st or else I might not be allowed back at the border. Just scheduling visa interviews takes time, and I not sure if I am going to be able to get a slot to get everything done and return by the 21st even if the strong ties to home country issues is to slide by.   I need advice on next steps. What are the other options I have? What else should I consider? If it comes down to that I have to go to India to get my F1 approved, how can I show strong ties given the situation?"	Yes
12	My wife and I are applying for sponsorship. I am a Canadian citizen and she is not but would like to come live in Canada with me when I move back.   I am 27 and she is 24. She is a CNA and nursing student while I am a tenure-track professor. The issue is, that when she was 19 she was charged with shoplifting a shirt from the mall. She went to court, was given a misdemeanor, and had to pay a fine. Can I still sponsor her given the situation?   She has not reoffended since and does not have any other charges on her record.	Yes
13	Hello guys. Im a dual diploma student. I was a student in the US, was going to sell my car but i couldnt(couldnt find a customer who didnt look like a weirdo from craigslist), so i gave a friend power of attorney to gift/sell my car. I allowed him to gift it because there was a family friend to arrive that year so he could take it if he wanted it. I forgot to turn the license plates over before i returned to my country.  Turns out the guy i gave power of attorney got pulled over driving it(which i in no way allowed him to do) after the insurance expired. The police took the license plates and towed the car. He took it back after paying some fine.   I immediately made him sell the car for really cheap as i didnt want it giving me any more trouble than it already did.  Now the question. Im still not done with my university in NY. When i return to the US, is there any chance i might not be allowed into the country? :(	Yes
14	I've looked at multiple options online, but they can be a little confusing. First option was to just go for 6 months, and wait another 6 months to come back? I think that's what it said at least. Second was to get a work visa, the requirements seemed to be only for prestigious jobs though like doctors, lawyers, athletes, etc. The last option I saw was to enroll in college/university, but I can't really afford that much for American tuition. Please help me find another solution to stay with my boyfriend that doesn't involve these.  tl;dr I want to stay with my boyfriend permanently in America as a Canadian citizen and I'm not educated on Visas.	Yes

16	Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	Yes
17	My sister has asked me to post about this.   • She is 8 month pregnant and is about to give birth in Thailand.  • As the title has already stated, she is Thai (Bangkok), her husband is Chinese. (Yunnan province, Kunming city)  • My sister and her husband have only sign their marriage certificate in China; they didn't sign one in Thailand.  • She has asked a Thai lawyer who is her friend about this. The lawyer has said that in China, the child can only get the Chinese passport if both of the parents are Chinese. Therefore my sister's son will automatically only be qualified for Thai nationality. The lawyer, however, does not specialize in this field of legal matters.  • On a Thai platform, another Thai woman said that she has asked the China Embassy in Thailand and they said that if the birth certificate states that the child is Thai, they can only provide China's visa with annual renewal terms. However if the birth certificate states that the baby is 'not of Thai nationality', then the embassy can provide the child with the Chinese passport so the family can bring the child back to China to continue with the proceedings. When the woman went to ask at the district office, they said that since the mother is Thai, they can only state in the birth certificate that the child is Thai and cannot state that the child is 'not of Thai nationality'.  • My sister's in-laws have told her to not get the birth certificate at all and get all the proceedings done in China so the child gets the Chinese nationality. They are trying to force/convince my sister to make her son's nationality Chinese. They are using money and legal reasons to convince her but my sister doubts their knowledges dealing with legal matters as their have previously lie and made up stories to convince my sister of various things.  Questions: 1. Will my sister's son only qualify for Thai nationality?  2. If my sister is to have more children, will the terms be different if she is to give birth in China instead of Thailand?  3. Can my nephew, who is Thai, inherit his inheritance from his father who is Chinese? (My sister is worried that they may use this as reasons to force her to give birth in China and force her son to get the Chinese nationality.)	Yes
18	I'm currently a us citizen under 21 living with my mom. My dad lives in Iran and wants to come visit me for a few months. I was wondering what options and visa would be appropriate for him to apply for.	Yes
19	My husband has these friends. The husband is an American citizen by birth and the wife was born in the Philippines. We have known them for a couple of years now.   They sent an affidavit home with my husband the other day wanting him to fill it out. He said no problem until he sat down and read it.  It's wanting info that he wouldn't know on his own about their marriage. We haven't seen wedding photos or a marriage certificate or anything like that.  If they spoon fed him the answers that would be perjury I would think. Right? Bug no no? They are trying to make him feel like crap for not wanting to lie on this form.	Yes
20	My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	Yes
21	"I'm on mobile at the moment so please excuse my formatting.   One of my uncle's ""friends"" is offering to pay him about 1,000 dollars to sponsor his new mail order bride from China. Obviously this is the biggest red flag you can imagine. However my uncle is really naive about this and is leaning towards accepting it because he needs the money. If the husband married the mail order bride shouldn't thag give her a green card? Why would they need a sponsor for it? I just want to get ahold of some information and facts about this issue to help me convince my uncle this is a very bad idea."	Yes
22	Hi,      Here's a quick overview of my problem :      I'm French, my girlfriend is American, we've been together for 2 years (she came to France for a year, and i went 2 times to the US for 3 months).      We want to get married and live together in the US, but i currently don't have any visa except for the ESTA 3-months tourist visa.      I came to the US 2 weeks ago with the intent to stay for 3 months, get married, and figure something out to stay here legally.      I ran into some trouble at the border with the officer telling me that i can't apply for any visa after getting married, as this would be illegal.      Fair enough, i explained i just wanted to get married, go back to france after the 3 months and come back again right after to do the visa, at which point he got angry and told me i couldn't even get married on US soil (which is total bullshit based on my researches)      We're not really sure what to do at this point.   Apparently getting married and acquiring a visa are not seen as a good thing, so maybe i should find a way to get a visa without getting married, and get married afterwards ?      From what i saw there's only 2 visa i could apply for : K-1 and CR1.      For now my gf makes enough money to support both of us, but eventually i'd like to work as well.   No rush though, for now we simply want to be together, even if i can't work.      Here's my plan for now : Get married, go back to France once my current 3-months visa is expired, apply for a long term tourist visa, go back to the US whenever the tourist visa is approved, apply for a K-1 visa once i'm in the US.   I'm worried i might run into trouble because of the marriage.      What do you think ? Any better idea ?	Yes
23	Hi, I have a female coworker from Iran going back to visit her father who is very ill. I'm concerned that she won't be able to come back to the USA due to Trump's travel ban but I'm not for sure. I've tried talking to her about it, but she is too distressed with her father to care (Her words). She has a husband from Iran who is an american citizen who has asked me for help.	Yes
24	He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.   He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there.   Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday.   What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.   TL:DR; Will trying for a green card marriage as a US citizen hurt the fact that I haven't been working legally (according to the IRS)?	Yes
25	After three years my finance and I are finally able to afford and have a home together in Canada. (I'm American) We are getting married in November. We initially met with the lawyer at the end of June. The consultation seemed to go well but I have serious concerns about his retainer.   The email he sent me took a week. Is this typical? Within the email there are serious grammar and spelling issues and the retainer has my name spelt wrong. It's also 3500$ CAD not including he actual processing fees. This is only payable by cash or money order. Is this normal?  The reason why we wanted to get a lawyer is because I was denied entry to the border in 2015 for insufficient evidence to return to the states. I was going to stay for two months, didn't say my exact day of return, was in my car with my fiancé, and had my dog with me. I have been to Canada at least 4 times since then with no issues.  I also was previously married and sponsored someone to become and American permanent resident. They have been a permanent resident since 2015.  We divorced in 2015. The lawyer said this shouldn't be an issue at all. Is this true?   Thank you for the help. I live in Colorado if you need that info as well.	Yes
26	Hey everyone,   Here's the situation. My mother is recently widowed and I'm unable to get her down into the bay area where I live (she lives 3 hours away from me) so that I can stay with her and look after her. My niece suggested that she could look after my mom but I need to get her over here into CA first. My niece is from the Philippines and I don't know where to start. I'm unsure what Visa she needs, what hoops I need to jump through/she needs to jump through, etc. Any advice or starting point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone! :D	Yes
27	This person is someone I know and Im curious on what likely is going to happen to him if he is found guilty? Is he going to serve time then get deported or just get deported? I took a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kIbvlc8.jpg) of what he is being charged with. Last I heard is that he posted bail but is being held by ICE. Thanks!	Yes
28	I'm currently on a J1 Grad visa from Ireland and trying to figure out what other options I have for extending my stay other than the H1-B?   Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.	Yes
29	Im in a really bad situation right now, i was caught at my school with possession of marijuana, and the court date is coming up. My family is stressed and they think they are going to be deported because we arent citizens. They think they will be arrested when we arrive at the court, and this was my first offense (im 14) please help, do i just get probation and community service or are we getting kicked out of usa	Yes
30	Hi! First of all I’m sorry for using a throwaway but it’s quite personal.  I’m a dual UK and Polish citizen currently on a business trip in Panama, which I entered using a permanent residence visa that’s in my British passport.   Due to a family emergency I need to return to Poland immediately. I booked a flight for Thursday and it’s via Frankfurt. But, on this rushed trip to Panama, after which I was supposed to go back home in London I didn’t pack any of my Polish documentation. No passport, no national ID card. Just my British passport and an EU(?) drivers license.  Now the problem is Poland has a US type requirement where as I’m a citizen, I’m required to present a Polish document. Therefore in theory, my British passport is invalid.  What are my options here? There’s no Polish embassy in Panama. I could in theory fly to DC/Chicago and go to an embassy there but that would require me to spend a bunch of money and take a gamble on whether I’m eTSA authorised. I could go to Canada where I’m pre-authorised to enter but that’s further away and more money. And then I could make my case with the immigration officer upon arrival in Poland, but I’m very scared of that. I will pass through Panama and Frankfurt immigration with my British passport.  What should I do? Even through I’ve been dealing with this visa/passport issues a lot by obtaining residencies in multiple countries, I’m lost in this case. I will probably be entering Poland (if nothing gets delayed and we meet in Frankfurt) with my fiancé who is a Polish citizen and has a Polish passport but is in no way officially related to me, that is unless we fly to Vegas tonight and get married...  Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks	Yes
31	So I submitted my K1 visa petition back near end of May.  It went to California which shows 3.5 month processing time (should get word in September).  The next steps are confusing.  Some say you fill out support information and gather civil documents and pay a fee for consulate interview and should be a fast process.  When I look at NVC website, they are saying copies of documents mentioned above go to NVC for processing before the consulate interview and can take up to 11 weeks to process now!  What is the correct process and is it really 11 weeks to process at NVC before an interview can be arranged (which takes 3 weeks to get that set up)?  If anyone can help me understand the process and timeline, I would appreciate it!	Yes
32	So I got my name changed, got certified papers from court, etc. I am also a foreign born U.S. citizen and I got my certificate last year, and I changed my name this year, therefore the Certificate of Citizenship is in my old name (note I did not update with the SSA  that I am a now citizen because i wanted to wait for name change). Now I'm planning on going to the Social Security Admin to notify them about my name change AND citizenship status. Would the SSA accept the Certif of Citizen as a doc even though it's in my old name? If I'm applying for a passport, would they accept  the current Certif of Citizen? Or is it NECESSARy that I apply for a replacement Certif that has my new name before I do any of this? Thanks	Yes
33	I need some help with my abusive family and have no idea where to start on my massive list of questions, problems and concerns.  A little about me: I'm 16 and live on a small farm in Alaska, I immigrated to the US with my mother when I was 6 and have been here ever since.  My mother re-married someone in the US but my legal and biological father is in Europe. And my moms husband has not adopted me legally. I get verbally abused everyday and physically at least once a week. I have no real bruises I can show to prove of the physical abuse as it mostly consists  of pinning me to the floor and choking me while yelling at me about how worthless I am.  They are very far-right so any physiatrists or any mental health checkups are out of the question as last time I asked I was grounded for a week.  Here is my list of questions and concerns.  1. All I have is a green card and I'm not legally adopted by my father so I don't know if I will be deported back to Ukraine to my bio father who I haven't spoken to in 10 years if I run away.   2. I've heard of some law regarding living in the US and at a certain age being automatically legible for citizenship.   3. They force me to work at a small gift shop they run for no pay and without a work permit, which I know is illegal as they are not present with me at the shop and I work up to 60hrs a week.  4. I have a medium size dog who is the only reason I'm still alive as I got him during a very suicidal period in my life. If I loose him I will most likely fall right back into that pit. So I will need some suggestions about keeping him with me.  5. They homeschool me so I have very few friends and no access to a school counselor of any kind.   6. I have not penny to my name.   The only thing that's been holding me back from going to the police is my lack of knowledge about the US immigration system and my precious dog.   Please advise me as to what I should do to get out of this nightmare. Thanks :)	Yes
34	I have filled majority of the questions; however, I am stuck on a few and unsure how to answer them. I hope I may get some help on them please.   *Brief information: Never arrested, never committed any heinous crimes.   My current status is overstay. (with ESTA which is expired already. )  17. Have you EVER violated the terms or conditions of you nonimmigrant status? 18. Are you presently or have you EVER been in removal, exclusion, rescission, or deportation proceedings? 19. Have you EVER been issued a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal? 20. Have you EVER had a prior final order of exclusion deportation, or removal reinstated? 21.  Have you EVER held lawful permanent resident status which was later rescinded?  46.e. Engage in any other unlawful activity?  (Does continuing overstaying consider a yes?)  Since April 1, 1997, have you been unlawfully present in the United States:  72.a. For more than 180 days but less than a year, and then departed the United States? 72.b. For one year or more and then departed the United States? (I am staying here more than a year but haven’t departed United States after overstaying.)  Since April 1, 1997, have you EVER reentered or attempted to reenter the United States without being inspected and admitted or paroled after: 73.a. .  Having been unlawfully present in the United States for more than one year in the aggregate? (Like I said, I was overstaying more than one year. But I haven’t departed the United States.)  I haven’t done any crimes, just overstayed. That’s it. Do I still need to say yes to those questions? And is there any other question that I need to say yes for overstaying?	Yes
35	I was asked from my insurance to show proof of my citizenship so I sent in my I-94A. A couple days later they said they needed the hard copy. When I told them I didn't know what that was, they explained it was a form that I should have received the same time I got the I-94A. I'm just curious as to what it looks like or what information it has on it because I have a lot documents to go through and I'm not sure which one it could be. And if I don't have it, how would I go on my way to obtaining it?	Yes
36	Currently my father has a green card, but my mom is undocumented. I was wondering if my active duty military status could grant my mom some sort of residency or protection from deportation.	Yes
37	Hey there. Little bit of background, I was born in the Philippines and moved to America when I was about four years old. (I'm 19 now and attending college.) I've never gone back, done all my schooling here, practically no connection to my home country aside from knowing bits and pieces of language and culture, got perfect English, stayed in good moral standing, etc., etc.  However, I keep running into trouble with documents and such because of my visa (A-2). This is because both of my parents work for the UN as staff. (Nothing major, just paperwork and such.) DMV visits are hell. I don't have a social security number. As far as I know, A-2 visa holders don't have a path to citizenship outside of marriage (and I don't want to commit fraud...) or sponsorship from an employer (which, I am told, is incredibly difficult--unless I also shoot for the UN). I know that the wait list for Filipinos to get their green cards/citizenship is miles and miles long.  If possible, I would prefer to avoid going back to the Philippines, since I'd basically be an alien and I dislike Duterte anyhow. I'd happily renounce that citizenship for one here, and I can't imagine how many kids like me feel the same.  So, does anyone have any advice for becoming a legal permanent resident or citizen of the United States?	Yes
38	"Hello Everyone, I'm writing because my fiance, who lives in the UK, was attempting to visit for a couple of weeks using the ESTA Visa Waiver program. She had the waiver approved but when she went through US Customs in Ireland, they questions what the purpose of her visit was and why she had 3 bags with her. She told them she was going on vacation to see friends and had 3 bags because there were gifts and she had clothes for several weddings she was invited to. They ended up interrogating her for several hours, took her phone and went through every text, email, and even her Facebook posts. They told her that she was not going to visit friends but rather going to visit her fiance. She told them that she was going to visit both and intended to come back in 3 weeks due to her having a job and had a return ticket. After hours of interrogation, the officer told her he didn't care about the luggage or the fiance part but was denying her entry because she lied to 3 officers about who she was going to see. They accused her of trying to use the Visa Waiver as a means to bypass the fiance or spousal visa and said she intended to stay in the US, which obviously wasn't true. He stamped her passport with an ""Application for Admission Withdrawn"" stamp and said if she wanted to enter the US, she has to apply for a fiance visa (which we intended on applying for in the near future anyways. This prevents her from being able to visit me in the US and our concern was how this would affect her chances of getting approved for the fiance visa when we apply for it. Does this negatively impact her chances? What are our best steps moving forward with getting her to the US and is there any way to remove the negative remarks associated with her traveling to the US? Any help would be appreciated!"	Yes
39	I’ve been doing some research and learned that felons ( and those convicted of lower level crimes ) have been turned away at the Canadian border.  I’d like to visit Canada ( Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, etc. ) but I’d like to figure out process of gaining entry first before wasting my time and being turned away at the border.  As far as my criminal history is concerned, 16 year’s ago I was charged and convicted of withholding information ie. not snitching.  This was a federal charge.  I haven’t had any issues with obtaining employment.  I was able to get into college and get my degree as well.    I’m not much for making excuses and letting life hold me back.  That being said, I do like to be proactive and be prepared and that’s why I’m posting about this on this sub.  So, what can I do to be have a chance at being allowed entry into Canada as a visitor/tourist/sightseer?  Will I need legal representation?	Yes
40	Hello there, Im Bruce  22 years old dual national like my sister, I hope to see her in a highschool back in the mainland US this semester/year.  Im petitioning for my mothers visa and thats just taking waaay too long.I intend to use my citizenship to make her first a legal alien then a citizen hopefully.Thats not why Im here thou,  My mothers got her passport of where shes native to ready for use.  Now My sister is a dual national, half american-half from where we live right now (Turkey)  If my mother considerd to go to the US right now and stay there on a tourist visa (Till her papers come through) Can we sign my sister for a school? Or can she somehow gain residentcy? Whats the best state for residentcy?  I got a feeling this isnt the best subreddit to ask but Im desprate. Also: Due to the local currency being a joke to the USD we arent that wealthy to american standarts. If anyone knows of a highschool that'll accept a third year student with exellant grades let me know :P	Yes
41	"I'm not sure if I should list the country I'm in. I'm Canadian but live in Asia.   A couple of years ago an admin woman who handled work permit stuff for a company that employed me screwed me over and I ended up overstaying in the country by four months. My travel visa expired but my work permit was still valid which created a big gap between the two. It's a long story, but she was a shady douchebag and ended up holding my passport hostage and extorted the company to get it fixed. We couldn't call the police because if her connections ran higher than mine I could have been deported on the spot. In the time that she was doing all of this I networked my way up to the right people and took care of her (legally) once things blew over.   So at the time my options were ""find a way to fix it"" or get blacklisted from the country for five+ years. I ended up paying her off to ""fix it"" since it was my only realistic option, and I could deal with her after. What I didn't know was that the additional four month waiting period was so that immigration officials from this country could strategically sneak my passport into two other countries (Hong Kong and Macau) to get stamped (backdated) and returned, which would line the dates back up with my work permit. When it was returned to me I was told to say that I was in those countries on holiday to explain the gap.   At the time, while I was pissed off about the whole situation, I was just glad to get out of it. I haven't really thought about it since. I haven't been back to Canada or the US in 6-7 years, however a family member is getting married next year and I will have to go to that, and since I'll be on that side of the pond I'll probably have to go to the US later for work. I'm just worried that when I go through immigration I might get flagged since everything is digital now. On every trip I've made since this incident, I've had to use the finger print scanners at the airport and obviously with the stamps in question, I wasn't there, so no finger prints would show up.   So my question is, is it likely that this will be a problem going through immigration in Canada or the US? Do they track stamps and finger prints thoroughly? I considered applying for a new passport but my old one was stolen and this replacement one doesn't expire for another two years. I'm assuming I can't just stroll in and get another one?   I truly apologize if none of this makes sense. I live in an insane country. I will be speaking to a lawyer about this soon but figured it couldn't hurt to ask here in the meantime."	Yes
42	A summary. A friend of mine in Dubai has been applying for his student visa to study in an Italian University for a year now.  The details here are hazy because I'm paraphrasing what my friend has told me.  Just recently (10 days ago), he was requested by the consulate to submit his bank statements, a photocopy of his flight ticket and his certificate of acceptance. When he did, someone working at the embassy told him the documents were false and to never apply for the visa again. In a threatening manner, I might add. They stamped the rejection on his visa.  I asked my friend, and he's certain every document is valid. I'm writing this here because he'd dumb af and doesn't want to seek help.   Isn't this illegal? I don't know much but I'm pretty sure falsely accusing someone is criminal.   What can one do about it?	Yes
43	Some clarification and backstory: I am asking on behalf of a family friend who isn't technologically-savvy enough to know about reddit. He has a daughter who will soon graduate from college in the US, who does not know that he was once deported - and he wants to keep it that way if possible. Also, first post here, not sure about the rules, the whole nine yards - will edit accordingly if I've broken any posting rules.  Story: My family friend (Bob) was an illegal immigrant for about a decade or so, until the mid-90s. He went there on a tourist visa and illegally extended his stay. In the mid-90s, Bob returned to his home country to settle some family affairs, and was detained when he attempted to return. From what I understand, he was flagged by the system upon arrival at customs, and it also didn't help that he had less than $100 on him (apparently, it seems that it signals an intent to stay illegally). Bob's visa was revoked and he was sent home on the next flight.  When his daughter was starting college, Bob tried to apply for a tourist visa to visit with her, and help her settle in. But the American embassy still had his records, and denied him his tourist visa.  Now, Bob is in the process of changing citizenships to another country on America's Visa Waiver Program (legally; his wife and daughter are from said country and he has been living and working in since being deported). If he successfully changes his citizenship, would it be possible for him to legally visit the US again? Or are there any other possible (non-illegal) workarounds to allow him to visit? He no longer has any intention of being an illegal immigrant.  Thanks in advance for any advice!	Yes
44	"Hello,  My wife and I live in the states. She is not from here and is currently applying for a green card. Today, as described by my wife, a man in a green uniform came to my door while I was at work. My wife answered, and he asked about someone named ""Mr. Jefferson Jr."" To which my wife said he doesn't live here. Then he asked something along the lines of ""what's the last name of the man that does live here"" and she then told him my last name. I regret that she did that, but she was nervous and I understand. Then this man left. She said he looked like a police officer but in a green uniform with a hat that matched the uniform. I'm not familiar with what agency he may be from, but I've mentioned that my wife is applying for a green card because it may be relevant. She said he knocked somewhat hastily as if she thought he was a delivery man and was in a rush.   My thoughts? He could have been trying to verify this is where we live, and used the false idea that he was looking for a ""Mr. Jefferson Jr."" As an excuse to ask about our last name. Or it could be a coincidence, but I want to be sure. I haven't done anything of question to warrant any kind of legal action to my knowledge. Please help.   Thank you"	Yes
45	"I do not understand the legal logic in the following immigration situation in which I currently find myself in.  US Citizen with wife who is not US citizen, albeit married legally in USA over 5 years ago. We have 2 US citizen children, of very young age, currently living with wife in the foreign country. After being legally married in US, I moved to wife's country for a few years.  Wife wants to immigrate to US, so does husband (me), for the betterment of the child's education and livelihood. Husband then comes to USA to establish residence and attains a good job to prove an ability to provide for wife (as per regulations in the affidavit of support) .   Immigration services estimates 12 months before issuing a visa, while a Fiance visa will take 6 months (i.e. I go to foreign country, take a ""spouse"" and bring her back). All communications to the USCIS yield little in terms of additional information on the case. Also no way to expedite the case unless she is from an extreme situation, which she is not.   Can someone, please, explain the logic in this situation, or even better, tell me how I can see my family again."	Yes
46	Hi all,  This information is all from my mom's memory and she told me as many details as she could recollect.   My mom is currently 56 years old (California current residence). She came from Guatemala in 1989 with my dad and oldest brother. They were caught by immigration. After paying a $500 fine per person they were let go with court dates etc. My mom actually was pregnant with me at the time. I was born and a couple of months later she went back to Guatemala to see her family. My dad (now deceased) attended all court dates but she did not because she was not in the country.   When she returned around '92-'95 she applied for a work permit and was granted one that lasted from 8-10 years. Around the time the permit was up she received a letter that informed her that she needed to apply for residency. She went to see a lawyer and due to fear told him she was in the country when she was required to appear in court but was unsure of what to do so she did not attend. (In reality she was in Guatemala and that's why she wasn't present but she has been too afraid to admit this fearing the consequences.)   She applied for residency in the mid-2000s and went through the process almost getting to end until she was informed that due to the 1989 deportation order it would not be granted. She was too scared to do anything else and that's where the situation is now.  My mom has been in the country now since returning from Guatemala for 25 consecutive years. I am 27 and a citizen that lived abroad for about a year after she had me. Currently she is married to an immigrant from Mexico. She has three children born in the United States including me aged 27, 25, and 17. She is still scared every day of being deported and asked me to please seek out any resources/advice I can regarding her particular situation to try and find options for her to become a legal resident.  I appreciate anyone and everyone's advice. Thank you so much.	Yes
47	My husband had a DUI in Pennsylvania in 2009. He went through ARD to have it removed from his record. Will this impact his ability to enter Canada through Alaska for a fishing trip?  Thanks!	Yes
48	Location Vic/ Australia  I received a caution/ drug diversion for possession/ being under the influence of LSD along with a caution for possession of a air rifle last year (I'm young and stupid, that's a cop out but that's the truth).   I'm currently trying to apply for a working visa for Canada and for jobs. They ask about previous convictions and cautions including driving offences. I understand it's in my best interest to be truthful but I also know it could ruin my chances to mention these offences.   What I want to know is will they show up on a background check for my visa? I was told by police they wouldn't show up on police records checks for work as they are only cautions but I don't know if the visa application is more in depth.   Tl;dr received cautions in aus, will they show up on visa application for Canada?	Yes
49	She asked for all original copies so she could bring them to wherever and have them copied. She said I wouldn't have to sign anything and it would be fine, because they just need proof that the person coming here knows a citizen from America.  This seemed really sketchy to me, 1 because I haven't known them THAT long... and 2 - she asked not to tell my mom (who keeps all of those documents for me) and lie to her and say that it was for work purposes.  My question is - is this as sketchy as I think it is? My mom told me it was definitely not OK to give those documents over and not to 'vouch' for anyone coming especially someone I don't know.  What are your thoughts?	Yes
50	Hello!   I'm a foreign student in the US; I'm on a student visa (F-1) going to art school. I know I can't work/get paid here legally, but can I make a film (me as writer/director) if I don't get paid at all? I will gather producers and crew, and they will get paid with money we raise to make the film, but I won't. Is that legal? I plan on sending the film to festivals in the US and abroad, if that makes a difference.   I went to film school here a couple of years ago and made some short films then, but I don't know if it's different now because my major (fine arts) is different...    Thank you!	Yes
51	I'm an international student at a Dutch university. In the academic year 2016-2017 I was unable to obtain 30ECs and hence my Residence permit will most likley be revoked. However if I transfer to a different university in the Netherlands to start a new course from Sept 2017 will I be able to stay in the Netherlands? I couldn't contact IND so I'm asking here. I hope someone here knows about this. And the MoMi states that you have to gain 30ECs ie half of the Total 1st year credit points at the University where you're enrolled to continue your studies and stay in the Netherlands.	Yes
52	Hey legal helpers, my brother-in-law just moved to the USA a week ago and is approved for his Green Card but we're still waiting for it to be sent along.  In any case, he got unexpected Misdemeanor citation when he was caught swimming at a county quarry by sheriffs in Iowa. Does anyone have any experience in guessing how this could affect his immigration status? His record is very clean excluding this one screw up.  Thank you much for any advice or ideas!	Yes
53	Okay, so I was born a dual citizen of Taiwan and the US. I live in the US, but has come back to Taiwan for the summer.   On the morning of the flight, I realized my US passport has expired for many days, and the lady at the checkout counter told me to use my Taiwanese passport at customs. (Usually, I used US passport at US customs and the Taiwanese passport at Taiwanese customs) I've renewed my US passport in Taiwan, but the issue is that I don't know whether to use my US or Taiwanese passport when I return to the US.   If I use my American passport, would TSA question me for not having a record for leaving the US? On the other hand, if I use my Taiwanese passport and apply for a visa, would the process be complicated by the fact that I already hold an American passport?  Thanks.	Yes
54	Hi all,  My mother in law was just at the casino playing slots when she hit a $1,200 jackpot. When they came to pay her out the manager told her he would only give her $800 because she did not have a good social security number (she is undocumented)  they then told her that if she made a big fuss about it they would ban her from the casino. Can anything be done here?	Yes
55	"Looking for information and the best route of action to take for UK Immigration.  I've been here for almost 6 years as it is with a company sponsoring me on a Tier 2 (General) visa. I'm looking to segue into another company but I do not want the clock on my indefinite leave to remain to reset.  The questions I have are:  * Can I hold a position at a board or director level for another company while simultaneously being on my Tier 2 visa? I was under the impression that it was a strict ""no second job"" situation, or can they run in tandem?  * Is there a visa option that would let me segue onto being solely a board member of company 2, letting me leave my current company, without my Visa resetting or the need for me to leave the country to file paperwork?  Thanks in advance"	Yes
56	I am a legal permanent resident(via employment) and in April, it will be 5 years so I can apply for naturalization this month. I think Naturalization is a straight forward process that I can do myself without an attorney.   I got married last year and my spouse has overstayed her tourist visa by a number of years and is out of status. I know I can apply for her green card once I am naturalized. I want to know when I should start the process for her: 1. When I file my N-400 2. Or during the oath taking ceremony 3. Or after I get citizenship  Also, what should I put in as the status of my spouse while filling up N-400?   As mentioned earlier, I was thinking of filling up the N-400 myself and only use the services of an attorney while filing my spouse's paper. Does that sound good or is it safer to use an attorney for the naturalization process as well?  Thanks :)	Yes
57	"Hi! My question is related to visas/immigration stuff/employment.   I am not a U.S. citizen and as an international student I completed a bachelors degree in education at an american college. I have a valid teaching license from a state. Currently I'm teaching at a private English-speaking school in my home country and I'm thinking about wanting to return to the states and continue my teaching career there.   I'm not looking for some sort of teacher exchange/""cultural experience"" for myself... I am perfectly fluent in English and fully part of the culture (minus the rodeos; went to one and was terrified #peta). Ideally I'd like some sort of permanent resident situation but I'm not quite sure how to get there. All I've been seeing online is a lot of lists of forms but I have no clue what the actual process looks like.   I'm not sure if this is a common or uncommon thing, but if anyone has any advice please comment below!"	Yes
58	Hey guys, first time posting so here goes...  Backstory: My family has permanent residency status for the US from Canada, and everybody minus my dad have moved here and lived here for at least 2 years. My dad had to stay back because of delays in my brother's approval process, and after it was finally approved, he still resides in Canada due to our property not selling. He has visited the US frequently, but never stayed longer than a month.  The current situation: Dad's mother was in a coma, and her condition is deteriorating, so he intends to visit her overseas, then visit us before going back to Canada. Before leaving Canada, he was stopped by immigration and they interviewed him because he has never remained in the US since green card was approved 3+ years ago, apparently not following the rules. They said they were notating the account, and though they cannot take away the green card, they could send him to court to appeal. He took the flight, but they said he is taking a risk, and the US airport might withold the card or prevent him from flying. His cousin (immigration attorney) said he could fill out a travel request application, but it could take 6 weeks.  He's in the NY airport currently, and likely will continue to fly overseas to visit his mother, but that may jeopardize the permanent residency process my parents have spent so many years and money working on. Is this a possibility, and what can we do to minimize the risk?  Any thoughts?  tldr; dad is flying overseas and may not be granted re-entry, or have green card revoked due to non-residency since being approved. What scenarios may play out?	Yes
59	Parents died, I assumed legal guardianship of my teenage brother over a year ago who starts high school this year. Husband and I are about to accept job offers for the Netherlands. Guardianship does not have specific restrictions on anything like this and I am talking with US lawyer this week as well but wanted to post here too.   But any lawyer from Europe or US know requirements for moving with a minor who has no living parents to a country in the EU?   Thanks!	Yes
60	My sister is a Canadian citizen who married a US citizen over a year ago.  They had a child about 7 months ago, born in Canada.  She tried to cross the border yesterday with the aforementioned family and she was denied, because they believed her to be emigrating to the states, which in a way she was, but she wasn't aware of how strict the process to emigrate was.  Her husband has a job in the states and he had to go, but she had to stay here.  As far as I know, being denied from the border already puts her on a list which makes it harder to enter.  She's been living long-distance from her husband for a very long time already, she was very excited to finally have the family together and after returning early this morning she has been crying on and off all day, I haven't really seen her this torn before.  Is there anything she can do at this point?      Any and all information would be extremely helpful.  Thank you ahead of time.	Yes
61	I'm a Canadian citizen studying in the UK. I'd like to come back to Canada (and more specifically to Quebec -- I don't know if this makes a legal difference) in a few years (2-4) with my girlfriend, who is a British citizen. I'm under the impression that we could both benefit the legal advantages of being married (which I'd be happy to know more about; I'm thinking visa, scholarships, etc.), but we don't have the money or time to organise a wedding (my girlfriend's parents live in Australia).  Q: Can we get married now (in secret) and get married once more (not religiously) when we arrive in Canada?	Yes
62	"I don't know if this is the best thread to post in but it's the closest thing I have because I don't have anywhere else to look.    Hypothetically, one my of friends is an international student from an Asian country living here as a student. He has no green card but he does have a working permit. He had previous situations with his host family that made him homeless for a while. He found a new family (I'm not sure if they're his legal guardians, but they are on his school papers and in order to continue school, they are required)    Now this is when the situation gets fucky because recently the new family has been arguing about him and essentially lost the ""trust"" in him and now is forcing him to pay back his ""debts"". Debts which include food, water, room, air, etc. All of this is done while his life savings is held under pressure. They apparently have proof that he was living under their roof for free. Along with this they are forcing him to find a job (basically means he is not allowed in the house) He is afraid that he is going to be deported if he tries anything legal and I can see why. He has had many close encounters with being deported back whether it was due to financial issues or family issues. I want to help him (tried talking to my manager about getting him a job) but I don't know how to legally help so I'm going to this subreddit for help. If possible, I would like to know if I could potentially become his host family so I would be on his school papers instead of the other people.

63	Hello Everyone!  So my girlfriend is currently a DACA recipient from Honduras and has been here in the United States for 13 years. She always talks about wishing her and her family the ability to become legal residents but she says the only way she can is either for her to marry a citizen  (were not in a rush to get married) or to wait for her sister who was born here to turn 21.   Is there another way? She went through k-12 here in the US and is going to start college soon. And she works as well.  Thank You!	Yes
64	My wife and I are on what you might call an informal separation. She's been staying in another US city for about a month now. She's a 10-year green card holder and she recently mentioned that she might try to find a summer job while she's there.  My question is, could she potentially get in trouble with Immigration if she does this without having filed for a change of address? I'd imagine she'd need to give a potential employer an address and that she'd provide where she's currently staying. I'm concerned about the idea of USCIS seeing that one day and her being penalized in some form or another.  She hasn't indicated that she's going to stay there permanently, so she of course still has her official address the same as mine, which is what's on her driver's license, green card, etc.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!  *Also posted this to r/immigration before I realized it'd get more traction here, sorry*	Yes
65	"I got my 2 years green card through marriage to Citizen, and it is expiring on August. I need to apply for the 10 years green card soon.  I will participate a diversion program, and my immigration lawyer is modifying the contract for immigration reason.  The lawyer said : “It means that you are not saying the facts are right UNLESS you break the agreement. Its lawyer terms, but in immigration it makes a HUGE difference” I attach the original and the modified diversion, and want to see if anyone can check it for me and I have a few questions regarding the diversion contract Original: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m9cgzuw4t3pkp73/AACQ5aRktPbq5Ayn9DyIop-Xa?dl=0   Modified part: STIPULATION OF FACTS STIPULATION UPON VIOLATION OF FACTS: Defendant stipulates that he/she is the individual named in the complaint, and that the offense(s) charged occurred within the city limits of Lenexa, Kansas. The Defendant ONLY UPON VIOLATION OF THE DIVERSION AGREEMENT stipulate to the facts as they are contained in the complaint, police reports, written witness statements, and to any lab or other test results prepared or taken in connection with this case.

Questions 1.	Immigration Status – Would it impact my green card renewal or any future immigration status? 2.	Travelling to oversea(short term vacation) – Am I able to return to US while I am on one year diversion program? Do I need to do anything before travelling to oversea? 3.	employee background check? – Would this charges shows up on my employee background check? Can employer reject me after offering me a job and found this charges on the background check? Should I just go ahead and apply and wait until the diversion is over? Would it impact my chance for getting a job in the future, if they found out about the changes?"	Yes
66	Here's my situation regarding my marriage..  I am American-Vietnamese, born here in the United States in the state of Georgia. My husband was an international student I met when I was 17. We started a relationship in which lead to our marriage when I was 18. I had our son when I was 19. We went through paper work to change his status and attempt to get his green card through marriage. I am not familiar with what the correct terms of the whole process. During the process I was pregnant with our son, so the initial interview happened to confirm if our marriage was real or not. We definitely passed really easy because of our baby. Since then he got temporary USA resident and temporary work permit (I think that's what it is), and the application for his actual green card applied for. We got lots of confirmation letters that the application had been received. We lived our lives as we waited. During this wait time our relationship went downhill. It was a very unhealthy relationship in which I needed to escape in order to recover myself and to do everything I could to provide for my son. He was arrested when I was 21 for domestic violence. It was an accident on his part but I was scared so I called the police. He had to pay a fine, take family violence classes, and was on parole for a few months. That was the end of our relationship.. the last straw. I immediately moved to Florida with my son to get away and start my life over. I left with nothing but our clothes. I've since then built a life for my son and I here. I am about to turn 23, he is 29, and throughout these two years I have let his dad see him many times. I am grateful for their father-son bond and do not ask much from his father. His dad asked me to continue helping him getting his green card because he does not want to be sent back to Vietnam. Out of fear that he would be sent back and my son would not have his father here in the states or him not being able to help with child support, I agreed. I am in a very healthy relationship right now with a man who loves my son and I for about six months now.  Now that I live in another state and in a relationship, I'm worried. He called to tell me that he got a letter asking for an interview next month. It's been almost two years since I left and this is the first letter. He asked me to fly in for this interview. Let me also add his family here in the states are the ones handling all the paper work and they are the ones going back and forth with the lawyer.. I pretty much have been doing what I was told since this whole process begin and I have no knowledge of what goes on.  All I know is I have to attend this interview and I am nervous. He was arrested and I moved out of state and am in a new relationship. I honestly want out, but I do not know where to start. I no longer care about getting his green card and don't really want any ties to him anymore besides our son. I want to get a divorce and move on with my life. Should I go to this interview and tell them our relationship didn't work out? And I don't want to do this anymore? And is there any chances I can get in trouble?	Yes
67	Hey Reddit,  So a friend of mine works as a cook in some big sort of conference center thingy.  Before getting into the issue at hand I want to preface that we are from California and there are established laws in our state regarding mandatory meal breaks.  Ok so onto what is going on.  My friend has told me that on several occasions, employees have been required to attend meetings during their lunch period.  They cannot bring food into this meeting and they are not given any other time during the day to eat.  I know in California, it is required that you receive a 30 minute meal break after 5 hours of work unless a shift is only 6 hours.  From what I understand, the company sometimes works around this by making employees clock out early yet not actually take a break, so that on paper they appear to be getting their break and then having them take the break much later in the day.  The final issue I was curious about, is that apparently, said company is counting restroom breaks as the employee's 10s and 15s.  And im not talking about a lengthy bathroom break.  From what I am being told, if nature calls and you arent on break, you use your break.  So if you need to pee and it takes 3 minutes, say goodbye to your 10 minute break.  Any help or comments on the legality of these practices is appreciated.  From what I understand, her division doesnt really have any HR to go to, just an office manager with no real power over how things go.  Anyway, thanks Reddit!	No
68	How does an employer prove that they have informed an employee of tip credits? Can the agreement be verbal or does it have to be written? Working in a restaurant, Tip credits and credit card processing fees are being taken from my wages. I was uninformed of this upon the start of my employment. I noticed these deductions after reading the server sales report at the end of the night. I am fully aware that the employer may take these credits, but should they be informing or providing notice to an employee about the exact numbers and percentages at the time of hire or during the training?	No
69	"Hello all,  I read the FAQs and still had a brief question. As the title states, I'm a Wisconsin driver that got a speeding ticket in Georgia.   The ticket is for 20 over the posted limit on an interstate, which qualifies for the ""Super Speeder"" classification in GA, according to the cop. I was not driving a vehicle that I own. I've already learned my lesson and am prepared to deal with the consequences. I have 3 main questions here:  -WI DMV site says ""No points are assessed for convictions from other states, however, the conviction is entered on the Wisconsin driver record."" I already know about the DLC and NRVC (both of which WI is not a part of), but can anyone put into simple terms what this means, mainly in reference to insurance? If it means that my insurance may be able to see this and raise the rates, it may be something that I want to work to get reduced.  -When I go to the website listed to pay and enter the information, I can see the fee. However, it says nothing about the ""Super Speeder"" fee of [I read $200, but that could be incorrect]. It's not really clear whether the additional fee is something that I'll hear about after the fact, or if that's included. Can anyone clarify that by chance?  -Has anyone else from WI gotten an out of state speeding ticket that can comment on whether it was/wasn't worth taking time off from work to go to court in hopes of getting the charge reduced?  I'm leaning towards just paying everything and being done with it, but I want to be sure I'm not setting myself up for other consequences further down the line by doing so. Any *advice* is appreciated, and I fully understand that I am only seeking advice.  Thanks!"	No
70	Hello a bit of background information.  Me and my girlfriend are tenants at an apartment complex in Kansas. We have two cats and a dog and fully comply with their two pet limitations. We originally moved in with both of out own cats, but after my girlfriend moved several states over. I convinced her to see a therapist and her therapist suggested a therapy animal. She decided she wanted a puppy as she believed it would encourage her to go out more to combat her depression and anxiety. I have my cat, and she has her dog who is registered as an ESA and her cat. She has the documentation and everything for her ESA and is still seeing her therapist.  Two months ago we received note for an inspection regarding maintenance for fire alarms and the heater in our apartment. Upon inspection the landlord discovered our ESA dog and expressed concerns on how dirty our carpets we're and informed us that we need to find a carpet cleaner and provide a receipt and provide official documentation that our dog was an ESA. I understood and agreed that we were in the wrong because the lease we signed stated we must inform the landlord of any new pets in the apartment. The least we could do is clean the apartment. She stated she would follow up with a inspection two weeks later to see if we cleaned our carpets.  Two weeks goes by and we we're in our apartment all day and the landlord never arrived to inspect our unit. Concerned I made a call to the landlord who blantantly lied to me claiming that she sent someone to inspect our unit and claimed we never hired a cleaner. I obviously denied that happened and I had a receipt emailed to me from the carpet cleaner as proof.  My concern moving forward is what I can do, as we are receiving another inspection in the upcoming week with no reason behind why we are having our unit inspected. I feel as though our landlord is trying to encourage us to terminate our lease since they have no grounds to evict us. My biggest concern is that this time the landlord will lie or make up excuses and we will have no way to prove she is lying since neither of us will be present in the apartment all day.	No
71	So my family and I are have been living in this apartment for a about two and a half months. We have had many maintenance issues since we have lived here, the worst of which has been a build up of mold in our air vents. We have reported this issue to management several times. Recently they told us they are were contracting a company to clean the air ducts. The day that they supposedly cleaned our air ducts no body was home. When I got home that day the maintenance man was still here and told me that the vents had been completely cleaned. I had a feeling that he was not being truthful so I decided to check the vents for any signs of mold. Sure enough the vents were still full of mold. I have documented all of the moldy vents with video and photographs. We plan on contacting corporate about this issue. What other legal options might we have in this situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!	No

73	"I will have lived in this rental property 1 year as of August 18th. When I moved in last August he prorated my rent for the rest of the month, but my lease agreements of 6 months have always been from the original move in date which falls on the 18th of the month. I've been paying my rent on the 1st of the month since September of last year. This month I paid my rent as per our agreement (agreement says by the 3rd of the month without penalty) on August 1st which covers August 1st through August 31st. On August 7th my landlord emailed me a new rental agreement (without any prior communication about the new rental terms) along with a note that said the rent would increase from $650 to $670 for the next term (which starts august 19th basically). I told him then that I likely would be moving out.  In our text messages it's clear I was interested in doing this based on what he expected and I texted back and forth with him over the next few days asking various questions about the move out process and what his expectations were for me to leave on good terms. I even explicitly asked about prorated rent and deposit if I left on the rental agreement date of August 18th (since I've already paid this entire month of August). He said ""I can refund you the amount if you choose to leave during this month. It's 22 dollars per day"" and ""The deposit is for leaving the room in clean and great condition. Once I see the room I can send the deposit back through Venmo."" I will be leaving the room clean and in good condition regardless of how this ends. We had other various exchanges about me keeping him informed on whether or not I'd officially found a place. After our conversations I believed it was understood and ok for me to move out on the 18th without any loss of funds (neither deposit owed after inspection nor prorated rent money) and was actively looking for another place with a move in date of August 18th.   Today August 10th he texted me saying that since I didn't give him 30 days noticed in our lease he would not be refunding my rent for the rest of August. This blew me away and I texted him back and told him that I'm willing to abide by the terms of our lease, but I'm curious where that leaves me? My lease agreement says August 18th, but I've paid through September 1st. So I'm not sure what happens after the 18th? I live here for 13 days with no rental agreement or I move out and leave $280 dollars on the table? Can I get that money back? Even september 1st wouldn't be proper 30 days and I'm worried he will not refund my deposit because of it even though the room is in good condition? If this becomes nasty (which I hope it doesn't) do I have any rights legally if he takes my deposit out of spite? I have text messages showing my intent to leave on good terms, his respones to that, and this his flip flop 3 days later. Is the lease agreement the only binding thing here?  tl;dr landlord is increasing rent. I decided to move. I've paid through the end of the month, but my lease expires on the 18th. Do i get my money back, am I out of $280 dollars ($22 dollars per day), or do I stay for what I've already paid for? Can i sue him if he tries to keep my deposit and prorated rent after he failed to notify me of lease agreement changes in a reasonable time?"	No
74	"My sister recently passed away under some very bothersome circumstances. My family has been involved in a lawsuit over this, which is reaching its end point. We were recently informed that before everything is finalized, my father is legally entitled to inquire about his possible share of the settlement. This naturally caused a collective ""WTF?!"" moment throughout my family, as he his an absentee deadbeat who hasn't had contact with the family in well over a decade, and even when contacted about becoming a co-executor of my sister's estate, he waived his rights by not giving a fuck and ignoring it. Here are some key points:  * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate.  * My sister passed away as a legal adult; after emancipation.  * This lawsuit was initially filed by my mother as an individual, and soon turned into it being on behalf of my sister's estate, as she became the sole executor.  * My father waived his rights when it came to becoming co-executor of my sister's estate. He had an opportunity to pursue it but didn't, and has absolutely no association with the lawsuit, my sister's estate, or the family.  * My father hasn't had any contact with my family for almost 13-14 years, and has never made any attempt to make contact. He knows very little about us, made no effort to contact us and seek information regarding my sister's passing.  * My father owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support, and is a tax dodger. He's been to jail several times over both. Our attorney and the judge handling this knows, as we've provided extensive documentation about this."	No
75	Does anyone have any information on what it's like to be the victim when OSI investigates a sexual assault?  I admitted to having been sexually assaulted at AFROTC LEAD in front of my Field Training Officer (FTO). Unbeknownst to me, FTOs  are mandatory reporters. Also, because I am a cadet, my report was considered unrestricted (cadets aren't eligible for restricted reports). I was able to talk to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, and my investigation will take place at my local base rather than Maxwell, AL, and I was told that I can apply to have a Special Victims' Counsel present, but other than that, I don't really know what will happen.   I don't have any rape kits or previous police reports on file. Can OSI make me give them information (especially the name of the person who assaulted me). Can the interview/subpoena people who I have shared the name of my rapist with? I'm a college student and I really don't want to have to undergo legal proceedings. Especially not for something like this. I dramatically altered my life to avoid contact with this guy, and don't want to have to face him in this investigation.   Also, although this is a military investigation, as a cadet, I am contracted, but I believe I'm IRR. Will I continue to have my civilian rights?	No
76	I apologize in advance for this long post. I'm located in North Carolina and am a student at a public university. When I transferred in, I applied for on-campus housing but was told that due to the extensive wait list I most likely would not get a room. So I looked for an apartment. I met two people who needed another roommate because theirs was moving out. I signed the lease the morning of July 21st, and later that day I got an email from campus housing after 5:00pm notifying me that I had been assigned to on-campus housing. I called the housing office on Monday and was told that all I needed to do was send them a copy of my lease and it would be taken care of. I did so, and heard nothing. I went into the office yesterday to make sure everything was taken care of. The lady at the front desk admitted to me that she looked at the email and forgot about it, admitting that she didn't do her job. I explained the situation and was told that the date on my lease was August 1st, I already knew about my housing assignment and they were going to charge me a $3,000 cancellation fee, half of the entire years rent for half of a dorm room. I explained that since it was a sublease, I was simply added to the lease and I signed it on the 21st. I showed the people in the housing office texts that I had signed the lease on the 21st but they said that they needed something official from the apartment complex. I went to the complex and explained my situation and they printed out an email exchange with their official email on it that proved that I had started the process and signed the lease on the 1st. I took that over to university housing and they said that the cancellation fee would be waived based on this. I went online to cancel my housing and got an email asking for proof that I had already signed the lease by the time that my on-campus housing assignment was available.  At this point I believe I'm being given the run around by the campus housing to get me to pay the fee. Do I need a lawyer to contest this?	No
77	So, Here is the story  I live in an apartment for two years, and I set up a direct deposit to pay my rent. When I set it up, I made the payments come out every 30 days rather than every month. So as time went on they started walking forward (as some months had less than 30 days) my landlord called me and told me it was late, I checked and turned out it was two weeks early because of this. I fixed it but was still a month early. She said that I could skip my next payment to get back on track. Before I could do this my first lease ended and I signed a new lease around the middle of September, backdating it to August 1st (the start of the first lease) so that I could leave the residence then as I would not be renewing the lease again. She requested that I pay increased rent and pay her additionally for August and September as the increase in rent would apply at the start of the new lease. I agreed to this and started an electronic transfer of the money before it was deposited she called me very angry stating that she needed to be paid immediately, I called my girlfriend and she took a check to her that day (I got a receipt for this). I ended up leaving the residence a month early (June 31 instead of Aug 1) I had already paid her for July when I started the lease. I don't expect any return of my money for July as the lease went until August. Although I would like a return of my deposit and return of the overpayment that I made, As of today 7/25 I have not heard from her. She has my new address as I gave it to her when she did a final walkthrough. As a side note, I have bank statements and receipts showing all the payments that were made to her and when. Although I do not have a copy of the second lease as she did not provide it to me when I signed it, she intended to make copies but never did.   What are my options? Small claims court? What is the stipulations on return of deposit and when should I pursue this legally	No
78	"Last year, I went in to a California urgent care center because I ended up having strep throat. I gave them my Aetna PPO insurance, paid the $75 copay, and then went on my merry way to the pharmacy. This was about a year ago.  I did a credit report check recently, and to my surprise a $200 bill had been placed into collections over 6 months ago, with the urgent care center listed as the original account holder. So I call this urgent care, which is located in a small shopping mall and is not attached to a hospital or any other medical offices. The receptionist pulls up my account and tells me that she sees that I paid the copay, but that they have nothing to do with further billing, as they send all their claims to a contracted medical billing office for insurance collection, which is apparently the standard in the industry. She kindly gives me their medical billing company's phone number, apologizes, and says she has ""not heard positive things"" about them. Great.  So I call the medical billing office explaining that their buddy, the urgent care center, sent me to them with my qualms about this phantom $200 medical bill. She looked me up by my name and birthday, and said that yes, they did send that amount to Stanislaus Credit Control Agency after four unsuccessful attempts to contact me. Interestingly enough, the main offices for both Stanislaus and this medical billing company are both located in Modesto, CA. Anyway, the lady says this is a result of me not reaching my insurance deductible, and that this $200 was the amount my insurance, Aetna, would not cover for the urgent care visit. I thought that sounded legitimate so I eased my tone and said thanks for clearing that up.  However, I now believe she was giving me a pre-scripted run-around. I call Aetna to ask what my deductible would be for an urgent care visit. **Aetna says there is no deductible for urgent care visits, only a copay.** I ask them to look up the claim for this urgent care visit, as the urgent care center has my Aetna insurance policy on file. **Aetna has no record of any claim for any urgent care center on my behalf.**   My Aetna customer service guy says hold on, he will personally call this medical billing office. I stay on the line listening to the provided elevator music, and he comes back reporting that the person who is in control of my account is apparently not in the office today, a Monday afternoon at 2pm. I ask my Aetna customer service guy if he thinks that sounds shady. He agrees, and says he personally will try again tomorrow and get back to me. I google the urgent care center on Google, and there are already four negative reviews mentioning surprise letters from collections agencies.  Are any/all of these companies in cahoots with each other to make money from collections, instead of correctly filing a claim with Aetna? I am still waiting to hear back, as this Nancy Drew stuff all went down today. Thanks in advance for any theories."	No
79	"Ok so I have been dealing with this for a week now, and things have gone nowhere. I took my car to get it air wrapped by a gentleman who had advertised on Facebook. I picked the color, dropped off the car, and waited to see how awesome my new look would be. Things started going wrong when he sent a picture and I noticed a slight discoloration. He didn't say anything about it, so I said something, and sure enough, he messed up. So thugs aren't great because we had agreed to pick up the car that Tuesday and now it is taking longer. So I pick out the new color (since he said the original was too hard) and he got to work. Well so I thought. He didn't change out the masking, and ended up ordering the wrong color without telling me (he later told me when I asked that he had tried it and it didn't work, then told me the truth that they just didn't have it in stock). So I didn't say anything other than asking why it was different. So I go to pick it up and I first see some errors. Nothing big, and stuff he said he could fix. He was in a rush, so I paid him contingent on him fixing it. Well when I get home and have a good hour to look at it, I start noticing how poorly it was done. He also had bent trim pieces, damaged the interior door handle, and got overspray all throughout the car. I approached him and asked him to explain. He said it was normal so I asked several installers who were out of state. I have over 4 people telling me it was not done right. He said he messed up on the phone, but couldn't give a refund. So I offered a payment plan. Well now he says he spoke with a lawyer and the lawyer said since the paper didn't say it was a contract it technically isn't one. I'll attach some pictures, but I'm curious if I have a case with this or if I should cut my losses.   Forgot to add, he also removed the first covering with a large ring on (posted a video after I got the car). And I'm worried I'll find scratches underneath. Would he be liable since it was negligent to have a ring so close to car paint? Thanks!'   Edit: added pictures with picture of ""paper"" I signed.   Edit two. Didn't post the cropped picture. Will reupload"	No
80	So I feel like a total idiot, but it has already been done. A couple months ago I had a guy ask tons of questions about a smartphone I was selling, and I answered. After some back and forth he bought it. Once he had received it, he said the Sprint SIM card he had would not work. He formally requested a refund through eBay, then opened a case against me for 'product different from the advertised product'. I was exasperated after he asked me to act as tech support, and I had tried, with no results. I refunded him. He never sent it back.  PayPal and eBay both tell me I shouldn't have refunded it, but the case against me made it sound like I had to refund quickly. I feel like an 80 yr old with her first computer to fall for whatever scam it was.   They also say to report it to my local police. I keep putting it off because I see no hope in doing so. Does anyone know if the police in Iowa could do anything? Thanks for your time.	No
81	"Hi, our business entered into a 3 year, $35/month bottleless water cooler contract with a local provider. Due to dissatisfaction with the service (the machine has needed service several times and not enough water is cooled at any given time), we would like to cancel.   The provider has offered to change the machine. Otherwise, the contract provides for a $150 removal fee in the event of cancellation. It also says, ""If provider terminates a rental term under this Agreement or any Add-on Schedule due to Customer’s default, including but not limited to, non-payment of any amount when due, improper care, usage or handling of the Equipment, or failure to perform any other obligation hereunder, Customer will be responsible for payment of all fees for the remaining term(s), as well as for all damages and removal and shipping charges incurred by provider.""

82	"I'm still pretty upset. So yesterday my landlord texted me and asked if he can bring someone over for a walk through. My lease is up August 31st. We set up for 4pm because I was supposed to work but another guy wanted hours so I let him pick up my shift. About an hour ago I get a knock at the door and as I'm getting up from my bed (butt ass naked) he opens up the door and has the new tenant with him. I was so embarrassed and ran back to the room as quickly as possible. He then yelled ""we'll give you a minute!"" And laughed and his tone was like ""oh this guy is so dumb"" as soon as I opened my room door they walk in and it was so awkward. I was just cleaning as we went and kept apologizing, it wasn't filthy but embarrassing like I had my weed jar out (yes I have my med card) and underwear in the bathroom floor, plates on he counter, I was planning on doing a quick clean up before they came.  They actually got done quick and then he came back and talked to me like I was a kid telling me I need to keep the place clean and stuff. Also questioning why I told him I would be at work. I told him I don't owe him an explanation and that we had an agreed time and he got upset and was like ""ok whatever I know what we talked about"". I have texts as well so I don't know why he even went there.  This isn't the first incident though. In March I come home to him leaving my unit and he said it was a leak they found during the inspection and he came to fix it. He then said he needed to grab some tools and will be back in 30. After working a 12 hour shift I was just ready to go to bed and after about an hour I said fuck it and assumed he's not coming and feel asleep and wake up to my bedroom door opening up and him telling me he was back. He then began looking in closets and shit saying he was trying to find the leak. (But he got the tools already to fix the kitchen sink) also they found it during the inspection so what was he looking for?   This feels extremely invasive and annoying. Is there anything I can do legally? It just upsets me because I'm wondering how many times he's came when I'm not here, and he brought the girl over to view the place when I told him I would be at work.   I've also found long blonde hairs around my place and no one with blonde hair comes over. At first I thought I was going crazy until if felt like every other day people at work were telling me I had a long hair hanging from my beard I blew it off months ago but now I'm starting to think that he may bring people over during the day, as I work mostly during the day and I work from sun up to sun down most days.   Also I noticed its times that my living room tv would be on( I'm not even in the living room unless company is over) or I had 2 less packs of ramen. Things that are big enough that I noticed but small enough where I don't look into at all. I know I can't prove any of this, but what options do I have? I have the neighbor looking out and she told me he does similar stuff to her but with her it's just him popping up and not having stuff out of place.   Is he within his rights?"	No
83	I don't know who it is yet, but I know there's a charge for Domino's pizza that isn't mine among other things. If I can find out which Domino's and trace that order to its source, I could potentially find out who stole from me. Obviously I want them in prison, but I'd like to sue the pants off them too.	No
84	I’m not sure where this falls as My knowledge of all this stuff is pretty much zero, would appreciate some help.   Riding bicycle this afternoon and I hit a huge unmarked pothole. Flipped over and messed up my knee pretty bad. I called 311 but was told, after they asked if I needed an ambulance which I said no to, I have to go into police station to make an accident report.   Went home cleaned myself up then visited hospital. Will be going back after the hospital to accident sight and take pictures of pothole then will go to police station to file accident report and provide all the paperwork from hospital.   As this was an unmarked pothole in the bike lane will the hospital bill and bike damage bill fall on the city of Chicago to pay? Or am I paying for this myself even though it wasn’t my fault? I am uninsured at the moment but will be insured at the end of August through my colleges insurance plan which I filled out paperwork for already.   Thanks for your time	No
85	"Note: I have a public lawyer, so I will try and be brief. This is in the state of Massachusetts.  Simply put, I've been charged with multiple counts of child rape. A child has claimed that they were raped and molested over the course of a few years by me (unsure of details). There is no physical or forensic evidence available, so it's the alleged victims word versus mine.  One of the only defenses I can think of (since I cannot prove I didn't do something) is a friend of mine who is related to the alleged victim. This friend of mine knows I've never been alone with the alleged victim and is willing to testify. Also, the biological mother of the alleged victim has a few mental disorders, I just don't know what exactly.  **I'm conflicted on these two points below;**  **1)** Proof beyond reasonable doubt is needed for a conviction, which seems impossible in this case.  **2)** I did some reading and came across a passage that stated if there is no ""logical explanation"" for the alleged victim to lie about the assault, then the defendant should be presumed guilty.  **Question:** Should I be worrying? Should I attempt or accept a plea bargain? If so, what can be considered a good plea bargain since I'm looking at maximum penalty of life in prison, despite not committing the crime?  Thanks in advance."	No
86	A fellow Redditor told me over on personal finance that if your hours at your job get butchered to the point where you only have one small shift a paycheck, it can be viewed as constructive dismissal and might be grounds for unemployment qualification even if you quit.  My question is, is this true? And if so, are their any technicalities and conditional rules to look into before I try to apply? I worked at McDonald's for three months and in my last month of work they cut me to one day a week, and eventually one day a paycheck. So, naturally, I quit. I'm looking for a new job but could really use some cash to hold me over, even if it's just enough to keep my phone turned on and pay my ride for gas when they take me to interviews.	No
87	"My wife and I recently got married and headed over to the social security office in our city to change her name. She decided that she ""hates"" her middle name and thus requested it to be changed to her mothers first name. Normally, they don't ask you questions about a maiden name change if you have your marriage license on you.   Long story short the name got changed and about a month later, which is today, we headed into the DMV to update her license to a newer version with her new name on it. They told us at the DMV that the name was changed without a petition of the court indicating a lawful name change. How can I get this fixed? Why did the social security office allow us the get the name changed if it is unlawful? What course of action should I take?    Thank you for reading my long post.    TL; DR: Wife and I got married, tried to change her middle name to something unrelated, social security did it, DMV told us we messed up and sent us to the clerk court, now we either pay money to fix it, or change her name back."	No
88	This is more of a curiosity question; however, it could affect me if the fires affect my area of BC. If the RCMP or Forestry service issue an evacuation order and I believe it is premature or unnecessary do I retain the right to stay on my property which is owned by me? I don't want to leave and stay in some run down hotel or some school gymnasium. So r/legaladvice, can I stay in my home under an evacuation order?	No
89	"Location is Quebec, Canada  I've been living with my girlfriend for a little over a year. According to Quebec laws, that would make us common-law partners. However, my ""official"" address is still with my parents.  I want to add her to my employer's insurance policy as a common-law partner, but I also don't want to commit fraud...  What's the situation? Would I be in trouble if I added her? Are we common-law partners? If I change my address in the following days, would I have to wait a year for us to be?  Here's the relevant condition for common-law partnership according to the CRA:  &gt;has been living with you in a conjugal relationship, and this current relationship has lasted at least 12 continuous months;  Thanks"	No
90	Sorry in advanced for the rushed writing.  I just received an eviction notice over violated my neighborhoods HOA rules regarding pets.  According to our landlords property management company dogs are not allowed in my neighborhood.  My dog is registered as an ESA and was prescribed by my doctor as a way to manage my stress as I suffer from an autoimmune disease. I provided both the dog's registration and my doctor's note when the realty company said the registration wasn't enough on it's own. They have since been hounding us with fees and emails with blatant lies about where the animal is kept. They stated they recieved reports that we kept the dog in our garage and yard for days on end. Beyond being complete lies, our dog has been alone a collective 6 hours since we rescued her. That culminated in an eviction notice today.  I have already filed a complaint with the City of Austin department of Housing and they have forwarded that to Housing and Urban Development here in Texas.  A thing to note is that about 2/5 of my neighbors own dogs and we were never provided any HOA rules, just told by our property management company that the HOA forbids them.   I'll also provide details that I had to answer from my complaint since those may be useful.  It is a shared wall condo I live in with a fenced in back yard. My names is on the lease. My adoption of the dog went through on 7/11 and her registration as a ESA was approved on 7/14 and requested accommodation that day with her registration paperwork. On 7/21 we sent the additional doctors note that tromped me getting the dog. On 7/24 they said I needed a note from a psychiatrist or psychologist which is insulting since I don't have a mental disability, but a physical one.  All of this is causing me immense distress and I've had to miss several days of work, which my HR director has noted and been very helpful with.  What are my options and what should my next steps be?	No
91	currently in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, I'm working on getting out (all without his knowledge) I'm just trying to tie up loose ends. A few months ago I fell asleep in one of the recliners in our living room and when I woke up he had his phone out and showed me ALOT of pictures he took of me with his penis out and on my face in various different places. near and almost in my mouth from what I can remember. he only showed them to me that one time then refused to delete them when I begged him to. be he wouldn't even show them to me again when I asked. he laughed and thought it was funny and never showed them to me again. I feel so violated. what can I do? press charges? ensure somehow they get deleted??	No
92	Hey all. Sorry if I come off as a noob when it comes to legal matters.  About 2 months ago, someone left a threatening note on my door. I was pretty certain it was my roommate's friend (let's call him michael) who I got kicked out of the apartment because he was staying there while my roommate wasn't. I filed a police report just to have it on record and notified the private security company that works for the apartment complex I'm staying at.  Just recently, while I was away for the weekend, someone broke in through my window and took my guitar and my speaker (roughly $500 - $600 in combined value). Also some of the walls are slightly damaged. I filed a supplemental police report. I strongly suspected it was Michael.   When I notified the security company, they sent one of their officers over to my unit just to ask me some questions. The officer said that he saw someone who fit Michael's exact description messing with my window and approached him and asked if he lived there. Michael told the officer that he was the one living in my unit. Then the officer just kept making his rounds around the complex.   Just this week, the apartment complex switched to a different security company. Idk if that's relevant or suspicious or anything like that. Just thought it was weird.  Really all I want is to be reimbursed for my losses, and to not be charged for damages to my apartment. Can I do anything about it? Would I have to go after the apartment complex or the security company?  Any input would be appreciated. Cheers!	No
93	We live in Virginia for starters. A little background I'm 24, my husband is 32. We've been together for 4 years and married for 3. We have one child together and have purchased a home while married.   He has been verbally and emotionally abusive to me for a long time now, and has cheated on me in the past. In recent events he's brought it to my attention that he's miserable and that this isn't the life he wanted for himself.   I've made it clear to him that the only thing I want out of this marriage is our daughter, I don't want spousal support, child support, none of the property. Just her.   The problem I've run into however is I currently don't have any means of acquiring any money, he's our sole bread winner.   So my question is, what the hell do I do.   I can't keep doing this with him, I'm at the end of my emotional threshold.	No
94	I am posting this for someone, and I am unsure if the details provided or 100% accurate as well. They are how ever close to the truth.    Around this time last year a young man (I will call him person A) was killed in a hit run by another (I will call him person b) young man in my hometown while person a was walking home from work late at night. Person b then removed person A's body from underneath his car, moved his body away from the side of the road and sped off.   As the days followed he had help from his dad with cleaning his car, and then hid his vehicle at his uncles business. Person A is now out on a $50,000 personal bond, and has court dates coming up  Is there anything I can do to help her?    https://imgur.com/gallery/yz5b0	No
95	So, this is a throw away account just in case because this deals with insurance, and I know little about it.  I posted in r/insurance and r/personalfinance too as I was referred.  A couple nights ago I was working an ON shift, and I typically park my car across in a lot that our company is allowed to use. This is downtown in a big city. Me, being a moron, left my spare set of keys and a spare debit card hidden in the center console. My shift ended somewhere around 7 am, and that's when I noticed my car was missing. Where it had been was replaced with a large pile of shattered window.     I called the police, and filed a police report. Then my dad (he handles the insurance and I pay him for it) filed a claim with our insurance guy. We have pretty good coverage, but the police have to search for the car for up to 14 days before the claim is considered I believe. Given the car was bought for about 7k, but certainly not nearly as valuable anymore, and there were things of value I could replace easily through insurance, I was not entirely upset.  Today, I was reviewing the cameras at my work out of curiosity. I noticed that my car started and took off at 330. I went backward in time and saw two people staring at it, looking around, and approach it at about 315. Their full faces are on camera, a little blurred, but identifying. The car window getting smashed was too dark to see, but there are companies with cameras next door.     What I would like to know is what would be my best option from here.    I can:    A. Report the footage to the officer.   B. Gather more footage and take my time.   C. Let the suits in Washington figure this out.    I do not want to do anything very illegal and obviously not commit insurance fraud, but I also would like to know my best decision financially.   I appreciate any and all advice.	No
96	"In August, I will be moving into an apartment with some friends near the University we attend. The move-in packet that we all recently received states that move in day is August 15th but first months rent is due in full on the 1st. They also said that no early move ins requests will be considered and they will not prorate the rent. I emailed them today asking why we cannot use the apartment during that time (which is not a big deal to me since classes don't start till the following week and I have work where I live till the 11th) and whether that two weeks of rent will be put towards anything. They said that they will be working of renovations and doing walkthroughs with former tenants during that period and that the money will go toward the ""1st month of the 12 month equal installment plan that make up [our] whole rent"". My mother and her coworker, who are both former apartment mangers, have stated that it is illegal in the state of Texas for a landlord to charge for a period where the tenant is unable to access or use the property. Is this correct and if so what can I use to quote (preferably a state law) when I reply back? Neither my parents nor my roommates parents are too excited for paying on an apartment that we cannot use.  My parents have an on call attorney that I do have access to but I would prefer to use that as little as possible. So, it would be a great help if I could get some help finding some exact statute that I could use.  Thanks to everyone in advance."	No
97	Our HOA is pursuing a lawsuit against the declarant of our building. The building is an old industrial warehouse/mill that was converted in loft condominiums. Evidently, the municipality inspected the entire building and overlooked several violations, huge structural problems with one facade and the roof. Certificates of occupancy were issued for each individual unit, but not the entire building. Somehow, construction proceeded. Years later, our HOA decided to sue the declarant for failing to remedy these structural issues, seeking funding for repairs. The problem is this: condo fees have increased by 200% in five years, as our HOA continues to levy assessments and fee increases to pay escalating legal costs. We have no transparency or visibility into the status of the case, we are all expected to continue coughing up money to fund an endless lawsuit with no guarantee of success. Potential buyers/investors have been turned away by the excessive condo fees, we have this feedback in writing from our realtor. Additionally, no lender will fund a mortgage for any unit within our building due to the litigation. Homeowners are trapped here, we cannot sell, and the constant fee increases without commensurate added value erodes our competitive advantage. Neighboring communities charge 1/2 our condo fee rate and offer twice the amenities (pool, landscaping, gym, tennis courts, etc). We have hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity, locked away due to the decisions of our HOA. I'll never buy another place in a HOA for as long as I live.	No
98	Hi, So I had 8 months left on my lease when I had to move out. The apartments told me after 1 week of moving out the apartment would be ready and that they will try to rent it out ASAP to minimize my losses. After 2 days of signing and paying them the reletting fee, they change the availability of the apartment to 2 weeks. They decide to renovate and increase the rent of the apartment since now is renovated. Before leaving I asked and they told me they will not renovate. I even ask for the price my apartment will be rented and they mention they would not know but it will be most likely cheaper than the other 4 apartments and similar to one since mine was not renovated. Is there anything I can do. Is like they took advantage of me paying already for those 2 weeks.  Second, since it will take them a lot to rent those apartments. Can I just send a friend to do a 1-month lease with them? The apartment price is considerably high when you do 1 month. But I still have 8 left,  and I doubt they will rent the apartment. Would I be still legally bound to pay for the other 7 months?	No
99	"(All parties involved live in California but the property is in Nevada)    Mom bought a property about 8-10 years ago for $400k. Mom runs a home health business out of this house. Then 4 years ago when the market turned, they were upside down in the house with a bad interest rate. Their real estate agent helped them come up with this plan to foreclose on the house then short sell it to the Real Estate Agent's friend who we'll call R for $245k. R had plenty of money/properties so it was easy for him to hide the accounting. Mom even had the cash on hand to pay R the $245k so he could buy the property on the short-sale. Obviously they should have just paid off the mortgage with this money so the stupid high interest was irrelevant. Anyways the business operated out of the house as normal and Mom continued to pay the taxes on the property. About 2 years ago they transferred the deed from R to a cousin with a different last name.      So I just learned of this today because Mom was planning to have the deed transferred back from the Cousin to Mom soon. Cousin is also a real estate agent and was trying to explain that putting it back in moms name will put red flags on the property to any lender of a potential buyer down the road. Meanwhile I'm just sitting there like ""WTF...what about the fraud my sweet little innocent future mother in-law just committed to con the bank out of $155k?!""      No legal consequences have arisen from the situation yet so I'm trying to figure out their options here. As I see it:   1. The cousin keeps the property in her name and let the business operate as it has been.   2. The cousin can eventually sell the property. I fear if it would be too risky for Mom to ever get the money from that sale though.   3. Try to clean it up. Get a lawyer, see if they can make a deal with the bank, own up to the fraud and pay off the $155k that was essentially stolen from the bank. This is what we're pushing them to do but I don't know if there are criminal implications for this route."	No
100	My boyfriend has to pay child support to his child's mom. He paid through Western Union the first month (last month) as per the agreement, and the money was supposed to start being taken out of his check this month. They never told his employer to take the money out, did not send his child's mom a card to receive the money on, and now today is the day she's supposed to receive the money. She's badgering him and we're not sure what to do.   Should he send the money through Western Union today and have a copy of her signature saying she got it? What do we do if he sends the money today, but next week she receives a card and they take the money out of his check?  The Child Services number for the county she lives in has not been answering their phones, and she apparently didn't have gas to go up there to talk to them in person.   Redditors, please help!!	No
101	"Our apartment has had A/C issues off and on for the past year. We've submitted dozens of maintenance requests, usually with a short term solution within a couple of days.  This time the A/C stopped working completely. They supplied 1 bedroom with a portable A/C unit (still a huge pain, really in the way in the room), the other doesn't have one. It got up to 85 degrees in the apartment today.  Now I know that air conditioning isn't required in a rental property in GA. However, if the apartment was leased with an A/C unit, the landlord must repair within a **""reasonable time""**. [Source](https://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/repairs-to-rented-property-answers-to-common)  1. Question 1: Is there legal precedent/agreed upon definition for what defines a ""reasonable time"" when it comes to apartment repairs, specifically air conditining?  Follow up to that, our lease agreement says the apartment complex has to act with ""customary diligence"" to make repairs if the A/C is broken.  2. Question 2: Is there legal precedent/agreed upon definition for ""customary diligence"" for apartment repairs?  Somewhat doubtful we have any recourse in this situation, which is really unsettling given how unbearable living in an 85 degree apartment is. But if anyone has any info so that we can at least attempt to put more pressure onto the building management I would appreciate that."	No
102	TEXAS We were served with a writ of execution on 7/13. The constable knocked on the door, said Good luck, signed the back and left. I opened it up and then called the JP court to ask about it. They told me the constable shouldn't have just left etc. The constable showed back up 30 mins later &amp; asked to see the paper he served me. The constable asked if we could come up with a payment agreement. We did &amp; agreed to a deposit of $1,000 and payment of $250 starting on Aug 25. He wrote out the agreement on his letterhead, signed it, and gave it to me. I asked if this was it, and now he wont be back to take things, and he said yes, there is an agreement now and unless you do not make payments everything is good. He gave the check to the person who sued us and he cashed the next day.I called the constable the next day, and he said that the person who sued us could technically still have him force the writ and take our possessions. I asked WHAT ? Yesterday he told me that the agreement he wrote down would suffice the writ. I am so confused as what to do now.	No

104	"We live on a lake in North Carolina where a development is going in across the street. Our driveway is directly across from one of the entrances to this new subdivision, which is mostly finished except for maybe 20 or so houses on the side of the subdivision closest to us. We had about 2.25 inches of rainfall in an hour or so yesterday which lead to a very large amount of silt deposited in our flower beds, in front of our garage door (some inside the garage), around the back of the house under our deck, etc etc. A large amount of debris traveled with the water and much of our mulch has been carried away.  As far as I can tell, the rainwater washed into the development's street, past the silt fences, quickly clogged the storm drains (because of the silt catchers they place in the drains), and then ran straight down the street, across the road between our house and the subdivision, and then down our driveway. I ran into the developer today who fed me a line about the gas company destroying the silt fence and not fixing it properly and how he's going to see if they'll fix it and clean up the silt for us. He was very clear that he's not going to take responsibility for the runoff because ""it was a 1,000-year rain that won't happen again"", and apparently other houses had mulch washed away (which I see no evidence of). He's going to send his guys out to start cleaning up the silt, but he won't pay for any landscaping because the water would have done that anyway. Which, of course, is complete BS because the silt clogged the storm drains. It seems to us, based on previous storms, that the installed drainage is not sufficient to deal with the runoff created by the subdivision. Whether or not it will get better once all of the houses are built and grass starts to grow, I can't say.   I would greatly appreciate some guidance on where to go from here? Contact our home insurer? Contact the county? There has to be a precedent for this.  Thank you."	No
105	"As the title states I'm 22. My mom got the no contact order when I was really young, no older than 4. I met with my dad, mostly out of curiosity but partially because I wanted to fill the void I felt during my childhood.   My whole life he was called my ""sperm donor"" and as I grew up and saw my mom for who she truly was I became more and more curious about my father and what really happened. (Feel free to stalk my comment history for more backround on my mom and our relationship)   The short version is I spent my entire life being the villain in my mom's story, even as a young child. I was blamed for everything wrong and the constant abuse I endured was ""my fault"" as well.  So when I heard that my dad wanted to meet me, I jumped at the chance. We spent 2 hours talking, about our cats, my mom, our childhoods, anything that came to mind.   I would love the opportunity to meet with him again and to possibly have him involved in my life but the no contact order worries me.   My questions are:   Would the no contact order still be valid even though I'm an adult?  If there are different types, how would I go about finding the information as to what exactly the order entails?  And finally, if it is still valid, how would I go about getting rid of or ending it?

106	I moved into an apartment 3 days ago. when I first walked in there was a dead roach next to my door. immediately I called the complex and they told me pest control only comes out every Monday (this was Tuesday)  ever since then I've seen about 5-6 a day. there's roach shit all over my living room floor and in my bathroom. they're dropping from the ceilings. I'm like creeping around my damn apartment on high alert every day paranoid about seeing one. I can't even live in my own place because I'm just alert about seeing another one. they're crawling outside my door, outside my window, idk what else to do at this point  if they come in and spray and I'm still having problems does this give me grounds to legally break the lease?

108	So I got a mechanic's lien from a company that didn't do work on my property...but is owned by the same guy whose company DID do work on my property. We are in a dispute over the technicalities of the work...and an inspection done by 2 third parties may have elucidated he committed fraud which is why I'm hesitant to pay at this moment (coupled with the fact that he billed stuff my insurance denied and I cannot afford at the moment), but that's besides the point. The point is, we signed a contract that said he couldn't put a lien on my property prior to the work being done. Now he's filing the lien on behalf of this second company. Can he do this? Also, one thing that I thought about, can he say that he transferred the debt from company A to company B? In court, are there ethical considerations that could defend me considering it's the same dude that owns both of these companies?   &amp;nbsp;  I'm gonna lawyer up soon but I literally cannot sleep over the fact that I may lose my home...and it's making me sick to my stomach.

110	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
111	"This happened last Friday. I want to believe that I'm worrying over nothing, but just to be sure I thought I should ask for some advice here.   **Background:** I am a university student and have lived in this apartment for 1 year with three roommates. The three roommates also lived there the year before that (I took the place of someone who moved out). We have had cockroaches for the past year at varying degrees of disgusting. Two years ago, my three roommates said that there were some but they made efforts to be clean to keep the bugs to a minimum. I moved in last summer and the heat brought them back at full force. The landlord had my apartment fumigated (as well as several others) before school started and that helped with some of the problem. Now as you can imagine, since the exterminators only locally treated several apartments, the cockroaches were gone for a bit but came back soon enough. I believe that she would have had to tent the whole place to really fix the problem. As a poor college student I decided to just keep the place clean and not move out and break my lease and deal with the bugs as they came, and this worked for most of the year. The landlord also fumigated the place at the end of the school year (this past June) but again, that only solved the problem temporarily and we still see bugs occasionally.   **The problem:** My apartment was being shown to potential new tenants and the landlord was there with them. At the end of the trip this dialogue occurred:  Me: ""Are you guys looking at this apartment?""  Them: ""No, not this one.""   Me: ""Well just to let you know, but the first floor has cockroaches.""   The landlord came back with someone after they had gone (a higher up?). The higher up (HU) told me that what I did was illegal because the entire first floor does not have cockroaches, only this place. I disagree with this because I did not say the entire first floor has bugs, I just said there were bugs. It would be foolish to assume bugs are localized to my apartment only because that's not how bugs work. I know that other places were treated for the bugs and I have a friend on the fourth floor who also says he has bugs. In any case, the HU told me to not do that again, and that they would come into my apartment on Monday to check for ""cleanliness.""   **My question:** Am I going to get sued? Are they going to try to say that my apartment is the only one with the problem and they're going to take away my security deposit? I truly think I didn't say anything patently false and I know that CA residents have a lot of rights as renters, but I just want to know what I'm up against for the rental company. Also, if it helps I'm moving out at the end of August for other reasons, so I won't have to deal with this landlord ever again soon."	No
112	I spoke to management today about it and she said he is a football player and they have had issues with football players being loud and a disturbance. She said she would email him about the complaint and told me to call the cops next time I heard it. I also constantly smell weed from in front of his department. I really don't want to call the cops and get this guy kicked off the team, and I'm also not sure they'll take me seriously because I already called once and no one came out that I'm aware of., and this is a college town so I'm worried they'll just let it slide because of his status. However, I can't stand the loud thumping at 2 am every morning coming through my walls. I don't want to go over there in case they gang up on me (usually multiple football players there at one time).   What should I do and would the cops even take me seriously for a noise complaint? It IS against our city ordinance for it to be heard through an apartment dwelling.	No
113	Hey Guys,  Long story short I need to execute a quit/claim to get my girlfriend on the deed of our house. I am currently talking with a law firm that'll do it for 300 dollars. They mentioned 145 of that is a conveyance fee that will just have to exist. I am curious if there is a reliable way I can do this myself or if that 155 extra is worth it. Or if anyone knows someone who can reliably do it for cheaper that'd be awesome.   Lorain, Ohio	No
114	Hello!  I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.  This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.  When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?  Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.  Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.  I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.  I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.  At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.  I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)  It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.  **tl:dr University won't accept payment via an AmeriCorps award, won't release transcript, how do I negotiate with them?**	No
115	My friend I visited over the weekend is renting a house where he and his mother have been living for the past 8 years. This place is in awful condition and it seems like the landlord isn't willing to do anything about it.   He asked the landlord to modify the dryer so that the exhaust goes outside and doesn't get the humid hot air inside the house, but the landlord ignores him. The basement surely has mold, it smells really strongly. There are many large cracks in concrete on the basement walls. Central AC doesn't work.  Paint is completely peeled from some of the walls. This house hasn't had any maintenance done to it as far as I can tell during the entire time that my friend has been renting. They only pay $500 a month in rent, but this place must be a health hazard.  My friend also sleeps in the basement and because it's cool there and doesn't seem to mind the possible health risks that happen with longtime exposure to mold. He does have a good and stable employment making $35K a year but is a functional alcoholic.  From a tenant standpoint, what rights does my friend have in terms of making this place livable?	No
116	I got married in 2012, divorced in 2014, and was in a related legal battle through May of this year (2017). As such, I have a LOT of paperwork left over... Original marriage certificate, letters from my attorney to myself and copies of what they sent to my ex, letter stating that we are legally divorced, etc.    How long do I need to hang on to this? The final court date I had was, as mentioned, back in May- and at this point everything has been completely finalized. No further issues to resolve in court. Can I shred everything, including the original marriage certificates?    Possibly pertinent information: I do NOT have children, there is no alimony, and no shared assets that were divided up at all (house or otherwise).   Thanks!  **TL;DR**: Went through a divorce + related legal battle, everything is finally resolved- can I shred/burn the papers, or is there some reason I would need them?	No
117	My uncle was a landscaper. He was working for someone that owns a family business company. They were working on a  yard and he needed to get something from the back of the truck. While he was standing behind the parked truck someone under the influence drove by and struck him . That was at 2pm yesterday. He was pronounced dead at the hospital around 3pm that day. His wife and children are obviously distraught. The man that hit him has prior d.u.i convictions. A couple of months ago my dad (his brother) passed away. My uncle was generous enough to help put in thousands for my dads funeral but with doing that his family is left with little to no money for my uncles funeral and other expenses. If the guy driving doesn't have a legal license or isn't insured are they at a loss? Is there any legal action they should try to take?	No

119	My friend is going through a contentious divorce right now. She has asked me to give a deposition and possibly testify for her. I really want to, but have an underlying concern holding me back.   They both have a history if drug use, and I have smoked pot with both of them in the past. The things she wants me to testify about have nothing to do with drugs, so I guess my question rests with the likelihood that I would be questioned about my own drug use and what the consequences would be. Is it possible that testifying to that could mess up job, adoption, or similar prospects for myself down the line? Also, my friend seems to think I might get drug tested for agreeing to be a witness. Is that right? I really just want a clear understanding of what I'm getting into if I agree to do this.    Do they drug test witnesses in situations like this?	No
120	"I need to disclaim some funds I would otherwise be inheriting so that they can go back to the Estate to settle outstanding debts. These funds are with Vanguard.   I submitted the paperwork they gave me and that is all in order but I also need to write up a document specifically disclaiming the funds by account number. The agent I've been dealing with was unable to give me a ""blueprint"" but said what I write up must include the account numbers and their reference number.   The Estate is already in the red, I don't want to pay the lawyer another $250 out of pocket to do this simple task if I can avoid it and I need to get this settled soon.    I'm in NY and another sibling in MA has to submit a similar document for their shares. Any suggestions?"	No
121	All names have been changed.  My boyfriend Abe and I live in a house with 7 people total right now. The house is owned by the K family, whom Abe knows personally. Abe acts as landlord by finding people to rent the rooms, collecting rent to send to the K family, repairing whatever necessary in the house, etc. This agreement is not in writing. We moved in about a year ago, before that a friend of ours who also knew the K family took care of the house but he moved out about 6 months ago. If Abe were to leave, the K family would sell the house.  The other roommates live here with no lease, no security deposits, nothing in writing and pay rent on a monthly basis.  One of our roommates, Kevin, has been living here a little longer than Abe and me. The entire time he has been here every single person has had complaints about him. He is very messy when it comes to the kitchen/bathrooms, never pays bills on time, and steals food. We talked to him about it many times and warned him that if he didn't improve we would ask him to move out, but tried to be patient with him as he is an old friend of Abe's.  A few months ago, Kevin's girlfriend Britney, who was living elsewhere, got into a fight with her roommate, who took out a restraining order against her. So Kevin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. After a week or so she asked if she could continue staying there until August, to which we said yes and asked her to start pitching in for utilities but no additional rent.  Since Britney moved in she has made a few efforts to clean but on the whole the place has been a lot messier and they continue to steal food. We have asked them many times to clean their bathroom, as they share it with two of the other roommates, but they are adamant they shouldn't have to do it.  Since they refused to clean up after themselves, and it is now August and Britney has not made any effort to look for other housing, we asked Kevin and Britney both to move out. We haven't given them written notice yet as we are able to be pretty flexible about the room and want to give them a reasonable amount of time to find somewhere else, but we told them 30 days roughly. However both Kevin and Britney have issues managing money which is the main problem with moving out. Britney in particular has lawyer fees since she assaulted her roommate, but she also hasn't been contributing to Kevin's rent at all even though she shares his room (and takes up a large portion of the common areas with her stuff since their room isn't big enough).  So basically we want to give them written notice to leave in 30 days but are concerned that even though they have agreed to move out, they won't find a place in time or be able to pay for it. I'd like to find out what exactly I need to include in the notice so that if they are still here by the end of that period we will be able to take some kind of legal action (and if it comes to that, what's the best approach?).  I'm wondering if we need to involve the K family as well or if we can give them notice by ourselves. Abe has already talked to the K family and they are fully supportive of our decision but I don't know if we need them to sign the notice as well. Here is what we are planning on giving them so far:    (Date)  (Kevin's full name and Britney's full name)  (Address)    Kevin and Britney,  Please take notice that I am ending your rental of the property located at (Address).  You have received this notice letter because you have a month-to-month tenancy and I would like to end the tenancy. You must move out within 30 days after receiving this notice.  Signed  (Abe's full name. Or K family?)     We are planning on printing this out and giving it to them in person. A few other questions I have:  Do I need to write separate notices for Kevin and Britney or can they both be on the same one?  Who needs to sign it? (Britney claims that in addition to giving them 90 days, we need every roommate in the house to sign but I don't think this is true)  To what extent does the K family need to be involved?  Do I need to provide a reason for ending their tenancy, or reference any specific laws? We live in Virginia.  Thanks so much if you've read all this and I appreciate any advice you could give!	No
122	"Hi legaladvice peeps,  A few weeks ago, my partner and I signed for a new apartment beginning August 1. We(and our guarantors) signed the lease and paid for the security deposit, first month's rent, and broker's fee(about $7500 in total), and proceeded to start changing utilities and scheduling movers and days off from work (all with a promised August 1 move date in mind).     Our broker informs us that we won't be able to move in August 1 and that it would be safe to say we could move in August 15, because the current tenant's new apartment won't be ready. Essentially, these tenants are waiting for the tenants in their new apartment to move out(which may not be until July 31) because their management won't draft up a lease or give them a move in date until they receive keys. The turnaround will take about 2 weeks according to this management company hence the August 15 move-in date. They are currently hoping that these other tenants will move out a week early, moving their move-in date to August 7 which is still terrible imo. They refuse to find themselves a hotel and storage space for the interim period. Their rationale is ""One of us is pregnant, and it's very stressful for us, so we aren't going to move until we are ready."" They refused to renew the lease and as far we know had never asked for a month to month lease. The tenants were informed with proper amount of notice that their lease was expiring 7/31 and that the landlord already had new tenants ready to move in.     We have informed the broker + landlord that moving in after August 1 is pretty unacceptable -- we will lose over a thousand dollars because my partner will have to cancel her sublet arrangement at her current apartment (which she was set to move from on 8/1), and I will have to move in with her for some undefined amount of time (from 1 to 15 days, approximately). I will have to pay moving fees twice, take days off from work, and I've already had to cancel professional trips between the dates of 8/1-8/15.     We have informed the landlord of all of this, and they basically said they would try their best to motivate the tenants to leave on time. I suggested that they could try reimbursing our expenses via the current tenants' security deposit, or notify them that even one day stayed past 7/31 will lead LL to proceed against them. The broker has been stressing to this couple how bad this could be for them monetarily– a lot of people's money is on the linen including ours, the broker, and the landlord although we don't know if that's getting through to them.     We signed a Blumberg A101 Condo Leasing form (https://www.blumberglegalforms.com/Forms/101.pdf) which includes a clause saying that the landlord isn't liable for failure to give tenant possession of the unit at the beginning of term - basically, it says LL's only obligation in this scenario is to prorate rent for each day they can't give possession, which they have already offered to do. As explained above, however, this situation will cause us to pay rent twice in August.      NYC housing-educated people, what are our options in this case? We still would like to move into this apartment, but it would also be useful to know if this can be used as leverage to cancel a lease, in a worst-case scenario where tenants squat for more than 2 weeks. Also, I'm curious about precedent for this scenario, and what landlords are typically liable for in a case of holdover tenants + signing a lease on property that they can't actually give possession for"	No
123	I'm not exactly sure if this is the right thread for this, but I need some insight and don't know where else to go. My boyfriend and I went to hard summer this weekend, and on Saturday he got caught selling ecstasy pills and I got caught in the cross fire. Before entering the event he asking if I could bring in his ecstasy pills ( 7 pills , Oreos and jacks) for him, I said sure. We made it through security with the pills. About 15 mins later he asks for me to give him the pills , so I hand him the pills, and he walks towards the guy he was going to sell to. They do the sale and my boyfriend gets handcuffed immediately and seconds later I get handcuffed.  We got the exact same charges. Poss of controlled substance, transportation of controlled substance and conspiracy( 3 felonies). Now the only possible charge that is actually reasonable for me is possession because I did have his pills on me. The other 2 are complete BS because I was unaware of the sale and everything else. I literally just brought his pills inside the venue.  I really need some advice here on what to do. Does anyone know any good public defenders in San Bernardino ?   P.s. This was my first time in jail and ever getting arrested, I'm a full time college student and work full time Also please do not lecture me, I know I shouldn't even been around him if he was selling, I just didn't think about all the repercussions.  This is in San Bernardino California	No
124	The toilet in our rental property overflowed, and caused several thousands dollars damage to the unit below. I was told that our tenant was very reckless and would not open the door to stop the toilet overflowing, even after people were banging on the door for several minutes (until eventually the police arrived). There is a police report which says the toilet overflowed.    We called a plumber to check on the toilet and he stated that there was nothing wrong with the toilet.  Next we tried to file a claim with our insurance (under the liability clause), but it was denied because the insurance company stated that I'm not liable, since the damage was not caused by my negligence. I was told that if my tenant had renter's insurance, their insurance would cover it.     Neither our tenant or the tenant below have renter's insurance. The landlord below is very angry and says that she will sue both me and my tenant in small claims court.    From what I understand since I'm not liable, I do not owe anything to the other landlord but I want to avoid the hassle of going to court, and I offered to pay $1500 as a goodwill gesture. Can this be used against me? (i.e. interpreted as admitting guilt?) Should I not give a check? or should I use any particular verbiage on the notes field?	No
125	forgive me if this is a long story. this has been slowly building for seven years. i will try to include only the essential facts. after that, feel free to ask questions.  fact 1 -- my husband has degenerative bone disease and was told eight years ago that he would soon be confined to a wheelchair. so far this hasn't happened, but he is not in good health although he continues to work hard for the little money he can make.  fact 2 -- i suffer from mental illnesses including PTSD from childhood and borderline personality disorder. i have applied for disability and been turned down, although it doesn't change the fact that my last therapist advised that i shouldn't be working.  fact 3 -- our landlady uses and abuses us. when she takes vacations, we watch her cats for free because we feel if we say no, we'll be kicked out. this is how she suckers us into almost everything, including spending an entire day cleaning out a shed on our property full of her stuff.  fact 4 -- her worst offense happened a few months ago. our septic tank overflowed (not maintained for 20+ years) and she didn't fix it for nearly two weeks despite my pleas, which only angered her as she tried to turn my husband against me. she also forced my nearly crippled husband to dig up the septic tank himself.  we were unable to take showers, use the sinks, do laundry, or even use the bathroom in the house. the smell was awful and very unsanitary. i do have video documentation.  fact 5 -- since that happened, i believe it has either caused further PTSD or aggravated what i already had. i have nightmares about poop. i smell phantom sewage smells all the time and very often taste it in my food. i was admitted to a state hospital for thirteen days and my psychiatrist classified what she did to me as abuse.  fact 6 -- while i was trying to recover in the hospital, the refrigerator that came with the house broke and my husband has been eating fast food for three weeks as he begs her to replace the fridge. now she isn't even answering her phone even though she is home. (lives next door to our rental property.)  fact 7 -- we have four cats that have also suffered due to the stress in our household. we can't afford to move and if we did, it might be near a busy road or highway, and i fear for them. i might could give one up for adoption but no more.  fact 8 -- in kentucky there is something called a landlord retaliation law that states she can't kick us out for a year after we have complained about a major repair to the house. if this is true we still have time, however with my mental illnesses i became very angry with her before my hospital stay. because of that, i cannot go to my house at all. i haven't seen my cats in weeks. she is threatening to call the police if i show up, although there is no restraining order or anything of the sort.   -  what would you guys do in my situation? i am finally on the correct antidepressants after twenty-two years, but her behavior is affecting my recovery. i really am better and had gotten over my anger with her, but now it's returning.  any and all advice is appreciated.	No
126	"This is a long shot but I was curious if there's anything wrong about a police officer turning his camera off while searching someone's car after a stop.   The way it went down as he says is he got pulled over for running a stop sign, the guy started to smell the weed then had asked if he could search the car. Before searching he told my roommate that he is a ""good cop"" for turning the camera off as he searched.   I was lead to believe cops weren't allowed to turn their cameras off, is that not true? If it's true, is there anything he can do about that or is he pretty much just screwed?"	No
127	Last year i went into the hospital and was misdiagnosed with the stomach flu, i went home and a week later ended up taking myself back to the emergency room after my appendix ruptured. I ended up needing emergency surgery after the drains didn't work and spent three weeks as an inpatient. I had to drop out of school for the semester and am still having problems. is this worth a law suit? or even a consultation?	No
128	I work for a restaurant in Michigan. The room where our dish machine is regularly gets up to above 80 degrees and 70% humidity. [Here is a photo of the temperature gauge in the room from today](http://imgur.com/a/jkIPM)  That was taken after the dish machine had just shut off for a brief ten minute period.  Our head of the building has begun to disallow us to have the doors to the room propped open while the machine is in use. These doors are at the hottest end of the machine. The ceiling vents do not work and on the weekends the air conditioner for the whole building is turned off anyway. There are two fans inside the room (there used to be three, one broke and was never replaced) that barely move the air around.   I know OSHA states that there are no temperature regulations for workplaces. However it also says that OSHA kicks in when there is a possibility for heat related illness. Spending 20 minutes in the room leaves you coated in sweat and the head of the building does not allow us to keep cups/water bottles in the dish room. We're told we have to go get water from the pop machine, but cannot do that when the dish machine is in use. Serving on 700 people on the regular in a 2 hour period means the machine is constantly in use. We constantly need to rotate people out of the room because they begin to get light headed from the oppressive heat inside the room.  Do we as employees have any legal leg to stand on to change anything?	No
129	I live in Vancouver, BC. Isn't it a crime to post a fake Craigslist ad with my contact info.? If so, how do I go about making sure he gets arrested and convicted of this crime?	No
130	Australian, but all help is welcome. Tenants that have been living there for around a year and a half have been crying their clothes and not using proper ventilation causing mold. I've made many attempts to fix the issue, installing fans and creating more ventilation (have evidence) yet they continue to keep causing it. They plan on breaking the lease which in fine with but not so happy they are attempting to get compensation for this. I plan on getting local advice soon but please comment, all help is welcome. Additionally I have evidence that I have made many attempts to do right by this current tenants: painting the house, fixing things/paying for fixing things.	No
131	I have bank records, email records, and a copy of my lease showing I paid a $750 deposit, plus a $250 pet deposit. I moved out last month(after giving the required 60 day notice) and now the apartment management is saying I never paid the $750, only the non-refundable $250 pet deposit . I received an itemized list of cleaning fees which came to just about $400(the power was turned off before I could clean). They applied the $250 pet deposit to the bill, but are now saying that I owe them the difference, but in reality they still owe me almost $600. I am printing out a demand letter to send, should I include any copies of my records with it or just the letter(because they should have the same records that I have regarding how much I paid)?	No
132	I live in a dorm and we have a full kitchen/living area that 2 rooms share, and one of the guys that lives in the other room is absolutely disgusting. He made food over two weeks ago and hasn't cleaned anything up and it has started to grow mold in our kitchen because of him. I have tried numerous times to get him to clean it up, and his excuse is that he will clean it when he needs to use them again. I have taken pictures and documented every time I have talked to him about it.   Can I throw away his pots/pans because they are becoming a legitimate health hazard? Or should I try to go through the University to force him to clean his stuff up?	No
133	"Hey guys, I'm kind of freaking out cause it looks like my eyes will never get to be 20/20 and I'm out $4000+ due to my current situation..  This kind of a long drawn out process, so I’ll just put everything in bullet form in chronological order:  •	December 2016: LASIK (using Contura laser) performed by doctor A. Result is ok, no longer have to use glasses, but not even close to 20/20.  •	March 2017: Go in for a check up and doctor A suggests an “enhancement” surgery  •	March 2017: Enhancement performed  •	June 2017: Go in for another check up, vision still not improving, doctor A suggests another enhancement.  •	June 2017: Wary of third surgery in the span of 7 months, I ask doctor A for medical records so I can get a second opinion.  •	June 2017: Get a second opinion for doctor B. He says my cornea has now become too thin for any more surgeries. He says that doctor A over corrected my astigmatism during my first surgery, then tried to correct the over-correction during my enhancements, which did not work.   •	June 2017: Share with doctor A what doctor B told me and recorded the conversation with his consent. Doctor A said that doctor B doesn’t know how to read the provided medical records because doctor A is using the “Contura” laser which doctor B is not familiar or had training with. **With ultimate confidence, he went on to say that with one more enhancement, my eyes will be 20/20 and will not require any more enhancements for the rest of my life.**  •	July 2017: Get a different second opinion from doctor C. The doctor echoes the opinion of doctor B and further went on to say that my cornea could be unstable at this very moment due to the two procedures. She said that due to my cornea thinness, there cannot be any more work done on my eyes now and for the rest of my life. Off the record, she went on to say that doctor A has a reputation in the community to perform reckless procedures and that the claims that he's making about how other doctors can't read his ""Contura"" laser is all ""bullshit"" because she has part of the Contura training as well.  At this point, I have lost all trust in doctor A and don’t think I’m going to not share any more information that I’ve gathered. I am definitely considering moving forward with legal action. Do I have a case? What do you guys suggest I do? Do you guys have any recommendations for a lawyer that can handle this kind of case in San Diego?  Thank you!"	No
