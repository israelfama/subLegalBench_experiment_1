0	Dad just died, now my Mom is trying to put all her ducks in a row in case she passes too. I have 2 younger siblings that Mom wants things to go to equally. Issue is that my younger brother and his wife and kid are moving into my Mom's house (so they can save rent) and my Mom wants to give them the house if she passes away, but wants all her assets split equally. How can she set this up so that it balances equally for all 3 siblings? She told me that the house she wants to put in my brother's name is not her largest asset (IRA, savings, etc).  I understand that my brother may help care for the house while he's there, and might take on some of my Mom's care down the road (but probably not, it'll be me, the eldest, as he's kinda flaky).	Yes
1	"I'll try to make this as in a nutshell as possible, and be watching the comments for any questions needing more information. Grandparent's left will for all belongings to go to my father. Uncle rarely ever visited them. Grandfather passed about 3 months ago. Uncle for whatever reason is executor of the estate. Grandmother has hardcore alzheimer's, is in bad shape (bed sore, can't feed herself) and staying at uncle's personal care home.  Uncle wants to keep her away from hospice cause ""feels like she has a while more to live"" -his words. He is getting paid any money she gets from herself and my grandfather's pension, including he stated another $1K per month for her to stay at his home. He plans on selling my grandparent's estate in order to pay for the cost of her staying there.... AKA he will get everything in cash from my father when in reality nothing was left to him. Father said he doesn't have enough cash to hire a lawyer currently, though I feel as if he's milking the estate he should be reported to having my Grandmother still at his home since she should not at all be at a care home and needs to if so be in actually nursing home with actual nurses. The care home is all run by my Uncle's side of the family.   Any advice here would be wonderful as no clue where to start calling or looking for help on this matter. My father wanted my grandparent's house to move into and didn't want to have to sell everything especially the house for my Uncle to end up taking everything when he's never been around for years. (Plus Uncle came into the house today taking bags of stuff, didn't tell us he was going or what he took, as my father installed cameras around the property).  Also, this is just outside Pittsburgh if that helps with any information on who I would contact on any of this. Thank you guys again for your time. I lurk a lot but really needed advice this time myself."	Yes
2	I need to write a complete last will and testament for a college assignment. I have a simple will I wrote by hand but it is barebones. I know it doesn't cover everything and my professor wants this will to be complete. Are there any actually free templates out on the internet? Any tips at all?	Yes
3	I've already requested my cori and filled out the petition request. The attorney who represented me originally is asking for $1500 to represent me at court for the petition hearings.  State is MA if that matters.	Yes
4	My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	Yes
5	Hello, When my wife's uncle died he left her an inheritance but it stated she had to be 25 years of age to receive it. In her place, her mother was to place it in a trust account and manage it until that point. My wife is now 26 and her mother has now said that she won't give her access to the money until she dies.  We have a good relationship with her parents and this seems odd. We have a copy of his will and it clearly says that the money should be in trust to [Wife's mom] until [wife] attains the age of 25 in which the trust will terminate and my wife will have full access to it.  I hate fighting with family over money but we are both working 60 hours a week to make a better life for our family. Any advice would be appreciated. If anything I said is unclear I will be happy to answer further questions. Thanks reddit!	Yes
6	So this is a throw away account since I'll be giving away a bit about my location here. I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.   I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.   Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.  So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.	Yes
7	Delete if not allowed mods. I've searched the sidebar, and online, and haven't really gotten a solid answer to my question.  Currently my wife is the trustee for her fathers trust account. Trust is set up in Nevada. She put a lot of work into finalizing it all. Meetings with lawyers, closing multiple bank accounts, opening others, setting up auto pay, etc.  Question is, how does she determine a reasonable rate to pay herself? We've heard it can be 1% of the total trust, but that seems high. Is there a general mathematical equation to put in? Quarterly? Yearly?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
8	I'm not sure which sub this should go in, but I recall seeing similar questions here. If there is a better sub, please direct me there.   My stepfather passed away suddenly. He didn't have much, but we need to handle his banking, cars, house, etc... No retirement, but of course he has some social security. He didn't have life insurance, but his wife did have some funeral insurance. His wife wants my wife (his daughter) to be the point person on this (executor?). What's the simplest, cheapest way to do this?  Our main concern right now is his car. He had a heart attack while driving and had a minor accident. The car was towed to a police lot. They will only release it to the owner. Well, he's passed away, and the technical owner is Carmax finance with whom he had a loan. They won't release it to his wife, stating they need legal ownership to claim the vehicle (she's not on the loan).	Yes
9	My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	Yes
10	My grandfather died several months ago and his trust leaves everything to my mom. She understands his wishes after death was to sell the property to my brother and split the proceeds equally amongst the siblings. After pressure from her siblings she agreed to sign an agreement stating that the property would be sold, maybe to my brother, and the proceeds distributed equally. When she got the agreement today a portion states that they will amend the trust to include all of the siblings and a clause that the trust must be sold within 90 days.  From my understanding once someone dies the trust can't be amended at all, is this correct?	Yes
11	"Hello.   My grandmother recently passed and left her estate to be divided among her grandchildren, including me.   My aunt, who was my grandmother's caretaker,  has sent all of the grandchildren a letter from her lawyer titled ""WAIVER OF NOTICE OF HEARING ON PETITION FOR LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION AND CONSENT TO THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER OF SOLVENCY, WAIVER OF BOND""  The letter is about a page long, and basically states that upon an order of solvency by the court, my aunt will be the administrator of the estate and will be entitled to distribute or close said estate without court intervention or supervision.  She can sell, exchange, lease, mortgage, convey, etc the property of the decedent without court order, and without notice, approval, or confirmation.  The undersigned also waives the requirement for the issuance of a bond.     Is this basically asking me to give up my portion of the estate?  I'm having trouble understanding just exactly what she is asking me to sign, and when I've questioned her about it, she has been defensive and is pushing hard for me and the other grandchildren to sign it.     I could really use your advice, thank you for any light you can shed on this situation."	Yes
12	I wanted to apologize before hand, as I have never dealt with a situation like this before and I may be mixing terms up. If anything is unclear I'll explain to the best of my ability.  I recently received a letter in the mail regarding my deceased grandfather's estate that I was included in the Will for. It included a check for my portion of the estate.The letter stated the following verbatim:  &gt;We represent ****, executor of the estate of ****, Deceased. At this time, we are in a position to make a partial distribution of the amount bequeathed to you under **** will.  &gt;There are insufficient funds available in the estate to make full distributions. Accordingly, we are distributing funds at the pro rata amount of fifty percent of the amount bequeathed. Enclosed please fund two copies of a Receipt, Release, Indemnification, and Refunding Agreement for your review and signature. If you agree with the Receipt and Release document, please sign one copy in the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in the envelope provided. The second copy is for your records. I have also enclosed an estate check payable to your order representing the amount due you as indicated in the release document.  &gt;One the estate is completed, we will be sending you an additional pro rata distribution of the balance of the estate. If you have any questions concerning the enclosed materials, please feel free to contact me at the telephone number listed above.  The letter then continued to the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement that said the following terms:  &gt;NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned, beneficiary, intending to be legally bound, hereby: 1. Declares that he/she has read this instrument and that the facts set forth above are true and correct to the best of his/her knowledge, information and belief; 2. Requests the Executor to distribute the sum indicated to him/her and the acknowledges receipt of such distribution to him/her effective upon delivery to him/her; 3. Releases ad discharges the Executor and his successors from all further liability, responsibility, and accountability with respect to such distribution to him/her; 4. Agrees to refund all or any part of such distribution to him/her if it shoulder later be found that distribution was due to mistake (either innocent of negligent) is that all or part of it should have been paid to others or that taxes or other charges should have first been paid; 5. Agrees to indemnify the Executor against any and all liability, loss or expense (included, but not limited to, counsel fees) that the Executor may ever incur as a result of the distribution to him/her without first securing an award by the Court having jurisdiction over it; 6. Agrees that any claim under this agreement may be brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, agrees to submit to the jurisdiction thereof, and waives any objection to the jurisdiction thereof; 7. Declares it to be his/her intent that this instrument shall be governed by Pennsylvania law and shall be legally binding on him/her and on his/her executors, administration, heirs, successors, and assigns; and 8. Agrees that any period for the limitation of actions for the collection of any erroneous distribution to him/her shall commence only at such time as the Executor shall have obtained actual knowledge of such erroneous distribution and that in no event shall the period for collection of any erroneous distribution be less than two years after the actual discovery thereof by the Executor.   My major question here is to ask if anything above suggests that I should wait to deposit the check included with these documents and if I should have the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement signed and sent prior to doing so. Also, for an ELI5 of the terms I'd be agreeing to. I ask this because the executor of the will has done some cheap, questionable things in the past that have given his siblings and I reason to be suspicious that he might do something to exploit these terms. He also works for the firm that sent and wrote up these documents.  TL;DR-I received documents (detailed above) and a check from the firm handling the estate of my grandfather and wanted to make sure everything seems kosher since my Uncle who is the executor has been a shyster in the past. I also wanted to know if it is okay for me to deposit the check sent to me right away and when the appropriate time to send the signed documents back to the firm.	Yes
13	"I recently purchased insurance for a year long trip that I'm taking. It was a little unexpected, so I asked my doctor for some prescriptions I have for a pre existing condition and he decided that he would tweak them a bit. This counted as a ""change in medication"" so now I am not covered for my pre existing condition. I'm not too worried, but if I remain stable for sixty days I saw some policies would cover me. I don't want to go without any insurance, so I have purchased emergency medical. But if I want to change companies partway through to get the pre-existing condition covered (about sixty days after I arrive-I know world nomad begins policies when you're already away) can I do that? I know I won't get my money back after the ten day review period, but will they cancel the policy so I can go with another company?"	Yes
14	My deceased grandmother died in 2009 and she left me money in her will. My aunt is the executor of the will but won't pay it out, and I'm legally an adult now so what options do I have in claiming this? Also the will dictates that there is cash money in my name but my aunt says that the money was put into a 529 college plan for me.   What should I do?	Yes
15	Let's say my wife and I are 58, have $500k in an 401k and 4 adult kids. We would like to gift them money now instead of waiting until we die to give them their inheritance. We want to do this in a manner that results in the least amount of taxes/penalties possible. As I understand it, the government looks back 5-years when determining how much one is charged for a nursing home, so we would like to make our gifts sooner rather than later. We wonder also if there's a way we could ensure half the amount we give to each child could be made untouchable just in case of emergency.   We went to an elder lawyer to ask for assistance with this, but he wasn't a lot of help, so I turn to you. If you were me, how would you handle this? Thanks in advance.	Yes
16	"Hello everyone I was wondering if any one had legal advice for contesting a will. Sorry if this is very long winded and not the right subreddit, let me know if I should cross post it somewhere better.   Some background, there is this woman ""J"" that my father my sister and myself feel have been taking advantage of  my  grandparents.  J was  ""bought"" (male order bride and what not) from the Philippines by her first husband who was friends with my grandparents. She had two kids by the time my sister and I were past the ""cute"" stages. My grandparents have a weakness for cute children and have been drooling over this woman and her kids for the past 16 years, including the new 6 yo kid with a new husband. This kid think my grandparents are hers and has no idea me or my father were relatives, so idk what J has been telling her but that could be paranoia talking.  We honestly have felt J has been taking advantage of my grandparents to try and be put on the will, and sure enough a few years ago they put her and her three kids on it for a very very gracious amount compared to the three blood family members that are on it. The grandparents refused to show us the will because J was on it. Since my dad in the executor so he was recently able to get a copy and it is split as follows:  30% to my dad, 10% to my sister 10% to me  20% to J 5% J kid 1 5% J kid 2 5% J kid 3 And the rest to boyscouts/church/stuff like that.  I guess our main concern/question is is there a way to contest the will effectively? I know there is a less then 1% of it happening historically. We think she should be on the will but this is extreme in our opinion. Her family, who's only been close friends essentially, gets more then their only son.   Also I guess we need a sanity check. Are we paranoid or are we justified in our feeling in your best opinion?"	Yes
17	* The actual house. Worth ~200K, in CA (where I live, my official residence is at the house). What deed makes the most sense for transferring into my name? From what I can tell, Quitclaim deed's are the easiest, but I don't understand the drawbacks to it.  * Does it make more sense to transfer the money into my accounts before their death so it doesn't have to go through any legal stuff?   Tl;Dr When they actually do die, I get everything. What are the processes that have to be gone through, and what do I need to do. I have power of attorney, and I'm the executor.  I don't know what I'm doing with all of this.	Yes
18	Since the failing health and death of my great grandma, my family has been very divided and communication has been spilt between my  grandma and uncle on one side and my mom on the other. My uncle is the executor of the will and my mom does not know if he has executed the will. She is also afraid that the will may be altered to the benefit of my uncle and grandma.  Is there anyway to check to see if he has already started to execute the will through probate court? My mom is unsure if it is apathy or devious motives that he has not executed the will or communicated with her. How can she approach the situation legally to make sure the will is executed so that this ugly situation can be resolved and moved on from?	Yes
19	"Okay, so my mom passed away in the state of Texas back in 2009. One year before the, she and her husband at the time took out a home equity line of credit. He co-signed. Then she died. There was no probated will upon her death. As I understood it, the house and property goes to her husband at the time of death. I was in the military and have NEVER had any financial or legal ties or obligation to the house. Anyway, he stopped paying on the loan last year. Back in December, the attorney representing the bank calls me and asks if I have talked to my former step-father (who co-signed on the loan). I explained that he and I haven't been on speaking terms since my mom's death due to personal reasons. Then about two weeks ago, I get written notice in the mail that they are trying to  pursue judgment against my deceased mother, her husband, and ""any heirs..."". I immediately called the attorney representing the bank (plaintiff) and left a vocie mail explaining that I have never have any financial or legal ties to that property and that I have not been able to reach my former step-father. Today, I get written notice that now I personally and being sued for the property....  Mind you, I haven't lived in the state of Texas in 14 years. I have NEVER had any ties to my mom's house. But now they are suing ME for it?!?   I'm a full time college student here in California. I have ZERO means to defend myself financially. I can't afford to hire a defense attorney. I called and left another voicemail for the prosecuting attorney explaining yet again that I have no ties to the property. I requested that they call me back ASAP to straighten this out.  I don't get why I am being sued for 35k for a property that is never and was never my responsibility."	Yes
20	"I'm located in Oregon. Let's say my dad's name is ""John Doe"".  John Doe passed away several years ago, and the house he purchased (that we currently live in) was transferred into the John Doe Revocable Trust. The house still has a mortgage that still has John Doe's name (not the trust). The deed of the house according to the county clerk's office has ""John Doe Revocable Trust"" as the owner.  The John Doe Revocable Trust has three trustees - my mom, my sister and I. We have documentation declaring this.   All three of us have agreed that we would like to have the house just in my name since currently, I'm making the mortgage payments and I have decent credit, and neither my mom nor sister feel they are in a position to be able to take responsibility for the property.   **What are the steps needed in order to get the house transferred out of being under the Trust's name and just under my name? And, with as minimal cost as possible?**   Here are the steps that I have figured out based on researching, but I would like to know if I am missing something, or if there is something else I need to consider:   1. Find a blank Quit Claim Deed form and fill in the info to show transfer of the property from the Trust (Grantor) to my name (Grantee).   2. Have all three of us trustees sign the Quit Claim Deed under a Notary.  3. Take Deed Form to County Clerk's Record office to get it recorded.   4. Submit deed showing new title of ownership to the mortgage bank who can transfer mortgage over to my name.   ----------------------------------------------------------------- Questions I have:   1. Are there any tax or other financial implications that I need to be aware of when this transfer happens? (other than fee for recording office, etc.)   2. There seem to be a lot of ""buy a deed form"" websites where you fill in the info then pay $30-$50 to print the form. I'd rather just write one up and format it myself and save the money if I can. Is there any trusted website or place that indicates what language *should* be on the quit claim form?   3. Are there any steps above that I'm completely missing?"	Yes
21	I've just received a copy of the trust documents and do plan to speak to an attorney on my behalf, but my grandma's husband's attorney also sent a w-9 form to be mailed to my grandparents home. His lawyer stated there is nothing to be distributed at this time (I'm assuming because they each has a sub-trust and if one of them dies the other can do what they want) and their grandchildren will each get half after their house is sold. The trust states that the surviving spouse gets to live in the house until their death if they so choose. So I'm not expecting to see any sort of money from that for a seriously long time. I've never had do taxes or fill out any IRS forms on my behalf and just want to know what the point of me sending this form to him would be. My dad used every penny that was left to my brother and I years ago when we were minors so I'm just really skeptical about everything going on right now.	Yes
22	"My mother has a specific dilemma regarding her father's bank account she is the POD for.  The will states that all assets aside from a few specified things (house and property lots) are to be equally divided among siblings.  I'm aware that the POD is separate from the will, and that my mother should have a legitimate claim to all of the money.  However, her intent is still to split it equally as my grandfather wished.  The problem is that she currently has Medicaid healthcare benefits.  It's a given that she will become ineligible for Medicaid for a time, and have to prove that she as ""spent down"" the funds to reapply.  The question is whether or not the state (Ohio, in this case) will honor the fact that the deceased wished the money to be split, or count the entire sum as belonging to my mother even if she splits it.  If the state does not recognize the will in this case, and counts the money as all hers, she will be ineligible for Medicaid for a much longer time without being able to spend down any more than her own share.  Is she going to be forced to keep the money herself, so she can afford private healthcare for however long it takes her to spend the full amount?"	Yes
23	"Hi there!   So my mother has recently sent copies of her Living Will and POA documents to myself and my siblings. I have a small question regarding how she wrote my name on the documents. I got married almost a year ago and decided to keep my maiden name(same as her name). Despite her and I having a previous conversation clarifying my decision to keep my name, she has decided to write my name on these legal documents as ""Mrs. FoxesRidingHorses MaidenName-HusbandName"". Does this mean anything? Will it affect the legality of my influence on these documents? It is not my name and will not be at any time. I am in Maryland and she is in Georgia."	Yes
24	A friends grandmother has split her will among her four children. However, her daughter (my friends mother) died before she did. By this point the grandmother was senile and could no longer change her will so she died with her will unchanged. My friend would like to know whether she inherits the money willed to her mother or the remaining three children split the money between them.   Thank you for your help	Yes
25	My grandfather died about 6 months ago and left all of his assets to his recent wife and made her the executor of his will. The one exception to this was my grandparent's house which he left her in a life estate.  Before his death he and his wife co-signed on a loan for several tens of thousands of dollars against the house. This past week I started getting calls from a debt recovery company asking about his finances. I know from my research that my family and I can't be chased down for his debts as we haven't received anything from and have no control over his estate, so I am not concerned about that.  Ideally we would like to sell the house ourselves and pay off the loan or take over the loan and rent out the house so it is not foreclosed on. I checked with my family and the deed was never updated to indicate the remaindermen he had described in his will so the first thing I am doing now is making sure that happens ASAP.  What are our best steps forward after that? Since she was on the loan can they even come after the house as part of the estate? We were thinking of calling the debt collection company and seeing if we could work with them directly, although we are not the executors so they may not even talk to us.	Yes
26	"The sequence of events, over the course of many years, is as follows:  1. My dad's sister married an awful man.  2. My grandma's will leaves money to my dad and his sister.  3. My dad's sister dies.   4. Grandma revises the will to leave my aunt's widower way less than he expected.   5. Grandma dies. (She was in her right mind to the very end, amazingly sharp, more ""with it"" than people half her age.)  6. Aunt's widower is arguing that he's entitled to his dead wife's assets from an older will.  My question is, assuming the recent will is valid...that makes no sense, right?"	Yes
27	"**The Story** My Fiance's dad (let's call him Saul for anonymity) has been living in his father's old house, in upstate NY for the past 30 years or so. This house has fallen into a state of disrepair: caved in ceilings, mold and water damage. Basically it needs to be torn down and a new house needs to be built on the property before the conditions become too dangerous.  **The Problem** Saul and his family are low income, and he hasn't had the cash upfront for repairs over the years. The bank will not issue a loan against the property since he does not have legal ownership. He has told me that for the past 17 years he's been pursuing legal action to gain ownership, but the hired lawyer is making very little progress.  **Tricky Family Situation** The house was left to my Fiance's dad and his siblings in their father's will, but, Saul only has a copy of an un-signed will. Here's where it gets tricky, Saul's mother was never married to his father (who also had two previous marriages, and was never legally divorced from the second wife).  Saul has five siblings, three immediate and two half from previous marriages.  Marriage 1: * Father divorced from wife #1 * Half-Brother #1: Signed off as not wanting property - deceased * Half-Brother #2: Signed off as not wanting property - deceased  Marriage 2:  * Father NEVER divorced from wife #2 - deceased (her family may have claim to property) No children from marriage   Relationship 3:  * Father NEVER married to woman #3 (mother) * Sister #1: Executor of the estate, but has signed off as not wanting property * Sister #2: Signed off as not wanting property * Brother #1: Cut ties with the family and we don't know where he is  **Steps of Legal action taken** * ""Hired"" Lawer #1 to search for missing siblings / other family members to get sign-off. (Saul told me he gave $100 as incentive to get started 17 years ago). This lawyer passed away, and the case was handed off to his partner. * Lawyer #2 has continued the search, was paid $1,500 in 2014. (I'm not sure if this was just incentive or actual fee required to start official work). * A publication search was made to find Brother #1, a judge ruled that we need to publish ads in the paper of his last known location (this search has taken months). * A publication search was recently started for Wife #2. We're trying to figure out if she has any living children.   **Next Steps** I'm meeting with the current lawyer this week and I'm going to ask for a recap of the steps he's taken, what's left to do and if any options exist to accelerate this process.  **My Questions** * Is there anything I can do to speed up this process? Any work-arounds? We are starting to fear for the safety of the family in this house. * Anything specific I should be asking the current lawyer?  * How long does a case like this usually take? Seems to have been dragged out for an unreasonably long time by lawyer. Does any of this seem fishy or illegal?  Thanks for any help!"	Yes
28	My friends mom died and did have a will, naming her as executor. Her mom was single, her parents are both deceased. I'm helping her with a checklist of what she needs to do to close her estate, I'm wondering if probate lawyers need payment up front or will they take payment once the estate is settled? She doesn't have much money but her mom does. Any advice is very helpful.	Yes
29	"I need to disclaim some funds I would otherwise be inheriting so that they can go back to the Estate to settle outstanding debts. These funds are with Vanguard.   I submitted the paperwork they gave me and that is all in order but I also need to write up a document specifically disclaiming the funds by account number. The agent I've been dealing with was unable to give me a ""blueprint"" but said what I write up must include the account numbers and their reference number.

30	This is post ended up having quite a few questions but they're all  in regards to money.  I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ?   My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?  This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.  Please help me, I want to live my life on my own as soon as I can, I don't live with physical abuse or anything too bad but there is some problems and it's just one of those homes where you don't want to stick around past your due.  The day I turn 18 is going to be a great day and I want to get an idea of what I have to do.  I appreciate anything you can help me with even if it's only one thing, thank you in advance to/if anyone that can help.	Yes
31	"California. Married, no kids (and there won't be any.) I have some personal assets (stocks, etc) and a partial share of a multi unit building that we live in (a san francisco tenancy in common) Our finances are mostly separate, we contribute to a shared bank account that we use for expenses.  I'd like to make sure that if I kick the bucket she'll get my assets, particularly the TIC share, with a minimum of hassle.   Is a trust the thing I want? A will? I've talked informally with a couple of different lawyers and have heard stuff ranging from ""you to combine all your assets"" to ""you don't have to do anything, it's automatic"" So I'd like to have a few more data points...  Particularly regarding trusts, I'm worried that transferring my share of the building to a trust will allow/trigger a property tax reassessment, which would suck for me and the other owners of the building. This may be too california-specific to be easily answerable.  TL;DR how do I make it so my wife doesn't have to go through probate, pay taxes, in order to get my stuff if I die unexpectedly?"	Yes
32	Firstly this is about my dad and just looking for some assurance that what I have been telling him is correct. Basically he and my aunt had my grandparents house signed over to them both (joint 50/50 owners) before they passed away. For the last 3 years it has been virtually uninhabited and as a result whenever I've been I have seen it progressively becoming more run down.  He wants nothing to do with the house and would prefer to sell it. My aunt keeps saying that she wants to keep it and because of this dispute and him thinking it's a massive task, my dad has not done anything.  From what I think, there are two options she has if he wants to sell which is either to buy out his 50% portion at an agreed or court ordered market rate OR she can agree to sell the house and the total value of the estate would be divided equally.  She wants to do renovations on the property and is asking my dad for money which he keeps thinking if he doesn't could affect the overall split of their ownership but I am quite sure that he has no obligation to contribute.  The property is located in Germany so falls under German law (if that makes any difference). The other thing I was thinking of is if he could sign power of attorney to me so I can work with the lawyers on his behalf (so as to stop it dragging on for another three years).  Any help would be greatly appreciated as this has been a massive burden.	Yes
33	Hi I I'm located in BC, Canada and my mom recently passed away, she was in charge of cash fund that was disbursed to members of a group, every two weeks each member would place x amount of dollars into the pot and every two week someone from the group would claim the pot. Each member could claim the pot once during the duration but would have to continue contributing to it till each member has collected.  Luckily I have all the details of the pot and what goes funds go where and to who, what I want to do is protect myself and her estate in the event someone claims that payment was not made to them after I disburse the funds. Is there a document that I can use that would be legally binding, I plan to have witnesses with me when payments are made.  I really do appreciate any help and thanks for taking the time to read this, have a great day.	Yes
34	(This is in Indiana)     So, my dad passed last April, and he was in talks for disability. After he passed I received mail from the Social Security office that I was able to receive his back benefits because he had been accepted prior to his death.     Now, I've filled out all manner of legal documentation, medical records, release forms, you name it, all addressed to me, courtesy of or on behalf of my father. Court is next week and the SSA is saying they need proof of kinship. I do not have the slightest idea where to look, as he's not on my birth certificate, and my (his) lawyer isn't exactly giving me great ideas. He had no will, nor any paperwork bequeathing anything to me, but after he passed I signed his estate over to my uncle because he's way smarter than I am and didn't, and still don't, have any idea how to deal with that.    What would work as proof of kinship?	Yes
35	"Basically what the title says. My wife and I just recently had our first child, and so we need to get a will and living will/medical directives in order.  I know wills can be complex, and rather than wasting an attorney's time with "" um, we don't know"" and ""we will get back to you"" responses, I figured that we could start with something like Willmaker pro. Then we could take our time and get everything filled out exhaustively, and take the documents it produces to an attorney to review and advise on. I figure this ultimately saves the attorney some time, and therefore saves us cash. I DO want an attorney to be involved because there are a lot of factors in our finances.  However, I wanted to see how actual lawyers who deal with wills feel about this. Would it be better to work through everything with the attorney from the beginning? How do you feel about things like Willmaker? Would my approach actually make things harder?"	Yes
36	Hello all, I'm based in the UK, my grandmother recently underwent a lung transplant, things have gone south as she had a heart attack and is now in a critical condition. My mother is looking after my cousin (as she lived with my Nan) and my Aunt who has downs syndrome. I'm posting on behalf of my mother on if the power of attorney (or what is it and we aren't completely sure) would apply. This is because my mum's step-father has been taking money off my aunty (with down syndrome) for himself whilst they've been staying with us, and we believe he may/ or may not, have taken my grandmothers stash of money she hid away in the house alongside her will. What I'm trying to ask is if there is anyway we can hold/take ownership over my Nan's and aunties bank accounts (as they're both in my nans name) 1. whilst my Nan is in her critical condition 2. If she doesn't make it through. Mainly to stop him getting ahold of any of their money (my mum is the executor on the will if that means anything) as he's began to say that he is looking for my nan's pin to pay for stuff whilst shes away (they had separate accounts for a reason and he isn't in the will whatsoever).  Any advice on what to do in the situation would be greatly appreciated- once again we are in the UK. Thank you.	Yes
37	Am I entitled to a copy of a trust in the state of Arizona? I am a beneficiary of my grandfathers will and the trustees claim that I am not entitled to any paperwork, including the trust. Thinking of hiring an attorney if they do not provide these documents. They want me to sign a document written by a CPA (not an attorney) to relinquish my rights to question their authority, which I will not do without documentation. Thank you in advance.	Yes
38	My parents passed away in 2003. My sister, brother, and I were minors at the time. In 2016, we were contacted by the state of Florida that there was abandoned property that was not included in my parent's original estate (we moved to Mississippi in 2003). We also became aware of a few Ameriprise accounts that were in my father's name that were never discovered in the original estate.  My sister contacted the original attorney who helped with the estate and helped her re-open the estate as the executor so the funds could be obtained. Neither the original executor nor the original attorney had the original estate tax ID number for the estate and we were told to apply for a new tax ID number, which we used to obtain the funds from the state of Florida and the stock accounts were transferred into an estate account at our bank.  We are worried about what taxes we will owe on these funds because they have been siting for so long and because we do not have the original tax ID number and are afraid of filing something wrong but no one we talk to can give us a solid answer. Some of the Ameriprise accounts were IRA accounts they seem to have a bunch of deadlines attached to them that we have missed but we can't really find a solid answer on what to do if we did miss the deadlines. The abandoned property from the State of Florida came from a ScottTrade account but we don't know if we owe capital gains taxes on it because we cannot differentiate what was the original amount in the account we we don't know if there was a gain or a loss on that account or even what stocks were in it, we only know the amount and where it came from.  tl:dr: My siblings and I became aware of more funds from a 2003 estate that just recently came under our control and can't get an answer on the taxes we owe.	Yes
39	I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	Yes
40	Hi /legaladvice  My dad died last week. He was too young. All of the funeral services and arrangements are complete and the family has gone home.  Now we're starting to get into dealing with estate stuff. Bank accounts, retirement fund, social security, car titles, etc. I think that we have most of the major things noted to take care of, but what are some of other things that people don't really think of where I should keep an eye out? What sort of unexpected hurtles may I face that I should be aware of?   We have his will and it names my mother the executor of his estate.	Yes
41	This is in KS.  My father passed away this morning. I am helping my mother through the process.  My family, including my mother, is worried about my brother going forward at this point. He has leeched off my parents his entire adult life, and now that my dad has passed we fear my brother's sense of grief and sympathy will not overpower his entitlement and he may try to take property or try to get money from my mother in her vulnerable state.   My father had a (small) life insurance policy and gets SSI. Other than that their assets are all in farmland/machinery/livestock.  What is the best way to go about making sure my mother is protected going forward so her, not my brother's, best interests are met?  Thanks.	Yes
42	"My sister recently passed away under some very bothersome circumstances. My family has been involved in a lawsuit over this, which is reaching its end point. We were recently informed that before everything is finalized, my father is legally entitled to inquire about his possible share of the settlement. This naturally caused a collective ""WTF?!"" moment throughout my family, as he his an absentee deadbeat who hasn't had contact with the family in well over a decade, and even when contacted about becoming a co-executor of my sister's estate, he waived his rights by not giving a fuck and ignoring it. Here are some key points:  * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate.  * My sister passed away as a legal adult; after emancipation.  * This lawsuit was initially filed by my mother as an individual, and soon turned into it being on behalf of my sister's estate, as she became the sole executor.  * My father waived his rights when it came to becoming co-executor of my sister's estate. He had an opportunity to pursue it but didn't, and has absolutely no association with the lawsuit, my sister's estate, or the family.  * My father hasn't had any contact with my family for almost 13-14 years, and has never made any attempt to make contact. He knows very little about us, made no effort to contact us and seek information regarding my sister's passing.  * My father owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support, and is a tax dodger. He's been to jail several times over both. Our attorney and the judge handling this knows, as we've provided extensive documentation about this."	Yes
43	"My family are having issues with a trust fund set up by my father who passed away in 1998 and think we have been treated extremely unfairly for almost 20 years. This has now come to a breaking point – the trust has informed us they no longer think we (my brother and I) are beneficiaries due to an deed which was signed by Protector rather than my father and the firm are seeking legal and tax advice on the outcome of this.  In order to tell this story right I’ll section my post.   **Background:**  Relevant parties: Myself (f25), Mother (49), Brother (20), father (deceased), half-sister (no contact), half bother (no contact), my uncle who is protector (some contact but not close).  My parents were never married but had been together for 10 years. Previous to this my father was married and had two children. They divorced a few years before meeting my mother.  My father had a trust fund set up in in 1991 (before my brother and I were born but when my parents were together). My parents moved from the UK to another country were they made a life together – owning a property together, a boat and were in the process of building another property. Around 1996 my father sold his business in the UK.  The unbuilt house, the business and the boat were all assets of the trust.  My father passed away unexpectedly back in 1998 when I was around the age of five and my brother (M20) was a few months old.   **History of the Trust:**  The 1991 Deed The trust was set up in 1991 – the original trustees were UK residents. The trust was established by a deed of settlement and expressed to be a Guernsey law trust. The protector of the trust was appointed to my uncle.  The beneficiaries of the trust were declared: 1. The settlor (life tenant) 2. The spouse and any former spouse of the settlor 3. The children of the settlor.  Change of trustees 1991 The trustees retired in favour of a new trust to take over.  1997 Deed 1 – Addition of my mother: My mother was added as a beneficiary.  1997 Deed 2: This introduced different terms. To pay the income of the trust to his children and my mother in equal shares until my brother reached 25, when of which all the capital will be divided between the beneficiaries.  1999 Appointment: Additions of beneficiaries and appointment of assets A deed was prepared that added myself and my brother as beneficiaries. This was due to them finding we do not come under the definition of children for the purposes of the trust or the 1997 Appointment as our parents were unmarried. This added new terms, notably allowing the discretionary distribution of income and capital before the youngest child (my brother) turned 25.  In order to be a part of this ‘deal’, my mother put my parents shared property in the trust portfolio (this is important information – bear with me!)  Change of Trustee 2002: The trustees retired in favour of a new trust to take over. This trust remains the current trustee of the trust.  2008 Deed: Appointments of the trust fund Under the 1999 deed the trust gave my half-sister and half-brother their full amounts as they are ‘legitimate’ children.   **The Problems:**  For years my family have had battles with the trust over unfair treatment. I wont go into the details of this, it’s so lengthy and an issue itself but we have asked to leave them a number of times. We were always told its not possible for any of us (Myself, Mother, Brother, Half-sister, Half-brother). We were told we would need to wait until my brother turned 25. Over the course of the years we’ve (my immediate family – not half siblings) lost about £60,000 + combined from fees.  Back in 2015, I asked for a deposit for my first home. After a lengthy email battle over the year, they finally agreed. At some point during this it came to light that my half siblings walked away years ago (we were never made aware), and that my mother has had the ability to walk away since 2008 (again, we were never told despite continuously asking to leave). When this came to light my mother instantly asked for her funds, they agreed to start making this happen.  It didn’t happen. Instead they sent us a letter a year later stating that after investigating our Trust as something came to light which means me and my brother may not be beneficiaries after all.  In preparing my distribution for my house deposit, they reviewed the 1991 Deed concerns were found/ raised.  **Problem 1**  Basically, my dad didn’t sign the ‘Change of trustees 1991’ document despite having priority power under the terms. It was executed by my uncle – as this dates way back we aren’t sure why, perhaps my father was unavailable. But he did instruct my uncle to do so on his behalf.  The second Trustees have communication from 1994 regarding this issue – however they, and the previous trustees decided they ‘were satisfied the Settlor was not available and therefor a change of trustees executed by the protector was valid’. This was because the settlement listed three person with the power to appoint replacements ‘The settelor, the protector and the trustees’  Flash forward 20 years and a law firm now thinks that the second trustees (1991) decision was ‘wrong’ and that our current trustees should take the matter to court seeking a clear idea of the tax consequences.  The law firm advice found there are two outcomes: 1.	The 1991 retirement deed is invalid but the 2002 deed is valid.  2.	Or they are both invalid and the trust should have never moved from the UK and there will be serious tax implications. There are serious tax implications for both and the trust are currently investigating these and we are awaiting results. This investigation is costly (£10,000 so far) and the distributions are being made from our ‘accounts’ with them.   **Problem 2: Me and my brother being added post 1991 Retirement Deed.**  As the 1991 Retirement Deed is likely to be found invalid, it is also likely me and my brother are invalid as this was exercised by ‘invalid’ trustees and after my fathers death. Yet my mothers appointment is fine as this was exercised by my father while he was alive and under the terms of the original 1991 deed.  Therefor we are awaiting tax information and investigation into the 1991 deed,1997 appointment and 1999 appointment as it has bearings on 1. The tax positions 2. The validity of past distributions 3. Whether to continue with court application 4. How to respond for future requests for distributions 5. Whether the second trust have any obligation to assist.  **Where we stand**  We’re currently awaiting the tax information but the trust have said to us that they would be looking at hopefully distributing all capital to us so we can walk away from this (yeah right – I’m sure they’re going to offer that).  From our point of view we are an innocent party to this. We’re angry that: 1. It seems we will have most of the capital taken from us due to mistakes that weren’t ours. 2. That they convinced my mother to put her shared home into the trust under a now false promise. 3. They may seek the past distributions from us! 4. Our half siblings have been able to walkaway from this mess.S o many other things.  **My main questions are:** 1.	Will we be held responsible and ultimately be the ones who will have to pay for this mess? 2.	Do you think there is any room to recoup loss/ sue for this mess (fees throughout the years and the likely loss of all the capital as this has not been picked up previously (apart from the communication in 1994)? 3.	If they do come back with a resolution to this (an offer to walkaway with a sum), do you think we should consider it? I’m concerned as I feel we are still the ones who have ultimately paid the price of someone else mistake. Even in the unlikely case this was presented, for all these years we have paid so many fees, and now feed for this tax/ law firm (who we have no contact with and know nothing about!) and the fact that my mother could have walked away years ago (she has been paying fees all that time!) 4.	What type of solicitor should we be seeking advice from?  Please help! This is causing us so much distress and pain. It’s been ongoing all my life and we just want out of it now.  TL;DR  Current Trust is arguing the previous trust was invalid as a retirement deed was signed by protector rather than my father who is now deceased. This makes previous addition of me and my brother (after my dad passed) invalid and the moving of the trust to a offshore trust invalid. This could have serious tax implications for us and also removes us from the trust, making all previous distributions invalid. Basically big £££ and distress over a mistake that was not ours and was overlooked for almost 20 years. Currently being made to pay all the legal costs of this by our trust (distributions being made from the trust capital). Should we sue or seek legal action?   Also half siblings were informed they could leave early and left in 2008 with capital. Despite my mother continuously asking to leave and being told no, it has recently come to light she could of in 2008 yet they didn’t tell her and she has paid fees since then!   Please, any advice is welcome :(   FYI Despite how this story sounds my father and mother came from different backgrounds – my mother being working class. I would consider us to be working class right now so available funds are limited and all tied up in the trust."	Yes
44	"**Yes, I know you're about to tell me to just hire a lawyer.**  My husband and I are expecting our first baby and we're working to get our finances and directives in order.  We have a relatively simple situation, the only ""big"" things being that we own a condo and we will soon have a dependent.  Given our situation, we feel pretty comfortable doing (and have been recommended by multiple sources to do) our documents DIY with an online service.  That being said, it's easy to find plenty of reviews saying ""it was easy and fast to use and the customer service was great!"" but I feel like the true test is in the actual execution of these documents.  You don't know if it was done right until it actually needs to be used.    So, has anybody out there executed a will and/or POA from an online service? Was it just fine or was it a disaster? We are particularly looking at LegalZoom and Willing. LegalZoom seems pretty solid but Willing is much newer so I'm curious to hear your anecdotes! Thank you!"	Yes
45	My mom has always been a bit controlling so I'm kind of doubting her intentions on this.. However, she just told me she went to a lawyer and got them to write me up a will and make her my health power of attorney.  The whole thing just feels weird and I didn't ask for it.. but I'm not really sure why this is needed, her intentions could be okay.  Can anyone explain the purpose of this? Everything online is really confusing and I'd rather be educated on this before she comes and asks me to sign the documents.  Information: 23, we live in different states, I'm not married and honestly do not have a net worth of much - about 30k.	Yes
46	Hello. My father passed away a couple of months ago. He didn't leave much in the way of assets, but he did have a 401k with a little over $52k in it.   My siblings and I weren't close with him, he wasn't a nice guy. My mother wants no part of anything to do with him.  So, I met with a local estate lawyer who was willing to handle everything, but he wanted a $3000 payment up front that would cover all costs associated. He said that if we were to put it on a credit card, we could get money out of the estate that he would be opening in order to pay it off before the next payment is due. My siblings and I, being young, don't have access to that amount of capital up front, and with my mother not wanting to get involved, I don't know what to do.   So here are my questions: 1. Does this seem to be a fair rate for setting up an estate and handling all of the probate stuff 2. Are there any services that you're aware of that could pay the money up front for a fee, that we could pay back quickly from the estate 3. Is this something I could handle myself 4. Am I running out of time to do this  One of my siblings and I are adults, just young and in school. We don't want to miss out on this money, the only good thing our dad has ever really done for us as far as we are concerned. He listed no beneficiaries on his 401k and had no will. This is taking place in Michigan, and the lawyer came highly recommended by my mentor in the local chamber of commerce.  Thank you so much for your time.	Yes
47	"My grandpa died in May. My grandpa died way before he did, and they'd saved and invested for years so he had a good amount of money, plus a paid off house. Grandpa always told me that I was to get half. He gave me the portion of his trust documents that named me so I could see the percentage I was getting (though there's no dollar amount).   It's now August and I've heard nothing from any lawyer. The trustee is my uncle (my grandpas son) but his wife (Aunt M) is really running the show. They're the other beneficiaries on the trust (it's actually 40% to me, 40% to them, and 20% to another aunt, Aunt K).   My maiden name is on the paperwork, not my married name. His house hasn't been sold nor have any of his other assets been liquidated (there's not many of those because he gave away most of his big stuff years ago, but I'm pretty sure they still have to liquidate everything). Aunt K also hasn't heard anything about how the process is going. It's a living trust so it shouldn't take this long I thought-- I mean it won't be settled in a few months but I think I should have heard *something?*  Today this is the reply I get from Aunt M, when I asked how this process is going:  ""Good morning, the financial group sent the check now it goes thur the bank attorney he reviews everything then the checks are sent out to everyone. I'll check with the bank, shouldn't be too much longer.""   Does that sound legit? For reference, I'm in Ohio: Aunt K is in California, the trust was drawn up in Oregon, and Aunt M is in Washington state where my grandpa died.   Thanks for any advice you can give me. I just want to know if I'm being scammed somehow by her. She's got a history of being dishonest."	Yes
48	"So essentially i was brought up under the guise of paternal alienation and covert incest. On top of a this, she also told all of us that Grandma would leave us an money when she died but 2 years after he death the will has been put into probate and we have been refused to see the will. She knows we are poor and she seemingly will just hold on to it till she dies.  First aspect, parental alienation. My mother would rarely ever speak positively of her my Dad. She belittled at every turn. Worse, she belittle his attempts at counseling and essentially use us to make him hit rock bottom (arrested usually.) my Mom did this portray herself as the valiant Mom. These things made bonding with him difficult and this only made things worse for him. She would never stage support for him, only ridicule him. He was like Lisa with Charlie Brown's football. We had to move 3000 miles to find work in the South because he failed a pisstest at his job. He has mental illness for sometime and figure she knew how to manipulate him. He lost so many opprotunities but my mother would always play the Wight Knight for him. Meth and pot arrests were big ones, however I witnessed her engage in these activities as well. Only after she would quickly criticize him. He was punching bag.   Stage 2: Covert incest, my mother always crossed every boundary with me. As a 4 year old, she bought me happy meals every day. She would constantly take me places and spend abhorrent time with me. I had a very hard time making connections with people. As I grew up after the move, I began to try and distance. But she would still act in ways that were inappropriate. The in 2008, my father tried leaving for the 1st time. Me and my sister quickly became each others escape. I would try and spend as much time with her as I could so I would not have to see my mother. The. In July my sister left with Dad for custody. I stayed with Mom and I believe she sexually manipulated. It got out of hand it was incredibly harming my 13 year old mind. Graphic depictions of sex and touchiness. These began the unwanted sexual thoughts that still plague me today. She offered me to come ""to bed with her"" one night. Of course that seemed like a sexual invite considering the previous events. But she knew I would have strong reaction that. All these thoughts made me turn to drugs and alcohol. I hung out with the wrong people. And she encouraged this. She would pretend like it was all okay. Then my Dad decided to come back and I would try rebuild a relationship with him. My mother interviened ever chance she got. She always would bad mouth any effort he made to connect. I thus would hang out and seek people who had drugs. This also impacted my relationship with Dad. Anytime he tried to stop me, my mother would constantly remind him about his past deeds.this only made me get worse.  Eventually in 2012 I started stealing some of my Moms tramadol pills because I was experiencing profound depression. She never addressed with me. But she knew it was going on and moved the bottle around and did try and intervene. This was the begining of a two year binge encouraged by my Mom and lead to me losing my scholarship. She practically encouraged me to leave school. My father left shortly after this. Now that he was gone for good, it was back to sexual manipulation and using drugs as a means to control. I quit tramadol on my own and then she began to romanticize her drug use and then a new substance for me. As this went I became more and more depressed and she began treating me worse and worse.the only reason I put up with was because she promised Grandma would leave an inheiritance. She would die and then she refused to talk about. I eventually was fed up and tried talking with my 17 year old sister for help. I was planning on getting help with that money. Turns out, my mother had manipulated her into blaming her father's absence on me. My sister geniunely complains about issues I can not fix. I left shortly after my mother refuses to help me in anyway.my father is so broken and he lives many miles away.   There is the issue of the will as well. i have checked the county office and the will is not in probate. She is ripping of my sister me and my two cousins. I think she is promising my sister money.   Thats the most polished way to put it. Is there anything I can do about the trust? Oh and she has stalled the divorce for three years. Its all just jumbled up and designed to be confusing as hell. Is there anyway to proceed with anything?"	Yes
49	Oklahoma is the place.   So, friends of mine are dealing with their mothers death. She passed last week. They are pretty sure that their parents were not divorced but have been separated only for 20+ years.   The father(or widower) might be married to someone in another state for around the same time of the separation to now. He is also starting to try and call the shots on many things with the estate.   Anyone have any advice on what they should expect? This is confusing me to no end but I'm not a lawyer.	Yes
50	"Hello, looking for some advice about the probate process for a small estate in the state of Arkansas. I've read up on what to do but I am still confused. Trying to understand if I need to go through probate court, or if this can just be solved through Arkansas's small estate process. I feel like this should be straightforward, so hopefully someone has some answers or recommendations.   My mother passed away last month. My father passed away 11 years ago, and I only have one (younger) brother.  I am named in her will as the executor of the will. My brother and I are listed in the will as beneficiaries, splitting any assets 50/50.   Her assets that are part of the estate are as follows: Checking account &amp; savings account, together totalling about $3K 11 year old van which she didn't owe money on, worth $1K at most  Assets that have my brother and I named as beneficiaries (so they shouldn't count towards in the probate process, right?): Life insurance policy for about $40K IRA account, about $30K 401K account, about $7K Another savings account, has about $200  Debts: Student loans, at least $20K Chase credit card, about $2K Not aware of others but will be running a credit report soon to confirm  From what I've read, her estate qualifies as a small estate in Arkansas, since it's worth less than $100K. So it should bypass probate court, and I simply need to file an affidavit of small estate. However, on the form for the affidavit of small estate, one of the stipulations for filing as a small estate is ""There are no unpaid claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate."" This is where I am confused. Chase wants to make a claim against the estate. If they make a claim, her assets are enough to cover the amount of their claim...so I assume I would need to pay them from the estate. However, I can't get the funds from her bank account to pay the claim without filing this affidavit. So how the heck am I supposed to pay them? Do I have to go through the probate court simply because there is a claim against her estate? I don't believe I should pay it out of my own pocket, it's not my debt. So it should come out of the estate. I'm just so confused about what to do next."	Yes
51	Ok, so about a year ago my grandmother passed away. No will was left behind, but she had expressed that she wished for it to be sold and split amongst the four grandchildren. She has no living children.   I have no way to contract two of us (no social media, no known number as i haven't talked to them in years and they didn't show up to the funeral) and the third has said she wants the house solely for herself as she thinks she deserves it more.   I can't afford a lawyer, but i want to see the house sold and split evenly. What steps do i take to see this happen? If it matters, this is in Illinois and I'm the oldest grandchild.	Yes
52	I own a trailer that is on my father-in-laws land. He is now deceased. The deed to the land is in his name. He did not have a will. But the land was automatically inherited by his children. Two of the heirs are now deceased as well. One of them was my husband. Our trailer is sitting on his part of the land. Which is in Carter Co Ky. Could any of the heirs tear down our trailer? What happens to my husband's part of the land that he is now deceased. He did not have a will. Is it legal for any of the heirs to tear down our trailer without our permission? Any help would be greatly appreciated!	Yes
53	My grandmother passed just over two years ago.  Before she passed I was told (by someone I am no longer in contact with) that she was part of a will however, he seemed reluctant to give me much more information.  In fact, he seemed like he told me by mistake as if he did not want to disclose that information.  He was the son in law of the man who passed and supposedly left my grandmother something in his will.  He passed roughy 5 years ago about three years before my grandmother.    So to my question, is it worth it for my mother to pursue this and try and claim this on my grandmothers behalf?   All parties have passed or are living in Washington state.    All advice welcome thank you!	Yes
54	The estate has plenty of assets to cover all debts so that is not the issue. Am I okay as executor to cover the post-funeral dinner for the relatives of the deceased from the assets. It will probably be $1000 out of an estate of $4m.	Yes
55	"My sister recently passed away under some bothersome circumstances in police custody, and as a result, my family has been involved in a lawsuit regarding her death. This lawsuit is nearly over, and everything is about to be finalized. We were recently informed that my father is legally entitled to request his own share of the settlement. Naturally, this has caused a collective ""WTF"" among my family. Here are some key points:  * My sister died unexpectedly and left no will. * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate. * My father isn't attached to or associated with this lawsuit in any shape or form. * My father has dodged child support for well over a decade, and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail several times over this. * My father hasn't had any contact with my family since 2003; nor has he made any attempts to make any contact, in any form. The last time we saw him was when he showed up to my sister's funeral for approx. 10 minutes, and left. * My father made no attempt to help arrange, plan, or pay for my sister's funeral service."	Yes
56	"Hi Reddit,  My mother passed away in Feb during the cleaning of her house my sister-in-law found a will that was signed, dated and notarized. I guess I have a few questions here.   1: Is this a ""legal"" will? What makes it legal and binding?  2: What is the process of selling the house?  3: She mentioned having to go to probate (what is that) and then said we could just not go though probate but did not say how that would work.  I am in the Dallas area my sister in law and the home are located in Austin.  I know this may not be enough info I can provide more if needed."	Yes
57	My Mum passed away 3 years ago and in her will she left her house to her partner then upon his passing it was to be sold and proceeds divided between the 3 grandchildren.Her partner and my sister never got on and he has made a will leaving the house to my wife and I. What recourse would my sister have to enforce the original will?	Yes
58	My friend's mother is currently being taken care of by hospice and they called her mother's siblings and told them that it is time to make funeral arrangements.  As her mother has been an incredible money pit her whole life and quite the burden on her siblings, they are declining to pay for any part of the funeral arrangements, and are foisting the monetary issues onto my friend (We'll call her Alice).  Alice is a management figure at a food chain, and doesn't make the money to pay completely for the cremation of the body.  Are there any legal footings that Alice can stand on that will compel her next of kin (who are loaded by the way) to pitch in or contribute to the cremation costs and transportation costs?  Is there any financial help that she can garner to complete the burial?  She would like to avoid the state taking the body so I would like to get an answer swiftly since her mother doesn't have much time left.  Thank you in advance for any information or help you may have.  We are located in Brevard County Florida, USA.  If this is the wrong subreddit to post in I am sorry in advance.	Yes
59	Posting on behalf of my friend who just lost her step-father on Friday and is dealing with the fallout today.  I'm going to provide a little background to give you a better picture of her issue:  Her step-father passed away on Friday due to natural causes.  Sunday her and her mother (the deceaseds wife) and his family met to make arrangements, and his family didn't want her and her son included in the obituary, nor any arrangements in their name included in the funeral. He was in their lives more than 20 years, but since he never formally adopted her they don't think she should be included.  I think this is a sign things are going to get nasty.  This brings me to my questions:  He had no will, are they likely planning on pushing that fact that she wasn't his biological daughter to exclude her from getting anything?  His wife is still alive but is dealing with medical issues that impact her mental state at times.  What steps should they, (step-daughter and wife) take today to protect themselves?  My friend isn't interested in his money beyond making sure her mother will have enough money for her medical care, but he has considerable assets including a large house, many vehicles and a sizeable account.  Looking for any and all advice.	Yes
60	"My 92 year old grandmother is currently decaying away in her home losing her mind. She has been injured various times but plays it off with insane excuses. She is clearly not mentally fit to be all on her own.  Currently she is in the ""care"" of my aunt, in which her daughter forced her so that she controls all my grandmother's finances. Right now the aunt does nothing at all, and worsens my grandmother's physical state.  In general the aunt is a big obstacle.  What can I do to help this situation? Ideally I'd want my grandmother to move in with me so I can actually take care of her but im unsure if my aunt would let that happen. It's come to the point where the aunt drains her pension each month not even leaving her enough for groceries.  Legally what are my options, alternatively i'd want her in an old folks home."	Yes
61	So my mother passed away early this year and about a month or two afterwards he starts seeing this woman from Hong Kong who does not have Canadian citizenship or permanent residency. My father married her this month without me knowing but I found out there was no prenuptial agreement signed. So first of all, is he in any sort of trouble if the government deems this as a marriage of convenience? Second, with no prenup signed, how can we protect his assets (such as house and finances)? I don't trust her and I'm worried that she can take a lot from him if they divorce or would be able to claim everything if my father passes away even though he has a will that leaves his estate to me.	Yes
62	Knowing my family, they wouldn't respect my last wishes. So I'm wondering if, legally, there's a way to make sure I don't have a funeral when I die? Maybe leaving a will? If so, how would I go about doing that and what would be the cheapest option?  Even $100 would be difficult for me to come up with.	Yes
63	My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	Yes
64	Sorry if doesn't make sense. I'm 16 and my dad is quite old, past 70. He is leaving everything to me in his will, but I don't get it until age 25 which is fine. His brother (my uncle) is my trustee and he recently told my dad he is investing the money until I'm 25. My dad said no, it's my kid's (me) money, they get to decide. My uncle says it's not until I'm 25 and that he can invest the money if he wants and that it's too late to make changes to the will now. This was all in an email I wasn't supposed to be reading but I am just wondering is investing the money a good idea or is this bad... again sorry if this is confusing, I don't know much about this stuff, and would just like to know if my dad and I should talk about it?	Yes
65	My wife and I have two very young children (both under the age of 2) who are babysat and adored by family friends who are about our age. They love our kids almost as much as we do. We're trying to make plans for the future, including a will, and want the family friends to raise the kids if something happens to us. They have accepted (tears of joy were involved), and we just need to figure out the legal path.  Our own parents are late in their own life stages due to the age at which we chose to have children, with the youngest of our kids' grandparents about 60 years old. We have concerns with the idea of our kids losing their parents, and then potentially having to deal with losing a new set of parents in their teens (or earlier--three of the four grandparents have serious health conditions). Only one, the wife's grandmother, has what might be considered an ongoing relationship, and that's only once or twice a month for 2-3 hours at a time, always with us around.  The problem is that we expect the grandmother and the father's parents to not take this well (that's a relationship issue and not in play for this post) and to fight it legally. We'd like to know what to expect when we select a lawyer to figure out the path, and what is involved in ensuring that there is an opportunity for the grandparents to be in our kids' lives but not have the opportunity to gain custody. This is prep work to make as easy as possible what is going to be, at least in some ways, a very difficult process.	Yes
66	Hello, /r/legaladvice.  I am currently researching the topic of Power of Attorney in British Columbia and an attorney’s ability to designate, alter or revoke a beneficiary designation on behalf of the adult (that made the enduring power of attorney).   Section 20(5) of the [Power of Attorney Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96370_01#section20) lays out specific circumstances under which an attorney can change or create a beneficiary designation.   However, my research of inquiries where this has arisen in my line of work has stated that an attorney has the power to make beneficiary designations if the Power of Attorney explicitly grants that power and, further, that Section 20(5) of the Power of Attorney Act only applies when such a provision does not exist in the Power of Attorney.   This leads me to believe that the Power of Attorney Act must fall under the legal doctrine of “everything which is not forbidden is allowed” **and so my question: is it codified anywhere that this Act, or British Columbia legislation in general, falls under this doctrine?** If so, where can I find that? Does Section 13(2) of the POA Act (“An adult may grant general or specific powers to an attorney”) considered to be the application of this doctrine?  Also, a side question. Years ago in a civics class I learned about this principle of if a law doesn’t forbid something then it is considered allowed and it was described with a one word adjective. Permissive? Non-exclusive? I can’t quite remember what that was. Does this ring a bell for anyone?   TIA	Yes
67	My mom has schizophrenia. Her brother is the trustee of a large inheritance given to her by her Dad. This inheritance is her main source of income. He's also the executor of my Dad's estate who just recently passed away.   My uncle wants to sell her house and put her in a assisted living home. She's only 60. She wants to stay in her home, where we she is currently being taken care of by a caregiver.   He's not providing her any sort of autonomy or transparency about the decisions he's making. He also refuses to allow me to have any  knowledge of how much she has and how its being invested. I know she has (800k+).  Right now I'm trying to figure out where her rights start and his end. And also if it would be worth applying for guardianship, I'm only 25 and not exactly that established yet. Would applying for her guardianship allow me to hold him accountable for decisions?  I just hate the idea that he's making these life decisions she doesn't agree with. He's doing this under the guise of it being in her best interest, but if that were the case he would allow her to be apart of that decision and would be sensitive to the fact that her husband just died four months ago. He wants the sell the house she's lived in for over 17 years and put her there within the next few months. From my understanding he wants to do this to lessen his responsibilities of taking care of her.   I'm also concerned about him making decisions about the kind of medical care she receives. She has the mental capacity I believe to make her own medical decisions. With other family members in the past, he has prioritized money over care, and I would hate to see him do the same thing with my Mom.   Does anyone have any idea about how to approach this? I don't where to start or how I go about any of this. Am I asking the right questions?	Yes
68	So I've known about this for years and years but honestly recently started using Reddit for real.   Growing up on the cotton farm my grandmother cared for her grandmother who was very ill. She was closer to her than much of the family. When she died my grandmother was in Italy with her army husband and couldn't go to Texas where the probate court is for all this land out in Texas she got, which has oil on it, a lot. That side of the family who did go get it ended up in politics and doing very well.  She has anxiety, always has, and is afraid of getting killed over trying to claim it due to the amount involved. She's almost 80 now and I'm not sure if this is something worth looking into since there have been some deaths around it. I called up the Clarksville Texas court to pull the old document that outlined what happened but they said it was incredibly long.   Is this something worth looking into? Sums involved are in the millions.	Yes
69	In short: --Widowed mother's assets consist of an HECM* (reverse-mortgaged home) and just enough cash/savings to cover current bills: utilities, trash, monthly Visa/medical bills etc. _(*house is worth more than HECM balance)_  --There are also 2 life insurance policies worth &lt;$10,000 designating the same beneficiaries as the estate.    --In addition to HECM, known liabilities = medical bills + CC debt slightly &gt;$11,000.   --We'll sell the house as soon as we're able (6 months) and distribute those proceeds (minus estate liabilities) ASAP.  Our issue is that among the beneficiaries, some don't need the life insurance money and want it all applied to claims on the estate, while others have real, immediate need for any/all funds available to them. While we expect there to be _some_ additional money to split in 6-8 months, the life insurance should  pay out in a matter of weeks.  Hence the question: are we _required_ to apply life insurance $ to the estate's  existing debt, or can/should it be disbursed directly to beneficiaries when it's paid?  Once we understand what we can do legally, we can sort out what we should do ethically, and according to our Mom's wishes...  Thanks for the help. We're talking a fairly simple estate and not much money overall, but it's a lot to some of the heirs. We want to handle these matters legally and correctly to everyone's benefit, but hopefully without spending down the estate's assets on professional legal help.    That's where you good people come in...	Yes
70	I know it sounds ridiculous to make a will at 18 but I am suicidal and I do not trust my parents at all, nor do I trust any immediate family members with anything that I own. In addition, I don't want them inheriting anything since they aren't very nice people. And is it possible to give everything to one person? I don't have any friends or any family members that I'm really close to. I only have my boyfriend. Any help/advice would be great appreciated.	Yes
71	"Forgive me if this isn't an appropriate subreddit for this subject.  My grandfather passed three months ago, leaving a will that split the inheritance between his three daughters. He had $100,000 in checking and savings accounts, a house on 80 acres of land probably only worth about $150,000, and shares of stock worth another $90,000. He happened to tell my mother, sister, and I that the shares of stock were to be split between us, the two granddaughters. He happened to not mention this to his other two daughters, my aunts, one of whom is the executor, and it isn't in the will.  Regardless, everybody has agreed that we two granddaughters will get this money to honor his wishes, though my eldest aunt, the executor, believes that this will be extremely difficult. She has declined to hire a lawyer for help, and lives on the other side of the country. She seems to be showing signs of early dementia, and has difficulties performing the simplest of tasks, including filling out simple forms. We can't directly help her, because she is so far away, and she refuses to ""waste"" money on a lawyer, though she is blowing thousands of dollars a month (it has been three months so far) because the enormous lawn needs to be maintained at nearly $200/week, and utilities are still on because she hasn't turned them off, property taxes are ridiculous, and the stock and property values have been declining steadily.   My mother and other non-executor aunt are frustrated, but at this point would rather give up the money than deal with their sister or bother with legal counsel. My sister and I are frustrated and could really use the money, but believe we have no legal recourse because we aren't formally in the will.  She is making zero progress on the estate and it is wasting money and preventing us from getting our inheritance. Is there anything my sister and I can do?   Additional info: Aunt lives in Arizona. Estate and sister are in NY. I am in Washington."	Yes
72	Please no hotline numbers or any bullshit like that.  I want to make a will that will ensure that when I die that there is a DNR, my organs can be used for whatever purpose, that there is no funeral/wake/religious ceremony, that my body is donated to science, and that my body is cremated afterwards and flushed down a toilet for all I care.  https://www.slideshare.net/tomwinfrey/sample-last-will-and-testament    Is that link that has a sample a good way to start it out?  I'm 30, not married, never married, no children, etc.  Should I start it out like that?  I think the Personal Representative is an Executor, right?  Being brutally honest when I say I don't have a dollar to my name, so I can't get an attorney.  I also don't have any friends or anything similar.  Can I leave it to my mother to being the executor, even though she will be a witness to the will (hopefully...)?  The payment of debts is tricky for me because I am heavily indebted with credit card debt, school debt, and a Personal Guarantee for a failed business lease contract.   So its around 150k.  Unfortunately my mom is on the lease contract for the failed business, so she will be stuck with that (yeah, I know its shitty of me, but I give up).  Can someone chime in on this here?  The only thing under my name is a car.  Should I try to get that into my dad's name?  He is disabled, so I'm not sure if that is possible.  They would REALLY need to sell the car in order to make ends meet.  Is there anything else that I am missing?	Yes
73	i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	Yes
74	"Hi legaladvice crowd,  I met with an estate planning lawyer recently, and she drafted up a will, power of attorney, etc. that I am currently reviewing.  I am somewhat naive about how all this works, but could you kindly let me know what is ""typical"" or standard practice for Trusts?  -----------------------------------  * For the trust itself, once it is set up, how is money put into it?  Is money transferred from all of our accounts into a single account in the trust?  What about stocks that we own in brokerage accounts?  Our house? Is the executor/trustee required to sell these and have cash, or are they just transferred into an account owned by the trust?  * The Will indicates that all interest earned on the principal within the trust is to be distributed each year to the beneficiaries. Is this normal?  Why would it not just accrue?  Do I want a 10 year old receiving tens of thousands of dollars each year?  For background, my wife and I have one child (a 2 year old).  If we both pass away, the trust would be set up and money distributed in three installments when our daughter reaches certain ages. Estate right now is about $3 million once you take into account life insurance proceeds.  I do plan on asking follow-up questions to our attorney, but wanted to try to make them sound somewhat knowledgeable!  many many thanks, GR"	Yes
75	So i'm going to kill myself. i tried in august and failed and i definitely should have succeeded. the past few months haven't changed anything. basically that's not why i'm here. i have some student and credit card debt. what happens when i die to that? i don't wanna leave my parents with financial problems after i'm gone. they have life insurance on me but not that much. Does the debt disappear or is there something i can do first? thanks.	Yes
76	Great Grandpa recently passed and at the settling of his estate me and my brother were presented with envolopes that had our names on them that were full of bonds our great grandparents had purchased in our names when we were born and while we were young. We have not cashed any of them in yet, but now members of our family are telling us to not cash them in due to the fact that none of the family outside of my Grandpa was present for the reading of the will. They are claiming it'd be illegal in some way or another. The bonds are in our names and all. Is this just a load of bull shit or do they have something here? Thanks in advance for any advice I get here.	Yes
77	"My Uncle was recently admitted to the Hospital in Houston and it took the Hospital 3 days to contact us, his family, because he was dropped off by a woman claiming to be his spouse who did not show back up until today wanting to pull the plug. We believe she is an illegel immigrant who has another valid marriage in Mexico, sorry for the lack of details I'm trying this as fast as i can because of the situation at the Hospital at the moment, he is located in Houston Texas and my aunt just made it to the hospital. We don't know who this woman who is apparently his spouse is, but we suspect it's some prostitute who was trying to become a citizen. What rights do we have as his family, can we stop her decision? Will she inherit everything he owns as he has no children?  What can we do as his family, nobody wants to unplug him except for his ""spouse"" who NOBODY know who she is."	Yes
78	My aunt is getting quite old and wants to set up a Living Trust and Will.  Both are quite straight forward as she wants to give everything to her daughter however she does have an estranged son that she no longer communicates with and wishes to ensure that he does not receive anything..  would LegalZoom be acceptable for this or would it be best to consult a lawyer.  also what would the expected cost be for a Living Trust and Will?	Yes
79	Horribly sad, very young, sweet girl.  What do we do with her final paycheck?  We don't know any of her family, only her BF who she killed herself in front of, and we will definitely not be giving it to him.	Yes
80	My mom has a copy of his will from 1981. The will is not notarized, therefore my family is wondering if it is a legal will. My mom's uncle, my grandpa's brother, is the executor.  If my mom needs a lawyer, which I'm assuming she does, she is in southern Cali and my grandpa died in northern Cali. Should the lawyer be by my mom or by my grandpa.   If the will is legal, my grandpa had two more kids after the will was written. What are those two kids entitled to get? My mom wants to add them to the will but I don't know if that is possible. If it isn't, I think she wants to give them what they are entitled to regardless of the will.   Last my aunt is also in the will. My aunt is bipolar. She is not really able to take care of herself. Most of the time she prefers to live under a bridge even though she has a home. My mom wants to give my aunt my grandpa's trailer but she is worried about leaving her money. She is hoping the money can go to someone who can monitor what is given to my aunt. But if the will directly leaves my aunt money is that possible?   Thank you in advance.	Yes
81	My mother, who I've been estranged from for several years passed away recently. I'm the only real family she had so I've begun the process to sort through the estate.  She always had some hoarding tendencies but I discovered after going to her house that she had become a full-blown hoarder. Like, rooms so full of junk that you can't access them.  I've run into 3 complications so far that I'm dealing with:  1. Despite an exhaustive search, there doesn't seem to be a will.  2. She was a renter, and the landlord obviously wants the house cleared out.  3. Under what I've read on NC law she would almost certainly qualify under the NC Small Estates law (I seriously doubt that in all that trash there's over $20,000 worth of property.) But under that law I cannot become administrator of the estate until 30 days after she died.  I'm trying to do the right thing by the landlords since they were personal friends of my Mom for over 20 years, and I've found a specialty hoarder cleanout company that can empty the house out.  So here's what my questions are:  1. Is it legally OK for me to clear the house out despite me not actually being the administrator yet? Everyone basically has already been treating me like one since there's nobody else to challenge me on it, but it won't be official for at least a couple more weeks.  2. The cleaners have said that since I'm not actually administrator yet that they want a letter from an attorney stipulating that I'm the only heir. How difficult/expensive would it be for me to get this?  Thanks in advance!	Yes
82	My grandfather passed away recently.  More than a year ago he added me as a co-owner on his bank account. What happens to the money in that account? Does it become part of his estate, am I entitled to it?   I thought I was entitled to at least some of it as the co-owner, but my aunt said not to spend any of it because she would have to pay creditors with it.   The whole point of putting me on his account was because he wanted me to have the money. (I was his caretaker &amp; he lived with me). It's not a whole lot - prob about 5k.   I'm in PA.  TLDR had a joint account with my grandpa, in PA, what happens to the money?	Yes
83	"So a little background my dad is 77, a widow.  He had a heart attack about 18 months ago and now was diagnosed with Parkinsons at the beginning of 2017.    I am his only child, his will is updated since my mom's death so everything goes to me.  He owns the home he lives in free and clear and it's worth about $180,000.  My wife keeps  nagging me to have the ownership of the home transferred from him to me.  Her belief is that if he have to put him in a nursing home at some point, that they will come after the home.  She believes this because her mother has told her this for years and is what they did to ""protect"" their grandparents home.    From my reading, if he was placed in a nursing home his medicare would kick in first, and they he would probably be eligible for medicaid (he doesn't have much money besides teh house).  I would rather not put it in my name, because I would face potential capital gains on the sale of it, whereas if i inherit it and sell it i'm paying nothing.  In the end, we don't want to lose the house.  I would rather pay the capital gains than lose it but i don't believe me wife is correct.  Thanks"	Yes
84	Basically, my sister has a dangerous lifestyle. She into doing crazy mountain climbing challenges. She has two sons, and the children's father have died doing the exact same thing. Losing her is a reality that I worry about. I also worry about my nephews who I can't abandon if something happens to my sister.  Can I take a life insurance policy with myself as the beneficiary in case she died, so that I have the means to take care of her children? I'm assuming the premiums will be high due to her lifestyle but it's a small price to at least not having to worry about the financial aspects of her getting herself killed and leaving her children with nothing.  We live in Montana.	Yes
85	Ok, so I'm a beneficiary to a generational skipping trust. We have inlaws that are for a lack of better words disruptive as well as aggressive towards some of the blood descendents Whom the trust designates as a beneficiary. I've considered calling hotel security to have them removed from the room as I assume they are not legally entitled to the information in the meeting when they get outta hand. Outside of this, what is the legal option to have them removed from the room entirely? Jokes aside please as I knew most people can't stand their inlaws.	Yes
86	An aunt's traditional IRA was moved directly to a company called Equity Trust in Ohio that does these self directed IRAs. The funds were used to purchase a property under an LLC that both her and the husband were owners. The aunt passed away and on the IRA the husband was named as beneficiary who kept the account with Equity Trust. Then the husband passed away who had named the nephew as the beneficiary. A lawyer had already assisted with setting up the LLC itself to transfer to that same nephew as well. What will the nephew who is the named beneficiary on the IRA have to go through whether they decide to keep or sell the property, and any tax consequences? This is all new to me so hopefully that all made sense.  https://www.trustetc.com/real-estate-ira	Yes
87	My father plans on getting re-married later in his life.  I always thought when he passes away my brother and I would gain his inheritance and estate, but will my new stepmother be the new heir?  My father is older than her, so he will most likely pass away first.  My soon-to-be stepmother also has two children of her own.  I'm afraid she will gain all my father's assets and use them to benefit her children.  Is it still possible for my brother and I to inherit all my fathers property and assets when the inevitable happens.  We all live in California.	Yes
88	My parent passed away 7 years ago. I was 18 at the time, and She left me a half the monetary value of the house, and the ownership name was put under my uncles (to make up the 2nd half) and specified on the will that I was to have access to these funds as of my 25th birthday. This is now coming up in 2 weeks, and my uncle hasn't made any moves towards taking out a mortgage nor has he put the house up for sale.  My last communication with him was in September 2016.. I have been attempting to get in touch with him semi-regularly since, as a reminder that we are nearing the deadline. The notary isn't helpful, and the executor of the will (my great aunt), is not doing her due diligence as she should have taken matters into her own hands and put the house up on the market. Not only has this been going on for 7 years.. but for the first 5 years, my uncle (lives in the house/lived with me but we do not get along and he kicked me out right) had been renting rooms out to people... one of them being a friend of a family-friend, and another being my cousin. He never once split the rent with me, which he should have been putting towards the succession, which he claimed he had been putting the money towards renovations for the house. This was a lie. He did not invest in the house with the rent money at all, and has in fact been reimbursed from the succession for the money invested on renovations as they are intended to help the sale of the house. He has ceased communications since last fall, meanwhile I've spent my entire adult life waiting for this to be over.   Basically, It's looking like this 25-year-old is needing to hire a lawyer under contingency. Has anyone had a similar experience to this that would be able to advise me?  I'm located in Montreal, QC.   Any help is appreciated.	Yes
89	Dear Reddit,  I really need your help!  A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.  Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.  I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.  How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?  How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?  And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?  Tbh, I've been really scared of this day. I've been trying to avoid even talking about it but the 2-year limit is ending. I really do need you guys' advices.  Sincerely,	No
90	My wife and I are filing for divorce in Ohio.  It's very amicable.  We had agreed on all of the terms, however the lawyer just told me that what we had decided isn't properly equitable.  Neither of us really want to go back to negotiating and we are both very much in agreement about what how we want things divided.  Is there a way around this, or will the court effectively force us to distribute our assets differently than we desire?	No
91	My question involves a traffic ticket from the state of: Washington  Hey guys, seriously appreciate any advice here.   My car was parked in my apartment complex's lot and had a resident sticker in the windshield after I registered it with management 2 years earlier. I had left for about 2 months to take car of my father who had a stroke, I didn't let management know I was leaving, paid bills on time while away. Looks like 30 days after I had left they decided they wanted to give everyone assigned parking spots, and if you didn't move your car for painting within a specific date, they would tow you. Obviously didn't move my car cause I wasn't there so car got towed and sold at an auction. I understand it’s my fault for not letting management know I was leaving but I never received any phone calls, emails, or anything from them that my car would be towed, or that we needed to move our cars for the parking assignments. I did receive a letter in the mail from the tow company though, which I only saw 30 days later when I returned home.   I haven't had a chance to speak with management yet because I just got back.   This is over a $10k loss for me if I can’t be reimbursed for my car...  Reading around on google looks like I have to take it up with small claims court.   What do you guys think?  Any feedback is greatly appreciated!!!!	No
92	Hello. I am a renter currently living in Pinellas County Florida. I would like to break my lease.  I have payed rent on time for the first 6 months of my 12 month lease. There is one other person on the lease who I share my apartment with. We currently with to find a new place to live as the duplex we are renting is too costly to be considered practical.   From light research I have discovered that, from what I can tell, If I am to break my lease early I will still be responsible for the remainder of the rent due for the next six months(Bad!). There are two ways that I can see in which I may be able to circumvent this and would like to know the validity of these approaches.(Good!)  First off, I believe that I was rented the property under #FALSE #PRETENSE. Upon viewing the property before renting I asked several questions about the property, the most important in this case is in regards to the back patio of the duplex. When asking the property manager (at the time) if the back patio was a shared space, or if it belonged to a particular tenant, the property manager indicated that the entirety of the back patio was included in the rental and that it in no way was shared with the other portion of the duplex. The back patio stretches from our back door, across one of our bedroom windows, and continues underneath a bedroom window of the other tenet. In addition, the power/water meters for both portions of the duplex(I am not very knowledgeable on this topic) are located about halfway across the patio, between the two windows. Lastly, on the far side of the patio from my back door is a water hookup that belongs to the other duplex. Upon moving in the couple that resides in the other duplex insisted everything up to the power meter belonged to them, and as a result the back patio has become a point of contention. The other couple has even restored to storing some of their things on my back patio as some strange show of territorial dominance. This is a hostile environment that I have no desire to be a part of and as a result I have stopped bringing it up with the other couple and stopped using the back patio entirely.   It is of note that over the course of the first three months of us staying at this property that the property management company switched two times and we had to sign a total of three leases.   Secondly as of around two months ago we began to see evidence of termites. Just some damage to the woodwork in the kitchen, VERY minor. We called the company, and they said they would take care of it. A couple days later the pest company calls us and we miss the call. WE call back and leave a message and they never got back to us. Two days ago the towel rack fell off the wall, and in the hole it left were termite wings. We suspect that the issue is getting worse.   What can we do in this situation.	No
93	I have an apartment in south west Wisconsin. I've lived here for 5 years and been a very responsible tenant. I have two other roommates.   So our faucet would leak when used, but it was a small drip and we didn't notice it for a long time. The result of the leak was mold in the cabinet space below. That section will need to be replaced. I reported the leak and concern for mold. They fixed the leak and sprayed the mold with an assurance that it was taken care of, but the cabinets have not been replaced.   I'm about to move out next month and I'm concerned that they have put off the replacement until after we move out and charged me for the damages and I don't have renters insurance.   Is there anything I can do to get some assurance that I won't be effected by these damages?	No
94	Not sure my state matters,  I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I need advice and feel stupid.   I received my first credit last week.  It's through Capital One. I activated it, set up my account, then used it at the grocery store for $7.  Today I went to pay my electric bill and it was declined.  When I check my online account I see they locked my card due to fraud.   I call Capital One and get directed to their fraud specialist.  Initially she tells me there is no fraud,  the card just isn't activated yet.  She puts me on hold to fix it.  Before this, she verified: My social Phone number Email address Credit card number and crv on the back  When she comes back she informs me she no longer thinks I am who I say am.  She tells me someone else called and asked for a new card to be sent out (somehow verified all the info down to my credit card number??)  So she tells me in order to prove I am who I say I am I need to email them a front and back photo of my drivers license, a front and back photo of my social security card and a photo of a utility bill in my name.   I understand they need to verify me,  but the whole explanation was very sketchy and I'm really nervous to email them all this info.   I could really use some advice please.   Thank you so much.	No
95	Hi, Here's a quick timeline of what went down: June: House is listed for sale- we make a cash offer within 3 days. The seller accepts our offer. We go through with various inspections to get through all the contingencies set forth in our contract.   After a few weeks we find out that there's an issue with the title- the seller's husband had died a year ago and they were both still on the title. Apparently they never got his assets taken care of/divided? They go to probate court in CT, and it's listed in the court's case-lookup as about 3 weeks after the initial listing and about 2 weeks after the accepted offer.   According to the seller's attorney, they expected the probate court process to take 4-6 weeks. I don't believe it because I haven't seen a single instance of anyone's probate court matter being that expedited. Moreover, since the probate court has the case listed at the end of June, and it's already almost mid-August, that timeframe isn't correct.  Our contract has it outlined that if by November they don't have the matter resolved, we can walk away from the purchase.   My question is whether or not there's anything legally wrong with what either the seller, or the seller's listing agent did in this matter. It seems a little strange to me that a listing agent would accept selling a house without proper proof of ownership. I understand that sellers can being a sale during probate, but have found nothing regarding what happens if they put it up for sale before going to probate. It seems excessively misleading to do this- as we expected to have a standard closing timeframe, well within weeks and not within 12 to 18 months.  At this point, we'd be lucky to have the probate court ready by next July.  Any ideas/input? Thanks	No
96	"My husband was in a situation in 2011 where he helped an old girlfriend buy a car and she stopped making payments on it after they separated. He also never made more payments on it and it was repossessed and has been a ""Derogatory"" item on his report ever since. It's for ~$13,000 and we are in Canada (Alberta but the debt was acquired in BC).   I've been trying to do some research and getting mixed recommendations on how to deal with it. We are in a position to be able to pay it all off in one payment, but should we see if it falls off the report next year (after 7 years)? Do we try to contact the creditor and get it all paid off? Would it even actually be removed from his credit report at that point? Should we do it all by mail as opposed to on the phone to keep a paper trail?    Thanks for any help you can give, we want to get it dealt with but I've seen many articles that say paying off the full debt could be actually detrimental and useless at this point."	No
97	"I'll try to keep it brief. I was just pulled over (petty traffic, improper signal). No biggie, until cop comes back with license ""you're driving on a suspended, we're writing you $500 in tickets and impounding your car"". Uhhhhhh....what? This was just now.  More info:  I had let a ticket lapse, but two months ago I paid 1/4 of it off and setup a payment plan, this is what I was told I needed to do to reinstate my license. I've made every payment on time and have even paid more than the minimum to pay it off quickly. I have another ticket that is newer that I have not paid off or setup a payment on, but I went to the courthouse and spoke with a clerk before a work trip where I was responsible for driving a company vehicles and I was told I am still within the 60 day ""grace"" window. I am still supposedly in that window.    I know I need to go to the courthouse to figure this out tomorrow, but my question is: will I be able to seek damages from the state for not following their own rules? I'm not going to be able to work this week (need to be able to drive), and the impound fees are always a nightmare. I'm sure a judge will throw out the tickets given this is apparently an administrative glitch...  I'm in Oregon."	No
98	"So this is my first ever speeding ticket - I honestly have no idea how to approach this. I got the ticket about a week ago in Bishop, CA while driving on a road trip. From about a mile away, I saw a black SUV and knowing my brother was nearby, I sped up to see if it was him. Once I got close enough to realize it was actually a patrol SUV with the words ""highway patrol"" on the rear, I immediately slowed down. But by then, I'm assuming, the cop had already matched my speed. He pulled to the side, allowing me to get ahead of him - then he proceeded to pull me over.   The court appearance that I have is about 300 miles away from my house. I'm willing to show up if it means I can get out of the ticket - but is there anything at all that I can do or say to make this ticket go away? I know it's a long shot, but I have to try!"	No
99	I requested to use my PTO and sick days instead of short term disability or FMLA after I give birth in a month because I will need to take FMLA later in the year when I will have no family help and therefore need to be at home.  My employer says they have never had this type of request before (taking PTO instead of FMLA) and that they will dock my vacation days since I do not want to take FMLA at this time.  Is this OK to do? I know they can't legally dock my sick time as per NY law you are required to provide 40 hours of sick time but is it OK for them to dock the vacation time they provided me as well?  Seems weird.  My husband is taking parental leave from his company and he gets to take his full PTO (his is accrued). My PTO is not accrued, I get it the first day of the year.	No
100	Hey guys,  First off, I wanted to state that I know I am in the wrong here. Backstory is, I rent from an agency and the pet policy on my lease is no dogs, 1 neutered declawed cat allowed with pet deposit. When I moved in 2 years ago, I had a cat. I paid a $200 refundable pet deposit, and a $20 monthy pet rent for the cat. The cat died after around 7 months of me living here. I called the agency and told them the cat died and they removed the $20/month pet rent.   August 2016 I got a dog. At that point, I had been living in this apartment for over a year and had not seen the owner or maintenance around ever so I figured they would stay out of my hair about it and if they said anything I'd eventually deal with it. Almost a full year later (June 2017) I got a phone call from the agency and they left a message saying that I needed to start paying the pet rent for my cat and that they knew I had a dog and that I needed to get rid of it asap. At that point, I was away travelling for a month and the dog was staying elsewhere. I called them back and left a message saying that my cat had died over a year prior and I had notified them of that, and that I didn't have a dog.   I returned with the dog a month later and I have not been contacted again by them about it. No letter was ever sent, just the one phone call. I plan on moving out in 2 months anyway so I am not too concerned about it, but I am wondering if this will give them any grounds to screw me out of my security deposit. From reading this sub, am I wrong in thinking that their option in order to deal with the dog issue was to evict me, and that if they didn't do that, they cannot take my security deposit because of it ? Unless, of course, the dog destroyed the apartment (she didn't, she's a good girl). Also, how about the pet deposit? Please advise, thank you.	No
101	I'll start at the beginning. My boyfriend &amp; I moved out of a crappy apartment in North Dakota. We moved into a nicer apartment with the same company, different offices. So my boyfriend drops off the check for rent ($700) at new apartment. A few days later, we get a call we owe late fees and rent. We show them we gave them the check for rent. They say they'll figure it out. That was almost 2 months ago. So now they called and said they messed up and gave the rent check to the old apartment. On our move out check, we got back $644. (They took over $800 for cleaning, replacing blinds, etc.) So now they're saying it's their fault for losing the check but we still owe them the $700 for first month rent. We barely scrape by as is so finding another 700 is beyond me. Is there any legal binding for me to pay the rent that they used and misplaced? They did use the money, they just accidentally gave it back a portion.	No
102	On mobile, throwaway, first time posting, etc etc.   So I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada on vacation. I'm originally from Alberta Canada. Tonight me and a group of girls went out for some Asian fusion. Unfortunately I am anaphylactic to peanuts. I carry meds in case of a reaction and always tell the waitress of my allergy.   So at dinner we decided to let the server just bring us food that would end up totalling $40-50 each and sharing instead of each ordering something individually. I told her at the beginning that I am severely allergic to peanuts. This allergy includes peanut oil. Server says great she understands. Awesome.   So our food comes out, one dish being chicken satay. I double check with the server that dropped it off (not our waitress) that the satay does not have peanuts. He says nope, it does not. Great! He said the dressing in the salad (which wasn't on our table yet) might have peanuts and he'll go check. So I start dishing up. I use chopsticks to put some veggie dumplings on my plate. I then grab some other food and eat it. Notice an immediate allergic reaction. Not awesome.   The waitress then hurries over and says don't eat the dumplings as they are cooked in peanut oil. Unfortunately I used the same chopsticks to pick up the dumpling as I did to eat something else. So serious cross contamination. We call the hotel paramedic and an ambulance. I spend about three hours in the hospital for observation. I gave myself my epipen and Benadryl at the restaurant. They gave me prednisone at the hospital. Had an IV and fluids given.   My question is do I have any grounds to sue? I'm pretty pissed since we're here on vacation and I felt like shit. I do have travellers insurance so the hospital stay will be covered by them. I'm really just curious what my options are. Thanks!  TLDR; told restaurant about peanut allergy, served food with peanuts, spent evening in the hospital emerg.	No
103	Like I wish I was making this crap up.    My mother who has several mental disabilities just dropped it to me that she is trying to run off with some stranger a few states away via plane or train or car. Abandining her apartment and younger son/ might be forcing him to go with her.  The thing is she is currently in trouble with CPS and has other programs like disability and government mental health services.   Is there any way I can keep her from running off? Or at least making it a lot harder for her too.	No
104	"I'm still pretty upset. So yesterday my landlord texted me and asked if he can bring someone over for a walk through. My lease is up August 31st. We set up for 4pm because I was supposed to work but another guy wanted hours so I let him pick up my shift. About an hour ago I get a knock at the door and as I'm getting up from my bed (butt ass naked) he opens up the door and has the new tenant with him. I was so embarrassed and ran back to the room as quickly as possible. He then yelled ""we'll give you a minute!"" And laughed and his tone was like ""oh this guy is so dumb"" as soon as I opened my room door they walk in and it was so awkward. I was just cleaning as we went and kept apologizing, it wasn't filthy but embarrassing like I had my weed jar out (yes I have my med card) and underwear in the bathroom floor, plates on he counter, I was planning on doing a quick clean up before they came.  They actually got done quick and then he came back and talked to me like I was a kid telling me I need to keep the place clean and stuff. Also questioning why I told him I would be at work. I told him I don't owe him an explanation and that we had an agreed time and he got upset and was like ""ok whatever I know what we talked about"". I have texts as well so I don't know why he even went there.  This isn't the first incident though. In March I come home to him leaving my unit and he said it was a leak they found during the inspection and he came to fix it. He then said he needed to grab some tools and will be back in 30. After working a 12 hour shift I was just ready to go to bed and after about an hour I said fuck it and assumed he's not coming and feel asleep and wake up to my bedroom door opening up and him telling me he was back. He then began looking in closets and shit saying he was trying to find the leak. (But he got the tools already to fix the kitchen sink) also they found it during the inspection so what was he looking for?   This feels extremely invasive and annoying. Is there anything I can do legally? It just upsets me because I'm wondering how many times he's came when I'm not here, and he brought the girl over to view the place when I told him I would be at work.   I've also found long blonde hairs around my place and no one with blonde hair comes over. At first I thought I was going crazy until if felt like every other day people at work were telling me I had a long hair hanging from my beard I blew it off months ago but now I'm starting to think that he may bring people over during the day, as I work mostly during the day and I work from sun up to sun down most days.   Also I noticed its times that my living room tv would be on( I'm not even in the living room unless company is over) or I had 2 less packs of ramen. Things that are big enough that I noticed but small enough where I don't look into at all. I know I can't prove any of this, but what options do I have? I have the neighbor looking out and she told me he does similar stuff to her but with her it's just him popping up and not having stuff out of place.   Is he within his rights?"	No
105	So my story starts in September of 2016. I was laid off at my Insurance firm and went on unemployment. On May 1st I went back to my old job after the contacted me back. I hate to feel this way but last week pay  cuts got brought up and it kinda felt like it was suggested to take to cut or your going to be let go. I'm just wondering what my rights are. I think I exhausted all my unemployment before so I'm not sure if he lets me go I will have anything to fall back on. Serious advice only please	No
106	Last year while I was visiting Paris, I purchase a rather expensive pair of boots I had been saving up months for. I figured I'd buy them in Europe since it's cheaper there ($1036) instead of $1293 in USA. I was told by the salesperson that I would receive a VAT tax refund at the airport after filling out several forms at the shop that I would just have to see customs and get my tax (about $120)refunded to me there.  I got to the airport, waited in a long line, almost missing my flight and the agents told me that I didn't have the correct form.  When getting home, I emailed the boutique explaining that I was unable to receive my money.  The sales person offered to speak to me via WhatsApp and gave me instructions how I could go to my local French Consulate and pay a 35 Euro fee to file the VAT tax return form to EU Customs located in Ireland. I gathered all the documents and made multiple trips to the consulate since each time I kept forgetting the appropriate documents. I mailed everything out, waited about 3-4 weeks and received no update. It's been about 8 months since then and I still have not received my money, even after emailing them several times and having them tell me that they'd look into this.   I know it's only $120 but I paid $35 and the sales associate said that the company would refund me for the fee and I went through all that trouble and they promised I would get it. I am visiting paris next month so I thought I could speak to their sales manager, but what can I do at this point?   Thanks	No
107	So my dad is on a ton of medication for his blood pressure that causes extreme frequent urination. Yesterday morning when he was headed home he got the urge to go RIGHT then. Anyone that has been on diuretics will understand. We are in Oklahoma by the way.  He pulled over in to an enclave (in a fairly rural part of town). As he was leaning against the hood urinating into the woods, someone drove by. They turned around as he was getting in the car screaming at him. (The guy had his wife and child in the car). My dad drove off because that is obviously a scary situation to be in.  Later we find out that the guy is blasting all over social media that my dad had his pants around his ankles and was masturbating in public. He didn't name him by name but we have an EXTREMELY recognizable car. Think only one of them in the state. He has since taken down the posts but claims to have made a police report and such.  My dad is an absolute wreck. He believes he has ruined our families reputation, is going to be hauled off to prison because its his word against theirs and they have three witnesses.   We have been in contact with lawyers and they just told him to lay low and not worry about it. They said worse case the cops might come by and talk to him. Urinating in public isn't a sex crime here in Oklahoma either.  Is there anything else I can do, what should we reasonably expect? What can I tell my dad to calm him down?	No
108	I'd like to take care of my warrant from June 2016. The warrant is for failure to appear for a violation of probation for not showing up to probation (I'm on probation in a county 7 +hours away).   I was convicted of domestic battery and sentenced to:  60 days in jail  3 years probation  52 weekly classes  Restitution  Probation would have expired April 2017, but it has been revoked since June 2016. I believe that would make it 10 months left.   Classes were finished October 2015, but I still owe most of the restitution.   What kind of time am I looking at and what's the best way to minimize that?  Is it more likely they will entirely revoke probation and I serve out the max one year minus 60 days served?  Or is it possible to avoid/minimize jail time and get off probation if I pay entire restition balance?   Also, I'm 7+ hours north of Ventura. Is there a way to hire an attorney to appear 977 for my mandatory appearance ? The protective order expired in April 2017.   Thanks for the advice!	No
109	My parents bought a house for me 10 years ago because my income was not enough to quality. They got the loan and I was on a title only. I put down 5,000 towards downpayment. I was paying for it mothly about +/_33% of the monthly payment Then I had to remove myself from title since I had to declare a bankruptcy but because I got a better paying job started paying down the loan at about 75% per month. I moved in in permanently and then got an even a better job and have paying about 98% of the payment. My parents never lived here. My parents bought it for me. I have been paying down the loan, initially with their help. Now the market value of the property has gone up. My father wants to retire and he has has an outstanding loan on a condo where he lives. He wants to sell me this house at about 75% market value. So essentially, I will have to pay the loan from the start again. He wants this money because he wants to pay off condo for his son and leave the paid off condo for him.  I think that is super unfair and unacceptable. I can add the money that he had to contribute toward the payments in the past to the loan, but the house was not intended for my parents. They should not profit on me. The house was purchased for me as  was unable at the time to get the loan. They never needed or wanted this house. How shall I proceed? They do not want to get the money they paid for it back. They want to make a profit on me, when they originally bought it at my request and for me. Thanks	No
110	I'm 20 years old and I've never seen my social security card and passport. My parents keep them in a safe deposit box at the bank. I have reason to believe that my parents will not permit me to retrieve them. What options are available to me if they decline to give me my identification?	No
111	"Hello all, kind of an extension to a previous post.   Recently, my roommates and I signed a lease and moved into an apartment that has a no pet policy. However, my roommate has an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) that has documentation for given to her by a licensed therapist in the state via telemedicine. We have done research, and found that we do not need to disclose an ESA to our landlord (correct me if I am wrong) under the Fair Housing Act.   Upon noticing that there was a dog in the unit, the landlord gave us a 3 day notice to cure our ""breach."" My roommate then gave our landlord the letter stating that the dog spotted was an Emotional Support Animal. Even after my roommate sent the letter to our landlord, our landlord asked that we either get rid of the dog, or we will be given an eviction notice. He stated that there is an ""undue burden"" due to having the dog, for the reason that under CA State Law, he must disclose that there was a dog living in the unit to future tenants, possibly harming future business. Is this true? Following this, he also stated that his attorney told him that we signed a contract under ""false pretenses,"" given that we moved in with a dog, and that this would override any discrimination to an individual with an ESA.   We have found a place for the dog to stay in the meantime, and want to bring the dog back, as it provides my roommate with the support needed to live not only in the apartment comfortably, but in the college town we live in. To appease our landlord, we have cured our breach. Even after sending him the letter, he told me that 1 of his supposedly 8 attorneys wanted to move forward with an eviction given we did not have the dog off the premise.   We have submitted a complaint to HUD, hoping that the fact that ESAs do not have to be disclosed upfront will help us out, and that our landlord's action is discriminatory.   Also, the lease specifies that PETS are not allowed. Because this is an ESA, not a pet, were we ever in breach?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you."	No
112	Hi everyone,  I am currently subletting a room near a college campus that I am working at for the summer. It is a room in a frat house. I didn't sign any paperwork, we did the entire thing informally where I found the listing on Facebook, negotiated rent and paid via venmo and moved in last month without signing any contract or written agreement. The room was pretty gross (hair and food stuck to the floor which resulted in tons of bugs). I bought a vacuum cleaner and cleaning supplies on my own and tried to clean to room to get rid of the bugs but I'm still having issues with them. Eventually I told the guy I paid about the issue (he isn't in PA, but called the landlord who said he'd bring in an exterminator, but that never happened.) I'm only staying for another couple of weeks and haven't been able to find a new place to live, so I'm going to stick it out, but it's fairly upsetting.  Is there any legal standard or something I could use to ask for my money back? Do I have any rights in this scenario having not signed a formal agreement?  Thanks!	No
113	This whole thing is going on in PA. I'm 33, my GF is 25, her Ex is 28 (i think) and their son is 4  So here's a rundown of events  I'll refer to my girlfriends son as G from here on out  My girlfriend is very into giving her son education opportunities. Last year, she was able to get G into a very organized and solid Pre-K program (at no cost due to her low income)  Her ex fought her on it. They have split custody, almost even amount of time is allocated between parents (a little heavier on the moms time).   The dads main beef was he'll lose time with his son, not to mention he had no transportation to drop him off or pick him up. Her ex lives with his parents, and they are great grandparents, but I think they are tired of their sons bs. He doesn't really have his life together.   We understood, so we setup a special thing with the school where G could go part time (1/2 days, 3 days per week). Since G was only 3 at the time, he would be eligible for the same Pre-K program the following year (coming up) and go to kindergarten the year after that.  It was kind of a pain agreeing to her ex'es demands to go part time. Her ex has no ride, so my GF would drive across town before work to take him to school even though it wasn't her day with him. I was in a position to pick him up around lunch time without issue.  Her ex verbally agreed that if their son liked going to school, he could go full time the following year.  Now the time has come to officially enroll him for the upcoming school year, and her ex is absolutely refusing to allow G to go full time. He likes the agreement where G only goes part time and we drive G back and forth.  A couple weeks ago he said he would agree to whatever G said he wanted. And G said he wanted to go to school more, and his dad agreed, and even verified all this via text to my GF. But her ex also had G for 3 days following this conversation, and once we picked G up, her ex said that G had changed his mind and didn't want to go to school more. When we press G why not, he says he doesn't want to make his dad angry (I don't suspect any physical abuse). I told G that dad wouldn't be mad att him, he would be mad at mom. But G is clearly a bit upset about the recent mom &amp; dad fighting on the phone, and being pressured to make a decision.  My GF is fed up with it and told the school to enroll G full time anyways, the ex called the school and told them not to. And now the school says we have until the end of this week to make a decision or G will lose his spot entirely. We view her ex's attitude as extremely selfish at this point, and find the mental conditioning he's trying to put on G very disturbing.  Is there anything legally we can do to get things moving that benefit G the most? Something that might be a small wake up call to the dad?	No
114	About 6 months ago, my boss got allowed the request of one of my coworkers to get a cat for the office. I protested and said my wife may be allergic but he/she said that they had always wanted a cat and it was going to happen. It did.   Come to find out, my wife is severely allergic and can tell if the cat has been near me at work. Coincidentally enough, for the first time in my life, I have had allergies that have really hurt my health as I have preexisting conditions that affect what medicine I can take. I am considering getting a allergy test and if the results are positive for cats, then show it to the boss with a request we no have a cat.  What can I do? Should I just say I will only work from home.	No
115	Hello, I recently quit my job at Papa Johns due to constant understaffing and extreme stress. I know they are obligated to pay me my hours worked, but I still have not received my check in the mail. Are companies required to send it in the mail, or is there a chance I will need to go pick it up? I haven't returned the uniform yet, but they can't withhold my check for that, can they? Any advice is appreciated.	No
116	I got into a fight at school with this girl. We had an argument and on that day, she posted on Facebook that she's was going to fight me the next day. Someone screenshot it and send it to me. Well the next day, at lunch, she was putting her hair up in a ponytail when she saw me. When the bell rung, I was walking my friend to her class when I saw her looking at me. She made it seem like she was just walking past me but I saw her friend watching and I knew she was going to throw the first punch. I was ready and she came at me. Well the police was going to charge me with an assault until I told him the whole story and showed him the screenshot of her threatening me. So I have a court day and it says crime/Traff misdemeanor. Never fought in high school. I think she was 17. No major injuries on both of us. I didn't get charged with an assault, got charged with disorderly conduct.	No
117	I am a student in Quebec.  Seven of us are moving in, and only two have signed the lease (as is common). I have not signed the lease.  We get verbal permission from the landlord to move some of our belongings in early. Half the previous tenants have left, so there is space. I moved in early with all my stuff. I sublet from one of the previous tenants, but did not personally get permission from the landlord, but  I find out later that this previous tenant did not tell the landlord.  Five days in, I start getting hundreds of bites on my arms and legs. It turns out that the place is infested by bed bugs, and has been for a while, with 4 ineffective treatments over the past year.  I move out and back to a friend's house, taking only the essentials -- clothes (which I treat in the dryer), and laptop. I leave the rest of my stuff in the house.  I tell the other future tenants, and the landlord calls a meeting -- tells us that the previous tenants are to blame, and that the house will get heat treated in the next week.  Some stuff (aerosols, a violin) cannot withstand heat treatment. I get verbal approval to go into the house and move it out before the exterminator comes.  When I turn up to the house, the landlord is there with the exterminator. The landlord tells us that we are getting steam treatment in just some of the rooms, rather than the heat treatment we were promised.  I argue with them for about 2 hours, and eventually they agree again to heat treatment. The treatment is scheduled for 10 days later.  I go in a week later to move out the aerosol/violin etc. and find that the landlord has thrown away most of my belongings because they were covered in bed bugs.  What are my rights? If I take him to small claims court, am I likely to win?	No
118	I've been carrying this on my shoulders since Nov. 2015. The therapists know the entire situation, in depth, and even though I feel iffy about what to do, they still encourage me. It is not such a black and white/cookie cutter situation, it's also very twisted, and gross, and sick... So I'll spare you the details and make this brief.   I don't have money to hire a lawyer, but my current therapist told me to at least seek a free consultation with one. How do I do this? If the crime happened in another county, what do I need to do. What will happen if/when I finally press charges? What should I expect? I need to know so much, but I don't know what all to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	No
119	I've just spent the last month in and out of the hospital due to black mold being in the house. I've told the landlord about it several times over the past year, and he refuses to do anything. He finally came in after medics found me unresponsive and sprayed the baseboards, but we won't check to see how far into the wall it's gone. So I'm currently out of the house, and will not be back until I'm positive it's the mold making me sick. I told the landlord I put a stop payment on the rent check until he decides to properly look at the wall and deal with the mold issue, and he gave me an official 3 days eviction notice. With the house not being habitable, can he do this? Is there anything I can do to not be evicted?	No
120	Hi, So I had 8 months left on my lease when I had to move out. The apartments told me after 1 week of moving out the apartment would be ready and that they will try to rent it out ASAP to minimize my losses. After 2 days of signing and paying them the reletting fee, they change the availability of the apartment to 2 weeks. They decide to renovate and increase the rent of the apartment since now is renovated. Before leaving I asked and they told me they will not renovate. I even ask for the price my apartment will be rented and they mention they would not know but it will be most likely cheaper than the other 4 apartments and similar to one since mine was not renovated. Is there anything I can do. Is like they took advantage of me paying already for those 2 weeks.  Second, since it will take them a lot to rent those apartments. Can I just send a friend to do a 1-month lease with them? The apartment price is considerably high when you do 1 month. But I still have 8 left,  and I doubt they will rent the apartment. Would I be still legally bound to pay for the other 7 months?	No
121	"I recently applied for a position in a VT branch of a major insurance provider. During my application, I had to agreement to private arbitration for any legal disputes before, during, and after any potential employment.   In addition to signing away any right to pursue a class action, disputes covered by the arbitration clause include things like sexual harassment, unpaid wages, discrimination against protected classes, overtime, and other issues clearly covered by both Vermont and federal labor law.  This is unlikely to ever be relevant for me, but I just want to understand, because this seems a little nuts to me. Basically, if this employer were to, say, refuse to pay me for wages I had earned, and I couldn't work it out through negotiation on my own, we would then go to a ""neutral"" third party selected by the employer. This neutral third party, while technically supposed to make a judgement based on actual law, could really do anything. They could just say, ""lol, you ain't gettin' paid"", and then I would get no money. I would not be able to appeal this decision... Is this correct?? I guess I don't understand the point of labor laws existing at all if employers can just have people, for practical purposes, sign away their rights. This can't be how it works, right?"	No
122	Occasionally the safe will be short at work. Last night it was short $100. The GM said that since they have no way of knowing who did it each employee who worked yesterday must hand over $15 or else they will be terminated for theft. Is this legal?    Edit: I am in Arkansas	No
123	Work in a place where traditionally lowest on the totem pole does the hard crap work. It sucks but eventually you earn your stripes someone new comes along and you do less and less of the crap until one day you rarely if ever have to do it.   Here and there over the years I have had managers try to jump someone over me (usually because they are female or older and less capable) pushed it to the main boss and they agreed that was not cool. Couple of times this resulted in the newer employee quitting because the work is that disagreeable      New group of managers has decided the traditional way of doing things (and also the way all similar departments in the company still do it) doesn't matter to them.   So now it seems that the young men no matter seniority get to do all the hard work, while being told that what we do is the top, not the bottom.   Are there and laws that protect us? (CA)  Feels real shitty	No
124	"Throwaway obviously and I'm looking for advice on how to help my big brother. Both families involved are from GA but soon to be ex wife is currently in NC and brother was recently reassigned to GA.  He is a Marine, been in over a decade and in his early thirties. About eight years ago, he married a woman who already had two children from different men. The fathers were in jail/on drugs/out of the picture and brother eventually adopted them both. She was ""finding herself"" and he enabled her to be a stay at home mom and payed for her to take numerous classes, from real estate to nutrition and now to yoga certifications, but she has never been gainfully employed since they've been married. She also has a chronically ill (alcoholic, smoker, possible MS) mother who lives in GA, who she drives to ""check on"" weekly and buys groceries for (with his money).  She has decided the military life isn't for her and she doesn't love him anymore, and wants a divorce. He is expecting to have to pay $1k per child per month + their mortgage payment (~$1k) on the NC house, which leaves him no money to support himself. He doesn't want to get a lawyer but I feel like he is totally being taken advantage of and that those sums are crazy.  If you need more info to help, please let me know and I will provide it. It breaks my heart to see him lose everything."	No
125	Essentials: Ex had a dog before we were married. After divorce, she asked me (via saved text messages) to take care of said dog until she found a place that allows pets. 18 months later, and with only one attempt to visit the dog 14 months ago, she's moved to California. I'm renting at the same house since the divorce, and the ex provided the $500 pet deposit for the dog at my house. Assuming no further contact, what do I do about the deposit money when I move next year?	No
126	"I live in Omaha, Nebraska. My old apartment charged me rent for the month of July, but my last day of residency was June 30th 2017. Due to another semi-unexpected expense, this overdrafted my account by a fair amount and I have so far been charged 2 overdraft fees and will likely have an ""extended overdraft"" fee added on before I am paid and can be back in the black. Rent was set up to be paid automatically through their web portal, and I had not cancelled it, thinking it was unnecessary as I had signed all the paperwork to move out.   The property manager had called me July 3rd, telling me the automatic system had charged me, I went to my bank to try and stop payment, but it appears it was too late. I contacted my bank Friday to file a dispute, and then contacted the property owned Monday. They agreed to pay back the amount, but denied responsibility and so would not pay the overdraft fee, claiming it was my responsibility to cancel the payment. I wasn't happy with that, but $35 didn't seem worth the hassle and cancelled the dispute with my bank. Now that it is 2 fees, as a second bill came due before I was paid, and potentially a 3rd fee, I'm less inclined to accept that and considering my options, if I have any. I was wondering if I am indeed liable for not cancelling the autopay set up through their portal, and if I am not, if this would be worth pursuing in small claims or through my bank."	No
127	I have bank records, email records, and a copy of my lease showing I paid a $750 deposit, plus a $250 pet deposit. I moved out last month(after giving the required 60 day notice) and now the apartment management is saying I never paid the $750, only the non-refundable $250 pet deposit . I received an itemized list of cleaning fees which came to just about $400(the power was turned off before I could clean). They applied the $250 pet deposit to the bill, but are now saying that I owe them the difference, but in reality they still owe me almost $600. I am printing out a demand letter to send, should I include any copies of my records with it or just the letter(because they should have the same records that I have regarding how much I paid)?	No
128	"Hello,  I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop.   Reference:  ""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic stop for another violation.   Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement. Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""  From the Arizona state legislature.  The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.  The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.  I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt.   I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this.   Thanks"	No
129	So I moved out of my last apartment at the end of the lease on the 1st of this month. Naturally I would expect my security deposit to come back to me by now, but I have not gotten anything from my landlord thus far. When I called him (the management company), he told me that my former roommates have not come up with a replacement roommate and are short on covering the replacement security. He stated I would not get my security back until my roommates covered that cost.  I am wondering why this should be an ongoing issue for myself if I am no longer legally binded to the lease.  My general experience with the management company has not been great. He never responds to my emails when I've requested information in the past. He answers the phone only when its convenient for him. And I have not actually ever met the guy. When he informed me of how the security deposit is being handled, I asked him if this was written in the lease and he said yes. I don't believe him though and am in the process of getting a copy of the lease to be sure.  Does a situation like this seem probable (legal) or is he just holding my money until he knows it's been covered (illegal)?	No
130	"My boyfriend and I rent a house directly from the homeowner. He always argues with us about the necessity of any requests we make for repairs or maintenance, so I've started emailing him lists of things we need addressed just to have it documented in writing. In these communications, I have tried to be as cooperative, polite, respectful, reasonable, and understanding as possible. He refuses to respond in writing and will call instead, making promises that he later claims he never said (I suspect this is why he does not respond in writing).   Last week, he sent some employees to replace our broken fridge and remove a broken window unit AC.  The next day, he came to the house with one of those same employees to look at some other problems.   He and I were talking about some of the items in my latest email, and he began getting angry and increasingly loud with me. He is upset that we ""complain about every little thing."" I remained calm and did not raise my voice, but I did respond to some of his accusations and complaints. At one point, I said, ""Please do not yell at me.""   My boyfriend heard the argument (just him yelling, since he wouldn't really let me speak) and came into the room to ask him not to speak to me in that manner. He also said, ""What's the problem here?""  Landlord turned his anger onto my boyfriend in an even louder, more aggressive tone. He accused my boyfriend of being on drugs the day before (something the employees he sent out must have said). Not true at all - he works second shift and had just woken up. The employee present this day came into the room at that point and stood behind my boyfriend. This was in a small, enclosed space, where the landlord and his employee had my boyfriend effectively trapped. The landlord started waving his fists around and threatening to fight my boyfriend.  Boyfriend managed to get out of that room and went to the bedroom in an attempt to walk away from the situation. Both men followed him and also trapped him there, still yelling and threatening.   We are considering filing a police report just in case anything like this were to happen again in the future, but also fear that may make the situation worse. I know he would not be notified unless a warrant was signed, but we live in a small town, so that's not always a guarantee.   I'd really appreciate any advice or feedback you guys may have on whether we ought to pursue this, since we now don't feel particularly safe around him and definitely don't feel as though we can ever mention another maintenance problem. Thank you."	No
131	I was looking for apartments in the Los Angeles area and found one I liked.  As part of the application process, I was required to deposit one month's rent (roughly $1,500) with the current tenant, who had leased the entire unit and was looking to add a roommate to the lease.  Neither party was particularly experienced with the process, so all I have is an email from the current tenant confirmed that I sent them a deposit for 1 bedroom / bathroom in a 3 ba/3 br unit.  My application was approved by the building management to be added to the lease, but I ended up finding a better housing situation, and so informed the current tenant that I was no longer interested.  Aside from the application, nothing was signed with the building management, and certainly no lease.  The current tenant now refuses to return my deposit on the grounds that it was a holding deposit meant to compensate them for these types of situations.  My position is that, given that this entire process start to end lasted less than 10 days, it's unreasonable to retain an entire month's rent as compensation for this.  Is the current tenant justified in keeping all of my deposit, and, if not, what options do I have for getting it back?	No
132	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
133	Sorry in advance for the length. I live in CT, fyi.  Seven years ago my then-wife and I bought a condo. It was put in her name but everything including the down payment was split down the middle. We divorced four years later in July 2015 (without lawyers) and we agreed that I would continue living there since she could move in with her mom rent-free. The divorce decree said I would continue paying half the mortgage until it sold and at that point we'd split the money we made (if any). I wanted to cut my losses and walk away since the condo isn't tied to me at all, but she refused to sign the papers unless I agreed to continue paying half the mortgage until it sold.  She said it'd go on the market as soon as it was show-ready. I gave it a good cleaning and bought some nice decorations and new couches for staging. it looked better than when we bought it. She said then it'd go on the market in the spring because that's when most people look for new homes. That never happened. A year ago we agreed that my new girlfriend could move in and take over paying half the mortgage until it sold. So, at that point my ex wasn't paying anything except property tax. After several months it still wasn't on the market. I told her it needed to be put on the market and sold ASAP so we both could move on with our lives. She said she met with a real estate agent friend and the condo is now worth a hell of a lot less than what we paid for it. She said we'd have to keep paying the mortgage for 3 more years until we sell it to break even.  This is unacceptable. It's been 2 years since the divorce and we've made no progress. I desperately want to move and be done with my ex once and for all, but because of our divorce agreement I feel stuck. Moving and taking on a second mortgage/rent is not a possibility -- I barely make enough to cover my bills as it is.  I'm planning on meeting with a lawyer soon to see what my options are, if I even have any. Before I do that, I'd like to hear what /r/legaladvice has to say. Would it be possible to take her back to court and have the divorce agreement revised? I want nothing more than to walk away from this damn condo and create a new life with my girlfriend.  *tl;dr: I agreed to continue paying have the mortgage of a condo in my ex-wife's name. She is no longer paying her half of the mortgage as that's been taken over by my girlfriend. Ex expects me to continue paying for another 3 years so the condo will break even when it sells.*	No
134	"Cross post. From legal help.  u/Freckas ((I can't edit title- people moved in property will not sign or pay I need them out. They started bull dozing me from the beginning but it was not obvious until they were inside the property and started haggling me down on rent and deposit. ))  Hindsight is 20/20. I realize now my mistakes: Holding rental property with out deposit or signed lease or any money what so ever.  The wife of the couple 23f and 23 m military put me on the spot several times.  Things I've tried to graciously provide but is turning and in fact turned into a nitpicking negotiating, bulldozing nightmare.  ""Reduce the pet fee since one pet is emotional therapy but will not prove it""  ""Let us paint (before even seeing the house it's recently been professionally painted for 2k)""  ""Let us meet you in the middle of the night, give us directions for an hour, invite all our friends and bang on the door,oh we forgot the money, we didn't bring the signed lease, we couldn't find a printer, we don't want to sign the lease until we pay and didn't want to pay until we found out your a real person not a craigslist killer""  Everything screams (I'm an idiot me the op and they are entitled)  They've been in the house since 1am Saturday, can't get them to answer to meet up for the lease and payment, they promised they would but like everything else they just end up doing what they want.  When I called this evening they finally answered and instead of giving me a time to meet they say ""we don't wanna pay the full month and want you to take off money from the deposit we have a list of discrepancies, and instead of 865 we want to pay 500""  I explained I already did the walk through with them every appliance is new, we did not provide a washer and had warned them that, now that is a bargaining chip for them.  I saw the writing on the wall and said ""You've not paid any money you've not signed a lease and you've not stopped making demands-it's clear I'm not going to make you happy this isn't working""  He says ""I need a week"" but also cusses me out and threatens me that they haven't signed anything so he doesn't have to do ""jack S----""  I say ""please no hard feelings but this will never work you've not jumped through any of the hoops that tenants are supposed to and I've had to do every single thing what your asking me to do now is too much special treatment""  The house could pass a military inspection it was spotless ontop and behind appliances professionally cleaned.  They are not in the same reality... I know really shouldn't have let them move their stuff in but they were ""please don't make us get a storage unit tonight just for one night"" and he is a marine who just got back the beginning of the month, I didn't know things would get so out of hand but they kept pushing.  I ended the conversation by saying I might be able to give you 48 hour but I need you guys out because I really did hold the house for you and this has gotten out of hand, your not wanting to pay and your taking advantage of me (my stupidity in reality).  What do I do? I need to know my rights, I am getting a property manager but I would like to get them out since they have no intention of really paying and keep stalling.  I have his commands number but I do not know legally if they are squatters or what I have done. We only want them gone with out retaliating in the form of damage.  I've already called power and water company to inform them that no one has permission to be there."	No
135	"Hey, so I just turned 17 and am in a kind of predicament with my parents. They think I'm a ""sociopath"" and a ""conniving whore"" (long story) and basically they want to kick me out. I am able to move out around Christmas, but my father has just informed me that he wants me out NOW. He made it sound as if he could just wave his hand and have me either sent to jail or committed to a mental institution. I tried to explain to him that in order to do any of that I would have to have committed a crime or actually be insane, both of which are not true in my case. However, I'm not sure...I told him ""I have a right to live in this house until I'm 18 unless I commit any crimes"" but I don't know if that's actually the case. So what are my rights as a 17 year old in PA? I seriously just need 4 months to raise enough money and graduate from high school, and then I will leave and hopefully never speak to these narcissists ever again.    Thanks"	No
136	My spouse and I have chose to move back to our home state from LA.  In doing so we had to terminate our lease early.  Our lease was a basic printed out 1 page agreement with our deposit amount and monthly rent and the agreement the land lord would cut the grass as long as we had no animals using it.  When we gave him notice of our intent to terminate the lease he let us know he would keep the deposit.  We told him ok we understood and that since we were paid up to a point we would be moved out by then.    This past weekend my spouse and I moved a trailer full of belongings to our new home and upon return to the home in LA today my spouse found our washer and dryer missing and all our stuff rummaged through and pictures of my spouses daughter who passed away in the trash with other things.  Called the land lord and he said he had Aarons (who we did rent to own with) pick up the washer and dryer for us since we were leaving.... He then threw things out since we abandoned it...... Keep in mind we are paid up to a point that we agreed to leave we were gone for just over 24 hours moving one load of belongings.      These are not the first issues we have had. During our months at this home we paid 1300 a month.  The landlord on more than one occasion let himself in with no notice. He even did so why we were home and the kids were playing just unlocked the door and walked in.  He refused to fix a leaking AC unit that kept soaking the floor at times as well.  He has threatened to throw all our stuff away as well because he has someone who wants the place now...  Also Aarons should have never picked up our stuff for him as he is not on the agreement at all and has no say so on our account.  They disclosed to him as well when picking up the washer and dryer that since that was being forfeited they also needed our kids bunk beds back  that we had already moved and that we owe X amount etc... They disclosed personal information and picked up belongings with out verifying anything or permission to speak with him.  Do we have any action we can take against either the land lord or Aarons?  At this point we are trying to dig through trash to find anything else that was tossed.   The house is in the same or better shape than when we moved in as well.	No
137	Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	No
138	So my town does angled parking spots on some streets. Town ordinance (though it's not actually posted on any signs on the streets) states you have to park head-in in the angled spots.  I was pulling out of a lot onto a 2-way street with angled spots on the right side. Before I did, the person in the angled spot immediately to the right of the lot exit I was using left the spot.   The proximity of the spot to the lot exit was such that, instead of turning right onto the street, reversing, then pulling forward head-first into the spot, it was faster/easier/safer to just pull forward and back right into the spot.  When I got out of lunch, I had 2 tickets. One for $30 for violating the head-in ordinance - that one I understand. Ignorance is no excuse, etc. However, I also had a $54 ticket for a Section 39:4-135 violation. Here's that text:  39:4-135. Parking; direction and side of street; angle parking; one-way street The operator of a vehicle shall not stop, stand or park the vehicle in a roadway other than parallel with the edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the right-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway, except as follows:  a. Upon those streets which have been designated by ordinance and have been marked or signed for angle parking, vehicles shall be parked at the angle to the curb designated and indicated by the ordinance and marks or signs.  b. Upon one-way streets, local authorities may permit parking of vehicles parallel with the left-hand edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the left-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway.  I think that violation is in error. In (a) it states only the angle of parking in reference to angled-parking ordinances. I took photos of my car, it's at the correct angle and between the space markers, it's just backed in.  What do I do here? I doubt it's worth it to fight the head-in violation since that one's pretty cut-and-dry, but the 2nd violation really seems like it's not valid. I've literally had 2 non-parking tickets in my life, one was speeding that I hired a lawyer for when I was like 17, and 1 was driving without an inspection sticker on a car I bought on eBay that same day, so I'm pretty green to this. If I plead not guilty, am I gonna have to go word-against-word with some douche traffic cop? This is also the town I live in, and it's a very quiet town with a ton of bored cops, so I'm worried that making any sort of waves is gonna mark me and my car to every cop in town forever. $54 isn't going to break my bank account or anything, but it really steams me. We literally went out for lunch, and it went from a $50 meal to a $134 meal.	No
139	My uncle was a landscaper. He was working for someone that owns a family business company. They were working on a  yard and he needed to get something from the back of the truck. While he was standing behind the parked truck someone under the influence drove by and struck him . That was at 2pm yesterday. He was pronounced dead at the hospital around 3pm that day. His wife and children are obviously distraught. The man that hit him has prior d.u.i convictions. A couple of months ago my dad (his brother) passed away. My uncle was generous enough to help put in thousands for my dads funeral but with doing that his family is left with little to no money for my uncles funeral and other expenses. If the guy driving doesn't have a legal license or isn't insured are they at a loss? Is there any legal action they should try to take?	No
140	"I listed an item for sale on the app LetGo for $300. I received a full price offer and provided my PO Box for payment. Since then I've had several red flags.   * The buyer asked for my phone number for the check, and since we've been communicating via text. The buyer has used two different phone numbers.  * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment.   * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.  * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.  * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.  * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.  Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.  Aside from not cashing the check what is my legal obligation at this point?  I've googled the credit union in GA and am considering calling them tomorrow to alert them.  In addition should I take the check to the police? Right now all i have is the check, the LetGo user information, and the two phone numbers the scammer used."	No
141	We dont have the money that he claims we owe him. We paid this months rent on the 2nd. Is there anything we can do? Please help I'm so scared.	No
142	One of my roommates is moving out on August 5th. She hasn't been the most courteous person through the leaving process. A few days ago, we got the utility/internet bill and everyone was told their money was due yesterday so I can pay the bill on time. The roommate in question hasn't paid yet and hasn't answered my texts following up.   I can't cut her off from utilities, but it's not illegal in my state to cut her from from internet. If she isn't paying her share, it's stealing, and I don't want that. The internet is in my name only, so no issues cutting her off from that perspective, whether that be changing the wifi password, blacklisting her devices via MAC, etc. However, the router currently being used is hers. This is where I fear any kind of legal complications. Am I subject to any legal ramification if I change the wifi password? It's my internet, but her router.  Due to budgeting, I can't afford to buy a new router until she moves out, so buying a new one isn't an immediate option.	No
143	"My girlfriend and I just received a voicemail from our apartment complex saying that we had to take down our [CA Pride Flag](https://smile.amazon.com/California-Pride-Flag-Rainbow-Banner/dp/B002OSQEUG/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8) because it's not on a flag pole (we saw a neighbor hang their USMC flag against their porch wall vertically, so we did the same with our flag.) and that it needs to be ""displaying colors properly.""  Our lease says nothing specific about flags, but it does say, about patios and balconies, ""any item not specifically mentioned here must be approved in advance by the community manager. Any item that has not been approved in advanced will be required to be removed immediately."" We didn't get permission, we assumed because we saw the other flags we could do the same. We can fly it on a pole, but we're worried about ""displaying proper colors."" What rights do we have to fly this version of the California flag?"	No
144	Some clarification and backstory: I am asking on behalf of a family friend who isn't technologically-savvy enough to know about reddit. He has a daughter who will soon graduate from college in the US, who does not know that he was once deported - and he wants to keep it that way if possible. Also, first post here, not sure about the rules, the whole nine yards - will edit accordingly if I've broken any posting rules.  Story: My family friend (Bob) was an illegal immigrant for about a decade or so, until the mid-90s. He went there on a tourist visa and illegally extended his stay. In the mid-90s, Bob returned to his home country to settle some family affairs, and was detained when he attempted to return. From what I understand, he was flagged by the system upon arrival at customs, and it also didn't help that he had less than $100 on him (apparently, it seems that it signals an intent to stay illegally). Bob's visa was revoked and he was sent home on the next flight.  When his daughter was starting college, Bob tried to apply for a tourist visa to visit with her, and help her settle in. But the American embassy still had his records, and denied him his tourist visa.  Now, Bob is in the process of changing citizenships to another country on America's Visa Waiver Program (legally; his wife and daughter are from said country and he has been living and working in since being deported). If he successfully changes his citizenship, would it be possible for him to legally visit the US again? Or are there any other possible (non-illegal) workarounds to allow him to visit? He no longer has any intention of being an illegal immigrant.  Thanks in advance for any advice!	No
145	Basically what happened was that my sister called to get internet for our new apt, and we were rejected by CenturyLink because the person who had lived there before had an outstanding bill of $200+. The representative even had the gall to ask my sister if she wanted to make the payment on behalf of the former resident, (why on earth would we do that for a complete stranger...? Honestly...) which obviously has ticked me a bit.    No, I don't know who the resident is, there are absolutely 0 ties between me, my family, and whoever used to live here. They rejected literally on the basis of the past resident having an outstanding balance, (my sister has a call recorder on her phone so she emailed me the audio,) yet, they require your SSN in order to make an account with them...    A friend of mine told me it's total BS and I could actually report them to the BBB for taking unnecessary sensitive information and rejecting us based on someone else's records. I've never heard of such a preposterous way to be rejected, and honestly I just want some decent internet for my home.     Also sorry in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. Idk where to post it...	No
146	One of my friends is a stoner and keeps his stash and paraphernalia in his car (not the wisest decision, I know). Sometimes I ride in his car. If, while I am in the car, he were to get pulled over and searched and his stash was found, what would happen to me, even though none of the items are mine?  I'm completely unfamiliar with marijuana laws in Maryland as I never have and never will use it, and this situation came to mind. Wondering if I'm making a mistake by riding with him.	No
147	"Okay, so about a month and a half ago, my boyfriend's friend asked if he could crash on our couch for ""a few days"" because he was homeless and broke and whatever. We said sure, as long as it was only for a few days, because we live in subsidized housing and it is against our lease to have someone stay for an extended period of time. He has been here for over a month now, and we don't know how to get him out. I am posting here because I was telling someone about this situation and how I was thinking about printing a fake letter from my landlord and using that as a way to get him to leave, and I was told that in Minnesota if someone has been staying in a house for a certain period of time they need to be formally evicted. I don't know how true that is, or what to do. We have asked him to leave and he just tells us ""I have nowhere else to go"" even though he has other friends with couches that he could be mooching off of. Sorry if anything is unclear, I am a little frazzled.     TL;DR Guy is staying on our couch and will not leave, he doesn't pay rent and isn't on the lease. How do I get rid of him?"	No
148	I have never liked my first name and recently I have undergone some emotional trauma related to it, so I want to legally continue using my second name instead. I'm a 23 year old senior college student and I would like to know what would be the legal repercussions and what I should start to do in order to stick to this identity. I have read about some people being able to do this without changing their name but I fear that I might do something wrong in the process. I will greatly appreciate any and all feedback.	No
149	I'll start with that I'm living in Atlanta, GA. I moved here and have been living in this apartment since June. Last week the apartment complex was taken over by new management. Over the weekend I got a letter stating that starting in September my flat rate water/sewer bill is gone and in it's place will be a $46 sewage, pest control, trash, and management fee + water charge based on consumption.   The issue is that in my lease I signed for the $xx flat rate water/sewage fee and the rest was just included in the rent. Is it legal for the new management company to charge this new rate or are they breaking the lease?	No
150	My brother recently saved up for and purchased a 2003 BMW M3. He's mad about cars and this one especially. A few days ago, while parked at a friend's house, someone backs in to his car in the driveway and then flees the scene. An onlooker thought it was something like a Pontiac Grand Prix, a pretty common car for a high schooler. He thinks he knows who it is as the paint scrape matches the color of a friend's Grand Prix. They and their parents denied the accident but I am somewhat skeptical. The person in question was present at the time, paint matches what was left on my brother's car and they drive a Pontiac Grand Prix, apparently very poorly. (As all high schoolers do) The damage done is pretty extensive to the front bumper and lights, would have to replace the entire bumper most likely? (Not sure) Insurance apparently doesn't cover the type of damage done so it would be all out of pocket for our family. Just generally curious on how I should approach the situation and if there is anything I can/should do to hopefully figure out who caused the incident?  -Previously posted in /r/cars   Images of car damage: http://imgur.com/a/e2sm3	No
151	"To preface this with a little bit of background, I have chronic migraines where I frequently get to deal with going temporarily blind, followed by several hours of excruciating pain worsened by light or sound. It sucks, but it's the hand I was dealt. Migraines, while often seemingly random, are triggered by several things for me, most notably by strobing or flickering lights and by cinnamon.   I moved recently into a new apartment close to my college campus, where the lease guarantees me the use of three assigned parking spots in a garage underneath the apartment complex. When I moved in I noticed that there were 5-6 flickering lights inside the apartment complex's garage, and I quickly called the property management company to ask if they could please fix the lights, even just by removing the ones that flickered if replacement was too costly. I called the property management company on August 3rd, and received a text from them that same day indicating that the lights would be fixed by this last Monday (August 7th). While this was slower than I would've hoped for such a simple fix, it wasn't entirely unexpected and I resigned myself to wait.   Monday the 7th came and went with no update from the property manager and no fix for the strobing lights. I asked for an update and received none. I had experienced two migraines that can be directly attributed to the lights (aura started immediately after being in the garage), but they were in the evening and I just dealt with them while I waited. On Tuesday evening the lights in the garage triggered another migraine, and I called to try and get an update on the light situation and got nothing but a voicemail. This morning I woke up to drive to work and hadn't even gotten my car out of the garage before the aura began, meaning I couldn't go to work for at least half a day (I'm preparing to leave for work when I finish writing this). This problem is costing me time and money, because each time I have a migraine I have to take two pills that cost cost over $100 each (Treximet, average price of $927 for 9 tablets) and I have currently lost $89.40 in wages for today (4 hours at $22.35 an hour). I cannot have this problem continue, for the sake of my financials and my sanity, but the landlord texted  me this morning with a real gem.  ""I do not have an exact day or time for the lights in the garage at this time.""  Understandably I was pretty upset by that and texted her to say it would be unacceptable and that a more rapid remedy was necessary. It's been almost an entire week (this is the 5th business day since my complaint) and they still can't even remove 6 light bulbs?  Her response:  ""No, I will not meet that demand. You do not have control over the building or the HOA. You are free to park street side.""  She suggests that I park street side, where there is only very rarely available parking (college town, right next to a college campus) and where my car and its contents are sitting out in plain view rather than sitting protected in a garage. I cannot park outside because, having gone for a short walk, there are no spots available on the entire street while my lease guarantees me a spot in the garage.   According to hud.gov, it would appear as though the property management company has to make reasonable accommodations for a person with a disability (chronic migraines count, and I am registered with my college's office of disability services): [link here](https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/disabilities/inhousing). I think that asking that flickering light bulbs be at least removed, even if not replaced, is more than reasonable.   At this point I'm at my wits end. I'm considering contacting the office of disability services for my college to see if they can provide me with any help to try and get this problem fixed any faster. I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable with all this, and if anyone has any advice that might help me more than trying to get someone else to step up to bat for me since the property management company refuses to listen to me. I'd also like to know if I have any grounds for a civil suit to reclaim my lost wages and the (so far) $400+ cost of medication that has been incurred just past the date they said it would be fixed."

152	Minnesota.  A couple of months ago my tenant gave me notice that he wanted to move out after the lease automatically renewed for a year term. I decided to be nice and allow him to with no penalty. Tenant said he'd be out by August 1st.   August 1st arrives and he asked for an extension of a week I had to give him extra time because I had no other choice even though I have new tenants lined up and they're mad at me. I told him he had to be gone Saturday. And just pay the amount of rent he would owe for that period.   I arrived home from vacation early this morning to find he STILL has stuff in the house. I stupidly do not have fines laid out on the lease. And I can not find how much I am allowed to fine him for breaking the term. Is there any way I can fine him for this huge inconvenience or am I just screwed?   Thanks for the input.	No
153	Tucson,AZ.  So, last Friday I got a notice that my complex was under new ownership. The note stated that we could pay our rent on the 5th because of the holiday and they were closed. The pay location also changed to dropping off rent at their office across town during their office hours. I worked on the 5th so I wouldn't have been able to bring them the payment. Tried to call them, no answer. A neighbor informed me that for this last month we could still use the drop box. However due to bad luck, and having no car, the places I normally got my rent money order from were closed or their machines weren't working, I got the MO the next day for my rent plus 1 day late fee in the amount on my lease, $6 fee. Today I got a note on my door stating my rent was late, it had over $100 in fees. As well, they got my rent amount wrong. It was lower than my actual rent but it proves they didn't even review my lease. My lease is a 1 year lease starting on June 1st 2017. They never reviewed any possible fees nor have I signed any  agreement with them yet for any of their policies.  So what am I looking at, am I liable to pay the fees, or are they essentially violating my lease agreement.	No
154	Sorry about formatting, on mobile.   Was running my in unit AC when I noticed that smoke was starting to billow out of it. I touched the sides of the unit and it was scalding hot. When I opened the unit I found Styrofoam pieces inside of the unit taped on by maintenance to jam the large fan. This jamming is what lead to the fire hazard.  Upon unjamming the fan and turning it back on, the unit would shake uncontollably, becoming a further hazard.  I have photos of the inside of the unit and the Styrofoam bits that were placed inside of it.    Do I have any legal grounds here because if I was not in the apartment it surely would have escalated to a fire.  I am located in Centre county Pennsylvania.	No
155	"For the 2 years I've lived here, we've gotten along reasonably well.  However, his last tantrum was the last straw.  I'm outta here.  When I moved in, I paid $1,200- first and last month's rent.  As far as I'm concerned, my financial obligations to him are satisfied.  His response note claims that I should pay:  * Half the cost for a housekeeper to come in and deep clean the place  * Half the cost of professional carpet cleaning for the entire house  * The entire cost of a new queen sized mattress because it's the ""right thing to do""   Since we never discussed getting a housekeeper (and I was the only one to ever vacuum, anyway), he's entitled to zero.  I will, however, be a stand up guy and run the vacuum one more time before I leave.  We DID talk about renting a carpet cleaning machine.  I agreed.  I did NOT agree to have a service company come in to do the work.  It looks like my share of  a 2-day machine rental + a large bottle of solution comes to around $35.  Replace the bed?  Not a fucking chance.   None of his end-game stipulations were written into our initial rental contract.    Is there any law compelling me to meet any of his demands?  I want to be fair about this, but will not allow myself to be taken advantage of.  What are your thoughts?"	No
156	"My wife, 1 year old and I recently moved into a house for rent in Pennsylvania. The landlord is an older man who owns multiple single family homes that he rents out in the area. Before signing the lease we informed him (in person) that we have a two dogs (70 lbs Goldendoodle and a 15 lbs mini weiner dog). At the time of the lease signing he had no issues with allowing the dogs to live in the house. Within the lease it includes that two dogs are allowed to live in the house with us. We never tried to hide the size of the larger dog and even made sure twice that he was aware of his size.   On the day of moving in the landlord expressed concern (without ever seeing the dog) that he wasn't sure if he wanted the dogs in the house (he said this to my wife as I was at work). Today, he showed up to the house to ""trim the hedges"" while we were not at home. My very well behaved and friendly, but protective dog was barking at the landlord through the back door. The landlord promptly called my wife saying that he does not want the dog in the house anymore and we are meeting this Sunday to talk about options in regards to the dog. When I called him back he said that he was afraid the dog was going to ""come out the window after him"" and was ""scratching the door"". I know my dog and all he does is bark and look out the window at strangers. I checked the metal door and there are no scratches on it at all, not even dirt marks.   The advice I am looking for is can he force me to remove the dog from the house. The lease was signed by my wife, the landlord and myself. The dogs were written in the lease that they were allowed to be on the premises. The lease also says that verbal changes are not authorized and that only what is written in the lease is legally binding. If he tries to force me to remove the dog (which I will not do as he is part of the family) can he evict us for that? If he does, am I legally entitled to get my deposit/first month rent refunded? Also, could I demand that he pays for any moving fees that I accrue if I do have to move out.   I do have access to a group legal through my employer. Would it be worth contacting an attorney if he tries to force us out of the house?   Thank you for your advice and I apologize for the choppy/bad writing."	No

158	"Hi legaladvice peeps,  A few weeks ago, my partner and I signed for a new apartment beginning August 1. We(and our guarantors) signed the lease and paid for the security deposit, first month's rent, and broker's fee(about $7500 in total), and proceeded to start changing utilities and scheduling movers and days off from work (all with a promised August 1 move date in mind).     Our broker informs us that we won't be able to move in August 1 and that it would be safe to say we could move in August 15, because the current tenant's new apartment won't be ready. Essentially, these tenants are waiting for the tenants in their new apartment to move out(which may not be until July 31) because their management won't draft up a lease or give them a move in date until they receive keys. The turnaround will take about 2 weeks according to this management company hence the August 15 move-in date. They are currently hoping that these other tenants will move out a week early, moving their move-in date to August 7 which is still terrible imo. They refuse to find themselves a hotel and storage space for the interim period. Their rationale is ""One of us is pregnant, and it's very stressful for us, so we aren't going to move until we are ready."" They refused to renew the lease and as far we know had never asked for a month to month lease. The tenants were informed with proper amount of notice that their lease was expiring 7/31 and that the landlord already had new tenants ready to move in.     We have informed the broker + landlord that moving in after August 1 is pretty unacceptable -- we will lose over a thousand dollars because my partner will have to cancel her sublet arrangement at her current apartment (which she was set to move from on 8/1), and I will have to move in with her for some undefined amount of time (from 1 to 15 days, approximately). I will have to pay moving fees twice, take days off from work, and I've already had to cancel professional trips between the dates of 8/1-8/15.     We have informed the landlord of all of this, and they basically said they would try their best to motivate the tenants to leave on time. I suggested that they could try reimbursing our expenses via the current tenants' security deposit, or notify them that even one day stayed past 7/31 will lead LL to proceed against them. The broker has been stressing to this couple how bad this could be for them monetarily– a lot of people's money is on the linen including ours, the broker, and the landlord although we don't know if that's getting through to them.     We signed a Blumberg A101 Condo Leasing form (https://www.blumberglegalforms.com/Forms/101.pdf) which includes a clause saying that the landlord isn't liable for failure to give tenant possession of the unit at the beginning of term - basically, it says LL's only obligation in this scenario is to prorate rent for each day they can't give possession, which they have already offered to do. As explained above, however, this situation will cause us to pay rent twice in August.      NYC housing-educated people, what are our options in this case? We still would like to move into this apartment, but it would also be useful to know if this can be used as leverage to cancel a lease, in a worst-case scenario where tenants squat for more than 2 weeks. Also, I'm curious about precedent for this scenario, and what landlords are typically liable for in a case of holdover tenants + signing a lease on property that they can't actually give possession for"	No
159	My 16 year old daughter is pregnant and I refuse to support her child, period.   She doesn't want to be emancipated, but I don't want to support her lifestyle anymore. I want her gone. I know I sound like a monster but I can't take this, I will off myself before I support her anymore.   (Drugs,sex, sneaking out, stealing from me etc...) I am a single parent, Father, mother is deceased.	No
160	Hi guys. First time poster here. Family bought a house about 10 years ago. HOA have been hounding my parents for the previous owner's unpayed HOA fees. They are billing them more than 5,000 . Threatening to put a lean on the house. My family has been paying the HOA fees ever since we moved in to this house. They have tried to settle this long term ago, but management keeps changing and they are very untimely or never reply back. What are my recourses? What documents do I need? . I need to help them. I feel like we are being taken advantage of.	No
161	I live in California.  I lived with 4 other guys and my girlfriend lived in my room. Only me and the 4 guys were in a contract with the landlord, not my girlfriend.  We agreed on the set price for each person at the beginning of the year (my girlfriend didn't pay and the other tenants didn't ask her to).   The day before the final month, one guy said he wasn't going to be paying rent and was moving out. He said my girlfriend should pay his rent since she has been living in my room for free. He ends up slowly moving stuff out and staying at the house about half the time anyways. He didn't pick up his final belongings until the last day when everyone moved out.   My girlfriend ended up fronting $200 and I $100.  I had been the person collecting the money from the roommates and paying the landlord each month. That means I also got the security deposit back from the landlord minus cleaning fees.   Am I legally able to keep his portion of the security deposit since he didn't pay me his last month of rent?  He is filling out a claim and is threatening to sue me if I don't give him his deposit back.	No
162	Posted in r/personalfinance originally   Not sure if best place to post, but have found help on this sub-Reddit before   My grandfather passed away this weekend and I have been off work since. My partner went to work on Monday but came home early and has since taken Tuesday and Wednesday off as well. Partially as she is upset and partially to support me.  Now, the thing is she has been temping at a company the past few weeks (in the uk) and she has been called this morning to be told she is no longer wanted as she is 'unreliable'   To me this seems wholly unfair, as she is taking compassionate leave, and if she had been asked to go in, she would have.  My question is, is this right? Is there anything that can be done here?	No
163	I'm in Ireland so this doesn't really regard me, but I saw that in Montana, intimidation is defined as follows:   &gt;(1) A person commits the offense of intimidation when, with the purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, the person communicates to another, under circumstances that reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out, a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts:      (a) inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person;     (b) subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or     (c) commit any felony.   My question is would a threat of violence, for example, count as self-defensive intimidation if it in turn provably prevented potential physical violence from taking place?  We're a few pints deep, and clearly this isn't urgent, but if someone could clear up this semi-drunken debate we're having it would be much appreciated.	No
164	"So I'm pretty familiar with California landlord/tenant laws and rules but this one has me stuck. Posting for a friend.   She agreed over a month ago to rent a room in a shared apartment. There were two rooms available, one larger and one smaller, for the same monthly rent and deposit. She made clear she would only be willing to move in and rent the larger room, and since it was available, the two made a verbal agreement she would be moving in in August. The other roommate who is ""in charge"" and searching to fill the rooms, I'll call her B, did not express any problem with this. There were texts outlining this agreement as my friend checked in with B multiple times to ensure that was still the case as B continued to hunt for a third roommate, and it always was no problem; the bigger room was saved for my friend.   The deposit was paid and lease was signed a week or so ago, and the third and final roommate had still not been found yet. It was confirmed in this visit as well that the bigger room would be taken by my friend the first week of August.   Friend went today to officially move her stuff in and someone else's stuff was in the room she was promised. B said she could take the smaller room, which she does not want obviously.  She would not ever agreed to live there had that been the only option since she is specifically moving for a bigger space. B said she will talk to the newest roommate about it, who's stuff was in the bigger room.   After learning the other two have no relationship so B isn't playing favorites necessarily, I assumed she was just desperate to find a third roommate and figured my friend will deal with the smaller room (she is very sweet so comes across as a possible pushover, which she isn't). My friend is going to meet with them tomorrow and make it clear again what the agreement was (assuming newest girl had no idea), show the texts to prove it, and see what they say.   Without a room being specified on the actual lease and them being the same price monthly, there is no way to differentiate between the two rooms on the lease. As I said, there are text messages to prove the original agreement about the room size though.   If they refuse to give her the larger room, would she technically be breaking the lease by not moving in since the room isn't specified on the lease? Or are they breaking the lease by not adhering to the original verbal and texted agreement? Just want to know what sort of leverage she has before she goes in swinging :)  Thank you in advance!"	No
165	Hello!   I'm a foreign student in the US; I'm on a student visa (F-1) going to art school. I know I can't work/get paid here legally, but can I make a film (me as writer/director) if I don't get paid at all? I will gather producers and crew, and they will get paid with money we raise to make the film, but I won't. Is that legal? I plan on sending the film to festivals in the US and abroad, if that makes a difference.   I went to film school here a couple of years ago and made some short films then, but I don't know if it's different now because my major (fine arts) is different...    Thank you!	No
166	I have neighbors who moved into an apartment right next to mine. The entire property is non smoking as outlined in the lease. At first they were smoking on the balcony and I reported it to the apartments but it hasn't stopped. Now they are smoking inside blowing it out of the window as it billows into my apartment. I've notified the apartments on 3 separate occasions and they have talked to the neighbors who claim is wasn't them. (I literally saw them with my own eyes..)  The apartments say with no proof there's not much they can do. I have severe allergies that are exasperated by smoke and this has been a huge problem for me. I keep my windows closed as much as possible but the smoke smell seems to permeate through the vents.  Is the apartment legally responsible to fix this issue since I was promised a non smoking living environment?	No
167	"Hi all... I'm helping my boyfriend get his marriage from Vegas annulled (he was drunk and drugged during it and doesn't remember, and both parties are consenting to the annulment).

168	I stopped at a stop sign and checked to see if there was any incoming traffic from the left. After checking, i proceeded to turn right but then I saw a person in front my car, crossing the street. So I quickly pulled over my brake and the person saw me coming at her and she quickly back paddled. Then she walked over to the driver's seat and when I pulled over my window to ask if she was alright, she said she WASN'T alright and asked for my information. So i gave her my phone number and my name and she just walked away after verifying my phone number... She was not on the ground, and from my perspective at the time, the only contact that my car had with her was with her hand at the front hood of my car trying to maybe.. prevent the car from lunging at her?   Is there any charges that I can get from this incident?  I am residing in Washington State.	No
169	Columbus, OH  My SO and I have been dating for ~5 years and want to move into an apartment together along with a third roommate.  They have both signed the lease and have cosigners.  I will not require a cosigner and not yet had an opportunity to sign.  Recently, her parents have made clear that they do not approve of us cohabiting.  My question is whose consent do I need to be on this lease?  Do her parents need to find out?	No
170	Location is Kentucky. MSPaint is here [http://imgur.com/a/eyigA](http://imgur.com/a/eyigA).  I've not got all the information I really need yet, I'm stuck at work. A contractor (i assume hired by the county) is laying pipe in my neighbor's yard and will soon make it to ours. I'm worried about a section of the pipe that will have to be laid underneath a section of property covered in decorative river rock large pebbles up to the roadway.   I figure the county has an easement to allow the work to be done but what responsibility does the contractor have to do minimal damage or put the property back as it was? Any?	No
171	I was caught by a speed gun going 85 mph in a 55 mph zone, after the fine was payed I was told by my fathers legal adviser to plead not guilty and to fight for a lower punishment. What steps can I take to not make myself look like an idiot. Here is what I have noted so far: * I was in a 55 Mph zone * I have driven over 10000 miles since I got my car this fall, driving to soccer practice for the school, for my soccer club that is an hour away, school , work, games, leisure.  * Driving for me is a daily task, and to be able to accomplish the things I need to do at this time in my life (Soccer identification camps, touring colleges, work, odds and ends) I need to drive because of my parents work schedule. * The car I was pulled over in was not my vehicle, it was my ex-girlfriends, it was a newer, better accelerating car.  *I am not saying I had a justified reason for speeding, I am cut and dry guilty, but I had SAT's in the morning and I was driving home from a late soccer game, I wasn't thinking right and I just wanted to get home.  That is all I have for now, can I get advice on whether this useful information, and what else I can add. Any advice is appreciated.	No
172	Person issuing my wife US Citizenship certificate a coupole of years ago changed the spelling of her first name and removed the middle name. She went to SS and was given a replacement with the new changes as they are on the US Citizenship. She didn't realize that the middle name was removed because it wasn't listed and that this would be the identity. My question is does she have to change her license too?	No
173	I'm currently drafting a non-fiction book about economics and the software development industry.  I want to compare charging an unreasonable amount or demanding excessive payment to the fictional character Rumpelstiltskin from the titular fairy tale.   As far as I'm aware, no one owns fairy tales and I'm allowed to do this - am I right?	No
174	This is for a name change, the hearing is at 9:20 AM so not really time to run all over the city (and to a county 2.5 hours away). I planned to mail all the info to MIL who still lives in the far county and she can do the searches there, while I'm doing my searches in my county, we meet up over the weekend to trade off papers and bam, done. It sounds so stupid but this process has been so stupid that I'm just being careful.	No
175	So my wife and I took a weekend trip. The highway we took is one of the older highways that has a ton of little towns where speeds go from 65 down to 45 and back up again constantly. At one point there was a speed change that my wife didn't notice and she was also coasting down a hill doing 60-65 we aren't sure in a 45. The cop stops us an writes her a ticket for 70 in a 45. My wife is also in the process of getting a job where a clean driving record is a must. Is there any recourse we can take to ensure this doesn't make it to her record? She got the ticket this weekend and after months of back forth with a company she got the job offer today. It's her only ticket and no prior warnings either. The state is arkansas.	No
176	Throwaway here. I rent a room in a house, the landlord also lives there with his wife. I have a signed lease that is good through October of this year. Long story short, the landlord came home from work to me having sex with his wife. He immediately assaulted me and told me to get the fuck out. I was pretty much thrown out (he's a lot bigger and stronger than me) and I didn't have a key to the house on me. I'm now at a friend's house for the time being.   Two questions  1. This definitely seems like an illegal eviction, should I wait for him to calm down and perhaps I can continue living there?   2. Can i call the police for assault? I have a black eye and some cuts but nothing serious. Or would this just about ensure that I won't be able to continue living in the house? The rent is cheap, is very convenient for commuting to work, and up until last night, I really enjoyed the company of the landlord and his wife.  I'm in California.	No
177	So i met this girl at a club in Berlin and we instantly hit it off. I invited her to take a drink with me at the bar, she agreed and we drank the first sip together at the bar. She then introduced me to her brother, who was 15 years old, and all three of us started dancing. She started holding my hand and moving me closer to her. So i moved and she started dancing dirty with me. After a while i kissed her on the forehead and she just went mad, she took my to another area and we started kissing. She then just suddenly stop and told me she needs to look for her brother. I said okay and thought nothing of it. I returned to the dance floor and started dancing, and she then just found me, came up to me and started kissing me. I thought okay she must have found her brother and told him something so we went to the bathroom and started having sex, she gave me various sexual acts and never once said, implied, nor showed that she was not consenting to this, and told me explicitly to put it in. After we finished i went to take a drink and came back to check up on her. I found her still naked with vomit all over her. I went in cleaned and dressed her up and found her brother to take her home. After a couple of days i got arrested and now accused of a rape charge. She claims that i drugged her drink and went in on her in the bathroom and she started pushing me way and shouting at me. None of which has happened! I dont know anyone who was in the club so i dont have any witnesses who could testify that we were just kissing with her full consent. This is a nightmare i am living and could ruin my whole life. Just the accusation of rape has serious repercussions. What can i do to prove she was consenting, and how can i move forward ? Please help me r/legaladvice	No
