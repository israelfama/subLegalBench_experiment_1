0	I'm trying to get on disability (height is 4'10 with a few mental disorders that have been left untreated, and 27 years old). The only diagnosis that I have are over 10 years old. It feels like I've developed another disorder as I feel like I can't go outdoors and have trouble completing my job because of this. I know that you have to have documentation of your disorders to get on disability but without insurance, I can't readily get up-to-date diagnoses. What is it that you guys recommend?	Yes
1	Hi Reddit,  A friend of mine when to an urgent care clinic today after having an asthma attack. After they gave him some medicine, followed by blood work, they determined his blood potassium level was dangerously low, called an ambulance for him, and sent him to the hospital.  After some time there, the hospital found nothing wrong with him. His potassium was low because the medicine he was given temporarily absorbed some of the potassium, making the levels appear low when they really weren’t. And now he’s stuck with a hospital and ambulance bill for emergency treatment he didn’t need. (He works in foodservice and doesn’t have a lot of money. Idk if he has insurance.)  Could he successfully sue the urgent care clinic for negligence to pay for the hospital visit?	Yes
2	Good evening, and thank you in advance for any advice. -------- TLDR: My wife had a C-Section and the internal sutures ruptured 8 days after discharge. She had no risk factors, and it apparently prompted the hospital to change their policy or procedures with sutures. Lingering physical and emotional issues remain to this day. --------  In April of 2016, my wife gave birth to our second child at an unscheduled but non-emergency c-section at a major hospital in Iowa. Luckily, both my wife and child made it through the Cesarian section just fine and we were discharged from the hospital 2 days later.  8 days after being discharged, my wife was getting ready for a Dr. Appointment for our child and coughed a few times. She felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, and within a few minutes notices a small trickle of blood coming from the Cesarian Section scar. It was very little blood, and we didn't think much of it until we mentioned it to our son's pediatrician. She recommended we get an appointment to the hospital to be safe, and we did so for later that morning. We discovered that the internal sutures for my wife had rupture, and that she had experienced a Fascial Dehiscence. They rushed her into surgery and several hours later she come out the other side alive, but with a serious road to recovery. All told, it took approximately 2 months to fully heal with regular wound packing and a wound vac.  At the time, her OB (who did not perform the C-section due to it being unscheduled) but who performed the corrective surgery mentioned that this was an extremely uncommon experience, especially considering my wife had none of the risk factors. She indicated that the hospital had switched the type of sutures used in the recent past and that they were convening a board of doctors to discuss my wife's case and changes that needed to be made at the hospital to prevent it happening again. Now, a year later, we are finally starting to realize the seriousness of what actally happened. My wife is still now dealing with some lingering physical effects (significant scar tissue causing her lower stomach to bulger) and she has had significant anxiety going back to doctors or being in a hospital.  We never really considered a lawsuit against the hospital until a family friend who is a doctor mentioned it recently. I'm curious if any of the folks here are familiar with medical malpractice and if this is somethng that would be worth pursuing or discussing with an attorney in Iowa. We have since relocated to a new state, and I don't want to spend the mental effort and spike my wife's anxiety again unless it is worth it.	Yes
3	My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	Yes
4	She is on dialysis (no kidney function) and had surgery to remove mass from colon three weeks ago. She was put in a nursing home for about two weeks but after being diagnosed with malnourishment and in such severe pain she was put back in hospital due to an abscess which they drained. She  started having seizures every 20-30 min and has not had any nutrition in 4 days. She is begging for food but from my understanding, they won't even tube feed her until they find what is causing seizures. She is completely bedridden due to being malnourished  but of sound mind. My father just got a call from the doctor asking for her living will. I am worried they will stop all medical help if he gives it to them.  What can we do?	Yes
5	I (25F) will be giving birth to a baby boy who is the offspring of my fiancé (31M) in September. Because we are not legally married yet, I have a few questions/concerns over medical legalities.   Basically, I need to know the steps to take in case of something going wrong during birth. I'm assuming, as the father of my child, he would take over the decision making process for the baby if something were to happen to me. Would he have the same medical power of attorney over me if I were to have to be put in a coma or on a life support machine? Or would MPOA go automatically to my parents? I guess my questions are  -Do I need to file some sort of paperwork in case of an emergency with my life?   -Do I need to have a will or some type of notarized paperwork giving him MPOA over our son?   -Should I just inform my parents of my wishes in case of an emergency?   -Am I overthinking ALL of this?   Any and all advice will be considered. Thank you in advance!	Yes
6	"I'm 50 years old.  After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.  Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.  My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.  Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.  I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.  Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.  Thanks very much for any advice you can give."	Yes
7	Hello I am an Expat living in Germany and am legally unable to work due to illness. My doctor here is willing to certify the disability and work with a doctor in the US to help me with getting the TPD Discharge of my student loans. But I don't know any US doctors and I haven't the slightest clue who I can ask. Does anyone have any recommendations for doctors who would be willing to help me? This doctor would have to be willing to communicate to my GP long distance. He or she does not need to be practicing at the moment, just needs to be licensed to practice in the US. Would appreciate any advice on this. Thx.	Yes
8	Hello everyone I'm in a bit of a bind. I called a doctor's office to set up an appointment in January. I made an appointment and they told me I needed a referral. I told them to cancel the appointment and call me when they received the referral. This was all in the same phone conversation.  Here it is 6 months later and after sending two referrals, they never called. I received this bill last week for $50 for a no show appointment. I cancelled that appointment and even if it was still an active appointment there was no reminder call/text/email which I opted for.  So, I call the office and get an answering service. She directs my call to the office manager who does not answer. Her answering machine clearly stated that of the call was for a no show bill to submit in writing. So these people send out these bills so often that she needed to put that on her message. I left her a message stating who I was, why I was calling, and asked for the address to send this letter to. No call back. I've called several more times and still nothing.  I've really had it with this office. I looked at their review on Google and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue. They have horrible reviews and some very similar to my experience.  So, what is your advice?   Thank you so much!	Yes
9	"Sorry this is going to be a long post. I'm not sure if this is actionable at all but I thought I'd post here and see what people think. I'm a 30 year old male that lives in British Columbia, Canada.  I have been very sick for the past seven years and have officially been diagnosed with an insulinoma. It is a rare pancreatic tumor on the pancreas. This is my story.  In 2010 I started becoming quite ill and went to my family doctor multiple times for a year.  He misdiagnosed me with celiac disease and then after that was ruled out by a specialist, my GP gave up on me.  I decided to take matters into my own hands and in less than an hour of researching online I discovered that I most likely was having multiple hypoglycemic attacks a day.  I went back to him and got several requisitions for blood work checking my glucose levels, and sure enough I was right.  My blood sugars were ranging from 2.7-4.1 mmol/L after meals and throughout the day, which is dangerously low. The most common form of hypoglycemia is reactive hypoglycemia.  The treatment for this is eating healthy and exercising, which I was already doing.  At the time I was a personal trainer studying kinesiology and extremely fit with about 8% body fat.  Because of this my GP ruled out reactive hypoglycemia and his diagnosis was insulinoma, an insulin secreting tumor on my pancreas which made perfect sense to me.  I was then referred to an endocrinologist for further help.  The endo did standard tests to check my liver and kidney function and to make sure I didn't have cancer, and then diagnosed me with reactive hypoglycemia without doing a single blood glucose test.  I had gone to a dietitian at my local hospital who said my diet was perfect.  I even wrote out my diet for the endo but all he said was to eat better. He said there was no way it could be insulinoma but never really gave a reason why. I then took his advice and ate even healthier by almost eliminating all carbs from my diet except for some veggies, and I got immensely worse and my blood glucose was even lower than before.    I tried to go back to the endo but he refused to see me.  I then went to endo #2 for a second opinion.  Endo #2 saw me for 5 minutes and said it was reactive hypoglycemia, but on the off chance it was an insulinoma he told me to do a 12 hour fasting blood glucose test. The test turned out negative. He told me this would rule out insulinoma, but now that i know more about the condition a 12 hour fast has never been given to diagnose insulinoma. Even when it was first discovered in the early 1900's.  There was always a 48hr supervised fast test in a hospital with strict protocols, which turned into a 72hr fast test, and today basically any blood tests with blood glucose under 3.0 and high insulin, c-peptide or pro insulin is enough to diagnose insulinoma.   Shortly after that I tried every healthy diet i could find, and the only thing I found was that the healthier i ate the worse i got. So I preformed an experiment where I only ate junk food.  The diet was less than 30g of protein a day and over 600 grams of fast acting carbs like pizza, mcdonalds, apple pie, soft drinks, candy, pasta and garlic bread.  For the first time in almost 3 years my blood glucose was normal and i felt relief of all my symptoms for two weeks.  However this was not a reasonable diet, I gained over 10 lbs in a short amount of time and still become hypoglycemic when i exercised.  I demanded endo #1 see me again with this new information and he agreed.  I saw him and told him the healthier i ate the worse i got, but the worse i ate the better my blood sugars were, which is consistent with insulinoma.  He admitted that it made absolutely no sense.  I asked him what do we do now, and he said ""i don't know"".  I asked if he could refer me to someone who could help and he said, no. If i wanted another referral for another opinion i would have to go to my GP and ask him.   Upset and confused by this endo, I returned to my GP and asked for another referral to someone new.  He did so, but endo #3 refused to see me saying that he agreed with endo #1 and there was nothing out of the ordinary about my case. I then luckily got referred to a wonderful internist who saw me right away and told me there was no way this is reactive hypoglycemia. He forced endo #3 to see me.  I then saw endo #3 and he explained to me what reactive hypoglycemia was and how i have it.  He said it couldn't be insulinoma because when my blood sugars were 2.7, my insulin levels weren't high enough.  He was wrong on multiple accounts here.  My insulin level was in fact high enough, and even if it weren't he should have tested my c-peptide during a hypoglycemic event to rule out insulinoma.  C-peptide actually gives a more accurate indicator of how much insulin is being released in the body and is crucial in diagnosing insulinomas. So i asked to go to the diabetes clinic to see if they can help me with my diet, since he was so sure it was reactive hypoglycemia.  I went to the clinic and they immediately said this is not reactive hypoglycemia.  They sent a letter to endo #3 telling him that he has to help me figure out what's going on.  So i go back to my internist who spoke with endo #3 and apparently he reluctantly said there may be something else going on here.  So then I was referred to endo #4 in a different city.  Endo #4 saw me and immediately said that there is no way this is reactive hypoglycemia.  She suspected and confirmed insulinoma after having me induce a hypoglycemic attack and having glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels taken. I saw her in 2015, and the test only took one day.   She then sent me to endo #5 in my own city to do the appropriate image testing to locate the tumor.  Endo #5 decided to do a 72hr fast to confirm that i in fact have insulinoma.  I spoke to endo #4 who said this was unnecessary, but if she wanted to have it done then i had to do it. It took 8 months for her to do the test and get the results and she sent me a letter saying i passed the test and nothing was wrong with me.  So either i'm the first person in recorded history with an insulinoma to pass this test, or she did it incorrectly.     So i go back to endo #4 and she tells me, if she doesn't think i have an insulinoma then she thinks im drugging myself.  She told me that's the only way I could be lowering my blood glucose so low.  So I induced a hypo with high insulin and high c-peptide with a negative drug screen.  After that endo #4 and endo #3 agreed i had an insulinoma.  The interesting thing is that for this test, my insulin was actually lower than the test endo #3 used as evidence to say my insulin wasn't high enough.  This makes no sense to me how he says this confirms insulinoma when previously he said that my insulin levels weren't high enough.   So then after all that I have been undergoing imaging studies and other fun tests for the past several months and they have 100% found the tumor in the tail of my pancreas.  I'm currently waiting for a surgery date to have it removed.    I feel very outraged and angry that it has taken 7 years to figure this out, when my GP and I have told them this is what it was 6 years ago.  Over the past 7 years i've barely been able to work.  I had to quit school and stopped being a personal trainer.  In fact when I saw my internist 2 years ago, he told me my blood sugar levels were way too low to function as a normal human being let alone work, and put me on disability for the past 2 years while we figured this out.  I also ended up having blood sugar readings of less than 2.2 mmol/L, which is considered life threatening.  I don't know if this is worth pursuing legally but I've got time to kill until my surgery so i might as well look into it, thanks!"	Yes
10	Hello,  As the title says, I am on my ex (husband's) insurance plan as a dependent. I am not able to get onto a different health insurance plan without cancelling this one. They say that only the primary account holder can have me removed from the plan, but my ex and I are not on speaking terms. Is this legal? Do I really have no say in this? I live in Canada, btw.  Thanks in advance...	Yes
11	My sister is pregnant and she wants to get an abortion. In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.  So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.  Ideally they wouldn't ever know about it but let's assume they figure it out somehow, can I (or her) be in any legal trouble here?	Yes
12	"A couple days ago, my mother went to the doc for a bump in her eye that seemed to be infected. The eye doctor examined it and said everything would be fine if she just rinsed it with warm water for two weeks. However, my mom didn't like this advice as she has been misdiagnosed before (years ago). Upon getting another eye doctor's opinion the next day, her fear was confirmed- the bump on her eye was infected and she needed surgery within 72 hours.  My question is: what can be done from a legal standpoint? I am sure that a complaint to the hospital will just be a slap in the wrist for the first eye doctor and I would hate for the same thing to happen to another person. I believe it to be utter unprofessionalism to say ""wash with warm water and rinse,"" and so I've came here to ask for advice.  Is this medical negligence, malpractice?"	Yes
13	"I am sorry in advance if this is long  3.5 years ago I had some issues where I woke up and wasn't able to move my joints, this was accompanied by large lumps on my legs. I was 24 years old (Female). I was referred to a dermatologist as they thought I had Erythema nodosum. Over a month or so I was doing tons of blood work and seeing this dermatologist anywhere from 1-3 times a week. I was constantly being told it was something else and being put on new medication. During this month I was also referred to a rheumatologist. Rheumatology and dermatology had a big meeting (?) where there were roughly 50 specialists of different levels in a room (I dont know what its called) to discuss my case because it was extremely rare. I was diagnosed with something called ""polyarteritis nodosa"" which is a rare form of vasculitis. My dermatologist called me with great news that they finally new what it was and then prescribed me.. prednisone (a oral steroid). I was given it for 6 weeks. Over this 6 weeks I started experiencing dehydration, frequent urination, some weightloss, extreme fatigue. I made appointments and saw him on numerous occasions because I felt that this should not be happening and something felt very wrong. He assured me it was just side effects and would send me on my way. At the end of the 6 weeks he essentially told me I was good to go and that I shouldn't have any more flare ups. Roughly a week later I started seeing lumps on my legs again and quickly made an appointment. Without questions, blood work, anything, he prescribed me another 6 weeks of prednisone. He told me he absolutely did not want to see me for 6 weeks and to not come back in. I started taking it and within a day or two all the side effects came back.. and they only got worse. I started losing lumps of hair, losing drastic weight and started blacking out. I would leave class ( I was a student at the time) and then wake up on a couch in the hall 4 hours later. I had lost roughly 35 lbs which was essentially all muscle. I am overweight and always have been.. my legs were the size that someones upper arm should be. I started barely being able to walk because my body wanted to collapse. After 3 weeks I made an appointment. The first thing the doctor said to me was ""I said I didn't want to see you for 6 weeks"".  I started crying and told him something was very wrong. Then he said ""I think you have type 2 diabetes because you are so overweight"".  This came from a doctor that ran 15+ blood tests on me months prior. He sent me for blood work that day and I got a call from the emergency room.  My sugar levels were at 29 mmol/L (540mg/dl). I was kept in the hospital that night and had an IV of fluids going through me. The nurse I had was talking to me and was very confused as to why the doctor put me on prednisone. She went and spent some time reviewing my file. She came back and told me that before the steroids my blood sugar levels were completely normal. She told me that in that meeting with all the doctors.. every single doctor recommended he NOT put me on prednisone because of the risk of type 2 diabetes (Due to the fact that im over weight). I am in the process of retrieving all my files from the hospital. I recently moved out of Ontario to Alberta. My diabetes are pretty controlled but this is still something that will effect me for my entire life. I know it has been 3.5 years but at the time I had no energy to think of anything to do with legal, I was also a student. Now that I am in my career and still need to see numerous doctors on a regular basis I am starting to realize how much what he did has effected my life and will continue to do so. I pay for medications that I should have never needed if it wasn't for him. Although being overweight I am and extremely active, healthy person. I always have been. I played soccer for 18 years, basketball for 5. I was a bike messenger riding 60-70km daily before moving to alberta.. this should have never happened. I need to know if it is worth it to go and talk to a lawyer.   Tl;DR  - a doctor gave me a medication against the advice of roughly 50 other doctors that resulted in me developing type 2 diabetes despite me showing all signs of type 2 and him ignoring. Do I go to a lawyer?"	Yes
14	I'm trying to get some advice for my roommates sister, and I only have the basic run down. Her sisters son died from Bacterial Meningitis, and was sick for about 2 weeks before it happened. They were controlling it with Motrin, but his fever got worse and they took him into the ER after a couple days of him not improving. He had a 103 fever upon arrival, and they just told him to keep giving him Motrin and released him. They never ran any further tests finding out that he had that, and the next day he continued to just not really wake up, and continued to look in bad shape. They took him into another hospital the next morning after being released from the ER, and they wound up admitting him and had to put him on life support that same night. 24 hours later, they pronounced him brain dead.   I just don't see any way the ER should NOT have admitted him, and possibly been able to save his life. Would they potentially be on the hook for this?	Yes
15	Problem 1:  My cousin has cancer. It was at one point treatable, but because of her mental health issues she was not able follow the plan established by her doctors. She is now terminally ill. Last week (Wednesday, the 44th day of her stay), we were notified by the hospital  that they planned to discharge her the next day. We were generally not happy with the treatment she received there (they would forget to feed her and administer her medication), but the nursing home she came from was worse, and we had yet to find better alternatives.  The next afternoon (Thursday) they returned her to the nursing home after saying she had consented to leave. She has  schizophrenia,  has not consistently received her medication, and is unable to make these kinds of decisions. I, her power of attorney,  did not discuss her discharge with anyone at the hospital (I was unable to return their call in time), and did not consent to her return to this nursing home. After speaking with my cousin about the incident later, she denies saying she was prepared to leave. Friday, around noon, less than 24 hours after she returned to the nursing home, she was readmitted to a different hospital for breathing problems. She was diagnosed with Pneumonia, and doctors noted spots on her lungs.   We are appalled by the way they have treated her, but aren’t sure who to contact, or what we can do about it. Should we contact the medical board? Do we need a lawyer? What kind of lawyer do we need?  Problem 2:  My cousin has siblings who so far, have not participated in her care, but seem very interested in her assets, and the possibility of acquiring them after her death (she has no children, a nice home, and over $150,000 cash). Though we haven’t mentioned it to her, she has said she suspects they are “only coming around now because they’ve figured out how much money i’ve got”.  One sibling is particularly intent on using her in any way possible. After meeting with her doctor to discuss her prognosis, his first thought was to search her house for life insurance policies. He has asked my husband and I to purchase bonds with her money, and a number of other “small” horrible things.   This weekend we found out that he broke into her house and changed  her locks. We do not know when it happened, or if he took anything, but my cousin says she did not want him in her house, and did not ask him to change her locks. He says he did so because he needed to find her insurance policy. He doesn’t want to be responsible for her funeral expenses after she passes, and didn’t trust me (the power of attorney) or her other sister to go to her home. He claims to be trying to do what’s best for her.   He has also been very adamant that she not return to her house (we’ve considered placing her there with an in-home nurse for her final days). We now believe it is because when he was there he stole something.   I am not sure how to protect her property from him while she is still alive, and I am wondering if I should call the police, and seek a  restraining order.  Thanks for any advice you can provide.	Yes
16	I really need help, please. I don't have insurance and I visited a new doctor May 17 because I have hypothyroidism and needed a new prescription. Upon meeting the doctor (mom as my witness) I explained to him I had surgery years ago and I need a new prescription to balance out my thyroid hormone. I told him I was diagnosed in February. I explained how I had a thyroidectomy and I would need medicine the rest of my life. I also said I just need the proper blood work to determine what MG of Levothyroxine I should take, and a prescription to make it happen. I even wrote all of this on my new patient sheet. I take what I thought was the proper blood test and now I must wait. A few days pass and I get a call from a nurse or receptionist saying my blood work came back normal.. I tell her there is no way seeing that I only had one month of Levothyroxine treatment and before that my levels were dangerously low. She insists I'm fine so I hang up very confused. I call my last doctors office and they also say that is impossible and they must have tested wrong. I call the new doctors office and they tell me I was administered a General blood test. I get a little upset because I specifically told the doctor what I needed and he didn't listen. It cost me about $115 out of my own pockets, no insurance. The nurse goes on to say the thyroid blood test is about $200. I demand the $115 I paid get credited to that, the accountants response is that they already paid the outsourced lab and cannot get the money back. I say it isn't my problem they did that because I told the doctor what I needed and what disease I have and he chose to ignore me. The accountant goes on to say that the doctor doesn't have to listen to me. I wanted to speak to my doctor but the three receptionists and accountant were all I got. I reported this to the Texas Medical Board and they said the doctor referred me to an endocrinologist which is completely false and dishonest. I never spoke to him after the initial appointment, and the nurses or receptionists were insisting I was fine.   Please somebody help me. I don't know what to do at this point. I am untreated and I feel extremely weary, I have no energy because I was left undiagnosed and untreated. I can't help but think of the other people this doctor left untreated, without their knowledge. He must be stopped.	Yes
17	"I had 3 teeth extracted yesterday by a local oral surgeon, and after I got home and the numbness began to wear off, I realized that one of the 3 was not one I had asked them to pull. I had a referral list with x rays from my dentist that reccomended 5 for extraction, but included a note that said ""per patient which ones"". I had opted to only do 3 for now since they were patially broken and painful, was going to ask my dentist about options to save the other 2 since they hadn't been painful. Before they started I was showing the assistant which ones I wanted done, and I opened my mouth and pointed to each one. I explained also that I had no clue which teeth the numbers on the list corresponded to, and my dentist had told me to just show them which ones that they would know the numbers. I thought she seemed to understand which ones I meant, but later I realized they pulled the one in front of one I had asked them to pull. It was on the list, but as I said, I wanted to try to save it. I called the office up, but they were already closed and the best I could do was leave a message with the answering service explaining what happened. What are my options for dealing with this? ""I'm sorry"" clearly won't bring my tooth back, and I'm less interested in money than I am in being able to eat as normally as possible again."	Yes
18	We live in a more remote region of Canada that has a full sized hospital. Our family doctor routinely cancels appointments on us and wait times to see them are upwards of 6-8 weeks. My wife was victim of a massive infection after the birth of our child that was apparently very easily treated had she been seen 3 months after the birth as intended. Her doctor cancelled and rescheduled every 3 months for a full year, causing the infection to grow to the point where she was bleeding for a month straight.  Our doctors have cancelled and rescheduled almost every single appointment we've made for the last 2 years often resulting in wait times of 2-18 months to be seen for potentially time sensitive issues.  I was told to wait 2 months to see my family doctor for surgery follow up while I was actively bleeding from my jewels. Do we have any kind of legal recourse here? We're tired of getting constantly dicked around by the terrible healthcare services here.  Do we have any recourse? Is there anything we can do short of contacting elected representatives who are actively slashing healthcare budgets in our province and likely not to care about this anyways?	Yes
19	"Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.   As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her.   I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked.   When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me.   Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes.   and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record.   There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.  Thank you. TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it."	Yes
20	I live in Washington. I have bipolar disorder and I had a severe manic episode that started around the 20th of June. On June 28th, I bought a 2013 Subaru WRX STI. I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k.    Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership.   I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price). They took the other route and had their lawyer send an email basically just saying there's no 3 day grace period or anything like that in Washington.   I know I'm definitely knee-deep in shit for this, but does anyone have any suggestions? I'm debating just leaving it there and taking the credit hit from a default. I make pretty good money for my age but I don't want to be stuck with those ridiculous payments. Even just seeing the car gives me anxiety and reminds me of all the bad decisions I made during that manic episode.	Yes
21	"I'm a US citizen who lives as an expat in the Czech Republic and have a huge medical bill in Colorado that I cannot afford to pay, and now debt collectors keep sending my brother notices (I have my US mail sent to him).  Some background: I was visiting family after spending a year in Vietnam and got very sick two days before flying to Europe. I thought it might be a parasite (I previously had one in Vietnam) and was informed by a nurse hotline that only an ER can check for parasites on this short of notice.   So I went to the ER and they gave me an IV drip, did blood work and stool sample, and gave me some meds. They would not give me any sort of figure for how much all of this would cost, not even ballpark. They just said ""it varies"". They were pushing to do a stomach ultrasound and I refused because it sounded expensive. They were very unsympathetic to the fact that I had no US health insurance and that I'd be paying out of pocket.  Now I have a bill for over $5000 that I can't pay. I don't even have any assets worth that much money.  I don't live in the US anymore, although I visit about every two years. What's my best option here? What sort of legal action are they able to take? Do debt collectors do payment plans? Are they able to go after my brother?"	Yes
22	I had a very, very bad experience with a dental  surgery the other day. Woke up during surgery, surgeon held me down and finished procedure with me wide awake, no pain meds, and left the room. No other interaction with him afterward. Is this information I'm allowed to share in an online review of the dental practice?	Yes
23	I was at a friend's party when the deck collapsed and I along with 2 others had to be taken to the hospital. My injuries are a severe scalp laceration on my forehead and up through my hair line. Another girl broke her back.   The house was a rental and from what I know they had the deck looked at/repaired twice. What is my best course of action?	Yes
24	"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	Yes
25	The police emergency detained me because they believed I was suicidal. I was in my car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazards on as I was crying and couldn't drive with blurred vision. They took it upon themselves to assume I was suicidal even though I made no indication of it, have no history of mental illness or even a police record.  I was forced into the back of a police cruiser, taken to the ER against my will, and they tried to charge me $2400. I negotiated it down to ~$650 and left. The doctor cleared me after talking to me for 5 minutes because he knew I should not have been detained for anything. I did not even have to see a psychiatrist as the police earlier said.  I'm not sure if there is anything I can do, but I was hoping to find some advice.     TLDR: Police detained me wrongfully, forced me to go to ER, and I am stuck with the bill now.	Yes
26	Husband had been ill for a few weeks and went to see Dr. Did chest X-ray and confirmed pneumonia-prescribed one week round of antibiotics. Husband went back in 2 weeks later for follow up, not any better. Dr did not repeat X-ray, blood work was abnormal so he was sent for ultrasounds of thyroid and kidneys. Doc never followed up on anything - actually he has never called ever. Husband called and made another appt - still feeling ill and coughing up horrible stuff and wanted to go over ultrasound and repeat blood work results. Came into office coughing up foul smelling phlegm. Repeated chest X-ray and was sent to hospital. Received antibiotics in hospital and was told he would have surgery. Was in hospital for 36 hours-no surgery. Dr came in and husband confronted him about his care and how he felt that he had been ignored. Dr admitted husband was patient profiled as a drug user by appearance. (Husband had lost 15 lbs before he saw dr and told him of weight loss, then lost an additional 10 before last appt. He had also lost a tooth in his 20s due to trauma.) Husband was transferred to another hospital on request. Underwent 4 hour surgery for empyema and then sent to icu. We are still in the hospital.  This all happened in Texas.	Yes
27	I'm not entirely sure if this is a fixable problem, but any advice would be much appreciated!  I had a baby three weeks ago, and we found out that there is something in our apartment that makes it hard for him to breathe. We tried everything: cleaning, laundry, air purifiers, humidifiers, etc. think it's smoke from another apartment, but don't know how to prove it. My husband and I have been staying with the baby at my parents' house for a few days, and he hasn't had any trouble breathing. We took him back to the apartment for a few hours last night, and he started to have trouble breathing again. Whatever is bothering him, it was on all of the clothes we brought back with us until we washed them.   Would it be possible to break our lease without penalty, if we can't live there? We need to find somewhere else to live, but that's not an option if we're stuck paying for this apartment. Our lease isn't up until December, and I can't seem to find anything definitive about options for breaking it. It looks like the management needs to make a good effort to lease out the apartment, if we say we don't want to stay, but I don't know how that will work out.  Thank you so much for your help and advice!	Yes
28	While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell.   I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home.   My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with. While I was at the ER, I told them it was a work related incident and to contact my employer. I received a bill for a little over $500 and promptly handed it to my general manager. I have now received another for a lowered amount, $267. When I received the bill for $267, I sent it to my employer with a note asking what we needed to do to take care of this and haven't heard anything.   I no longer work there because I accepted a position for an internship in another city. What legal obligation do I have to pay the remainder? I don't want it to go to collections, but I don't feel responsible for paying it, either. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have gone to the ER at all. What is the best course of action?  TD;LR: got Tilex in eyes at work, boss sent me to ER, stuck with bill.	Yes
29	"**Backstory** My wife and I went to visit a friend in Roatan, Honduras in April.  I had to be taken to the emergency room for food poisoning.  While I was getting my stomach pumped, my wife was dealing with the paperwork.  They initially told her it would be $250.  After they saw that we had insurance it got bumped to a $500 ""deposit"",  and as we were ready to head out it turned into an $800 ""deposit"". At that point we were starting to get angry and told them to just charge us whatever the costs were.  We weren't just going to leave them money without seeing an invoice of the charges.  They refused to provide one.     The dude had copies on his desk of my Driver's License and Insurance card.  So I grabbed them while he went and talked to his ""manager"".  When he came back we told him that we didn't want to use insurance and just charge us whatever the costs were.  My wife, being the great fighter that she is, got the ""deposit"" down to $500, cuz they kept on saying that they didn't know how much.  So we paid the ""deposit"" and I left them a copy of my driver's license and my email address.    I don't want to scam these people, they might have saved my life, but I just wanted them to charge me for the services rendered.  **Now** Yesterday, almost 90 days out, I receive an email with the invoice of $5,000.  We spoke to our friend in Honduras and he says these charges are outrageous.  The invoice came from an American company.    My question for a lawyer would be, is there a ""statute of limitations"" on this sort of thing?  Is there anything they can do to me legally?  All they have is my driver's license with an out of date address.    Thanks in advance."	Yes
30	Last year i went into the hospital and was misdiagnosed with the stomach flu, i went home and a week later ended up taking myself back to the emergency room after my appendix ruptured. I ended up needing emergency surgery after the drains didn't work and spent three weeks as an inpatient. I had to drop out of school for the semester and am still having problems. is this worth a law suit? or even a consultation?	Yes
31	"(suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.  At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.  I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was ""I'll talk to you when I get back"" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule.   Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there.   This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting.   But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying ""I'm too sick to work"" contradicts ""The way you run this place is inhospitable for me"".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there.   What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?"	Yes
32	My girlfriend with a mental condition (schizophrenia) has a friend who constantly makes her feel bad until she sends a sexually explicit image to her. If she doesn't respond to him (he lives in New York) then he berates her and curses at her.    This past day there were over 45 missed calls from him while we were spending time together. I didn't know she was doing this until she told me he was yelling again because she hadn't answered today, and I finally snapped and called him out on it. He eluded to having the images which led to my learning she had been doing this, and then spoke of how he got annoyed and mad at how she didn't send these images so he got mad. Today was the first day I learned of this. Once she learned I knew about what she did for him she cut herself so deeply she was in the ER and the other guy was unapologetic at his actions. I'm not sure if this has any legal grounds. Would it be helpful to call the police and report this? We are both 20 so are rather inexperienced. Apologies if this is written badly. I'm a mess.	Yes
33	Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	Yes
34	I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	Yes
35	"Hey guys, I'm kind of freaking out cause it looks like my eyes will never get to be 20/20 and I'm out $4000+ due to my current situation..  This kind of a long drawn out process, so I’ll just put everything in bullet form in chronological order:  •	December 2016: LASIK (using Contura laser) performed by doctor A. Result is ok, no longer have to use glasses, but not even close to 20/20.  •	March 2017: Go in for a check up and doctor A suggests an “enhancement” surgery  •	March 2017: Enhancement performed  •	June 2017: Go in for another check up, vision still not improving, doctor A suggests another enhancement.  •	June 2017: Wary of third surgery in the span of 7 months, I ask doctor A for medical records so I can get a second opinion.  •	June 2017: Get a second opinion for doctor B. He says my cornea has now become too thin for any more surgeries. He says that doctor A over corrected my astigmatism during my first surgery, then tried to correct the over-correction during my enhancements, which did not work.   •	June 2017: Share with doctor A what doctor B told me and recorded the conversation with his consent. Doctor A said that doctor B doesn’t know how to read the provided medical records because doctor A is using the “Contura” laser which doctor B is not familiar or had training with. **With ultimate confidence, he went on to say that with one more enhancement, my eyes will be 20/20 and will not require any more enhancements for the rest of my life.**  •	July 2017: Get a different second opinion from doctor C. The doctor echoes the opinion of doctor B and further went on to say that my cornea could be unstable at this very moment due to the two procedures. She said that due to my cornea thinness, there cannot be any more work done on my eyes now and for the rest of my life. Off the record, she went on to say that doctor A has a reputation in the community to perform reckless procedures and that the claims that he's making about how other doctors can't read his ""Contura"" laser is all ""bullshit"" because she has part of the Contura training as well.  At this point, I have lost all trust in doctor A and don’t think I’m going to not share any more information that I’ve gathered. I am definitely considering moving forward with legal action. Do I have a case? What do you guys suggest I do? Do you guys have any recommendations for a lawyer that can handle this kind of case in San Diego?  Thank you!"	Yes
36	My spouse is currently in the psych ward on voluntary status. A nurse who is caring for them has repetatedly verbally abused them. We made a report to an outside party who has informed the director of nursing at the hospital.   The nursing director informed the nurse who was the abuser of the report and who made it. Is that legal? We are afraid of retaliation by the nurse  as they were not sent home or repremanded in any way.  Is that legal? I thought reports were to remain anonymous.	Yes
37	My daughter was refered by her dentist to another dentist to see if a very small cavity needed to be filled and to consult about possibly getting veneers. She is 17. She went back and was gone for 2 hours. The receptionist blew off my requests for information about what was going on multiple times. When they brought her out she looked like hell. They had done an unauthorized root canal on her. I am pissed off. My daughter now has a giant silver molar that was put into place without asking. What do i do here?	Yes
38	Hey everyone. I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'm not sure how to proceed. My mother is seriously mentally ill and has been refusing treatment for as long as I can remember. I beg her to get help because at this point she's extremely paranoid, terrified of touching things (germ situation), repeats herself 100x times, and has pulled out all her hair, and sadly, there's even more :( I've tried pretty much everything, but she's ALWAYS been this way. It even had a huge effect on my upbringing and due to that I have CPTSD. She once tried to burn me alive as an infant, and would regularly slam my head into concrete and the tub for things as simple as knocking over my juicebox. I'm afraid that at the rate she's going, she's just going to crash and burn... hard. I have a 16 year old sister too, and I fear that if my mom really gets out of hand, we'll be evicted. She honestly screams 24/7 so I'm not even sure how we haven't gotten kicked out. Due to my cptsd and a slew of other conditions, I'm disabled and can only work a job from home, but that's not enough for me to move my sister and myself out... I was wondering if there was any way the section 8 could be transferred to me or my sister, as my mother isn't stable or responsible enough for this kind of thing and always submits their paperwork MONTHS late. It's like she's trying to go out of her way to get us kicked out. Anyway, I'd like to keep my little sister safe, more importantly. Is there any way we could protect ourselves and our housing as my mother continues to self destruct ??  Thank you, and sorry for the essay... It's just been a LOT :/	Yes
39	Hey everyone~ using a throwaway account for this. Please let me know if this is the right place to post or if there's a similar post I may reference.   So I became disabled recently (off the clock) and found out I'll need surgery which would leave me immobile for the next 2-3 months, and won't return to an active lifestyle for another 8 months. Because my job is high physical activity I am in the process of claiming disability and my employer has been extremely helpful. Since I also live in a walk-up in an urban area I can't access my apartment safely without supervision so I decided to stay with my mom in a different state until I can have the surgery.   The problem is I didn't have insurance at the time of the disability so I've been having to pay out of pocket for MRI/X ray and Doctors visits to make sure I would really need surgery, out of the state I live in. My insurance kicks in next month so I'll have to wait until then to get the surgery, unless I want to pay over 10k out of pocket. I can't yet make an appointment for the surgery because I'm not insured yet, even though I will be at the time of the appointment. I get it, it's a legal issue. There are a lot of 'should haves' in this scenario and I am to blame for why this is spiraling. I'm gaining back control of the situation but it's going to be a longer process now. However, this is not where my issue is.  I went to urgent care and paid out of pocket so I could get referred for an MRI and specialist. Okay. Did that. When I saw the specialist I asked specifically if I would be able to work and how long would it be. He said absolutely not and that it would take up to 8 months to recover, post-op, back to my high activity level. My employer then suggested I file for disability. When I spoke to the office again they said they wouldn't fill out my claim because I'm not getting the surgery with them and that it could be a legal issue, however when I pressed them on why they didn't really give me a lot of information. When I spoke with my employer's insurance company they said they just needed the word on whether I could work or not, and that the surgery dates could be figured out later.   Then, I tried going to the urgent care to see if that first Doctor could fill out my disability form (since he was the one who referred me and scheduled the MRI etc). His receptionist said that it would take up to 2-3 visits, possibly more to get the claim filled out ($150 per visit!). It's literally one sheet of paper asking if I can work. That's it. The MRI is proof enough I can't and I have my medical forms from the hospital. When I asked why she wouldn't give me an explanation, all she said was it would take time to fill out the paperwork (but doesn't know exactly how much time) and that we could see a specialist if I needed it that badly. I am at a loss. I'm in the process of finding my own specialist and surgeon in my state and that's become a wholly different issue otherwise I could've had that provider help (and will if none of this gets figured out but time is a factor with paperwork) ...  Can the hospital refuse to sign the disability papers because I'm not having the surgery with them even though they told me I will absolutely need surgery and won't be able to work?  Can the urgent care doctor ask for an unknown amount of medical visits just to fill out one piece of paper? I feel like I'm being price gouged.  I know this is my fault, yes I should've had insurance and yes I should've seen a doctor in my state immediately to start the process of finding a specialist. I really did not think my injury was  going to need surgery at the time and thought I could just heal my way out of it. I'm learning a hard lesson this month and paying out of pocket for it. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you	Yes
40	I am having a hell of a time trying to find out if this is legal or not.   Does anyone know if a doctors lawyer/legal advisor is allowed to be present in the exam room with the patient, while the doctor and patient discuss the patients medical information/diagnosis, without the patient being aware of or introduced to the lawyer? In California.  In what situation would a doctor do this?   To me it screams guilt/liability but this isn't exactly something that happens frequently so I am unsure. Especially when the patient is unaware of any serious medical issue that the doctor might be liable for.	Yes
41	"Hi Reddit Lawyers. I need some advice on my case. Backstory:  April 2016- I injured my hamate bone, fracturing the hook. I did not know this until May, when pain persisted and I went to an Ortho. I had X-rays and an MRI to confirm the fracture. My ortho elected to wait for the bone to heal. Fast forward to July. Still have pain, went back to the same ortho but with a hand specialist. He also had me wait and did not perform an excision. By August, the pain was still there and I would not heal. After X-rays and a CT, we decided to excise the hamate hook. (I was told I could immediately get back to sports and life as soon as the incision healed, but that story kept changing as I followed up the procedure and had pain. Being told I could participate quickly is something for another time).  After waiting a few months with no activity, my wrist was feeling ""better."" I was not having the same pain. On July 3rd, the same pain came back. After X-rays, MRI, and CT, it was shown that my hamate hook was still there. Only half was removed. The same fracture site existed with only the tip missing in the images. I went to a new ortho and recently had the rest removed.   The standard of care for this injury is to excise the hook immediately based on my research. Non union rates of the fracture are as high as 90%. My new ortho also said that they do not even talk about letting it heal, that went out of date 20 years ago. The go to is excision. This is also coupled with the fact that the surgeon stated he removed the entire hook in the op report. He ""completely"" removed it and said he examined the fracture site- something not possible because the original fracture was still there. Apparently, all he did was cut the tip of the bone off. This, obviously, caused me to have a follow up procedure to fix that issue.  So I had to wait in pain and not continue my life, which was wrong to begin with, and my surgery was incorrectly performed. I spoke with a lawyer and was basically told my case isn't big enough for his firm. I plan on getting a second opinion. I would like to know what you guys think. If I can't find representation, should I send a letter to the original ortho? I would include what happened, what had to be done, the images from the CTs clearly showing the hook still there. Maybe compensation? What should I do? Thanks in advance!"	Yes
42	I lived in and worked as an RA in a very old building when I was at university. There's one very uneven staircase and one day I fell from the top of it, hit my head, and fell down the rest of the staircase. I had all of the normal concussions symptoms and was diagnosed with one.   I haven't really been the same since then. I've always had bad headaches on a daily basis but I starts sleeping poorly and had more really bad headaches after this. About a year after this happened I basically had a migraine for three months, had to stop school, and developed an eye droop.   No one could figure out what was the matter, I had scans, blood work, etc. They still couldn't figure it out so said it was likely complications from severe headaches for too long. I was put on pills and Botox injections.   A few months after that I began having neurological problems, confusion, memory problems, my handwriting got really small, and I had to stop university for the second time. Once again nothing could be figured out. I had more MRIs and even a spinal tap and nothing was found. Thy said it may have partially been a complication from one of the headache drugs.   I live in pain everyday. I take pills at breakfast, supper and night, I'm just now attempting to finish the degree o should have over a year ago. My life has changed completely. Even though I'm in Canada the medication still costs a lot. I don't get to be young anymore.  A disability lawyer said I might have a case and I'm not sure if it's something I should pursue.	Yes
43	Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
44	My Grandmother is 66 years old and started cataracts surgery June 1st.  They do one eye, wait 2 weeks, than do the other eye.  With this surgery you also get to choose the type of lens you want, and what distance you'd like to see best - near, intermediate, or far. You can choose other options as well, including having a different power in each eye. But she chose to see better near for both eyes.   Both surgeries themselves went fine, no problems. The problem is that now she has one eye that sees up close and one eye that sees far.   We had many follow-ups with the eye doctor - not the surgeon - Who was surprised on the last visit the difference he saw between the eyes and said he was seeing something not the norm but he wanted to wait a few more weeks to make a definitive conclusion as this surgery can take a period of adjustment.   The problem persists, is pronounced, and we believe is past the time adjustment period and seems to have settled. We have the final follow-up appointment next week but we wanted to know beforehand that if the eye exam follow up does conclude that further correction is needed if we need to pay more for that, if we have legal recourse, and/or what we should make sure to do/get/ask.	Yes
45	"(I understand this is a very complicated subject and it would be impossible to give me any straight answers here.  I'm mostly just looking for insight.  I'm going through a very scary/stressful period and I don't know whether a consultation would even be worth the energy at this point.  Any input at all is appreciated.)  Male  30 years old  So in 2015 I was diagnosed with a severe migraine variant that involves daily episodes of head pain and neurological deficit.  No fun.  This involved a great deal of emergent investigation and consultation with several specialists.  The problem isn't life threatening but it does carry some risk-factors and it's recommended that I keep a close eye on it.  Fast forward a couple years and I move to a new town.  Migraines aren't doing so hot so I set up a new patient appointment with my current provider (a Physician's Assistant).  I bring in detailed documentation of my case and we discuss my problem at length.  I watch her (presumably) enter all of this information into her computer.  At the time she seemed pretty on top of things, referred me to a new neurologist, got some bloodwork set up.  I felt like I was in good hands.  Fast forward to the present day and things are not going very well.  I am having severe issues with my neck and the neurological component of my migraines has become frighteningly pronounced.  My neurologist is booked for the month so last week I report to her office to discuss what's happening.  We decide to order a set of MRIs.  A number of things about the visit strike me as very odd/unprofessional/concerning:  - ""Wait what neurological symptoms?""  She forgot about them.  This was essentially the entire focus of my first visit.  I had given her a printed out description of exactly how my migraine auras present and we had discussed at length how important it is to monitor these because they can mimic some very dangerous things.  She kept this printout.  I checked my records after the visit and it seems none of those things had ever been recorded.  - She insisted the weakness/numbness on the right side of my body was due to a pinched nerve in my neck.  This is despite three different neurologists previously diagnosing these symptoms as brain-related, either migrainous or epileptic in nature.  I explained this to her, which she completely disregarded when placing the MRI order explained below.  - She forgot I have blood pressure issues.  - She prescribed me a muscle relaxer which the pharmacist later told me interacts with one of my other medications.  - She said she wanted a good look at the soft tissues in my neck, but ordered a spinal MRI.  I thought this sounded wrong so I checked with the imaging center when scheduling my appointment.  Wrong indeed.  I had to call her and have the order revised.  - Upon arrival at the imaging center, a confused looking receptionist told me my provider had called at the last minute and changed the order again.  I was never contacted about this.  - When ordering an MRI, the doctor/PA notes the patient's current problem so the radiologist knows what to look for.  For my Brain MRI, the order reads ""Migraine without Aura"".  I've been diagnosed with Migraine *with* Aura for 2 years.  This was established at my first appointment.  It's rather important, because frequent migraine auras can actually leave behind lesions detectable on MRIs.  No mention of the extremely complicated, localized neurological deficits I have such a detailed history of.  - Likewise, my Neck MRI order fails to mention the severe pain I've been having in the front left side of my neck, which was presumably the entire reason we were getting it done.  Instead it only mentions the numbness/weakness in my arm which (again) already has an established brain origin.  I got the MRI on Tuesday.  The imaging center said it would take up to 48 hours for the scans to be read, and then my doctor would call me to let me know what's next.  Friday rolls around and I still haven't heard anything, so I drive over to the imaging center and pick up the reports myself.  They tell me the reports were finished on *Wednesday morning* and I must have missed the call from my doctor.  I triple checked.  I'm signed up to receive multiple forms of contact.  No emails or portal messages or anything.  There are even some abnormalities noted on the report, which I thought typically meant the patient was contacted as soon as the information had become available.  Funny thing about the MRI report, it came back noting I had ""right sided neck pain"".  My pain is on the left.  I don't know who's fault that is.  It's like they're throwing darts at a board.  So now I have these reports that I have to second-guess because my provider gave the radiologist shoddy/incomplete information about my case.  I'm taking drugs that interact with each other because it's the only solution I've been offered.  The diagnosis I spent over $10,000 resolving in 2015 is now being changed by someone who isn't even technically a doctor.  I know I haven't been physically injured by anyone, but does any of this sound like malpractice?  I don't even like the idea of suing anyone, but this illness has caused me a great deal of disability and I am now looking at a situation where I may have wasted almost two thousand dollars on scans that need to be re-done because somebody else didn't do their job.  Sorry for the length of this post I'm just very wound up about the whole thing and have no idea how much of this I should consider acceptable or how I should proceed with handling it.  Thanks in advance."	Yes
46	My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	Yes
47	My mother had a heart attack in March and she's been in two different hospitals since then. The first hospital released her to the second with an idea that when she recovers there, she'll go to another rehab facility. She has not recovered and the issues are still going on. (For context, she was told she should have triple bypass surgery which I agreed to.).   I'm not sure what to do legally or personally at all. We have a house and I own a condo. Another hospital that wants to take her for rehab wants her on Medicaid, but she can't get on it because she has assets that go beyond the requirement. I also don't have access to all the financials in any case because I can't get my mother in her current condition, to sign a power of attorney.   Again, I'm not sure what to do.	Yes
48	I am not from America so I apologize for my bad English. I used google translator  The other day I was in the pharmacy picking up my painkillers, and in the box says how many to take, but I took the biggest route and now I'm out of pills and I can not get high, and I feel very sick. Is there any way I can sue the pharmacy? Also, my province is Michoacán	Yes
49	This is gonna be a long one, feel free to skip to the TL;DR.  I don't know where to turn with this, so I'm trying here. I'm a woman in my thirties living in Norway with mental health problems. I've been trying to seek help for the past six months with several rejections and I wonder if anyone can tell me if there is something I can do to get help here.  In November 2013 I tried to commit suicide. For 1.5 years after that I received one-on-one therapy sessions where I was diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder. The therapy was concluded in July 2015 because the therapist felt we had gotten as far as we were going to get in my current situation. I was put into group therapy in late October the same year and while I tried my best for 6 weeks I ultimately failed at completing the 'course'.   Since then I was in a work placement program for approximately 1 year. I started struggling with attendance after about 6 months and after several bouts of depression and suicidal tendencies I was committed to a clinic in January 2017 and concluded from the work placement.  I was in the clinic for a total of 10 days. The first therapist I spoke to at the hospital I was at first talked about thinking I would benefit from trauma therapy. It was also mentioned that I could get assistance at home to help me keep things neat and tidy as I find myself unable to keep on top of housework myself. Once I was transferred to a clinic all that was talked about was me returning to work placement. I was concluded there once I was released from the clinic, so that never happened. The psychiatrist at the clinic referred me to an in-house program where you're in the clinic for 6 weeks receiving cognitive treatment, going home in the weekends.  I never received any follow-up calls or check ups from the clinic after being discharged. I was rejected from the in-house treatment because they felt I needed more individual therapy and further progress.  Since I was discharged, my GP/doctor has been helping me send referrals to various psychiatric institutions. I was rejected from the district psychiatric clinic (DPS) in both Indre Østfold and Akershus based on something my former therapist wrote in my file: that I would likely not benefit from further treatment.   Two private psychiatrists have also been attempted but have received either rejection or no response.   Two years have passed since I was in active treatment and my psyche is in a much worse state than it was after 1.5 years of steady treatment. I've gone through painful things and continue to go through painful mental things that I need help to handle. I am desperate for a therapist to talk to, to help set my head straight. At this stage I'm in such a deep depression that I barely can get out of bed. Nothing is enjoyable. I go through the day only so that I can sleep again. Sleep is the only peace I know.   Now, my question is whether there is anything I can do to make that statement either stricken from my record or asked to be disregarded? This one thing seems to keep me from getting the help I seriously need and I'm just really terrified of my future if this continues. Is there ANYTHING I can do to get help based on only my current situation? Is it legally sound to reject my referrals based on a two year old assessment?    TL;DR: I struggle with mental health issues including depression and recurring suicidal thoughts. A former shrink has written in my records that she doesn't think I will benefit from more treatment and now I'm being rejected for treatment everywhere I turn. What can I do?	Yes
50	Hello - over the last few years, I noticed my skin had been getting progressive worse like I'm really allergic to something.  I've documented the deterioration of my skin the whole time at my doctor's behest.  Over the last two years, I've worked with my doctors to try everything possible - from steroids to light therapy to daily injections.  Nothing worked.  My doctor began to wonder if it was an environmental issue and encouraged me to stay away from my old, musty office for two weeks and see what happens - lo and behold, my skin turned almost back to normal for the first time in years.    I came back to my boss and talked to her about options for me to continue working - I offered telecommuting, working in another office across the street and coming in for meetings, etc.  She refused to work with me on anything.  I'm now taking medical leave.  What options do I have?	Yes
51	I am a young expat having a US insurance in a country where insurance is mandatory for every resident.  My insurance declined my doctor's request for a treatment for a recently diagnosed life-long debilitating disease.  It simply said that based on the medical evidence provided, the insurance was refusing. No explanation was given.  Basically, my question, what happens from then on?	Yes
52	Went to a court hearing, where it was vital that the doctor send the medical records to prove my case, but the clinic sends a blank disc to the court.  I was give the blank disc from the court that day.  I was told in court that because the disc was blank with no records on it that I was going to lose my case in court that day. I was to recover no reward for my case.  So the doctor or the clinic messed me out of thousands.  No justice for me at that time.  Well I haven't given up hope that I will fix this.	Yes
53	After a routine cleaning with a dentist they informed me that I need five fillings in my mouth. I come in a week or so later and get the fillings done.  PRIOR to the fillings I felt absolutely no discomfort or pain in my mouth. AFTER the fillings my mouth is in constant extreme pain and several Advils a day barely mitigate the pain.  I believe this dentist did something to mess up my mouth and I was wondering if there is anything I can do in the form of legal action against her. This is the state of Illinois.	Yes
54	Hello,  I was terminated from my job on April 24th this year.  I knew my health insurance was good through June 1st in which case I used it.  Since then, I thought my family was uninsured while I wait for benefits from my new job but I've received an updated insurance card from a new insurance company (Aetna switched to United Health Care) and my wife called them and they did, in fact, say that all of my benefits are active.  I have also never received any termination paperwork or COBRA information in the mail to this day.  My question is can I still use these benefits even though I think the company has no idea that they are paying for them?  (They are an extremely unorganized company with nobody looking over financial matters, so I think I may be slipping through the cracks.)	Yes
55	Asking if I have any legal leverage being you know a minor. It's a bit of a complicated situation I don't want to go too too deep in to it but long story short I think the meds are unnecessary and potentially harmful.	Yes
56	I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back. Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this. After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time. By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything. I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts. Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?	Yes
57	As stated I'm having to go in tomorrow at 5 am for an emergency procedure. I had today off, and just left the doctors where I found out. I haven't told my job yet. I'm a front office manager at a hotel.   Normally I wouldn't be too worried, but I'm concerned due to the fact we've just gotten a new general manager, who for lack of better words is a complete idiot. He can't do ANYTHING by himself. He's only been at our property for less than a week. No one on the property really knows how to do what I do on a daily basis. This is what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned since I will be out for a minimum of two weeks- they will replace me. Especially seeing as this is going to make everyone's lives really difficult.  How should I handle this situation with my employer and do I have any rights? All our handbook states is if you require more than three days off you need a doctors note.	Yes
58	I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.  First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying. I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.  I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.  As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.  Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.  **TL;DR, sick, boss doesn't believe me, what do?**	Yes
59	"I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.    My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?  What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?"	Yes
60	I don't think she has a case but now that's she's of more sound mind she's annoyed she was fired because of a hospital visit related to her PTSD.  Basically she was a contract employee for a company when she had an issue that ended up with her in the hospital.  They held her for 4 days but couldn't find a bed for her in a ward better suited for her so eventually released her to my care.  (Ultimately a mistake because she ended up in the hospital again for worse symptoms for a whole two weeks but I digress).    I never contacted her work during those 4 days, I honestly didn't even think of it, I was spending those 4 days sitting in a chair in her hospital room. Upon her release I do contact them and let them know what happened, she still wasn't really in the shape to talk to them but since her job was basically ticket assigning and chat moderation she agreed to go back to work right away since it was simple and done from home at that time anyway. They ask for a picture of her release paper work showing the days spent in the hospital and leave it at that.  I let her know she said she'd handle it, sent them a picture and that was the end of it for a few hours.  A few hours later they contact us saying she sent a picture of the wrong thing, I look and curse myself for not double checking her because in her addled state she did send the wrong thing.  She sent the picture of the paperwork that basically just said they set her up with an appointment with her normal doctor to follow up about the issues with her PTSD and the hospital stay.  I grab her normal paperwork and see that since she transferred hospitals at some point they only had the 2 days at the second hospital listed not the first two.  So we head out to the original hospital and get the paperwork showing all the days she spent.  I'm sitting at the gas station outside our house when we get a call from the contracting company and are told that they have ended her contract and she doesn't have a job anymore.  They do kind of have a history of this.  Two or three months prior to this another coworker of hers who was actually employee there for over 4 years had their contract ended the day after it was revealed she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  I don't think she has much of a case because I don't think contract employees have much at all in the way of rights.  Also they didn't actually know she had PTSD the only thing that told them was the paperwork she accidentally sent them, she never told them herself at any point.  Either way I said I would ask.	Yes
61	Hi,  My wife's employer pays for her health insurance. About a month ago, she had a routine doctors appointment. The doctor refused to see her since the insurance was terminated, unless she paid out of pocket. This also delayed her month prescription of medicine. Now she has a sudden sever pain in her neck, and she called her insurance to see what urgent care she should go to. They informed her that her policy was terminated again. This is very frustrating. Is this a legal or employment board issue? Someone told her to just go to the urgent care and send the bill to her boss. I think that is a bad idea.   Her employer has never announced to the overall company that there has been nonpayment of the insurance premiums. For all we know, they have failed to make payments on time other months as well. My big concern is what if she was in a serious accident or had a sudden illness. We could be liable for all the charges and he full bill if that were to happen.   Any advice?	Yes
62	My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes
63	Not sure if this is the right thread, off sick due to a very personal issue because of stress (no I'm not bluffing it's real), I originally wanted to go back to work however my GP advised me not to. Now I am undertaking therapy and don't think I am ready for work but knowing the nature of my company they will do everything to get me back. What rights do I have? Can a OH Nurse overturn the sick note?	Yes
64	My girlfriends son is almost 2 years old. A few weeks ago he hurt his leg, and she took him the very next day to an urgent care facility. They did X-rays and stated a sprain. A week later he was still showing pain and swelling so she took him to another imaging facility who also stated sprain after additional X-ray. Today she is at Vanderbuilt with him and the doctora there are saying a fracture.  Is there any action that can be taken against the first two facilities?	Yes
65	My girlfriend and I went to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico this past week. Went great, until I ate something bad and came down with severe fever, chills, pain, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Worst infection of my life. I ended up needing medical transport and was hospitalized for 3 days, where they pushed all sorts of drugs and antibiotics. Ultrasound revealed my colon was super inflamed, and I had a condition called gastroenteritis. The hospital stay cost $16,000.  We contacted the resort, asking for a refund. We know for a fact it was something that I ate from there that made me sick, since we didn't leave the resort at any time. If they refuse, do we have legal grounds to sue?	Yes
66	My kids (9 and 8) are doing a dermatology study on a cream of some sort. When the dr approached us we were told they would each receive $650 for about 16 weeks of study, using meds and getting blood drawn. We discussed this with them and they wanted to do it. Upon signing the paperwork we noticed that it said the payment would be $500 for each. My wife talked to the Drs tech about it and she was assured that the payment was $650 and that it would be changed. Fast forward until now and we are being told it is actually only $500 and that we signed for that amount. Drs office isn't willing to do anything about it. Do I have any legal action I can take or are my kids just screwed for trusting them the staff in the beginning?	Yes
67	"I am a 27 year old and have been on the ""Healthy Michigan Plan"" through Michigan medicaid due to being a graduate student with no income.  Back in February I received a one-time inheritance payment of $26,000 which would bump me over the limit for 133% of the federal poverty level which is the designated level for benefits eligibility.  My negligence to report the ""income"" change within 10 days indicates that I may be responsible for overpayments by medicaid.  I had been confused about whether the inheritance counted as income and would be treated as such by medicaid.  I did some research and am unsure as to whether the income reporting is annually or monthly.  Since that one time payment, my income has returned to zero. What are my options at this point?  I have used medical services since that time using my medicaid insurance. Will reporting the income now start a shit storm that will require legal counsel?"	Yes
68	So about 4 days ago my first born was well, born. He was born at home with no health issues although mama had to go to the hospital for a hematoma that was ironed out in no time. After we got home we both had been up at this point for about 40+ hours and were exhausted. He had passed his 24 hour visit with no issues and we were just about ready for bed when my SO asked if his hands were blue. I had told her they looked red if maybe a teensy bit blue and we decided to go to the ER for our new parental Paranoia, after telling them this they brought him to the NICU and said they needed blood, some pee and a 48 hour watch. Obviously we didn't want to but we waited the 48 and as we were relaxing my SO was holding the baby in the chair and he had been angled funny and lost his breath from his head being against the his chest. The doctor knew this but it was shift change so she communicated it to our new doctor, he says 5 more days are necessary even though my baby has been told he's healthy, a good eater, and clean of any infections. Do we really have to wait the 5 days or can we do an alternative and leave. I know AMA isn't allowed but is there any other way?	Yes
69	She has a pacemaker, and is a 3 time cancer survivor in her mid 20s. She has been in and out of the hospital every month for the past few years. First it was heart issues, and another was breathing problems. She got many heart surgeries, including heart valve and stents. She has had heart attacks too. She barely has any muscle on the back of her neck, so its hard on her to look up while at work.  I almost lost my mom many times. I'm 20, she is 52. All of these problems are from the radiation she endured in her twenties. Recently, she was hospitalized for over a month because she couldn't breath. She had fluid drained out of her lungs, which was a major surgery. She made it through it, and now has to use an oxygen machine at home and oxygen tanks every where she goes.   We struggle financially, and as a college student that works almost 40 hours a week, half of my paycheck goes to bills. She has applied for disability twice, and has been denied twice. I'm in shock, especially because of everything she has been through. And now that she relys on oxygen tanks, it makes me feel horrible she has to still work because she got denied. We did get a lawyer, but it could take up to 2 years now.   Is there any way to fast track this process? Or any place we can appeal this? There is absolutely no reason she should have been denied. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm a Florida resident if that helps.  Edit: we were also denied food stamps, even though we can barely afford food and barely get by with bills. She has lost too much weight since she has been on the oxygen machine.	Yes
70	Are there any laws in California about how close you can smoke to doors and windows of residences?    I live in an apartment complex with a lot of cigarette smokers.  I am highly allergic to cigarette smoke (been to the ER, multiple doctors, prescribed inhalers, EPI-pens, etc.)  The number of smokers has gotten much worse in the last few years, and it is negatively impacting my health to a serious degree.  I had to move out of a previous residence for the same problem.    The apartment complex has a small open grassy space with a barbeque where most people smoke.   [&lt;Sexy MS Paint Diagram!&gt;](http://i.imgur.com/5uOE8AX.jpg) It is within a few feet of windows and doors.  People also smoke inside the laundry room and inside the enclosed garage.  At any given time of the day or night there are around 2-4 people smoking.  I really don't want to be one of those people who complain about this sort of thing, but there are lots of children in the complex who shouldn't be inhaling this too.	Yes
71	I am currently battling with my insurance company about my claims. This is not for an car accident claims. Just strictly medical treatment and I am in the State of Washington.   I started receiving medical treatment back in April 2016. and inquired about starting my claims in September 2016. I made all the inquiries through emails and never actually submitted my claims. They told told me is that, in order for them to reimburse me, I have to make the payment out of pocket. I did not have the money to pay for the expenses at the time so delayed my claims. They NEVER told me that I have to submit my claims within 180 days of my services.  I finally was able to make payments on the medical services in July 2017. Subsequently, I my claims and the Company deny reimbursement for treatment received from April 2016 through December 2016 since it was outside of the 180 days window.   I was doing some research and it mentioned something about Washington State is a notice prejudice state but I am not sure if it has been extended to health insurance claims.   Am I out of luck? Is there anything that can help me?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
72	So, my wife (no marriage cert, but we lived &amp; function as man &amp; wife) has left, not really communicating at all.  While I adore her, and want things to work out, if she needs to leave to be happy, I can deal with that.  However, she has major medical issues (using the max FSA contribution in ~8 months each year), but if we are split, I can save ~150 a PAYCHECK by dropping her and changing to a high deduct plan, with HSA.  She has no job at current, and ~4 yrs ago when she took med leave from her last job, she didn't do the required appt's &amp;/or paperwork to continue to get paid from them. She also refused to apply for unemployment, or disability in all that time.  We also have a 5 yr old daughter, but I'm not concerned about custody today, although that will be it's own issues.  Open enrollment is typically in Oct. so I have time. But I want to be prepared.  So much more, I'm sure, but ask ?'s and I'll answer.	Yes
73	I was walking at work when my right knee sprained I didn't fall or hit anything. I was told that they couldn't cover it because I was just walking but, the reason it sprained was  from a prior injury that I sustained from work before. The place they sent me to Concentra urgent care facility that handled and cared for my injury told me that I was fine and released me from care. Not too long ago after they let me go I reinjured the same right knee just walking at work. Now am I suppose to act like Concentra wasn't wrong for letting me go the first time? I'm sure they are not perfect so now the people handling my insurance are telling me that Concentra can never be wrong and that it's just a coincidence that the same right knee sprained just walking ? Can I sue ?	Yes
74	"TL;DR: The place I work is gross, and the manager does nothing to prevent it. What do I do?  I work at a local pizza restaurant, and the manager is just awful. I could go on about it, but here's the main concern: I'm pretty sure I got a fungal infection from working with dishes. The area rarely gets cleaned properly (I'm one of the maybe 2 people that uses cleaning products thoroughly), and the proper sanitary supplies are not readily available. Not even gloves. I've been cut working a handful of times, and not even washing/sanitizing has prevented the infection. People clean the dishes they need and sometimes more before the regular dish shift (6 pm to close), and the only sanitary option in the area is hand sanitizer. I'm not sure how effective this is honestly, but I personally spray my hands off, dry them with a paper towel, apply a generous amount of hand sanitizer and rub it in, then wipe off the excess before handling clean dishes. Other people typically use the sprayer and handle dishes doing little more than using paper towels after, and then proceed to wash their hands and continue food prep. This is alarming, because I can only imagine how much bacteria and fungus have spread throughout the restaurant due to the manager's utter disregard for any proper procedures. I will either be going to the clinic today or tomorrow for a check-up for the infection, but I'm wondering who I should contact to fix this. It's gotten to the point that I almost want a doctor's note to limit me from any food or dish contact and stick to driving, but that wouldn't be fair to others. They're unaware of the issue due to inexperience or ignorance. I've had issues with fungus from unsanitary working conditions in a ""high class"" popular Italian chain restaurant before. Any information is greatly appreciated, if you need any other info, let me know."	Yes
75	"Throwaway because reasons but I love this sub and read it daily (probably more than I should) and have learned so much. Hope you guys can help with this.  (Also 1st post disclaimer so if it's formatted wrong, I'm sorry.)  I recently started working at a tiny pharmacy in a tiny town in WA. It is not a ""regular"" (Walgreens type) pharmacy. They make personalized medications and also do not bill any insurance at all. I have worked in many other pharmacies/medical places and all of them have treated anything with any patient info as protected and put it in a separate garbage to be shredded. This place does not. We throw everything, no matter what's on it, in 1 garbage that gets taken out to an easily accessible to anyone dumpster. I'm talking about full prescription labels with name, address, phone, dr, drug, directions, etc. They also write the last 4 of the credit card and CVV on the same paper so that also goes in the garbage. As well as any notes like a temp different address or ""card declined"" or spouse's name.   I am INCREDIBLY uncomfortable with this. If I was a patient and found out my pharmacy was doing this, I would literally never fill there again and tell everyone I knew what they were doing. I think it's a huge breech of trust. I asked my boss why they do that and she said because they don't bill any insurance, HIPAA doesn't apply to them so they can disposed of it however they want. I'm sure she knows the rules but there has to be something that says it's not ok but I'm not familiar enough with personal information disposal regulations.   LEGAL QUESTION- Is there anything I can show her to say ""no, you can't do that""? I like my job but I'm so uncomfortable with this and actually might quit for this reason. You can't tell a patient ""trust us, we'll take care of you....but don't look while we give access to your medical info to any bum who wants to dig through the garbage.""  Tl:dr pharmacy doesn't bill insurance and throws away PHI because ""HIPAA doesn't apply"". Is there anything I can show my boss to say ""stop being dumb?""  Thanks in advance for any insight!"	Yes
76	"Hi everyone.  My father passed away about 5 months ago after suffering a heart attack during surgery to remove colon cancer.  There are a few odd things that happened, however. I've been trying to ignore them, but they've really been bothering me lately.  1) We had all spoken to my father (who was brain dead at the time) and a few of us were in and out of the room. I stayed in the room the whole time, as I didn't want him to be alone. A few of my family members had come back into the room, and as I was sitting there holding his hand, they pulled the plug. It surprised me, as there was no explicit ""Are you ready to pull the plug?"" They just pulled it, and all of a sudden it got quiet. At the time, I figured maybe it just wasn't like the movies and that's how they did it. But now, I'm second-guessing myself.  2) Apparently, I'm the only one in my family who understood that, when we were finally getting to see him after he had stabilized a bit, we were going to say goodbye. The rest of my family understood that we were just going in to tell him to fight through and that we were here for him. So while the plug pulling surprised me, it REALLY surprised them.   3) This could totally be an ICU nurse trying to make my mom feel  better, but the ICU nurse said that while my mom was telling him to fight, he raised his arms and pretended to box. I highly doubt that if he was brain dead, he would've been able to do that.   My dad had leukemia for 10 years and cost his insurance a lot of damn money over the years. I hate to suggest that they were eager to get rid of him, but... I can't help but think that.  Is any of this normal? Is there something odd to this whole scenario?  Thanks so much, and sorry if I rambled or if this is the wrong sub."	Yes
77	She talked me into staying with her because she said I had commitment issues.  She made herself my personal caretaker isolating me away from professionals, church, friends and family.  I trusted her more than myself because of dogmatic Mormon views of Husband and Wife and benevolence of mental health professionals.  She talked cryptically about gas lighting, life insurance and suicide protection but ducted out at the idea that she pay it incase I am instituted and can't.   She lastly brought up a polyamorous marriage. I said she was cheating when she left for weekends without contact. She gave me 30 days to get out of her parents house (she was already pushing her parents into nursing homes for).	Yes
78	[PA] I don't want to give too much away. But doctors messed up and tried to cover their tracks. I need a lawyer but not sure who to go to. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.	Yes
79	Hi all,   I turned 26 this year and got booted from my family's health insurance plan, was making almost no money as a contractor, so I went on Pennsylvania's public health benefits. Two months ago, I got a job offer and I needed to both start right away and move to where the job was, and in the personal tornado of making that happen, I just remembered that I never cancelled my public benefits.   The moment I took the job, I left the income bracket in which I'd been eligible to receive benefits. My health insurance with this new job didn't kick in until one month into it, so I've technically only had 'double health insurance' for one month. The only costs that my benefits have been covering in this overlap period are the monthly rental payments on a medical device I need - it's a cost that I could hypothetically reimburse the state for out of pocket.   What kind of trouble am I in? Obviously, I'd like to take action first thing Monday morning when their phone lines open up and report my mistake, but am I looking at any potential legal issues here?	Yes
80	"My 92 year old grandmother is currently decaying away in her home losing her mind. She has been injured various times but plays it off with insane excuses. She is clearly not mentally fit to be all on her own.  Currently she is in the ""care"" of my aunt, in which her daughter forced her so that she controls all my grandmother's finances. Right now the aunt does nothing at all, and worsens my grandmother's physical state.  In general the aunt is a big obstacle.  What can I do to help this situation? Ideally I'd want my grandmother to move in with me so I can actually take care of her but im unsure if my aunt would let that happen. It's come to the point where the aunt drains her pension each month not even leaving her enough for groceries.  Legally what are my options, alternatively i'd want her in an old folks home."	Yes
81	"I live in Washington state.  In June 2015, we were on vacation in Montana and my daughter had an accident that required a trip to the emergency room (she grabbed a hot hair straightener with both hands, fully recovered with no additional treatment necessary).  We gave the hospital our insurance information, were discharged and didn't hear from them again.  In April 2017, we got an EOB in the mail from the insurance company saying that our responsibility is the full amount because the hospital didn't bill within our plan's ""timely filing limit"".  A few months later, in June 2017, we got the bill for the full amount from the hospital.  I'm not sure what our next action should be, my thought is that we write a letter to the hospital informing them that we will not be responsible for paying the full bill as it was their neglecting to bill the insurance that caused the problem.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
82	Location: Los Angela's California  I was at a bar last week with some friends and some time during the night I was at the bar getting a drink and when I turned around an extremely drunk man smashed his glass into mine while he wildly gestured about something.   At first I was in shock since he basically smashed a glass in my face but when I looked down my entire right hand was a bloody mess. I shouted and one of the bartenders saw this and called the ambulance. I  was furious with the guy who gave me a fuck of comment before the manager on staff sat me down and helped me until the ambulance got there.   I'm at the hospital and during the exam it was discovered that 3 of the tendons in my hand had been cut and I need surgery to repair them.   The broken career part of the story is that I'm an graphic designer who relies on the use of my hands to do my job. And now that my hand is still recovering I can't work or do anything and I'm concerned about what to do. I don't know who I should call, if there's some way of getting my expanses covered, what I'll do if I can't use my hand well enough in the future and I can't work as a graphic artist anymore.   I'm surviving off the money I have saved and will be okay for about a month and I have medical insurance so that's all taken care of. But I just need advice of if I can get some sort of money to help pay for my expenses and what my options are.   I don't really have the money to pay for a lawyer since al of my savings are paying for everything and I don't have a salaried job since I'm freelance at the moment.   I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes as I'm writing this with my left hand on mobile and I'm kind of dog scared shitless about what to do.	Yes
83	I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.	Yes
84	I have been to a mental hospital voluntarily a few times when I was younger. I want to buy a gun for hunting but was not sure if Im alllowed to. I Dont have a mental illness. I was also one time held in a hospital until I saw a psychiatrist whuch was a couple hours, then I was released after being evaluated. Do I still have my gun rights?	Yes
85	"I'm considering suing my doctor for medical malpractice. This doctor works out of  ""Clinic Name LLC.""  What do I need to know in regards to the LLC at the end of the clinic name? Does this mean I cannot sue him for malpractice or is he protected from lawsuits because he works at this clinic?"	Yes
86	My friend who suffers from chronic insomnia just turned 18, and with the passing of the new medical marijuana law, he thought he'd give it a try. The only problem is his love for shooting firearms. His doctor informed him that he would be barred from ever owning or shooting one if he received his medical card. He is OK with not being able to use firearms during the duration of the time he uses the M.M., but he is worried that he would never be able to own/shoot one again legally. What is the current law on this and are there any ways to get around it if his doctor is correct? Thanks so much in advance.	Yes
87	"My mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease at 59, and is now 66.  For the last 3 years she has stayed in an independent living retirement community that didn't necessarily get involved in her day to day life, but generally would let my sisters and I know if she started progressing more quickly, missed meals, etc.  Cut to a few weeks ago, facility contacted my family saying she has started doing some things (nothing violent, just a lot of getting lost, wandering) that will require us to move her and that we should start ""actively looking"" for a new facility, but said there was no large rush and they took our payment for the entirety of this month.  I'll note here that moving any senior into a retirement home with more care requires them take a physical within 30 days of moving and they must have all medical records.  These take a bit of time to get in order.  In short, we felt they were giving us that time.  This morning, my sister receives a call saying that my mother has slapped someone at the facility and they are kicking her out effective immediately.  They told her that because we've already paid through July there is no need to hurry her things out, just her.  I'm out of town for work and the more information I get from my sisters the more pissed I get a this place.  Am I just way out of line with what I think is right vs. what the law is or is there a firm legal footing to protect my mother, sisters and family from one day notice termination and what I see as essentially rent theft?"	Yes
88	I think it seems obvious in hindsight these meds where a problem but when your unwell and in a psychiatic settig you tend to take meds like it or not and i didnt associate the increased meds and pain fully until lately. It wasnt until i read about Akathisia that i noticed this is what i had been suffering. I just want to sue because this has bankrupt me and ruined my life and could have been avoided if a docter had just noticed these very negative side effects and stopped the meds.	Yes
89	Briefly...  I make a HIPAA Violation report about my employer.  When you do this, there is a box that you can check that says that you do not want your information revealed to the company you are reporting.  Today I get a call from my employer... basically saying... about that HIPAA report you made about us...  Awkward.  I contact HHS.gov.  They confirmed that they erroneously revealed my information to my employer.  I do understand that my employer cannot legally retaliate against me.  (At least not overtly.  But who knows what my performance reviews are going to look like over the years).  I also understand that at least as of right now... I have no damages.  So I suspect that I answered my own question...  Except that it seems like a pretty big deal that the agency that you are reporting privacy violations to are violating your privacy.  Do you think this is something I should consider pursuing?  Or do I need to just sit back and wait for enumerable damages?	Yes
90	I am from Canada so I am not terribly familiar with this situation under state laws. My friend has a sister who has been in the ICU for a couple weeks now and requires heart surgery. Without the surgery she will die, and even with it, it is highly likely she will die. They are a very poor family and already struggle to make ends meet. If the sister dies, are the parents responsible for outstanding debt?   I thought a hospital bill can only be charged to the patient, an insurance company or if someone had signed something. Just looking for some advice on how this sort of stuff works and where to go from here.	Yes
91	"I have a 4 year old son. My name is not on his birth certificate and paternity has not been established. This is an agreement between his mother and I, I have no custodial rights and they live several hours away. This, to her, prevents me from ""trying anything"" and also prevents me from being responsible for any child support.  I pay half of his health insurance premium through Florida Kid Care to help out.   This coming enrollment period I will be adding my 8 year old son to my insurance, the difference between Emp+Child and a family plan is minimal.   My question is, can I add my 4 year old son which I, on paper, have no rights or custodial duties for to my health insurance while keeping our arrangement?"	Yes
92	Hi all,  so rewind to about a year ago when I began taking some medicine to remove a foot fungus in the. During one of my last treatment visits in January 2017, I saw a different podiatrist for the first time due to my other podiatrist being out of the office. This new podiatrist may have had an issue with my appearance or something because he did not really address me at all and seemed annoyed by my presence. He did not talk much even though I had asked him a lot of questions about my progress. He takes a quick look at my nails and then proceeded to cut my nails very low, despite my painful cries, without warning me or asking me to do so in the first place. After which he writes me a script for some bogus prescription that didn't help and left without saying anything. Fast forward to May 2017, and I start to develop very uncomfortable pain in one of the toes trimmed down low. Apparently, the low cutting of the toenail resulted in an ingrown toe nail in eventually both toes. A preventative measure to this is to soak your foot in salt water to help the nail grow, but my previous podiatrist did not mention anything about that.   The ingrown toenail proceeded to get infected, and resulted in the last couple of months of alot of pain, discomfort, expenses on medical supplies, and many trips to the doctor. I really find this podiatrist culpable of all of these issues, especially since the other podiatrist I saw before him did not think it was necessary to cut the nail so low, and has been coaching me through the entire process.  Can I sue that podiatrist I saw in Jan for cutting my nail too low and not giving me any advice after to prevent ingrown toenails?  Are their lawyers out there willing to see this case considering there won't be a lot of money involved?   Thanks for any legal advice you can provide!	Yes
93	I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my leg in 2013. Medi clinic Doctor didn't prescribe blood thinners or send me for an ultrasound to confirm it or even suggest a follow up afterwards. Ended up almost dieing in the hospital with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs so bad I passed out from lack of oxygen and my stressed out heart couldn't pump enough blood. After my diagnosis (two xrays and CT scan later) I was on clot busters so strong I had to stay in ICU for 24 hours in case my brain started bleeding out. During my stay, the info pamphlet they gave me pretty much stated flat out that PE is caused by deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) in the legs.  Currently on blood thinners right now for the next 6 months and am otherwise healthy. I think the Dr that diagnosed me completely dropped the ball with not prescribing treatment or requesting an ultrasound to gain even basic knowledge about what was going on and to that effect it's probable the clot remained for years and moved to my lungs (been having breathing issues for the last couple of years)...  Thoughts?  I'm not about frivolous lawsuits, but this sounds like negligence at the very least.	Yes
94	TL;DR- Got lost in the health insurance system due to a glitch; now have a wisdom tooth tearing up my mouth and want to know if it's okay to get medical help despite being in an appeal process   So! Back in December of 2016, I applied for health insurance via NY State of Health and uploaded my tax returns as proof of income (I'm freelance). I was then told I hadn't given enough information of proof of income despite uploading my tax return, so called the phone line to ask what more I needed to do. They told me tax documents were enough, it was a glitch in their system, and they would contact me when it was all settled. In February I hadn't heard from them yet, so called again to check in---was told once again that it was a glitch and they would contact me shortly.  Fast forward to now--I still hadn't heard from them, but apparently have a wisdom tooth that decided to show up in my mouth last week and wreck havoc (constant pain, hard to eat, hurts to swallow, all that fun stuff). I called the office again to check in, was told it was a massive error on their part and they got me set up to pick a plan (which I did), except it doesn't start until August--I cannot make it much longer like this, one week has already been hell. I then requested to file for backdating due to an urgent medical need, which was denied (not sure why entirely, more than willing to call and ask for specifics if that's helpful).   I can expand on all of this further if the wall of text hasn't already been a turn off, but the basic questions I have are:  -now that I'm filing an appeal, is it okay to still get my tooth removed or does that hurt my standing in the appeal process?  -if I win this appeal will I be reimbursed for whatever costs my dental would've covered (if it's kosher to remove the tooth)?  -is it terribly stupid to not have someone to represent me for this telephone hearing?  Thank you for any/all help and hope everyone is having a wonderful Sunday!	Yes
95	Hello r/legaladvice and the Reddit community as  whole. First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.  Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al’s devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.   Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?   What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?   Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?   Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.   If there's any questions I can ask or information you guys need please let me know and I'll ask Al. This is so early on he's still dealing with the emotional blow. Btw I did ask permission to ask for help on his behalf so long as it was anonymously.	Yes
96	So two years ago my fiance was attending a university in New Hampshire and she received health insurance through the university. After a year she took a leave of absence and moved to California for a job. She received health insurance through her job in California. The university did not cancel her insurance in New Hampshire, so she submitted a form to the insurance company in December 2016 to waive the insurance in New Hampshire and the waiver was refused. She repeatedly reached out to the insurance for several months to sort out why they would not cancel her insurance and she's now finding out (through the university, which has done nothing to alleviate the problem) that there were claims submitted in January, February, and March of 2017. Being in California she couldn't have used the New Hampshire insurance since it was only accepted at the university's medical network. She has proof that she was clocked in at work in California for the times associated with the claims.   The university states that all students (even those on a leave of absence must have health insurance that meets their requirements). Her leave of absence ended a month ago.   I've already read through the [FTC's medical identity theft](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0171-medical-identity-theft) page and plan to follow the instructions there. Is there anything else that we can do to solve this? What would be the best way to get the insurance cancelled?	Yes
97	Whenever I go to my orthodontist, they have a bunch of dentistry chairs in the back so each patient is getting treated side by side with no privacy. In this same room, there's a big television in the middle with patient's names, reason for visit, treatment for the visit, who they're seeing, appointment time, et cetera. This seems to me like a very clear violation of the law. Am I correct in thinking this?	Yes
98	Hey, this may be a dumb question and if I'm putting it in the wrong place please let me know.  I went to a new doctor who started me on a prescription for a new medicine to counter some side effects of another medicine I take. The new stuff actually started to help, a lot. For the first time in a long time it didn't feel like my stomach was trying to eat itself constantly. However, they put a typo on the prescription--they prescribed 15 pills at one dosage, and 15 pills at a second, but the second half had the typo and the pharmacy couldn't fill it. No big deal, they have 15 days to correct it, right? Totally wrong. The pharmacy called them 2-3 times in the first week, and faxed the request over as many times. I spent all of the next week calling, leaving voicemails, and never hearing back. Finally Thursday, the pharmacist got a verbal confirmation it was being sent over that day. I called Thursday and got the same confirmation. Nothing. Then Friday morning I called and told them that it needed to be in ASAP so I could pick up that afternoon, because I only had one pill left. They assured me it would be sent to the pharmacy within the hour.  Pharmacy again got nothing. I tried repeatedly to get through to them again and when I finally got someone on the phone, was told that it was still waiting for the doctor to sign off on it (the girl from the morning had told me she'd messaged the doctor but either she didn't do that, or the doc just didn't bother) and she'd gone home for the day. It's a controlled substance psych med, so the pharmacist wasn't able to even give the one pill to bridge the gap, even though they had the original prescription with that stupid typo.  So today has been an absolutely awful day of being sick, having stomach pains way worse than they were before I started this miracle medicine, and just generally wanting to curl up and cry.   I'm already looking for another doctor, and gave them honest reviews on Yelp and Google, but honestly with their other low reviews (I didn't even check first, was referred by a friend who didn't have as bad a time) I don't think they care to make improvements. Is there something that can be done to fine them, or somehow bring to their attention how badly they communicate? At this point I just don't want them to screw anyone else over like they did me.   Thanks everyone, and have a great night.  TL;DR doctor jerked me and pharmacy around for 2 weeks and messed up on a prescription for a psych med, caused massive frustration and a day and a half of feeling awful. Can anything be done to make sure they don't keep doing this to patients?	Yes
99	"My Uncle was recently admitted to the Hospital in Houston and it took the Hospital 3 days to contact us, his family, because he was dropped off by a woman claiming to be his spouse who did not show back up until today wanting to pull the plug. We believe she is an illegel immigrant who has another valid marriage in Mexico, sorry for the lack of details I'm trying this as fast as i can because of the situation at the Hospital at the moment, he is located in Houston Texas and my aunt just made it to the hospital. We don't know who this woman who is apparently his spouse is, but we suspect it's some prostitute who was trying to become a citizen. What rights do we have as his family, can we stop her decision? Will she inherit everything he owns as he has no children?  What can we do as his family, nobody wants to unplug him except for his ""spouse"" who NOBODY know who she is."	Yes
100	"Hi all,  I'll try to keep this simple. My health plan(New York Medicaid) covers 20 visits of Physical therapy a year. I might or might not have gone over 20 visits when I started going to my current Physical Therapy Office. I went to PT for 3 visits and got billed $50 for each of the visits. Now in this point of my life, $150 is a boatload of money and can't afford to pay it off. Apparently my plan can't help me out as I went over the 20 plan limit and the PT office didn't confirm whether I was at my limit or not as well.  So I'm basically stuck with this bill and it will possibly be sent to collections. Now I have a ""plan"" perhaps on getting this resolved which may be a bit un-kosher. You see this same office billed my insurance company (NY Medicaid), for an EMG of the Neck and Lower Back and they were paid $3.5k for each part.  However when I asked the office for the report they tell me they only did and have a report for the EMG of the Neck not the lower back even though they billed my insurance for it and got paid $3.5k.  So I want to try to ask them to waive my physical therapy balance of $150, so that I look the other way and don't report them for billing fraud to my medicaid health plan. I'm not sure this will work but I am all out of options, and would like any and all advice."	Yes
101	We are located in Alberta, Canada.   Over the course of the past year, my mother has suffered a debilitating illness that has kept her from working.  There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc).   My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.    We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we don’t know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage.   Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.	Yes
102	Hello all, I went to the ER yesterday at 1am for severe stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea and vomiting. I was given a slew of IV’s that were supposed to ease some of the pain and nausea. I can’t quite remember the nausea medicine but I was given ranitidine for stomach pain. Within the first few minutes I finally felt better and was able to finally sit up without feeling like me stomach was gonna burst.  Fast forward maybe an hour and the stomach pain returns, It starts to creep until It is a full blown torrent of pain. I begged for some more medicine and after another ranitidine bag I felt a bit better.   They took blood samples and found that I had a lipase of around 140, this led them to believe it was my pancreas and they gave me a CT dye mix to cat scan my organs. After the cat scan which showed a severely inflamed pancreas, I started itching, BAD. I have had hives before so I told the nurse hives were starting to form and she said, simply “No those bumps are from you scratching.” 10 minutes later and I’m covered head to toe in large, red itchy blotches. It takes them maybe an hours and a half to file some paperwork before they finally give me something to rid of the hives that had me ripping at the bed sheets in pain.  Once my hives cleared, I was given even more drugs, though my abdomen still hurt very bad. I passed out from all the drugs and pain and fell asleep. I was admitted into the hospital overnight and woke up 10am today. Cue, me waking up and vomiting blood-filled green vomit into multiple emesis bags. I begged the nurse and the doctor both for more nausea and pain meds though all I was given was some more ranitidine which at this point does nothing for me.  Now I’m sitting here with the worst pain of my life and the doctors saying I have to deal with it. They recommended I had a endoscopic tube inserted to my stomach to search for ulcers. The only problem is, I’m 17 and this hospital refuses to touch minors with that and I have to instead wait until Monday. (In two days) and see my family physician and get a recommendation before I can go to a different hospital and receive treatment. I asked if I was going to be getting any medicine to last me until then but I was denied everything and I know the pain is gonna return again. I’m just dreading when they take this IV out of me and discharge me. I can’t stand the pain, it hurts too bad. All I want are some pain meds. I guess I’m just gonna have to deal with it though.   A little side note I would like to add is they took a toxicology test on me and found THC then they tried to say that it was the THC causing my intense pain and inflammation. FML.  TL;DR: I had severe pain and sulfur burps, went to the hospital. They said I had a swollen pancreas then poisoned me (unintentionally) and covered my body with hives before taking an hour and a half to fix it. Currently about to discharge me after not fixing any of my abdominal issues or even giving me some pain meds to make the situation easier.	Yes
103	"Last year, I went in to a California urgent care center because I ended up having strep throat. I gave them my Aetna PPO insurance, paid the $75 copay, and then went on my merry way to the pharmacy. This was about a year ago.  I did a credit report check recently, and to my surprise a $200 bill had been placed into collections over 6 months ago, with the urgent care center listed as the original account holder. So I call this urgent care, which is located in a small shopping mall and is not attached to a hospital or any other medical offices. The receptionist pulls up my account and tells me that she sees that I paid the copay, but that they have nothing to do with further billing, as they send all their claims to a contracted medical billing office for insurance collection, which is apparently the standard in the industry. She kindly gives me their medical billing company's phone number, apologizes, and says she has ""not heard positive things"" about them. Great.  So I call the medical billing office explaining that their buddy, the urgent care center, sent me to them with my qualms about this phantom $200 medical bill. She looked me up by my name and birthday, and said that yes, they did send that amount to Stanislaus Credit Control Agency after four unsuccessful attempts to contact me. Interestingly enough, the main offices for both Stanislaus and this medical billing company are both located in Modesto, CA. Anyway, the lady says this is a result of me not reaching my insurance deductible, and that this $200 was the amount my insurance, Aetna, would not cover for the urgent care visit. I thought that sounded legitimate so I eased my tone and said thanks for clearing that up.  However, I now believe she was giving me a pre-scripted run-around. I call Aetna to ask what my deductible would be for an urgent care visit. **Aetna says there is no deductible for urgent care visits, only a copay.** I ask them to look up the claim for this urgent care visit, as the urgent care center has my Aetna insurance policy on file. **Aetna has no record of any claim for any urgent care center on my behalf.**   My Aetna customer service guy says hold on, he will personally call this medical billing office. I stay on the line listening to the provided elevator music, and he comes back reporting that the person who is in control of my account is apparently not in the office today, a Monday afternoon at 2pm. I ask my Aetna customer service guy if he thinks that sounds shady. He agrees, and says he personally will try again tomorrow and get back to me. I google the urgent care center on Google, and there are already four negative reviews mentioning surprise letters from collections agencies.  Are any/all of these companies in cahoots with each other to make money from collections, instead of correctly filing a claim with Aetna? I am still waiting to hear back, as this Nancy Drew stuff all went down today. Thanks in advance for any theories."	Yes
104	"Hey guys,  So just to start off this story is very long and I can post more details if needed but basically what happened was this...  I visited a dentist for a general cleaning and during the exam they stated that I needed to remove one of my fillings and replace it with a porcelain filling. They were very persistent and proceeded to tell me that I needed to get this done. I agreed eventually. The filling took over three visits (one month) for them to ""get it right"". During one of my visits they dropped the filling on the floor and I, the patient, found it. All of the visits were the worst pain I've ever felt in my life as if they did not numb me right and the staff seemed very unprofessional.   After the visits were over, the tooth is still in a lot of pain and I have been in pain for over two months. I contacted them and they told me the doctor that worked on my tooth does not even work there anymore. All of these events obviously made me decide that I will be seeking help from a different office and I requested them to give me a refund of the money I had spent on those visits. They are being extremely difficult to work with and I'm concerned I will not get my money back. My question on the matter is do I take them to court if they refuse to refund me?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated and again I can give more details as requested. There were a lot of events that took place that were completely unprofessional and I've never experienced this kind of thing from a dentist.   Thank you so much!"	Yes
105	Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.  When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay.   My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!	Yes
106	"The long version:  I work with developmentally disabled men. My employer is a private not for profit agency that cares for nearly 1000 disabled people. I don't want to drop the name .On an outing one of my clients tripped and fell down 2 stairs, landing flat on his belly and face. He was awake, he sat up on his own and was responsive. I called my supervisor for guidance and she told me to take him to the hospital if he would go himself or call an ambulance. He wouldn't move and doesn't communicate very well verbally so I called the ambulance. The ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital.  This is where it gets messed up.  I follow the ambulance and try to get to my client but the er wouldn't let me see him for 15 mins. Finally they let me see him and they have him in a gown and lying in bed. They ask me what happened and I tell them what I saw. They order a ct scan.  While we are waiting for the results I comment that he is acting weird. He usually can walk but he won't. So the nurse said that the doctor won't let him leave if he can't walk. Scan results come back, he broke a bone in his face but he can go home. No checking if he can walk or other exams. Just a head and neck ct. And bam, suddenly he is discharged.  My coworker and I load him up and take him home. He still won't walk and is still acting weird, but they said he had a concussion and would be dazed. So later that night my boss comes and does an exam and it is obvious he has an injured leg, so they take him back in the ambulance. They wouldn't let my boss be in the room with him just like they did with me. An x-ray is ordered. Broken femur.  He has surgery and 2 days later my boss notices his shoulder is swollen and bruised. It took more than a day to convince the hospital to just x-ray his damned arm. X-ray is ordered, but the next shift nurse tries to cancel it citing the ct scan, ""They should have picked up anything on the ct scan..."" My boss was pissed. Turns our, he has broken humerus.  So the higher level people in my company want to have a formal meeting with the hospital because this is just ridiculous. So the hospital is now trying to pin the whole thing on me. I gave them bad info, and that I said it was ok to discharge. That kind of stuff is way above my pay grade and I am not the guardian. My boss said it is bullshit, but she isn't sure if I'm in any legal jeopardy.  So with that, do I need to lawyer up so I don't get sued without representation? Ask any questions, and sorry if it reads like a grade school story. I am super stressed and feel so bad for my guy. The hospital failed him and I feel like I failed him too.  Edit: Somehow I managed to delete the original post, sorry."	Yes
107	I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical. When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas. A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call  b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her.  Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request. I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper). *Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty.  *She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.” *Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them. *I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored. *I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.) *I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy. *My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic. *My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call. When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy. Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.	Yes
108	Mom in Ohio is a permanent resident of a nursing home but underwent surgery in a hospital and upon her return to the nursing home requires physical therapy to recover. Medicaid has covered her permanent residency but then Medicare Part A steps in to cover the skilled nursing physical therapy she is receiving post-op.  The question about simultaneous status has arisen because we took her to an appointment outside of the facility (unrelated to the surgery) and we were informed that her status as a permanent resident vs skilled nursing patient matters for billing purposes. They explained if she is covered under Medicaid then they would bill them, however if she is currently covered by Medicare then the nursing home should be billed directly or her personally if the nursing home doesn’t deem the appointment vital.  So can you be considered both a permanent resident and a skilled nursing patient by a nursing home? Meaning the nursing home is concurrently receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid (the per diem and the patient liability amount).  This is my first post! I am sorry if it is not worded well, I have very limited knowledge of Medicaid/Medicare/Nursing Homes and am learning as I go. Also, I am cross-posting in hopes of getting it in the right place!	Yes
109	"My sister is a resident of California, she recently was prescribed some Vicodin after oral surgery on July 6th, 2017.   In pain still; the doctor during a follow up wrote out another prescription today on the 11th for the same medication except now Target/CVS are refusing to fill the prescription because there is a *new law* that ""covers this medication every 8 days only"".   I'm curious; wouldn't the doctor who wrote out the prescription be aware of this or is this not even a true law?   Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"	Yes
110	"I live in Texas and I am renting an apartment. I noticed mold on the edges of the vent right around the time where I developed a weird cough. I also allergies, thought they were seasonal but it could be that it was the mold. Anyway around a month ago I told the apartment people that I saw the mold on the edge of the vent. They sent a guy to clean it but he said it was just condensation and that it wasn't harmful. He changed the filter and left. I then decided the clean the ""condensation"" and took out the vent where the ac air comes out from, and saw it was incredibly moldy. The vent was covered in mold, the wall had mold and inside the vent area there was more mold. It was disgusting. I also noticed mold on the vents to my living room and restroom. Since they ignored the mold the first time is there anything I can do? How do I approach the apartment staff? And do I have to continue to live here with this mold problem? I don't think it is healthy to stay in this apartment."	Yes
111	"Good Morning,  I'm writing this as a request to find out what I should do with regards to patient abuse. The patient in question is my father, and below I've copied the draft that my mother, a RN nurse of 20+ years, wrote.  Essentially my father's back was messing up and we had to go to the ER at the VA due to urinary incontinence and met Dr. A.  Dr. A was condescending, told them they should not be there because the ER is for people with real problems, (cancer, amputations, etc), and asked if my father had any bowel problems. Dr.A was told no, and then insisted on doing 2 anal exams. He never washed his hands, did not physically help my father orient himself, barked orders at him while my father was struggling to move, and threatened to send him home because sphincter tone was normal.   My mother questioned Dr.A about the urinary incontinence because our primary care physician told us to come in specifically when that occurs. Dr.A ordered a bladder scan, saw the urinary incontinence times 2, then transferred us to the Harborview ER (Seattle).   Below is the draft letter that my mother wrote to file a complaint, and i was hoping I could get some feedback/help with ensuring that it is received with the amount of urgency that it deserves.  Looking for criticisims/edits/review, as well as legal advice for proceeding forward.   We are located in Seattle, Wa.   ***Draft Letter***  	July 12’ 2017 Attn:  Medical Center Director 	I am sending this complaint in regards to an ER visit for my husband, Patient, on June 18’ 2017.  	My husband was being treated at the American Lake VA since late May’ 2017 for a back injury.  He’d been to PT with a referral in for Neurology and Sports Medicine d/t quickly progressive symptoms.   During the course of 1 week he went from walking independently to being given a cane and then a rolling walker by PT.  We were instructed at the last MD appointment to go to ER if any difficulty with urination occurred or if pain became intolerable.   	On Sunday, June 18’2017, we ended up in the Seattle VA ER d/t 2 episodes of incontinence/retention over the past 3 days and intolerable pain.  I arrived with my husband assisting him to ambulate with the rolling walker d/t him being barely able to stand.   	Dr. A was our ER doctor.  His attitude from the moment he stepped into our room was condescending and dismissive.  He showed nothing but disregard for my husband’s condition stating that people usually come into the ER for real problems such as Cancer or Amputations.  My husband had severe progressive numbness, tingling and pain down his right leg, all of which occurred over the course of 1 week.  He asked my husband if he had any bowel incontinence and was told no.  He then decided to perform a sphincter exam x2 with obvious force with both penetrating entries and no handwashing at any time.  Afterwards he did not wipe the gel off either time but left him there on his side struggling to move in severe pain.   Of note, this is for a man who can’t lie straight d/t back pain and can barely move without assistance.  This was all after bowel incontinence had already been denied.  Dr. A was ready to send my husband home until I questioned him about the episodes of urinary incontinence.  He then decided a bladder US would be in order, which should have been done as opposed to a rectal exam for the initial complaint.    After the US showed urinary retention after multiple attempts he transferred us to the Harborview ER.  On the transfer form he noted my husband to be ambulatory as if he was independent, no note of 1 person assist or ambulatory aide needed.    The end result being my husband was admitted and MRI showed a moderate L5-S1 disc herniation with nerve impingement.  He’s since had a microdiscectomy performed and is now healing.   	I understand many people have back pain, but for Dr. A to be so dismissive of a person is poor practice and abuse of his own perceived power.  He is a bully to the point he is on the line of patient abuse.    I don’t believe this man is fit to work with patients, especially a vulnerable population such as veterans.  My biggest concern are for the patients in the VA system who have no one to speak for them.  Most veterans are not knowledgeable of how patients should be treated.  The treatment and testing from Dr. A for my husband was wrong and abusive.    									Sincerely,  									Patient Wife"	Yes
112	Today I found out Cigna denied part of my FMLA paperwork for a small error on the form that my doctor made.   The doctor failed to include two days I have missed from work in his date range for my intermittent leave for Migraine.   When I spoke with Cigna about this they stated that I can get a second chance, but only because I live in Washington State. Washington State has its own FMLA law. If I lived in a state without secondary protection, Cigna states that they would not reconsider if my doctor corrects the form.   Cigna never called me to inform me of the error on the form, and just denied my claim.   When I brought this up, they told me that they aren’t allowed to call. They also said that the law as written allows them to deny a claim and not reconsider it.   When I asked them where in the law it says they can do this, they mentioned that sections 825.306 and 825.307 of the 1993 FMLA pertain. She stated that it reads that the employer cannot call the doctor to question items on the form.   This section was obviously intended to protect the employee from the employer unscrupulously contacting doctors trying to prevent the leave from being approved under the law, Cigna is trying to make it about them.   I want to get this information out there. People living in states without secondary approval could lose their jobs because of stuff like this. People in desperate situations and in poor health could lose their jobs and their ability to pay for their insurance and their ability to receive care because of this policy by Cigna.   Upon research I read something about a 7 day cure period, and I think my situation applies.   What can I do? I feel like this company is taking advantage of people and it makes me sick.	Yes
113	"Hi /r/legaladvice,  Let me preface this post with some background on the situation. I'm beginning college at the University of Washington in Seattle, and I found an apartment community several blocks away from campus. It's a wonderful place with a plethora of amenities, and rent is fairly reasonable considering the exorbitant living cost of Seattle. I was set to move in on August 1st. Everything seemed great until my family and I actually visited the apartment several weeks before my lease began. The entire community is designated as no-smoking, and their contract explicitly states that “smoking is prohibited at the Residential Community, including the Leased Premises…” However, when we first viewed the place on July 21st, there was a clear and pungent cigarette smell in the bathroom, as well as in the washing and drying machines. Moreover, the living room walls were dotted with nail holes and scuffs were easy to spot on the walls. Okay, no big deal. The manager mentioned that the painters had not furnished the apartment yet, and most of the damage would be restored by move-in day. We were just getting a “preliminary tour” of the room.  We visited a second time on July 24th, this time with friends. The four of us spent a while checking the place out, taking measurements, etc. To our dismay, the smell was ever present, as were the scuffs and everything else. I made a comment about it to the other manager showing us the place, who claimed the painters had already been here and done their job. Clearly not.   Fast forward to today, August 1st, which is supposed to be my move in day. Upon arrival, we were baffled that the smell *still* lingered, and the walls hadn’t even been painted since our *first* visit! I compared photos from our preliminary visit on July 21st to the current state of the apartment, and the same scuffs and cracks are visible! Everything is exactly as we first saw it. There wasn’t even an *attempt* to mask the wear-and-tear from the previous tenant!  I confronted the manager about this, and she insists that the painters and cleaners have already cleaned and repaired the previous tenant’s damages. This is wholly false, and photographs speak much louder than words.   I'm honestly at a loss for words right now. The nicotine smell in the bathroom, scuffs on the wall, and cracks in the corner of the alcove don’t bother me. At least not as much as being blatantly lied to. The manager claimed the apartment had been furnished and touched up by the painters and cleaners, when there is little to no sign of any effort to restore the place.   Also, I forgot to mention I paid a $300 deposit that covers any holes, scuffs, cracks, or other normal wear and tear that I leave behind after my lease is up. The Move-Out clause of the contract reads, ""deposits will be refunded when [...] premises are vacated and left in the same general condition as when first occupies, with the exception of normal wear and tear..."" Moreover, “residents will be charged for damage to the Leased Premises beyond ‘normal wear and tear’. Repair and replacement damages will be billed at actual charges."" Damage beyond ""normal wear and tear"" includes damage from cigarette smoke, so I'm confused why management did not charge the previous tenant for cleaning costs. Why am I stuck with this lingering smell, when it was management's duty to prevent it?  I'm so lost. What can I do in this situation? I can’t move in until the apartment is actually furnished, which was supposed to be today. I am currently writing an email to management explaining the situation. Anything I should draw specific attention to?  Thank you all for the help!"	No
114	"I live in Los Angeles, California, the apartment I'm renting IS protected by the RSO.  One day I recieved a text via phone that for the most part read  ""gg no re""in short a 30 day notice to move out.  In order for it to be legal he HAS to have a just cause.  Which he claims after he texted me a 30 days notice.  He only gave me a reason after I essentially begged him to give me a reason.  The reason is allegedly uncleanliness. Some things have some form of merit to them, but most of them don't, anything that I could possibly have fixed I already have.  Furthermore I have pictures to help prove my case although its a difficult thing to argue I do have several arguements for why I am not unclean like he claims and that they are in fact far worse than I have ever been.  To my knowledge he has not said anything about court.  First he said he was going to call the police, then he said all of my stuff is going to be on the streets when I get back.  Putting my things out on the street without going to court is incredibly illegal.  Right now I suspect if thats the route he wants to take I have allready made plans to stay home so he can't do that, I'm not sure what hes going to attempt to do in this case with me here so I do have my concerns.  For example if he tries to bust down the door or attack me. Additionally they are several roomates, which could testify against me. one is his girlfriend, the other have been friends.  Largely any advice for the inevitable court case would be appreciated, if he ever figures out or decides that he actually wants to take me to court.  Or if he continues to decide to try and force me out through self help means."	No
115	"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	No
116	"Hey /r/legaladvice, I'm a longtime lurker/occasional poster (this is obviously a throwaway) who is finally finding a need for a bit of advice.  Location: Iowa  I'm an out of state student attending an Iowa public land grant university. A representative of our residency department recently informed my roommate group that our dorm is being downgraded from a four person capacity to a three person capacity, and that one of us must find alternate housing. They've offered one of us a different room in the same building, but that room costs almost two grand more per year. Additionally, they will be raising the rates on our current dorm.  They've told us we have two business days to decide who will move. This is basically no notice, and we're only a week away from our move-in date. Because of this absurdly short notice, I do not believe I can schedule a consult with a legal firm in time. We've also already been billed the cost of the dorm.  It is my limited understanding that my university is just as beholden to our legal contract as I am, but not all of the same tenancy laws/protections apply. I'm trying to negotiate a deal where they split us the difference, but given that they seem to be deliberately railroading us, I'm not convinced that will go anywhere.   ***Misc. Notes ***(these details may or may not be necessary to understand this legal situation)  - Our contract stipulates that the contract is for ""space only"" and preferences are not guaranteed. That is understandable, but we've been under the impression we'd be living here and paying X amount for many months. - If we were to cancel our contract this late we'd be paying a lot of penalties. - I cannot afford any substantial change in cost to my dorm situation. - All communication has been done via university email. I've already printed off a copy of the bill in case they they try to change it on us. - We cannot just find non-university housing last minute like this. Unless we take the universities deal one of us is homeless and still stuck paying tuition. - Student legal services is paid by student government directly through student fees, so they might be able to help despite this being an issue with the university but it's the summer.  - I can provide an MS Paint diagram of the dorm, but it isn't especially relevant."

117	**TL;DR:** Should I go to court over a 1110(a) violation based on the defense that I am an out of town and not regular NYC driver and the sign was not visible to me? Or take the 2 points and pay the fine?  **My problem:**  I received a traffic ticket for violation of 1110(a) (2 points) in November 2015 in Brooklyn. All I can read on the ticket is: Disobeyed...traffic...device. I had an initial court date of September 2017. I was unable to attend, and it was rescheduled to 5/2017. Then, I got a letter in the mail that it was now 8/2017.   I wanted to know my best approach. I am not sure what details matter so I included as many as I could remember.  **Background:**  I turned right after another car on a busy intersection at a green after sitting and waiting for pedestrians to clear. After I completed the turn, I was pulled over (the other car wasn't).  It was a no right turn intersection. I am not a regular city driver. And I had never seen this sign. It was new to me. I am trying to find out the date of install. At the time, it was blocked by a truck, and I was behind a big truck. I followed another car and turned right. The cop was aggressive with me and implied he could do more than ticket me which I felt to be arrest, and I did not challenge him beyond an inquiry.   At the time, I was back and forth in NY and did not drive in state, and I had an out of state license. Now I live in NY, and I have not got a NY license yet because I don't drive and didn't have a SS card and enough ID points (I do have a NYC ID card). Now I have both, and I am not sure if I should retain my out of state license for point reasons or get a NY license this week. This is my first ticket on this license (had a license at 16, let it lapse when I stopped driving, retook the driver's test in my 20s).  **Questions:**  1. Is it worth fighting this ticket on this basis? Or should I just pay the fine?  2. Do I need an attorney?  3. If not, how will this hearing go? What should I be prepared for? This is all new to me.  4. Should I get a NY license (and won't be driving) or will the outcome affect my new license? Or keep the out of state until the court date?  **Secondary questions:**  1. I can find a database about parking signs but not traffic signs. Any idea I can find when a traffic regulation began at a particular intersection?  2. My new hearing time is at 4:30 in the afternoon. Is this typical? The TVB closes at 4:00. I have an evening class, and I wondered how long I could expect to be there.  3. If I go to DMV and request a new date, are they likely to give me one with school conflict?  4. Why would the DMV change the hearing date on their end?  Thank you for any and all help. I appreciate any insight. I have no idea what to do or expect. Have a great week.	No
118	"Hi /r/legaladvice!  I have been working in a salon industry for a substantial amount of time and was even Assistant Manager at other salons I worked at. I recently moved home during my year off before grad school and I started working at a salon at the beginning of April. I told the owner that I would be leaving at the end of July to go to grad school which is why I refused a management position with his salon. During the interview I asked for a certain amount per hour and he increased the dollar amount without any provocation. I thought this was a great opportunity for me and I took the basic sales level position.   Upon starting my job I was given sales goals and was told (unlike many others) that as long as I hit my goal I would receive 10% commission. He handed me an employee handbook and as I started to read through it line by line the owner told me all I had to do was sign the last page. I told him that I just wanted to read through in case I needed to initial any part or if I had questions about a section. He instructed me that there was no other place to initial and that I don't have to read it because it was straight forward. He pressured me into signing the last page without being able to fully go over it and I was not given a copy of what I had signed despite me asking frequently for one.   There weren't any problems in April or in May. I met all of my sales goals and was given my commission on the day it was promised. In early June I arrived at the salon location I was opening and found a letter he had left for me instructing that my hourly pay was now decreased by 20% with no mention of change in commission structure. The only other employees that received this letter were all going to school at the end of the summer but their letters stated specific hourly pay changes and changes in commission structure. Many employees quit but I decided to call the owner and alert him to the fact that I was promised at least a certain dollar amount per hour and it was his decision to increase it and now after the 20% decrease, I was below the amount I had asked for in my interview. He agreed and decided to bump my pay up to my requested amount in the interview.   After this conversation took place, he then gave me a very high sales goal and put me at a salon that wasn't busy enough for me to meet it. However after a couple of weeks he and the scheduling manager began asking me if I could cover shifts at a busier store for other employees. After accepting the shifts I was now working full time (40hr/week) after just wanting to do a max of 30. On the final day of June I ended up selling $1300+ for the busy salon and surpassed my sales goal by $9. July 1st was the end of the week and I was already clocking in 40+ hours when I asked if I could go home early since the salon died down. There were multiple employees there who could have taken care of our clients. The assistant manager told me that it was ""ok for me to leave 1 hour early"" considering I had to go to a second job that night. The salon was closed Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday for 4th of July. On Wednesday I was scheduled for 11 hours, Thursday for 12 hours, and Friday for 11 hours. On Wednesday I had worked all day and did not take a break. I saw that we were slowing down at the end of the day and when another assistant manager came in to close (who would've taken all the appointments anyway thus leaving me with nothing to do) told me that I could leave early again since there were no clients coming in and I had already been there for 10 hours. I went home and heard nothing.  I came in on Thursday fully intending to work my 12 hour shift because Thursdays are very busy and I knew they would need help. I worked non stop without a break until 5pm when the owner (whom I haven't seen in days) comes in and hands me a letter that he is terminating my employment due to ""excessive absenteeism without the approval of a supervisor"". I was livid. I initialed the document that said that I did not agree with the terms on which I was being terminated and left.   He is supposed to be paying out commission this week and I'm afraid he won't give it to me because a co-worker sent me a copy of the employee handbook which states on the last page that if you are terminated you are not entitled to you commission. I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here. Clearly I was forced to sign a document in front of him and I wasn't able to read anything from it because he never sent me a copy and I feel like he took advantage of this situation because he clearly gave me a sales goal that I wasn't supposed to meet last month but I did and I feel like he's worming his way out of paying my commission. He knew that I would be giving my two weeks at the end of this week (after I was supposed to get my commission check) and I feel like he tried to beat me to the punch. I have NEVER been in trouble at this job and I know that he can terminate employment for whatever reason but I feel like I worked for free essentially. This commission check was supposed to be $500+ and help me for school.  TLDR; Was given a huge sales goal last month that wasn't intended to be reached. Surpassed the goal and the owner terminated my employment for things that were approved of by supervisors. Now I fear he won't pay me my commission due to an employee handbook he forced me to sign without reading."	No
119	In the final stages of a divorce as the defendant. She has a lawyer but I cannot afford one. Things have been pretty simple. Agreed on most of everything and planned on signing papers out of court. The papers arrived yesterday and there are a few things I don't agree with mostly being taking my son off of my insurance. Thought this was a harmless act but it added $150 to my child support. She won't budge on keeping him on mine. I really just want this all over with but I also want to stand up to this because I feel taken advantage of due to my ignorance. Is there anything I could do? Would I even have a shot if I took this to court without a lawyer?	No
120	Hello, curious about IP in the US and have a few questions. Whenever you visit a convention (Comiccon etc) there are always a ton of artists selling fan-art.   What's the legality behind that? Is it just a matter of companies not going after small time artists and hoping they don't notice you? Is there a difference between selling a drawing of a companies character in their original costume vs designing a costume with that character in it? Does it matter?  What about accepting commissions to draw a companies IP?  With those out of the way - I plan on selling original artwork of my own design at conventions starting next year. What can I do to protect myself? How would you go about income tax (Specifically MO/KS tax laws regarding artwork sold)or licensing original content? If someone stole artwork from me what would be my best course of action?  Thanks for your help!	No
121	We have a month to month lease and our landlord decided he wanted to go to student housing. So he notified us that we have till Aug 1st to leave (This was on July 2). Now we are moving out the 14th and have notified him via text that we are leaving. I also asked since we already paid rent for the whole month could we get back the money for the days we wont be living here plus security deposit (The place is in great shape no damage or anything).  He has not contacted me since I notified him of us moving out and asking for the money. My question is are we entitled to the money covering days we won't be living here? From my understanding from the day we leave till 30 days after, he has to give us a written review of the property and security deposit.   He has done this all though text also nothing written.	No
122	Hello everyone,  I am moving into my first apartment this fall near my University.  I signed a lease for a two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend last November.  On the lease it says that we can move in on August 19th.  Every other apartment complex we've heard of in this town, including his current apartment, ends their lease on July 31st and begins the following year's lease on August 1st.  This lease has us move in on August 19th and move out on July 31st.  While this is frustrating because he is without an apartment for the first part of August, we understand that we screwed up and signed for a later date.  The landlord wants the cost of an entire month, $569, due on August 1st even though we are only allowed to begin moving in on the 19th.  We have asked them to move in earlier since we are already paying the cost of a month and nobody will be in the apartment, but they have said no.  My parents think this is illegal.  Is it actually illegal?  This is in Iowa. Thank you!	No
123	I live in a small rent control building in Hollywood California. Everyone has been here 20-40 years. My neighbours are all senior or permanently disabled. The building got a new landlord a few years ago. It's been clear that his goal is to run the building down until we all move so he can possibly renovate and flip. He tried a few evictions that didn't stick and one unit has been empty since he bought and that empty unit it full of enough hardwood for every unit.   An example of his crazy behaviour. He doesn't have a copy of anyone's lease therefore he doesn't know what's in the lease but he decided laundry is not and decided to physically break the laundry machines himself to prevent further use. I guess it's his laundry machine to break but there has been laundry in the building for over 40 years and now the 80 year old couple have to walk to the Laundromat. Laundry is not under housing departments jurisdiction but is there anything we can do?   Safety issues. 1)The key box for the letter carriers access key was broken and key removed so somebody random out there in the world has access to the building. 2)The security door doesn't always lock. 3)The computer system to buzz in guests and the access for parcel delivery is broken. Landlord says he's not required to fix so if we are getting anything delivered we have to prop open the door on the street or miss the delivery. 4) The car gate doesn't always shut or it shuts too soon and has damaged 2 tenets vehicles as a result. 5) Building access to the compound has made the 80 year olds are feeling vulnerable. Apparently safty is not under housing departments jurisdiction. Is it not the landlords responsibility to upkeep security doors and security panels?  Recently we've been pushing for repairs recently. My floor is damaged from 2 leaks and he refused to fix the floor. I got the housing department involved and he is being forced to fix my floor. He retaliated by throwing away everyones personal potted plants and trees. He tore up a small tomato garden and smashed the clay pots. The thing is he gave us notice he would remove our plants 3 years ago but the notice wasn't legit and nothing ever came of it. Can he throw away our property without proper recent notice or does the note he wrote 3 years ago stand?   Hoping for good advice! Thanks.	No
124	So I was driving home from my weekly UA and classes as required after last DUI (wouldnt have even been in that town if not for these obligations). Sober all day, and days prior to that.  For some reason I seizured, passed out, etc behind the wheel not 10 minutes after meeting my PO.  Single vehicle accident, hit a curb.  Eneded up goin to the hospital to get checked since I was frightened I may have had a seizure or something Consented that I'd do the state test via blood and UE.  Nothing to hide.  All came back clean for everything.  I wasnt worried, just thought I'd get driving under suspension...Well this cop finds an empty package of Kratom which was not consumed anytime prior to the accident. He writes me a DUi (which I've had a few guilties of but learned my leason)...With this additional charge I could face substantial jail time even though I was not in anyway intoxicated.  I was never given sobriety tests, read rights etc.  This cop may have just ruined my life right as was rebuilding it, so pissed!  Any advice?	No
125	I work in an office with one other co-worker. He is male and we have the same position but I am the senior of the two.  I requested a transfer to work in another state to live with my fiance. I worked on detail in the other state who is aware of my interest in transferring and would like to have me. Unfortunately, they can't hire right now.   After this request my supervisor, who is not the authority to determine if the transfer is approved, began treating me much worse. I get that being a jerk is not illegal but I have documented several incidences where my male co-worker was clearly favored.   I then was up for a promotion, which was at the discretion of my supervisor, and which I didn’t get. She said she decided I needed to obtain a job certification first which she hadn’t told me prior. Additionally, part of my supervisor’s job is to help support me in getting certified.   I made an informal complaint to her supervisor about what was going on and the treatment I’d been getting compared to my male peer. He thought she was being fair.   Since this complaint my supervisor has been even worse. Lack of communication, discussing my work with my co-worker and not me, and preventing me from working towards my certification. Other senior staff are aware of this and no one is trying to help me. She has a history of bullying her staff.   So I need the certification to get the promotion, as well as for my job, and I’ve been told to stop working towards requirements for the certification. I think this is considered retaliation and there is a financial loss from this.   Side note: She is still supporting my co-worker in progress towards his certification.  Also, I was told that my informal complaint didn’t impact any decision on approving a transfer. It’s basically political.  There’s a lot of other examples I have documented of unfair treatment but I don’t want to make this post too long.   Ultimately, I have great job security. I like my job and I don’t want to let one supervisor stop me from pursuing what I need to do to advance my career. I also don’t want to jeopardize my chances of working with the other state or anyone to think this is just complaining because I want t to transfer.  Any advice on what to do here? Pursue discrimination case or retaliation case? I was thinking about filing an informal grievance and going from there.   Thanks in advance!	No
126	So I feel like a total idiot, but it has already been done. A couple months ago I had a guy ask tons of questions about a smartphone I was selling, and I answered. After some back and forth he bought it. Once he had received it, he said the Sprint SIM card he had would not work. He formally requested a refund through eBay, then opened a case against me for 'product different from the advertised product'. I was exasperated after he asked me to act as tech support, and I had tried, with no results. I refunded him. He never sent it back.  PayPal and eBay both tell me I shouldn't have refunded it, but the case against me made it sound like I had to refund quickly. I feel like an 80 yr old with her first computer to fall for whatever scam it was.   They also say to report it to my local police. I keep putting it off because I see no hope in doing so. Does anyone know if the police in Iowa could do anything? Thanks for your time.	No
127	"Quick question and I'll delete once answered.  I'm renting a town home from a husband and wife who own a few properties around my town. The lease is the shortest I've ever signed, probably because they're not a huge complex or company. The lease is pretty standard and we've had no issues with anything since moving in. When my fiancé went to drop the rent off, he had left a lease for us to take home and sign. It's the same lease we signed when we moved in, with only the dates changed.   One of the clauses (if that's the right word, but basically description)  in the lease is ""deposit:"" then something along the lines of a $650 non-refundable deposit due at the start of the lease. We paid this at move in. I emailed him for clarification and I'm sure he will say we don't have to but here is my question to you:   Is the email sufficient enough as an agreement in the event he tries to charge us and takes us to court as proof we don't need to pay it? (Although i doubt this will happen, I've read horror stories on here so now I'm second guessing everything) or should we go in together, sign it with him, and have him edit that part with initials?   Thanks!   TL;DR - lease renewal mentions paying a deposit already paid. Is an email agreement that we don't need to pay it enough in the event they later say we owe it or should we have them edit the lease?"	No
128	"Here's the background: My ex-husband moved out of state (from OR to WA) about 4 years ago, and has visited our daughter (F, 12) maybe 4 times in those years. He has drug/alcohol/legal troubles, and is currently sitting in county jail awaiting a trial for domestic violence that will likely send him to prison for 5 years (that's the plea bargain).   We have ""joint custody"" and have since 2009, but our daughter has lived with me and with my husband (her stepfather) that whole time. I've discussed getting official full custody a few times, and it's just never seemed worth it. (He can't afford any child support; he's often homeless; he doesn't try to see her or have her for Christmas/vacations anyway, and so for all practical purposes, we really do have ""full custody"" anyway.)   But now, with this prison sentence looming, I'd like for my husband to be able to adopt her. I know I need to have his parental rights terminated, and I'm meeting with a lawyer next week to have that first conversation. Just a few questions:  We have a $100 consultation, but I'm wondering if after that, I'd be able to do most of this paperwork on my own. Does that seem reasonable? Or am I going to have to really sign up for the full deal with the lawyer? If so, does anyone have a rough ballpark of what that might cost so I can start figuring that end out? Are there any particular questions I should ask at our meeting?  And finally... this IS a good idea, right? It's possible and worth it?  Thank you, thank you!"	No
129	This happened in Washington, DC in March 2015. I was going to school there and dating a guy. We had been dating for about 18 months when the rape happened. He was very verbally and mentally abusive, and had me completely under his thumb. I was also suffering from depression and untreated anxiety at the time. He penetrated me while I was sleeping. I immediately felt assaulted, but I didn't file a report because I was too depressed to make myself do anything and too afraid of him.  I've been haunted by this ever since it happened. I still feel violated, I still have issues with intimacy, I still have huge issues with distrust. I know he's out there being successful and living his life with no consequences while I deal with nothing but pain. I feel like the only way I can move on is if I get some sort of justice.   But there are problems:  -I don't live in Washington, DC anymore. I ended up transferring colleges.   -It was so long ago. I don't even remember the exact date and time.   -We had consensual sex before he raped me and consensual sex afterwards, because I was in shock and afraid. I know that kind of thing looks bad to police and juries though.   -He asked me if he had raped me several times and I always told him no. I only said no because I still loved him like a fool, and I was terrified. But I know it makes me look really bad.   I would change what I did and said if I could in a heartbeat, but I can't.   Do the lawyers here recommend that I report him anyway? Would I look like a liar or someone who wanted revenge? And how would I go about it since I don't live in the same state that it happened, and I don't remember some vital details?  Thank you	No
130	I don't know if there's any recourse here. I forgot to get insurance so I don't have anyone to cover a hotel for a month. I don't have $3000 extra for a hotel for a month (cheapest I could find with a pet is $100 a month). It's estimated apartment repairs will take a month and then I'll be allowed back into my apartment. Thankfully nothing in my unit was destroyed and I did talk to insurance about getting a policy as soon as I do move back in. I understand it was a mistake to not purchase and I usually do. I don't know why I forgot. I don't know what my options are except to be a wilderness man (go camping) as I don't have family in the area.	No
131	Hello,  Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I was concerned about overexposition to the stock market, and asked my wife in late 2015 to make changes.  She ignored my request.   I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax.   I feel overburdened because while my exwife claims a sizeable share of these funds, she has completely ignored anything related to stewardship.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.  Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case for a while now, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending to be unavailable, or absent from the country, or that they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months..., just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.   Any advice appreciated.	No
132	"So I'm fuming because for the 3rd time in the past month I've had painters my property managers have hired have just hopped my back patio fence and started moving my patio furniture around. To cut out the personal parts of it, I'm trying to figure out the interpretation of the [Washington RCW](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.150) vs. what I feel is right.   Originally, a notice was provided that stated on a specified date pressure washing would start and that painting would begin afterward. No final date was given, and no specific window of time for the entries were given. I complained because entry #1 was made at this stage, and a new general notice was put all over the building because of my complaint.   This new notice, however, stated that starting on a specified date painters would be accessing the external portions of the units and gave a window of time (8AM-6PM), but no specific end date. They also gave no unit specific entry information. The second entry happened during this period. I complained to the painters directly and asked them to notify me if they were planning on entering and neglected to complain directly to the property manager as when I reread the notice it did kind of say ""hey they'll be entering"".   Well today the third entry occurred, about 4 days after I've last seen them around. My girlfriend was home alone and naked in bed adjacent to a window, fortunately the blinds were drawn, however the window itself was open (i.e. she could hear them complaining about the open window; mind you it's the middle of summer). The notices at this point had been removed, and no final date of entry for the painters was ever supplied. The painters supplied a handscrawled note saying ""painters will be behind unit today"" or something to that effect on the front door this morning at some point.   I complained to my property manager again, who reviewed her ""general posting"" as she called it and told her that the notices had been removed so I assumed that the ill-defined period had expired and I was mad that the painters had entered without notice again (unclear on my expectation of notice). At this point, she responded ""politely"" asking what I wanted and I stated that I wanted a legal notice of entry to be provided at least 24 hours in advance (the law seems to say 48 hours notice...).   I have made no effort to stop their entry excepting challenging them on who they are and why they are there. I feel the entries are unreasonable because it doesn't seem right to have an open ended period of time that I should have to bring my patio stuff inside and close the blinds to maintain privacy when the patio is a part of my unit. I just want a more practical window of time, and proper notice to prepare for that practical time window (i.e. protect my stuff by bringing it inside).   Is there any recourse, and can anyone advise on what kind of notice should be expected?"	No
133	"My wife and I recently got married and headed over to the social security office in our city to change her name. She decided that she ""hates"" her middle name and thus requested it to be changed to her mothers first name. Normally, they don't ask you questions about a maiden name change if you have your marriage license on you.   Long story short the name got changed and about a month later, which is today, we headed into the DMV to update her license to a newer version with her new name on it. They told us at the DMV that the name was changed without a petition of the court indicating a lawful name change. How can I get this fixed? Why did the social security office allow us the get the name changed if it is unlawful? What course of action should I take?    Thank you for reading my long post.    TL; DR: Wife and I got married, tried to change her middle name to something unrelated, social security did it, DMV told us we messed up and sent us to the clerk court, now we either pay money to fix it, or change her name back."	No
134	"Background info that you need to know: My dad has physically abused me for basically my entire life, and my mom their entire marriage (has become a lot less frequent in the later years of their marriage, but he still threatens her with a raised hand. Also, she has kind of learned not to speak out against him because she understands the physical threat that he poses to her). Up until recently I just took the abuse and did nothing about it, but over the past year and a half or so I've been standing up for myself and threatening to dial 9-1-1 if he stepped closer (first time I did this was when he was threatening to beat me with a bat because i accidentally lost one of his papers -- locked the door and put the phone up to the window so he could see) and even using my own strength to stop him from hitting me - not hitting back, just using my arms to hold his down.  Also, my dad has been financially abusive his entire life. My mother works 5 days a week and makes almost as much money as he does on top of the countless hours of housework that she does and the abuse that she has to go through from him, and still she is barely ever allowed to spend money on anything for herself. Every penny she spends is policed by my dad and he goes so far as to make her return things that he does not approve of. He barely gives me any money to spend (probably has given me on average like 5 bucks every 2 months -- he hasn't even given me a birthday present or a graduation present or anything), which isn't such a big deal on its own and honestly it may seem like I'm complaining about a first-world problem and sound like a little brat but what makes it awful is that he did not allow my sisters and me to get jobs while each of us were in high school (although with some convincing I managed to get permission to get one near the end of my senior year of high school, but I couldn't find a job all throughout the summer), so basically we all wanted money to spend but he would not let us work nor would he give us money. He's even been known to take money from us that we received from other family members on special occasions, which is why we've learned to hide our money even around our own house.  Also, he makes every decision in the household for both himself and my mother and she plays a very small role in any of those decisions if any at all, even though she is a breadwinner just like he is. He threatens her with physical abuse or raises his voice at her if she doesn't comply with what he chooses to do, and eventually she just gives in like always.  I planned to move into my college dorm (university is in NJ) on the 31st of September to start my freshman year of college. The payment for my first semester costs, including tuition and housing and everything, is due on the 17th of August, and it's not small amount of money that I can pull out of nowhere in 7 days. --------------------------------------  So, over the past few months, things have been getting pretty heated between me and my dad. I don't see him much during the day, but on the occasion that I'd still be awake when he came back from work, we'd usually fight about something, and the fights have been getting more and more frequent.  Tonight, my whole family was in the car on the way back from an event, and he asks me about my roommate, and somehow, like always, one thing leads to another and we're arguing with each other again. He says to me ""Ok, well if this is how it's going to be, then we're not going to be paying for your college. You're on your own."" I told him to stop using the word ""we"" as if my mom had any choice to make in the first place -- I told him to say what he truly meant and use the word ""I"", because everyone knows it's only him that makes any big decision like that ever and speaks on behalf of both my parents. Even though my mom makes her own money, if she wanted to pay for my college fees, she wouldn't be able to because my dad would not allow her -- or at least she feels too threatened to try anything like that. We usually have this argument and it blows over in a few days, except this time I went even further and told him that he basically ruined my life and called him out for physically, mentally, and emotionally abusing me throughout my entire life and doing the same to my mother throughout their entire marriage. This got him especially upset, and as we were coming out of the car, he rushed to the back, clearly very angry, and I knew straight away what he was about to try and do, so I locked the door and punched in 9-1-1 on my phone and showed him. Eventually, I got out of the car safely, but he would not let me back in.   So yeah, after much threatening over the years, my dad had finally kicked me out of the house for the first time ever. I called up one of my friends but by the time he got to my house (about 2 hours ago) my mom told me she wanted me to come in and just say sorry to my dad, but there was no way I was going back inside there, so I just left for a little and my friend and I hungout and I planned to stay over his house for the night like he had offered, but my mom wanted me back home and had convinced my dad to let me stay, so I just went back. And now here I am, typing all of this that literally just happened and my dad's upstairs and things are extremely heated between us and this is the first time that I'm actually legitimately concerned about what's going to happen in my future after a threat from my dad, because our argument tonight actually went way beyond the level that it usually does.  I still have to get a new phone and laptop for college which my dad had promised me, so that's also a problem, because I doubt he's going to be paying for those things any time soon. I'm going to ask my mom to help me out on her own without my dad but I know it's possible she might not agree because she would not even think of going against my dad's word. As I mentioned before, the payment is due on the 17th of August and I do not think between now and then that my dad will change his mind about paying for it, and even if he does, I do not want to remain under his fiscal control like my sisters have all throughout their college years, because they go through hell whenever they want to make a decision about their lives and I don't want to put myself in that situation. I'm completely lost, I have no clue what to do. Please help.  P.S. sorry if there's a lot of useless information in here, I just wanted to put the stuff about my dad because it seemed to me like a lot of it was illegal and it might help. Also, I'm just a complete mess of emotions and my thoughts are running crazy right now."	No
135	Hi legal advice! This is one of my favorite subs and an old situation has been bugging me on and off for years. At the insistence of my partner at the time I let the situation go but I've always wondered what I might have done.  My partner and I lived in a daylight basement of a split house - we had the entire basement and our neighbors the whole top. When moving in, the landlord mentioned in passing past plumbing issues but said all had been resolved. After a few months, our section flooded with backed up wash and toilet water (approximately 2-3 inches of poop scented water), leading to the damage of some electronics. The culprit was deemed the upstairs neighbors flushing 'flushable' wipes which caught in and blocked a poorly designed section of plumbing, leading to sewage backing up through a floor drain. Upon talking to the plumber, the landlord had been previously advised the system would continue to backup until the bad piping was replaced but he had elected to do nothing. Basically, he lied to us about the plumbing issues being rectified. We confronted him about this and, as he claimed to have insufficient funding to fix actually fix the issue, offered to let us out of our lease early and with only ten days notice. He also offered, via email, to replace the electronics if we provided him with an appraisal of value.  We proceeded to find another home while the apartment filled with sewage water another three times. We literally found floating nuggets of feces at one point. The smell was awful so we stayed with my parents. During this time, the landlord became aggressive, repeatedly telling us that he would hold us fully responsible if he found we had contributed to the clogging in any way. I provided the valuation and the landlord dragged his feet, never giving me a date for which I'd get a check. After a couple of weeks, I demanded an update on the status of the reimbursement. He claimed due to my rudeness he had rescinded his offer to replace my damaged goods. We attempted to get the plumber to provide us with written documentation regarding the landlord's refusal to fix the plumbing. They called the landlord to get his permission, and he promptly called and lambasted us.  Upon finding a new unit, we gave written notice and calculated prorated rent for ten days. After delivering the notice to the landlord, he became extremely aggressive, saying we would pay for the entire month of rent or he would take us to court. I wanted to prorate the amount anyhow, especially since the apartment was uninhabitable, but my ex-partner was spineless and insisted we just give in and forget it. I was a chump and went along with her, despite wanting to take him to court.  After leaving, he refused to perform a post-move walk-through with us but deducted the entirety of our deposit due to the state of the apartment, all caused from backed up sewage, and claimed the window mount air conditioners were all missing, a complete fabrication, and demanded we compensate him for their value. I told him to get bent and he threatened to sue but never did. All in all, we were out about $1200 (~$2500 if you count the electronics), not a lot but a sizable sum at the time.  Oh sages of /r/legaladvice, what sayest ye? Should I have taken it to small claims court or was it not worth the trouble, as my ex-partner insisted? I actually still have everything documented, could I possibly even sue now, four years later?	No
136	"Hi! My question is related to visas/immigration stuff/employment.   I am not a U.S. citizen and as an international student I completed a bachelors degree in education at an american college.

137	I want to make a brand of cat plush toys and coloring books. I was planning on naming it Mushu, but the dragon from the Mulan movie has that name. I searched the trademark website and it said the trademark for that is 'dead.' So would it be okay to use that name for the company and the products?	No
138	Hey all. Sorry if I come off as a noob when it comes to legal matters.  About 2 months ago, someone left a threatening note on my door. I was pretty certain it was my roommate's friend (let's call him michael) who I got kicked out of the apartment because he was staying there while my roommate wasn't. I filed a police report just to have it on record and notified the private security company that works for the apartment complex I'm staying at.  Just recently, while I was away for the weekend, someone broke in through my window and took my guitar and my speaker (roughly $500 - $600 in combined value). Also some of the walls are slightly damaged. I filed a supplemental police report. I strongly suspected it was Michael.   When I notified the security company, they sent one of their officers over to my unit just to ask me some questions. The officer said that he saw someone who fit Michael's exact description messing with my window and approached him and asked if he lived there. Michael told the officer that he was the one living in my unit. Then the officer just kept making his rounds around the complex.   Just this week, the apartment complex switched to a different security company. Idk if that's relevant or suspicious or anything like that. Just thought it was weird.  Really all I want is to be reimbursed for my losses, and to not be charged for damages to my apartment. Can I do anything about it? Would I have to go after the apartment complex or the security company?  Any input would be appreciated. Cheers!	No
139	Her lease is/was only a 1 year lease so she hasn't been in this apartment long, but her apartment is absolutely infested. I'm talking you walk into the kitchen (without food, trash or dishes sitting out) and there's roaches crawling around everywhere.   There's also the issue of the bees, which I guess nested right outside her window? We find many dead bees by her bedroom window, and often have to just ignore one flying around (or kill it but I feel bad killing bees lol). She's actually been stung twice now.  Finally the last major issue is a broken thermostat. The original thermostat in her apartment looked as though it was from the early 90s. A mercury one I think. It was broken throughout the year and it took until this past month for them to replace it.  Of course, they've put in work orders over these issues. She's has the ability to look at the work order history for her unit, but it appears either the apartment company's system changes the dates automatically or someone is changing them manually. One example is a work order she has a confirmation email (which she has for many others as well) is dated April 25th, and the work order system says the work order was submitted at midnight 6/20, and completed at 11 AM 6/20...  Any course of action possible here?   Location is state of Georgia as well.	No
140	"We're in Minnesota, USA. My husband had a piece of equipment worth $10,000 stolen from our vehicle in the parking lot of our apartment building. We have cameras facing where our vehicle was parked, and we have an open police report, but our apartment landlords are refusing to look over the tapes because, ""we don't have a two-hour time frame of the crime."" We have a 6-hour window from parking and realizing the car was burglarized, but that isn't good enough for them. They won't let us review the tapes ourselves, and the officers don't really care about a petty theft case unless the office can see someone with the piece of equipment (it's rather large).   Is there any sort of legal action we can pursue to get our landlord to review the tapes?"	No
141	"After many years of no contact I reached out to my father in prison. He quickly sent me paperwork to become his POA, which my aunt (his sister) has had up to this point. My dad has legal trouble in both NY and PA and is constantly appealing and transferring between both states.   My father was in his 60s when he went to prison and actually retired from his job, so he gets checks each month. He wants the money put into an account for legal fees and other expenses, and some taken out for commissary. He thinks his sister is taking his money (I highly doubt it) and that he wants me to take over.   I have a general understanding of POA but my dad has a sketchy past financially. I'm in nursing school full time, and financial aid pays for my schooling, and I'm not sure if having this financial POA counts as my income or his own. Do I have to file taxes on it? If it counts as income this might cut my financial aid back which would be devastating. My dad claims he owes nothing, but I know my dad had debt (I watched many cars get towed for non payment growing up) and have gotten phone calls for outstanding bills. Will they/can they come after me if I have POA? Can that effect my credit?  I can't afford to talk to a lawyer about this situation, and I'm not sure of my fathers current credit or debt. His past was always a secret and he lies a lot.   My mom is advising me not to, saying my aunt had problems with other inmates sending her threatening letters wanting his money. My dad talks to ""jail house lawyers"" aka inmates a lot and they wanted compensation from his retirement, so they threatened my aunt apparently via letters.   I'm unsure what to do really. I want to help him but I don't know much about POA, and googling only tells me so much. I'm trying to keep good credit and my debts to a minimum, and I feel like this can come back to bite me. Please help!"	No
142	My boyfriend started renting a house in June. He inquired about signing a lease multiple times but the landlord never had him sign a lease. He has been paying all his rent and utilities on time. The house has multiple issues, including a leaking/sinking in roof, walls, clogged pipes, possibly black mold in the bathroom, and overall needs to be deep cleaned. Not a great place, I know. As my bf did his walk through he noted all these issues and since has messaged the landlord multiple times about fixing everything. The landlord response was to do nothing. He's already looked into moving out into a new apartment in August.   Now, my bf and I were supposed to take a road trip out to my home state in June, so I came out to the house so we could get ready to go. After some unexpected expenses, we couldn't go on the trip until the following month. I have been staying with him since.  Today, the other tenet who holds the primary lease (who he has had many issues with, including the landlord telling bf she tried to take money from his overpaying the rent) started yelling at my bf that he needed to pay back rent for me staying here. The landlord never said that I had to leave or that I had to pay anything while I have been here, and when we called to talk to my bf's dad he said that he has never heard of such a thing and he would ask his attorney.  Any advice would be helpful, neither of us have had to deal with all these issues before.	No
143	I got a speeding ticket about a week ago in Florida. Not my county but next over. Its only $131 and I just want to pay it and get it done with. I called and the lady said give it a few days and told me to check again and I did and its still not there. They use a 3rd party ncourts for payments. They have no record nor the county clerks office! Don't they have to make it available for me to pay? What are my options here? Should I challenge it? I dont mind paying I just need it taken care off to not worry. What should I do, and the officer also did not mention anything about points on my licence, is was doing 79 in a 70. He followed me for 25 min through another county until I entered his just to nail me.	No
144	"I rent a room in a house with two other guys and the owner himself.  On the lease it does not specify how utilities are to be paid only that rent is to be paid by the 5th of each month.  The LL wants each tenant to pay a portion of the utility bill but ALSO pay double that as an advance for the next month.  Example: June came to $100 in utilities. Each person will pay $50 to the LL and get a $25 ""credit"" so if the cost of next month is $125, each person will pay (125/4)*2-25 =$37.5. (Do note that $100 would not be problem but in AZ, air conditioning is driving the monthly electricity cost to about $400/mo.)  Can he do this? I think this is incredibly unreasonable since you get a month to pay your utility bill anyways and I could be using the money during that period of time."	No
145	My 50's mother in currently in a temp (6 month full-time I think) position and a permanent position opened in the vacancy of her coworker, same job just permanent.  She was told not to apply because it would interfere with her position possibly going permanent. Within a week of that, the application on the other position closed and she was also told her job was not being changed to permanent. They were going to close her temp and open an identical perm job in her slot that doesn't have a new application period but is pulling from the list of candidates from the job she was told not to apply for. She was told afterward that they were specifically looking for someone 'energetic and outgoing' in both positions. Given the fact that she was told she might be changed over, and was told she wasn't right after application closed, it is really fishy. Is this a defendable age discrimination case?	No
146	Hi all,   My mom and dad share joint ownership over a piece of property in the town of Pascagoula, Mississippi. My dad wants to transfer his ownership to me, so he suggested using a Quit Claim Deed to sign over his portion of ownership to me.   Could anyone advise whether this would work?   I understand a Quit Claim Deed transfers ownership with no warranty, but I'm unsure of whether it would apply in this case due to the nature of split ownership.   Thank you all	No
147	[Iowa] She'll sometimes not let me leave the house and take my phone so I have no way to talk to my friends, lately I've just been using my 3ds to message them. If I just left the house could she call the police and make them take me back? She also won't let me ride in friends cars but I can't find anything that says it's illegal for me to do it without her consent even though she says it is.	No
148	Hi. I'm 18 years old and I would prefer to switch from both parents for a week at a time to one parent permanently. Are there any legal repercussions and how should I go about this?	No
149	A neighbor of mine has caused a lot of major neighborhood problems. He's mostly yelled at neighbors, unprovoked (i.e., riding up to them on his bike and calling them names), trespassed after being asked not to, and actually just yesterday assaulted someone with a shovel. I don't know the situation on that last one (whether it was provoked or not, but there was a woman screaming at him that he had raped her daughter. He also happens to have a conviction for child rape. Goody.), but my husband and I got security camera footage of it sent to the cops,so we'll see what happens there.     Anyway, before yesterday's assault incident, a cop who had come out previously for a disruption hinted at, though never outright said, that the disruptive neighbor may have schizophrenia or another severe mental illness, and suggested that we as a neighborhood (not an official HOA or anything but we've all been affected by this guy) write a letter to his parents, who own the house he's in.    Are there legal guidelines for this (i.e., citing each incident we've had), or is it open to interpretation?	No
150	"We live on a lake in North Carolina where a development is going in across the street. Our driveway is directly across from one of the entrances to this new subdivision, which is mostly finished except for maybe 20 or so houses on the side of the subdivision closest to us. We had about 2.25 inches of rainfall in an hour or so yesterday which lead to a very large amount of silt deposited in our flower beds, in front of our garage door (some inside the garage), around the back of the house under our deck, etc etc. A large amount of debris traveled with the water and much of our mulch has been carried away.  As far as I can tell, the rainwater washed into the development's street, past the silt fences, quickly clogged the storm drains (because of the silt catchers they place in the drains), and then ran straight down the street, across the road between our house and the subdivision, and then down our driveway. I ran into the developer today who fed me a line about the gas company destroying the silt fence and not fixing it properly and how he's going to see if they'll fix it and clean up the silt for us. He was very clear that he's not going to take responsibility for the runoff because ""it was a 1,000-year rain that won't happen again"", and apparently other houses had mulch washed away (which I see no evidence of). He's going to send his guys out to start cleaning up the silt, but he won't pay for any landscaping because the water would have done that anyway. Which, of course, is complete BS because the silt clogged the storm drains. It seems to us, based on previous storms, that the installed drainage is not sufficient to deal with the runoff created by the subdivision. Whether or not it will get better once all of the houses are built and grass starts to grow, I can't say.   I would greatly appreciate some guidance on where to go from here? Contact our home insurer? Contact the county? There has to be a precedent for this.  Thank you."	No
151	Seattle, WA  My husband and I have lived in this apartment for a little over three years. Our first year's lease was very simple -- just two pages long and pretty boilerplate. When it expired we asked about renewing, but the owner said he was considering extensive renovations and didn't want to extend new leases to anyone just yet. Fine, whatever, it's Seattle, we went month to month. They increased our rent once during the two years we were month to month, but this place is several hundred dollars under market value so it was no big deal.  Fast forward to now and the owners have switched property managers twice. We've been offered a new lease at an increase of $75 per month, up to $1265 (okay) or the option to stay month to month for an increase of $175 per month, up to $1365 (not okay).   The new lease is long, and includes some provisions I've never seen on a lease before. A couple of them make me uncomfortable, because I'm not sure if they're the norm or not.  From the Renter's Obligations: General section:  &gt; To execute all revised rental agreements upon request;  &gt; Not to do or keep anything in or about the Premises that will increase the present insurance rate thereon. Resident agrees to reimburse Owner for any increase that might occur for violation of this rule.  From the Last Month's Rent section:  &gt;Resident paid $1090.00 for last month's rent when the original lease was signed.   As the new lease amount is now $1,265.00, an additional amount of $175.00 is due upon the execution of this renewal.  Are we being paranoid, or are those terms a little sketchy? We've had a good relationship with our landlords and neighbors so far, but we don't want to be held liable for the owner's insurance rates or be forced to sign a new lease every time they want to change a rule.  Maybe worth noting, the new manager seems pretty disorganized. They originally had no record of our cats (who have lived here the whole time and were on our original lease), not a record of us paying our last month's rent when we first moved in (to the tune of $1090, now requesting an additional $175).	No
152	I hired a lawyer to help me out with a legal name change. I submitted to him all my relevant papers and documents. Now it's been two weeks and I haven't heard anything yet. I'll probably ask him for an update, but is this amount of time normal? How long should it be before I hear back about making a court appearance, etc? Is this timeline consistent with usual expectation?	No
153	"This is a strange situation. I feel like I am being harassed in a really weird way.   I broke up with my ex (we'll call him ""John"") 6 years ago. Recently, I've been getting mail (bills, mostly) in John's name sent to my address. Debt collectors are calling my cell phone looking for him. And I even had a man come to my door to deliver a court summons to him! Whenever this happens, I return the mail to the sender. I tell the debt collectors they have the wrong number, etc.   For what it's worth, he was highly abusive. We went no contact after I kicked him out. But that didn't necessarily keep him from harassing me. He eventually stopped. But now he's using my mailing address and phone number as his contact information, and I think it's just a weird way of maintaining some ""control"" over me.  So what on Earth can I do about him using my information? Is this fraud?"	No
154	"This is my first time posting to this subreddit and I'm incredibly nervous writing this, so I apologize if I missed any rules or etiquette.  I'm in a situation currently with a girl I hooked up with a few times 2-3 months back threatening me with possible legal action over a false claim of sexual assault. This is the important part, so I'll get it out of the way first:   This first came about at a party at my apartment with a couple friends, my roommates, myself, and her (we'll call her Sally, not her real name). At the beginning of the party, Sally and I made a few suggestive remarks to each other back and forth, which made it clear to me that she was interested. Later on, after everyone had a few drinks, we met outside and talked about getting in the shower together later. We ended up kissing at this point, but nothing else, and went back inside. Afterwards, I messaged her from the bathroom asking her to come join me as planned, which she did. At this point, we are in the bathroom, still fully dressed, discussing whether or not we should hook up that night. There was some uncertainty since she is good friends with one of my roommates (we'll call her Anna) and neither of us wanted it to end poorly and affect our relationship with Anna. Sally and I are talking this over in between making out and lightly touching over clothes (not genitals, since the law seems to make a distinction there, from what I can understand). After a few minutes of this, she mentions that she thinks she drank too much. I agreed and suggested we talk about it the next day when we're both sober and decide if we wanted to hook up later on. She agreed with this and left the bathroom, then I took a shower by myself. That was the end of any physical interaction between us that day.  After that, Sally messaged me a couple days later saying (and this is a direct quote) ""By the way, thanks for not taking advantage of how intoxicated I was the other day. You're a good guy."" I now have this and many other texts saved and backed up so I can't lose them. After discussing it further over text, we mutually agreed to hook up the next time we met, and ended up having consensual sex a few times over the next couple weeks and she didn't say anything that would leave me to believe she was anything but interested in continuing.  I ended up breaking things off about a month ago because I felt she was getting emotionally invested after we had agreed that it was explicitly a friends with benefits arrangement. She took this perfectly fine at first, said she was disappointed, but understood and respected my decision. However, just this week, I came home and Sally was waiting for me inside of my apartment (she's good friends with Anna, so she was waiting inside). She asked to speak with me outside to go over some paperwork. Confused on what paperwork she could've been referring to, I agreed to follow her since as far as I knew, things were just a little rocky between us since I broke things off, but we were still friends.  To my surprise, she pulled out a printout she claims came from a local police station highlighting the changes to the law made by A.B. 2888 and A.B. 701 (the amendments to California's definition of rape to include additional sex acts and mandate a minimum prison sentence of 3 years for any such cases, which was brought on by the Brock Turner case, to my understanding). She explained that I had hurt her so badly that she saw a therapist, and that therapist urged her to go to the police since she thought I had sexually assaulted her based on Sally's description of the events. She went on to say that she did end up going to the police station with a guy who is now her boyfriend and that the police wanted to go out and arrest me that day, but she refused to give them my name because she ""doesn't want to ruin my life and thinks I'm a good person"". She also mentioned more than once that she's had to stop her now-boyfriend from coming over to physically attack me at my apartment or work, but that if I were anyone else, she would've given both the police and her boyfriend my information. I don't have any of these threats in writing since they were verbal, but it was bad enough that Anna went as far as to tell me that I should have my security guard at work escort me for a while since she keeps mentioning that he wants to hurt or kill me (I'm honestly not sure which).  I spent some time explaining to her why I was confused that there is even any question of everything between us being consensual, she agreed that she did consent at all times, but that during our first interaction her consent was not valid because she was under the influence of alcohol. Mind you, I also had a few drinks that day and we never did anything beyond make out and lightly grope. I wish I could say there was more to her claim, but the only thing that differs between our stories is that she is now saying she tried pushing away four times, but that never actually happened. I tend to be pretty timid about making moves, so any sign like that would deter me immediately. She also told me that she wanted me to agree to take counseling so so that I don't hurt other women and suggested that if I didn't do so, she was going to go the legal route. After all of this, she asked if we could still be friends, which I reluctantly agreed to, simply to avoid escalating the issue any further. I immediately went to sleep in my room and that was the last I saw of her. I later found out that she had spent the night with Anna, as I saw her car still there as I was leaving for work.  As confident as I am the claim is invalid, I'm obviously not a lawyer, so I don't know what I need to do to protect myself. I made an appointment to speak with a criminal defense lawyer in case she does decide to proceed with her threat to pursue legal action, but I'm still scared in the meantime, both of being falsely charged and of being physically harmed. I'm not a big guy and don't think I could defend myself against most people, which is especially concerning because I don't know what her boyfriend looks like. I'm currently staying at various friends' houses that she doesn't know for the time being for my safety. I also asked that Anna not allow her over for the time-being, as I'm concerned about her going through my things.  Any help or suggestions would be immensely appreciated. I don't know where else I can reach out in the meantime. If there's anything I can clarify, let me know and I'll do my best to clear it up. Thank you."	No
155	Last Thursday my husband and I woke up to our basement flooded with sewage pouring up out of the drains. We called a plumber who managed to stop the backup but said the sewer line was broken on the city's end so they'd have to fix it and that if it wasn't fixed it would back up again soon.  We called the city and were told that they won't even come look at it because they would be able to tell if it was on their end so we need to call a plumber.   We called a 2nd plumber out and were told the same thing. It's a broken city pipe so he can't touch it. We took both reports down to the city building and were still told that it can't be theirs and that they aren't plumbers and don't just come out to look at people's pipes.   I guess I'm looking for advice on who actually is responsible for fixing it? If we can't touch it and the city won't fix it is there someone else we can call? All I want to do is get it taken care of but I'm honestly not sure what to do now and I'm terrified it's going to flood again at this rate.	No
156	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
157	"Hey everyone, not expecting to get a ton of feedback on this but anything would be appreciated. So let's get started. My mother is currently renting out a house on the property of her landlord and long story short they made a ""verbal agreement"" that her contract would only last six months. Welllllllll the ACTUAL contract says that the lease is terminated when both parties agree on a termination date. So, no set date but seems kind of odd. Six months is approaching as of July 30th but the landlord is stating that my mother cannot move out and must continue to rent from her because she ""needs to protect herself"" by attempting to force my mother to continue to rent. My mother is trying to leave on said date above but is worried that the contract is binding her and she is forced to live here until the landlord deems that she may go. The landlord has since ceased to respond to my mother or attempting to work anything out and is straight up ignoring her now. Any suggestions or insight on how legal any of this is or how stuck my mother actually is? Can the landlord legally obligated her to continue renting because of he contract wording? Thanks in advance."	No
158	I just heard someone fire 5 to 6 shots and it was very close to my house. I do not want to bring police to my house because if someone just got shot, I'm really not trying to be next.   I'm not experienced with fire arms, but I have used them before. It's that same distinct popping sound. Sounded like it came from a handgun or a low caliber rifle.	No
159	Hi there. Me and my two roommates live with our landlord. The lease states that we are to divide all utility bills evenly BUT, there recently has been a piping leak that has caused the gas bill to skyrocket. The landlord wanted us to split that very high bill but me and my two other roommates refused because it does not seem fair to be penalized for faulty piping and house infrastructure. The landlord has now contracted plumbers to fix the issue but gave no warning on how long the repairs would take and that we would have no running water or working toilets. She has made the house a hostile environment and my roommates and I want out of the lease. Is there any way this can be done?	No
160	"Me and my friend are two students who enter college this year, and it is rather hard to find an apartment in Berlin where we want to study, since we live 6 hours away from it.  So last friday I find a fitting apartment on one of those websites where you search for apartments etc, and contact the person who put it on there. The text about the rooms sound good, but there is only an email adress at the end without a name to contact him. He replies the same day, telling me some details about the rooms in englisch (not in german, which I rather expected because the description of the rooms also where in german). I reply in englisch and ask for pictures of the rooms because there werent any on the website, and I also tell him that I can talk to him in german if he wants, because I thought he may be only writing in englisch because there are many foreign students who come to Berlin to study.   He then tells me ( still in englisch) that he Is in America until the end of the year, and asks me about details when we want to move in etc. This conversation goes on for a bit, notice that I still dont know his name or anything, but he sends me some pictures, which look good for a student apartment and seem to be connected to each other ( meaning they belong to the same apartment), although He said doesnt have a layout plan of the rooms.  I then agree and say that I like the apartment and ask on how to make it official. His response is:  He will send me a contract which I have to sign and send back to him, then transfer the deposit and the rent of the first month, and then we will send me the keys per mail.   He doesnt want to send the keys to a friend so we can visit the flat at first, because of ""past experiences"".  ----This is where I thought this may be suspicious.  I started to do some research on the Adress of the object, and found out that the same rooms where put on multiple apartment websites, but unlike the one which I found it on, these ones had a name at the contact part. I searched it up and it seemed to be an artist living in Berlin who even said on a website that he makes his rooms available for tourists to live in.   The next day I get the contract after he asked for some of my personal Information. Now this one is finally written in german but there are  obvious grammatical Errors in them which suggests that it is a rather poorly translated contract. It also Turns out that its not the person whose name is on the other websites, but the adress on them and the description text is the exact same as the one i applied for.  I ask him if its possible that we visit the rooms to make sure everything is as we discussed it and then we would sign the contract immediately.  Now he replied with the following:  ""As I told you earlier I only have the keys of the flat with me here so there's no way I can show you. I told you about this things previously and you agreed that I should send the contract to your email. Well, I understand if you cannot proceed but I assure you of safety with your money because the contract is legal from my lawyer.  My suggestion is that if you can pay just the rent alone I will post the keys to you and after you receive the keys and move in you pay the deposit. If this is satusfy with you or not please tell me immediately so I won't keep waiting for you all day as I have other interested applicants too.""    Is he trying to talk me into making a quick decision by lowering the price I have to transfer? Or is he a maybe a legit person who wants to get this over with?"	No
161	My condo unit in Alberta had a leak that affected the unit below me while I was away for the weekend, which prompted a call to an emergency repairman.   The cost to have someone come down from a vendor (Honeywell) to enter the unit cost around $750 to turn off the water line. The invoice described having to wait 3 hours for a locksmith to open the door, and another 30 minutes to locate and close the water valve.  Another $1000 was billed to cover the damage to the ceiling of the unit below me. I'm not sure of the damage extent, but can't imagine it being that expensive to fix.  During the entire time, the condo management company did not contact me. I received the bills totaling to $1750 one year later since the accounting department 'forgot' to send the invoices. Both vendors were already paid the excessive and inflated invoices by the condo management company, without any  investigation if they were reasonably billed.  I know during an emergency, if you're not in your condo unit the condo company has a right to enter your property and try to resolve an issue. But the vendors clearly charged excessive price to do simple tasks. I would imagine or hope there is a law in place to protect condo owners from automatically accepting to pay outrageous prices that they cannot shop around or pre-approve of. Otherwise someone could potentially be billed a million dollars to clean up a very minor spill in a hallway, since that happens to be the condo-approved vendor's going rate.  What right do I have regarding these highly inflated invoices paid already by the condo company? Should I hire a lawyer and/or dispute them in court?	No
162	I got married in 2012, divorced in 2014, and was in a related legal battle through May of this year (2017). As such, I have a LOT of paperwork left over... Original marriage certificate, letters from my attorney to myself and copies of what they sent to my ex, letter stating that we are legally divorced, etc.    How long do I need to hang on to this? The final court date I had was, as mentioned, back in May- and at this point everything has been completely finalized. No further issues to resolve in court. Can I shred everything, including the original marriage certificates?    Possibly pertinent information: I do NOT have children, there is no alimony, and no shared assets that were divided up at all (house or otherwise).   Thanks!  **TL;DR**: Went through a divorce + related legal battle, everything is finally resolved- can I shred/burn the papers, or is there some reason I would need them?	No
163	(Virginia) My management company was bought out nearly overnight. We were told that all our leases would be honored. Now that it is the about to be the first of month, we received our bill and it's almost $2,000 more per month for the unit. The management company says they lost our lease (we've emailed them our copies and brought them paper versions). What options do I have?	No
164	Backstory: I'm transferring from my local community college to go to Cal in the Bay Area. Housing was ridiculously hard to find, so I'm living in a small house split into two apartment units with people I've never met. There is 4 rooms being rented out in the unit I'll be living in, and I was the 2nd person to sign a lease for one of the rooms. All 4 rooms were leased out as single rooms to 4 different people. Turns out there is no wall separating two of the rooms. They emailed me saying I can either rent out a room in the other unit that is more expensive because of it being secluded (which I can't afford), or share the room until a wall is built (they still need to get permits from the city) in a couple months. They claimed that the other 2 people that signed up for singles have already moved in. I emailed them back saying I was not pleased about it, but I'll share the room until they get a wall up. This all occurred about a week and a half ago.  Fast forward to yesterday and one of the roommates that supposedly already moved into his single emailed me asking if I could set up the internet because he will not be moving in until the 11th. I signed up for a room, and also will be moving in before him (on the 2nd). Another email came in and made it seem like the other guy with a single room also hasn't moved in.  So my question is, what would happen if I move in and take one of the empty single rooms? The lease I signed states that I'll be getting a single room to myself and the other room is even 50 sq feet smaller than the one I'd be getting after the wall is built. The rent is only a $50/month difference, but I'd be willing to bite the bullet on that if I had to just to guarantee that I'll have privacy. I don't get why the landlord (which is a corporation) is singling me out for sharing a room in the first place since I was the 2nd person to sign up for a room and will be moving in and paying rent for a longer period than the other roommates.  Could they do anything about me taking the other room since they are already breaching the contract we signed by not actually having a room for just me to rent?	No
165	"We had a nasty hail storm come through in May 2016, I made a claim for a full roof replacement and non-roof related repairs such as deck, broken window, fencing, etc.  I went through the claim and broke out the roof-related repairs costs line-by-line to come up with the total cost for the job, since the roofing company would NOT be performing any non-roof related repairs. This is what we agreed on for the cost, and what is reflected in the proposal from the roofer, not including supplements. I even sent them a copy of the claim so they could see for themselves. So, Cost – $500 deductible credit + supplements.  Nearly 6 months later, the roofing company tells me the amount they've successfully negotiated for the supplements, and I receive an additional check from the insurance company to cover them.  The roofing company invoiced me for remaining balance, exactly what was in the proposal, base negotiated cost + supplements (which we now had a figure for). I paid it promptly and in full.  I must have been wrong in thinking that the transaction was over, because the roofing company came back AGAIN and says that ""After auditing the final amount we saw that contractor O&amp;P was not included in the first final invoice we sent. For that I do apologize on that."" and ""as soon as it was discovered we made sure to send it out. This has never happened on any of my jobs and again I do apologize for this oversight.""  First of all, it seems wrong to me that they can come back AFTER the invoice has been paid and ask for more money. If I buy a donut and walk out, you can't chase me down the street and say you messed up and undercharged me. However, I'm not trying to wriggle through get anything for free.  Secondly, the proposal mentions nothing of an additional cost TBD later in addition to base cost + supplements. I called my adjuster and he said that the supplements (that had already been paid) included overhead &amp; profit, and in fact makes up the bulk of the supplement amount.  Thirdly, the insurance company is failing to show me the math of HOW they arrived at this NEW total, and instead is only threatening to put a lien on my house. They say that I MUST give them ALL money that I've received from the insurance company or else they will be in violation of the law for helping me benefit from a claim. Surely they understand that they are not entitled to any money for repairs they did not make, but the bigger question is even IF I received more money for the roof than what we had agreed upon, why would they be entitled to that money? We agreed on a price, and that's what I've paid. If there IS extra money, shouldn't it go back to the insurance company if anything?  I'm trying to get my adjuster to answer one simple question: of the money I've received, how much of it is for roof-related repairs? My policy covers depreciation for the dwelling, but not the detached garage, so looking at these numbers for Replacement Cost, Actual Cash Value, Depreciation.. it's all a bit overwhelming and confusing. It's been difficult getting a straight answer from my adjuster since he's still slammed and is hard to get ahold of. After looking at the claim again, I/we used the Actual Cash Value of the roof-related items to come up with the original cost, now that I have more understanding of how this works, should we have used the Replacement Cost? If so, the cost WOULD be higher, but as I mentioned, I sent them the claim, they looked it over, and we agreed on the price.  This is the first time I've made a claim of this nature and this process has been different than any auto claim I've made. Is there Colorado law that states I must hand over any money I receive regardless of what was agreed upon? If so, why even bother with a proposal? Or are they trying to take advantage of me?  I can supply any real figures if that helps. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks."	No
166	"So I just was told by by my neighbor that their dog was attacked (badly apparently) by mine, in my backyard. It is not fenced, but has an electric fence. My dog will not leave but it doesn't prevent anything else from coming in obviously. If this is true, am I liable for any injuries? Does homeowners cover this?  Also part 2 of the question: my dog has never shown any aggression to other dogs, she has no scratches or cuts, there is no blood on her at all(she has white fur so it would be super easy to see). Frankly, I'm not convinced she did this at all. But if I didn't see the ""incident"" is it basically just his word against nothing? I took pictures of my dog as soon as he told me but other than that I don't have any proof of anything."	No
167	"Hi all, obligatory long time lurker, first time poster  A bit of backstory; I'm currently a student at a college in North Carolina. I moved into my apartment the beginning of January 2017. I took over the previous tenant's lease midway through the school year.  I signed a lease renewal for the 2017/2018 school year back in January 2017.   Additionally, I have a Emotional Support Animal (ESA) that I acquired a letter for legitimately through my regular mental health care provider. When I signed my first lease, all the agency required from me was a signed copy of the letter from my health care provider. I was also not asked to provide any other documentation or sign any forms when I signed my new lease (for the August 2017-July 2018 year) back in January.  I received an email today from my leasing agency that included a form they want all residents with ""assistance animals"" to sign. Most of the conditions on this list are reasonable, for example, the tenant will be fined to repair any damages the animal causes and things along those lines. One policy, however, stuck out to me. It said:  &gt; Animals must be kept in the Accommodated Resident’s assigned room and may not be allowed to roam freely within the unit.      According to the form, the penalty for not abiding by the policies is immediate eviction.  My questions are 1) Can they require me to sign this form after I've already signed my lease months ago? 2) Can they legally ban my ESA from the common areas? (living room, bathroom, kitchen) 3) Can they make me or my ESA leave if I don't sign this form?  I went back and checked my lease, and the only thing it says about animals is their pet policy:   &gt; Tenant agrees that at no time shall any animal or pet of any kind, including, but not limited to dogs, cats, birds, and snakes, be kept or harbored in or about the dwelling unit by Tenant or his guest(s) for any period of time. Tenant agrees that he is responsible for paying a fine that can range from a minimum of three hundred seventy-five dollars ($375.00) or more up to one month’s rent and that his occupancy may be terminated for having an unauthorized pet...  Am I correct in thinking that my ESA does not fall under that policy?  My roommates love my ESA, and there have been no issues with her in the common areas in the past. I'm really not comfortable signing this as it says I cannot keep my ESA, or I will be evicted if I don't follow the listed rules.   [Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/lkQiW) is the full list of policies they are requiring me to sign.  TLDR: Leasing agency I signed a lease with months ago is trying to make me sign a form forcing me to keep my legitimate emotional support confined to just the bedroom of my apartment."	No
168	"Our new scumbag landlord withheld $120 of our security deposit for a professional cleaning crew on our move-out. I let her know that we spent hours cleaning and making the apartment spotless, and we have pictures to show it. However, she says that they always hire a professional cleaning crew, even if it's been cleaned by the tenants and won't refund the money.  Furthermore, there are some scratches and wear on the hardwood floor. Long story short, prior to our move in the old landlord tore up the carpet to replace it, and found the hardwood floor that was previously there. When we moved in, this wood floor already had scratches all over and a big scuff in one place. However since the old landlord let us know about it, we didn't think to take pictures and document it. Then came a new landlord who is handling our move out and is charging us $300 for ""repairs to the scratches.""  There was also peeling paint on two doors when we moved in. We told the maintenance person, but never actually had written correspondence with anyone so she's saying there's no record of it, and she's trying to charge us $100 to repaint the doors.  I'm guessing it's going to come down to filing a claim in small claims court, but except for the pictures we took after cleaning the apartment, we don't really have any proof. I asked the new landlord for the receipts for the repairs and she says she'll try to find them.  If we do file a claim, do we do it in the court where she's located? Or can we do it in the new city we moved to?  Thanks for any advice and suggestions!"	No
169	Manitoba, Canada.  I was in the shower when I heard a knock at my door. I'm not renewing my lease, and the landlord has shown it to several other people, so I just assumed that she was going to show it again. My girlfriend was laying in my bed and I figured she could answer any question if they had any(she doesn't live with me, but is there enough to field most questions)  I got out just as they were leaving, but didn't see my landlord anywhere. I ask my girlfriend if she had see her, and she told me that the landlord didn't accompany them, and that they had unlocked the door. At which point I heard the relock the door as well.  I was pretty weirded out by this, so I went to speak with the landlord and she wasn't home. As far as I know that person still has the keys to my place. The rental agency won't be open until Tuesday for me to call either.  Is this legal? Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again?	No
170	Long story short, I’ve been sick for a few months, unable to work, and pay my rent.  My landlord went through the eviction process, and we had a court date set for August 3rd. I didn’t bother to go because you’re required to pay to file a response or go, and I knew I owed the money (less than $2,000 if that matters). From what I had read, I would be given about a month to find a new place to live, which was okay with me.  Today, 6 days after the court case, I received a package from my landlord with the court document that stated the judgement for forcible entry and detainer was stayed until tomorrow.  Does this mean I can be forcibly removed as early as tomorrow? Do I have any legal way to give myself some more time? I have nowhere to go (I recently moved here for a job, so I have no friends here), and have no means to live out of until I find a place. I have no money until I get paid on the $15th, and my boss/person who does payroll is out of town so I can’t ask for an advance.	No
171	I was on my way home from picking my girlfriend up from work about 3 weeks ago. It was just after 11 pm and I had a friend accompany me since we were hanging out anyways and we wanted to grab a bite to eat after. I pull up to a red left turn arrow and waited for it to turn green, the light proceeds to turn green (green, not flashing yellow, to be clear) so I accelerate to get onto the ramp that heads onto the freeway, halfway across the intersection I see headlights to my right side and half a second later an F350 with a pushbar is shearing through the front end of my car and I'm screaming what the fuck. The airbags did not deploy for whatever reason. I go into emergency mode and tell my passengers to get out of the car, and get to safety since my car was smoking and I didn't know if it would start on fire or not. The other driver (who's truck was totally fine) walked over and admitted fault, I proceeded to bitch at him for being a reckless fucking idiot who could have killed all 3 of us while also contacting police. So the cop shows up, takes mine and my passenger's statements, and goes to talk to the guy who had just gotten off the phone with his boss since it was a work truck. This was my first accident so I was totally caught off guard and didn't have much of an idea of what to do. I took pictures of my car and the intersection, and also took a picture of his license plate and insurance information. The past 3 weeks have been a jumble of phone calls and trying to figure out what the hell to do to get what's owed to me. Fast forward yesterday, I finally get a hold of their insurance agent amd she tells me she will send out an adjuster to estimate the damages and whatever else they do so here I am waiting until I get another call from their agent today. Apparently they are denying my claim due to insufficient evidence that it was their drivers fault. I've never been involved in anything like this and I have no idea where to start besides getting a hold of the police report. So I guess my question would be what the hell do I do now?  Sorry for the wall of text, not good at formatting on mobile.	No
172	Please let me know of any errors and things that I can improve upon. Sorry in advance.   I can't take this anymore. I want to leave this house and be my own person. I am tired of being threatened to leave by my parents. I do so much for them and they hate me.  I am 20 years old, unemployed, and have no car or drivers license. I was adopted unofficially and have no legal paperwork and have no idea if I even have a SSN or any means to get legal help in my situation. For all my life I have been treated as a glorified slave and nanny. I have pretty much raised all 3 of my younger siblings because my parents always had to work (which I understand) but it's way past the normal help here and there. I watched them as babies and fed and bathed them, I took them to school and all of that since I was 8 or so. For 20 years I have been the backbone of my family.  Although I didn't provide financial help I did do pretty much every thing else even cooking and cleaning after my siblings parents and grandparents. They don't even seem to realize how unhappy I am. I asked my parents for my information so I could get a job and they don't have it, they  flat out refused for 20 years to help me change that. Since  I graduated HS in 2015 they've been telling me to leave the house and to get a job but I simply can't because they all ask for my ID and what not and I don't have it. I hate not having my own identity to prove who I am to future employers. I want a change and I am totally helpless and powerless. I have no control over my life and it's already taken a toll on my mental health. I need an escape badly.   I've attempted suicide more than 5 times from 13-20 years of age and I always change my mind because these people are not worth my life. Yes they did raise me but it feels like they only did so, so they could keep me as free labor. I'm basically just a tool to them they don't even let me stay over family members houses or go out simply because they want me to watch the kids so THEY can go out or sleep or whatever. It's so maddening and I do it only because I love my siblings they need me and I need them especially the youngest one, she loves me more than our parents or anyone combined and I can't bare to leave her with them.    I'm so conflicted because they do this to me but on the other hand when we go out together and do family things I feel loved. But the good is only about 10% while the other 90% makes it not worth it in the long run.  Please if anyone knows what I can do to get myself as far away from here as possible, let me know. I'm going to die if I keep living like this. I will gladly give any information I can if you need it. Just please I need advice asap.	No
173	I'm currently trying to get a divorce in Hawaii. My ex moved back to the mainland back in 2015, so this has been a wild ride. I've pushed for her to sign all the papers since early 2016, and she finally has sent all the documents *except* the appearance and waiver. Now she's gone no contact despite saying she would send the last document. She hasn't replied to any of my emails since June 1st. I'm kind of in a hurry now because I'm gone until September and then leaving to go overseas with the military in October for over 6 months. I'm not able to use the military legal services because she can't, which is a whole other story.  My question is, can a judge grant the divorce without this *one* paper? Do I have to get a lawyer involved? If I do have to get a lawyer and we can't get this figured out before I leave, will I not be able to finish it until I get back?	No
174	Hello,  We are 2 months into a 12 month fixed term lease. Our landlord continually emails us stating she wants us to leave so she can move back in due to personal circumstances.   We are aware this is illegal during a fixed term, she can only give us the boot for her to take possession back AFTER the lease, we spoke with the Landlord Tenant Board, and relayed this to our landlord but she CONTINUES to email us alternating between begging us and threatening us.  What can we do to make her stop? Do we have to hire a lawyer to send her something like a cease and desist? Do we call the police? As far as we are aware she has not been entering the unit or showing up - so I don't think trying to get a no trespass order is possible.  We just want to live in peace without constant bombardment and empty threats. She needs to be put into her place but clearly us pointing to the law and how her attempt to evict us contravening it, is not enough to make her stop.  Any suggestions are truly appreciated!	No
175	"Hey all.  Last week, my s/o and I received an email from our property management company which informed us that there had been an unpaid natural gas bill which had risen over $1400, which he insisted we pay. He noted that this had been accumulated over the last year. He said it had been going on for the last 3 years, but ""we're lucky"" (actually said that in his email) that the company can only charge back for the previous years service.  Now, my s/o and I moved into this property (rental) in 2014. At the time we moved in, the property management company told us that they would set us up with the utility accounts we needed (including natural gas) so we didn't have to worry about it. So, we filled out the form and were ensured that it would be set up. which was not completed correctly.  for the last THREE years, we've been using our natural gas services uninterrupted. Nothing has been shut off, we never received and invoice, nothing seemed out of the normal until last week. We had been receiving invoices from another utility company for hydro and electric (which we paid in-full, on-time, every month), but unknowingly to us, this did not include natural gas.  The property management company stated that the owner of the property has been receiving the bills for a significant period of time (which we found out to be the entire 3 years upon calling the natural gas company) and just now decided to bring it up. The account at the natural gas company is entirely in the owners name, and was never, and still isn't in our name.  In the tenancy agreement it does state that we were supposed to pay all utilities, which we're not arguing. We were completely unaware that our other utility bill which we were paying on-time, in-full, every month did not include natural gas, but only hydro and electricity (this company ALSO provides natural gas may I add). We've tried to bring this up to the property management company, but they're adamant that this is entirely our fault, pointing to the tenancy agreement and saying we didn’t do our due diligence to ensure it was set up correctly (which they said they’d do…) and not acknowledging their company's error in the process (or the owner's) and are demanding payment.  We're at a loss as to what to do. We don't feel that we should be flipping this bill due to the amount of errors in this entire process (account not being set up correctly by PM company, owner not making us aware of the billing issue in a reasonable amount of time, our services NEVER being shut off in THREE years...) and considering that the overdue amount isn't in our name and never was, that seems like the owners issue.  My concern is what could happen legally to us. We're moving out over this (unfortunately), so eviction is not an issue. Thoughts?"	No
176	So my family and I are have been living in this apartment for a about two and a half months. We have had many maintenance issues since we have lived here, the worst of which has been a build up of mold in our air vents. We have reported this issue to management several times. Recently they told us they are were contracting a company to clean the air ducts. The day that they supposedly cleaned our air ducts no body was home. When I got home that day the maintenance man was still here and told me that the vents had been completely cleaned. I had a feeling that he was not being truthful so I decided to check the vents for any signs of mold. Sure enough the vents were still full of mold. I have documented all of the moldy vents with video and photographs. We plan on contacting corporate about this issue. What other legal options might we have in this situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!	No
177	"It's a long story, I'll do my best to keep it short. Back in March, I started renting a room in a house I found on CL (mistake #1). I came to find out from the other roommates that the ""landlord"", we'll call him D, wasn't actually the owner of the house, but the only person who's on the lease. The landlord is our next door neighbor. I also found out that D was in prison for insurance fraud, and has been in trouble for scamming and stealing in the past. I have no problems at all with any of the roommates (there are 5 of us right now), but the rest of them are all having problems with D right now, and a couple of them are threatening to move out. I was talking with one of the roomies roday, and she told me the tenant who had my room before me was evicted by D the same day he paid rent, and wouldn't return the money. This really worried me when I heard this. I know he has to give me a 30 day eviction notice, he can't just kick me out, but my main concern is getting my deposit back. What should I do? Should I lawyer up just in case? This guy is a psycho, I'm starting to get a little freaked out. Thanks for reading."	No
178	"TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.  First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.  Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.    The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.  Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays.   Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?"	No
179	"So pretty much I've been soliciting spells and rituals on apps like whisper. I have them pay me over paypal, and send them instructions for the ritual. I never promise health benefits or weight loss. I've sold two so far. A love spell and ""spiritual cleansing"". Both at 20 a spell. Can I be sued for selling a phony spell?  Is there anything I can add like a disclaimer or something to prevent someone from trying to sue me?"	No
180	I live in Virginia. I pay child support, I dont make a lot given I am still in college. My ex is going to college too and needs day care for the kid. She said my child support will most likely go up. If I am already paying child support at a set amount relative to my income, is it really going to go up and how much. I am trying to talk with her about going together and finding a nice place we both agree on since i might be paying for it, I have a right in where he goes right? Speaking of rights, I havent been to court yet to establish my time with him, I work all the time and go to school and can see him only when I am free. It works, but should I go to court and get it all down for the record? I am 24 she is 25 and still lives at home with the kid her 28yo brother and her mom, I live on my own with roommates. What is best for the kid is for her to watch him, but once I graduate and get a job, I want to get 50/50 so I don't have to worry about being screwed in child support. What is my best option, I can provide further details if needed. Thanks &lt;3	No
181	I grew up in this house and have lived here for 19 years. After my parents divorced when I was 18 my dad moved and I moved with him. My mom stayed. Now I'm coming back and she took me to court and evicted me. The judge says the rental agreement I have with my dad (the owner of the same property) doesn't matter and I have to pay my mom $670 and leave in 1 week. How is that even possible if it's a joint property?	No
182	"As the title says, I'm about to buy a house with my boyfriend soon.  I'll be the only one on the title and mortgage, and I'm putting down the down payment. I decided to be the only one responsible for it until he and I get married, just to be as smart as possible about it. Other than that, he and I are going to split the monthly costs of the home, split the repairs/upgrades, and split the utilities (the same as we do while living in our apartment).   My question is this: Are there any tax difficulties for me if I just have him do an automatic payment or something into my bank account to cover his half of the cost? I'm not sure if it would legally be considered ""income"" for me. For better or worse, it'd be a bit like rent until we get hitched.  If that way sucks, what's the best way to deal with it?"	No
183	I am a tenant at will on a month to month lease in LA and have lived in my apartment for 2 months. Recently the lease holder of my apartment had given a 30 day notice to one roommate and has made the living situation uncomfortable for me and my other roommate by sending aggressive texts, asking for bills they won't show us, and more recently taking the modem and router completely out of the apartment and leaving us with no internet.  This all seems extremely petty. Since I'm not on the lease I know I don't have much rights, but I'm worried about paying rent when I'm planning on leaving at the end of the month. At this point, I do t trust her to give back my security deposit.  The landlord is a bit mia and I haven't been able to contact her via phone. Would it be better to send her a certified letter stating my concerns and offering to pay her directly? If I do so can I ask her to sign an agreement that I will get my deposit back  by 9/21/17, which is Los Angeles law for returning a security deposit? Can I just not pay rent and stay until the end of the month? I'm not sure if I'm entitled to the same 30 day notice without a lease? Or do I just cut my losses and try to leave as soon as possible?   Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.   Tl;dr: lease holder is being extremely petty and trying to make all roommates move out. I moved in 2 months ago and am not sure what's the best way to get my security deposit back.	No
184	I am only asking for informational purpose as I was curious whether it rests with the father or the mother (paternity established, and they share custody). I also understand that if mother and father are fighting wrt to naming the child they should probably not be having childre, but I'm asking this question from a purely academic point of view. I also want to know if different states have different laws regarding naming the child, or if there are some ridiculous laws in other states, feel free to chime in.	No
185	Pulled over yesterday and told I was swerving. I was not drunk, but was pretty tired because it was the end of a long drive. I had a major panic attack during the field sobriety tests, I was shaking too hard to stand, and when the officer did the visual test I almost passed out from locking my legs. There is no way I passed those tests. The attack passed by the 3rd test (balance test) which I was able to do fine, but I was not allowed to retake the previous two.   Officer thought I was on some kind of narcotic, and brought me into the station. The did take a urine sample, which I'm positive will come back clean, I don't do drugs. I did have a few beers earlier that afternoon but this stop happened over 4 hours after I had drinks, and I did not have enough to even get buzzed. I did tell the officer when I had the drinks, and complied with all testing and requests, and I was incredibly polite through the whole ordeal.  This is my first OBI, I have no priors, and I have already spoken to a lawyer and have things in motion to meet before my arraignment hearing. What should I be expecting to happen here? Is it normal for a first time offense to be downgraded into a reckless driving charge? Should I expect the book to get thrown at me and to receive the manditory 72 hours in jail? These questions will obviously be asked to my lawyer, but I was hoping to hear some positives to this before going in because I'm freaking out right now.	No
186	"Long story short, we held off on filing the eviction notice and was kind enough to give him until Sept 1st to move out, or else be evicted by the Sheriffs.   Well now his dad decided to type out a letter (HIS agreements, nothing from a law office), along with a $1,000 that ""if deposited then you agree to these terms."" Now we are moving forward with the eviction notice.   Question 1: I'm not depositing the check and I want to send it back to the address listed on the check. Do I need to cross out whatever is written on the check and write ""void"" in its place?   Question 2: Would I need to have the Sheriff put the eviction notice on his bedroom door? Roommate comes in through the garage and won't notice anything on the front door."	No
187	So I rented at this somewhat shady apartment complex and I decided I will not renewed this year. The lease was a joint lease between me, Roommate A and Roommate B. Roommate A and I decided that we will no longer rent here and we're moving out meanwhile Roommate B decided that he will stay there and bring in new roommates. I decided that I did not want to renew this lease nor be involved with this apartment unit any more so I will not renew the lease and they can decide what to do on their own.  Fast forward a month, I heard nothing and the lease is almost over so I checked with my roommate. They said that they already renewed without me or my other roommate and then 2 new people signed the lease instead of us. The security deposit will not be given back to me but the 2 new tenants will be responsible for paying us back. I understand that the security deposit is probably binded to the the unit therefore if someone is staying in the unit, it remains. But they also told me that 'legally' the new tenants are required to pay us back. Is this true? What if the new tenants do not pay Roommate A and I our deposit back? Was it legal in the first place to have this apartment unit renewed without 2 of the leaseholders? Thanks!	No
188	I moved in to a unit and found out afterwards that the landlord/management is stingy. I suspect that they will try to nickel and dime me out of my deposit. I paid $1040 for a unit that is $520 monthly.  What could I do to ensure that their judgement is fair? If I feel that it is not fair, what steps could I take?	No
189	My wife served me with divorce papers last weekend. I have 30 days to file a response with the court in the county that she lives in.   My quick question is: when they say 'file a response with the court', does that mean I have to go in person, or can I mail it in? It'd take me three hours each way to get to the courthouse, so I'd rather not go there in person if I can avoid it.   Court is Washington County, Oregon.	No
190	"I have a [previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/6kcqte/can_he_actually_get_that_or_a_lesson_in_why/) that outlines the whole background, if anyone would like to peek at it.  But I have a specific legal question:  My ex believes he's entitled to half of our home's passive value increase due to the market demand.  We bought the house in 2012, but didn't marry until December of 2015.  When we bought the house, it was worth $148k.  When we married, it was worth $155k.  A month ago when I told him we were through, it was worth $160k.  And now, it's worth $168k.  (These are Zestimates - yes, I know they aren't accurate, I'll be getting an appraisal to get the right numbers).    So - for what time frame is he entitled to the increase in value (marital property)?  During our marriage?  Or the whole time we've owned the house?    Also, the value keeps rapidly climbing - what's the ""stopping date"" for the equity owed?  (Hope that makes sense).  Thank you for any help."	No
191	Just found out my mom's been living in a no-lease no-rental agreement situation in Ontario, Canada (I started digging when she asked me who was responsible for mowing the grass, which is telling...) What should I tell her or warn her about? Thanks all:)	No
192	Signed a 12 month lease for a larger two bedroom apartment floor plan with a move in date of August 12. Was wrongfully (she admitted it) given handicap accessible apartment, which is a HUGE difference in counter height, door frame size and more. She has no more apartments available until October, but is not willing to move anyone who was promised an apartment after me. My lease is up now on August 18, and I don't know what to do? It's not specified on the lease that it was a handicap accessible apartment, and that was not the one I was promised and given a tour for.	No
193	For context, my friend turned 18 at the end of October 2016. This drama didn't begin until well after that, around March 2017.   Her mother and step-father are not nice people, nor are they particularly intelligent (I'm putting this very, *very* lightly). For years, she's been told by doctors that she has both depression and anxiety (unmedicated until a couple weeks ago), but due to religious reasons/political differences, her mother insisted she be tested for autism. So she was, and the results came back saying that she has provisional aspergers; this means that she showed some symptoms, but those could just be byproducts of her unmedicated depression/anxiety combo. Her mother does not seem to grasp this at all, and insists that she 100% has autism, treating her as if she's a young child.   During a certain event a month ago (far too long to explain here, as it goes too far off topic), police were intervening, and her mother was howling about how she had paperwork proving that my friend cannot make her own decisions (we were trying to pick her up to take her to a comedy show), so she cannot decide to leave with her friends, and threatened to press charges on us for attempted kidnapping. She merely showed the cops the paper that diagnosed my friend with provisional aspergers and the cops had her go home with her parents, no other arguments permitted.   However, after chatting with someone this week whose parents/younger brother have actually gone through the process of gaining legal guardianship over someone 18+ years old, it came to my attention that her mother might be lying, or that she's forged some documents. We're not sure. I've done some light digging (some of which was very confusing to read), and it seems that, on the basic level, certain paperwork needed to be submitted, court dates needed to be set up/attended, and above all else, my friend should have been informed that all of this was happening (if it actually was). She received no notice whatsoever of anything like this.   So my big question here is: Is it AT ALL possible that her mother was able to sneakily obtain the legal stuff necessary with ZERO consent or knowledge from my friend, since she is not a minor? (And a second less pressing question, which you can ignore if you want since it's not the main focus: Are there any important things we should keep in mind if her mother presses this further, or if there's a confrontation over it?)	No
194	My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.  My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?  Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.   I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!	No
195	Stockton - California (USA)  Let me just get to the core of the situation. My friend and her husband are sharing an apartment with her husbands Mother and Sister. All costs are 50/50. Mother wants to move out with daughter so she went to turn in a thirty day notice with her (mom's) name and daughters name. She was told the notice wasn't valid unless all names are on the notice, so she promptly put the names of my friend and her husband without their consent on the notice. Now the leasing office is refusing to listen them about how the signatures were put on the notice without consent. The leasing office is now refusing to allow my friend and her husband to bring on another qualified tenant to help pay for the apartment even though they wish to resign a lease. What legal actions does my friend and her husband have since the process that started this was void to begin with? The leasing office is refusing their complaints. My guess is because it is due to rent control and by releasing to new tenants they can raise the price.	No
196	Got into a car accident with a brand new lease car. I'm at fault and I have no insurance on the car. The leading agreement for my cAr too says I need to have full coverage at all times during the lease. So the contract for the lease has been breached as well and the repairs for the car are too much for me right now. I need help or some type of direction on what to do now. I know I messed up bad	No
197	My parents in California recently got documentation stating that a lawsuit has been filed against them from the distributors of solar panels for a contractor company that we hired to install solar panels on our roof top. The contractors received parts from distributors but apparently haven't paid the distributors for the parts. They have already installed the solar panels on my parents house.   Previously my parents had received a Lien of Mechanics from the same distributors. This was the first contact they had with the distributors. My parents informed the contractor company. The contractors claim that they have paid the distributors already but did receive a second bill which they have not paid because they believe they have been wrongly double charged. They assured my parents they had taken care of this situation with the distributors. The contractors said we would received a letter saying this was resolved from the distributors legal representative. But instead my parents then received notice of the lawsuit.   The contractors have been informed once again and said they will handle this. Is there anything my parents can do in case the contractors do not resolve this issue?	No
198	"I just moved into an apartment in Michigan. When I was shown the apartment I noticed there were two AC units, I would not have selected an apartment without AC. Upon moving in neither units are working. One is an electrical problem with the wiring, the other just doesn't make cold air.   Upon talking to the property management they said they would try and repair the units but will not replace them if they are broken and can't be repaired. They said they don't have to as the lease says that AC is not included. The lease says the landlord must maintain the premises and all appliances (without listing which ones are included) and then under a section labeled ""Other Restrictions"" it says ""No Air Conditioners"" listed alongside other things such as ""No pets"", ""No washer/dryer"" and ""No waterbeds"". Obviously I interpreted this to mean no installing or bringing in your own AC unit as I already knew there was AC in the apartment. However they are claiming this means they don't have to replace it.   I'm waiting to see if it can be fixed before making a fuss but I want to know whether or not they legally do not have replace the unit. It's hot and it's frustrating as it just seems like they are trying to weasel their way out of spending the money."	No
199	I live in Austin, Texas and for the past month and a half, I have had a mold and humidity issue in my (nice) apartment. I have put in work orders and have talked to the leasing office in person on several occasions to address this issue, but the problem remains. I've had to throw out pairs of moldy shoes, clothes, and buy a dehumidifier for my bedroom (which hasn't really done much).  I just got an email from the leasing office a few minutes ago saying that to repair the problem, they will allow us to terminate our lease agreement and move out. They previously offered to move us to a different unit in the apartment complex but its on the top floor, and we're really fed up with the complex in general.  My question is, can I take any actions here? Can I push for them to reimburse us for our damaged clothes and the cost of the dehumidifier? What about getting them to reimburse us for any moving costs associated with moving to a different apartment complex?	No
200	"Hi, our business entered into a 3 year, $35/month bottleless water cooler contract with a local provider. Due to dissatisfaction with the service (the machine has needed service several times and not enough water is cooled at any given time), we would like to cancel.   The provider has offered to change the machine. Otherwise, the contract provides for a $150 removal fee in the event of cancellation. It also says, ""If provider terminates a rental term under this Agreement or any Add-on Schedule due to Customer’s default, including but not limited to, non-payment of any amount when due, improper care, usage or handling of the Equipment, or failure to perform any other obligation hereunder, Customer will be responsible for payment of all fees for the remaining term(s), as well as for all damages and removal and shipping charges incurred by provider.""  As a result, they are seeking $630 for the remaining 18 months of the contract (in addition to the removal fee). We understand a cancellation fee, but to what extent is it legal to charge the full duration of the contract? Thank you."	No
201	Horribly sad, very young, sweet girl.  What do we do with her final paycheck?  We don't know any of her family, only her BF who she killed herself in front of, and we will definitely not be giving it to him.	No
202	Location: Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and maybe Florida  Background: When my 2nd? cousin went to apply for a credit card, we found they had a number of loans in default from several years ago when they were under 18. We're about 90% sure their biological father stole their identity and have already filed a police report and they frozen their credit. They're on their way back to some semblance of normalcy, but the new issue is they have a large number of half siblings from their biological father, my shitty cousin. We aren't entirely sure how many, but my uncle, his dad, had met 17 of them, though relatives estimate around 25 to 30 altogether scattered through various states.  Problem: We realized if my cousin had stolen his oldest child's identity, it was likely he had done so to his other children as well. Unfortunately, as none of the others lived in that town, there was nothing the police could do to help. He works under the table to dodge child support, and can only be reached at a PO box in Indianapolis. Unfortunately, he would only respond to his dad. (After walking out on his family, he made it clear he wouldn't be around them. We decided to keep inviting them and he never forgave us for wronging him so horribly, but his dad was out of the picture at the time) Unfortunately, his dad was recently arrested  for selling meth and decided to skip town on bail.  Is there any way we could try to track down the other kids to let the mothers know to check? I know this whole thing sounds absurd, and quite frankly I would rather not air out family laundry online, but it would be inexcusable to allow him to rob his kids.	No
203	My wife and I rent a small one bedroom home from her uncle, which shares a back yard on the same lot or two lots connected. My wife has some mental health issues that prevents her from working currently and last month is brutal and had a lot of things hit us hard and we were late on rent quite a bit. I talked to him and he made everything sound like it was okay.  I was messaged on facebook about the new lease even though our current lease doesn't end til November. He states that we must keep the attic window open from spring till fall or its a 200 fine per month. Anything left on my porch is $25 fine, she must park on the street and not use the three car spot on the lot. If our dog uses the yard to pee or poop its a $25 per incident. all of which end with can lead to eviction. I can't leave the property for more than 2 days with out written notification. Which I assume is part of his insurance clause. Also rent goes up in jan according to the new lease, and each day its late prior to the increase is $5 and $10 after increase per day after the 1st. In the original lease we had until the 5th before it was due. I am sure its all because of last months drama which I was hoping a close family member would have understood what I was going through trying to keep my wife alive.   The attic window is kinda insane to me, I get the theory behind it but we don't have insulation in the attic nor any moisture barrier and it just seems like in bringing an excess of moisture which is bad for electronics and other things. Maybe I am out of line.   I can't afford to move, and I will abide by his requests it just seems far fetched in some areas as if its more of a trap than anything.  Any ideas of this is all legal or is he over reaching in some areas?  Thank you kindly.	No
204	So I signed a lease last week on a 1 bedroom apartment. The agreement states that the lease starts on August 11th. She assured me that the tenant would be out and I could move in. However, she called me telling me that the current tenant is waiting for his new apartment to be ready and won't be out until the end of August. She also said his lease is until October but that she was letting him out early which is why she had me sign a lease for August. I paid $100 for my application and signed the lease. She called to inform me that I couldn't move in on the 11th, she had no definitive date on his moving out but said it would be late August and if I wanted my 100 dollars back she could get it to me. However, I told her I'd wait for now. I found a new place in the meantime and told her that I need to cancel my lease and get my $100 back since I couldn't even move in on the date that the lease specified. Is there something in writing I can get saying that the lease is canceled? She said she'd try to get my 100 bucks back but I want to make sure before I sign the lease at the other apartment.	No
205	"I currently live in a nice 3br/2ba home. I am subleasing my room from ""Liz"" who is the sole tenant on the lease. Every month, I pay her my share of the rent and she pays our landlady. Our lease is up August 1st, at which point we all agreed to be out. I had arranged to move in somewhere else for August 1st. ""Liz"" and my other roommate (also subleasing) haven't lived in the house since June, because they felt the area was unsafe/ too busy. ""Liz"" has been paying her share of the rent, whereas my other roommate found a summer subletter. We all planned to be out August 1st and have been in regular communication about this fact. Four days ago, Liz tells me that I need to be out on July 29th, because she wants to leave town early (moving to another state for August 1st) and the landlady won't let me do the walk through by myself, because I am just subleasing. This has been a major inconvenience. I had scheduled to move the morning of August 1st and spend the weekend preparing my move. Additionally, my new landlord had to shift some things around to let me in three days early. I will be paying him prorated for those extra three days. Because, this was such a major inconvenience and because I already paid for a full month, should I request that Liz reimburses me for those last three days? This would only be about $60, but it would help with moving costs, etc. Additionally, this is not the first time Liz has pulled a stunt like this (a few months ago she listed our house to try and find new tenants for May 1st without speaking to me first because she wanted to move). We resolved our issues on that front, but now she blindsides me again. I'm generally easygoing, but think it's only fair she reimburses me for bending over backwards for her! Thoughts?"	No
206	My parents have decided to eat *Soylent* and only that, I'm of course expected to do the same. Soylent  for three meals a day, no snacks, no other food in the house. I won't even be allowed to eat school lunches, I have to take a bottle of Soylent to school and drink that instead.  Is this legal? Yeah they're technically feeding me but it's been three days and I'm miserable, I just want a sandwich or even a piece of fruit so badly. This isn't even some weird temporary diet they plan on doing indefinitely.	No
207	My roommate got caught with so an eighth of marijuana while getting pulled over the other day, he was about to get his medical card this next week. He so far hasn't been charged but was taken to the police station. If he gets put on probation can he still get a medical card without any issues? I saw that the supreme court here passed a law saying that probation can't stop medical patients (http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/04/07/medical-marijuana-arizona-supreme-court/25416337/) but I can't seem to get anything about getting the card after being caught by the police.   Can anyone help me out on this?	No
208	forgive me if this is a long story. this has been slowly building for seven years. i will try to include only the essential facts. after that, feel free to ask questions.  fact 1 -- my husband has degenerative bone disease and was told eight years ago that he would soon be confined to a wheelchair. so far this hasn't happened, but he is not in good health although he continues to work hard for the little money he can make.  fact 2 -- i suffer from mental illnesses including PTSD from childhood and borderline personality disorder. i have applied for disability and been turned down, although it doesn't change the fact that my last therapist advised that i shouldn't be working.  fact 3 -- our landlady uses and abuses us. when she takes vacations, we watch her cats for free because we feel if we say no, we'll be kicked out. this is how she suckers us into almost everything, including spending an entire day cleaning out a shed on our property full of her stuff.  fact 4 -- her worst offense happened a few months ago. our septic tank overflowed (not maintained for 20+ years) and she didn't fix it for nearly two weeks despite my pleas, which only angered her as she tried to turn my husband against me. she also forced my nearly crippled husband to dig up the septic tank himself.  we were unable to take showers, use the sinks, do laundry, or even use the bathroom in the house. the smell was awful and very unsanitary. i do have video documentation.  fact 5 -- since that happened, i believe it has either caused further PTSD or aggravated what i already had. i have nightmares about poop. i smell phantom sewage smells all the time and very often taste it in my food. i was admitted to a state hospital for thirteen days and my psychiatrist classified what she did to me as abuse.  fact 6 -- while i was trying to recover in the hospital, the refrigerator that came with the house broke and my husband has been eating fast food for three weeks as he begs her to replace the fridge. now she isn't even answering her phone even though she is home. (lives next door to our rental property.)  fact 7 -- we have four cats that have also suffered due to the stress in our household. we can't afford to move and if we did, it might be near a busy road or highway, and i fear for them. i might could give one up for adoption but no more.  fact 8 -- in kentucky there is something called a landlord retaliation law that states she can't kick us out for a year after we have complained about a major repair to the house. if this is true we still have time, however with my mental illnesses i became very angry with her before my hospital stay. because of that, i cannot go to my house at all. i haven't seen my cats in weeks. she is threatening to call the police if i show up, although there is no restraining order or anything of the sort.   -  what would you guys do in my situation? i am finally on the correct antidepressants after twenty-two years, but her behavior is affecting my recovery. i really am better and had gotten over my anger with her, but now it's returning.  any and all advice is appreciated.	No
209	I gave my friend money to lend and believed her story. Today, I thought I was dropping her off to see her mother, but I drove her to pick up heroin from her drug dealer. I had no idea this was happening, and I'm scared and worried for the child. The grandparents are likely to get CPS and the police involved.   I just would like to know what to expect from my end; will I be called in to give information or have to testify in court, if it happens? What is the process involving opiate addiction and pregnancy? Will I get in trouble?  Thanks.	No
210	First time poster looking to get an answer to a question that I've been having issues figuring out.   I'm trying to file a Paternity case to get a court order for visitation. I reside in Los Angeles county and my daughter resides in San Bernardino county. Which county do I use to file for my paternity case? My daughter has lived outside of Los Angeles since 11/2016. If I file in San Bernardino county, do I have to travel to that courthouse each time I need to go to court or will the Los Angeles courts be able to assist me?	No
211	Hey everyone. My boyfriend is in the process of hopefully getting a job in the USA. We have been dating for around 4 years and always said we'd get married if we relocated so we can be together. I am worried about a couple of things that might cause problems  - I am diagnosed with Anxiety, this in itself isn't the problem. I have went through a few diagnoses' to get to this one though but it's settled on that. I am considered in remission but a couple years ago I got into a fight with a girl over something stupid. I punched her in the face but the police weren't contacted. I did, however, talk to my therapist about it and worked through it with them. If this is on my medical records could it cause problems? (Btw just a note that me and the girl resolved it and were both kind of douchebags)  - This is the one I'm really worried about. My mother is currently awaiting conviction on a charge of possession with intent to supply multiple substances and one charge of conspiracy to convey drugs into a prison. I did not know about this or profit from it. Will this cause problems? If so, how do I prove myself and what are my options?  Thank you guys in advance, worried sick here.	No
212	"Father has son on vacation in Florida while school is out. He is trying to claim his vacation address as sons current address for full custody.

I have &lt;b&gt; NEVER&lt;/b&gt; exposed myself to that child, and I don't even drink.. or do drugs.. it also says she has moved the child several times during his VPK, and kindergarden years..

213	As mentioned above this happened last week, and ever since i have been super stressed. A lady  called from CRA REVENUE COLLECTIONS DEPT She asked me if i was so and so...confirmed it and then she went to explain to me she was calling me on behalf of CRA. and then confirmed that my landlord is so and so..i confirmed yes. and then she went on to say that i will be receiving a legal package in registered mail on monday/tuesday. I was like...for what... and she replied that this is inregards to my landlord and my rental payments. and she said after i received the package i will have to direct all my rent payments to CRA... I live in a condo, and i am really confused...i recently came out of rehab from an accident ( being run over by a car) and have slowly started working... I checked up on them and it seems legit. If i send CRA the cheques i am afraid Either my landlord of the condo board will kick me out. I live by myself and my service dog and i am really confused...like wtf... I called my landlord and he says its a scam...and i called the 1800 number on cra website and they transferred me to rev collections dept. I mentioned my worries to the lady and she was like..well ya you can go to tenant and landlord board.. I mean why the hell am i in the middle of all this crap... Please advise..should i seek legal aid.. i live in mississauga, ON so i got no idea how the rules work  1. Should i sign for the registered letter which i might receive today/ tomorrow.  2. Should I answer her calls.. 3. Should i continue paying my landlord the rent..will i be implicated in anyway cuz of his tax issues. ( because the lady on the phone said i will be help responsible for his taxes...which doesn't make sense)  I did post earlier but was told to remove phone numbers and names ..have done so..I didn't think it was such a bid deal.

214	Last week a wiring issue in my apartment damaged some of my property and I’m trying to figure out if I have any chance of getting compensation from my apartment complex. I had three power strips burn up and die over a two day period. When the maintenance guy came out, he tested several of the outlets and assured me that everything was fine and it must have been a defective power strip. I explained to him that there had been three separate power strips that had all died over a period of two days, but he again assured me that there was no problem and told me to buy a new power strip and use it as normal.   So Thursday afternoon I’m sitting at my desk using my computer plugged into a fourth power strip when I hear a loud popping noise and I start smelling burnt electronics. The lights start to flicker and dim and then become really bright, and everything plugged into the power strip abruptly shuts off. I call the office and they send out their head maintenance guy who looks behind the outlet and finds a broken wire. He fixes it, and is on his way.   I purchase a fifth power strip, but when I plug stuff into it, I find that my computer and printer no longer turn on. Since I was using the computer immediately prior to the power strip burning up, and I was told that the cause of the power strips burning up was the broken wire, it seems clear to me that the broken caused the damage to my computer. Given that I was assured it was safe to buy a new strip and use it, it seems to me that my apartment should compensate me for my damaged property. It also seems to me that it could have been a significant safety hazard, but what do I know?   I emailed my apartment stating the facts of what happened, explaining why I think they should compensate me, and asking if they would be willing to do so. They called me back saying that they would not.   The main lesson that I’ve learned from all this is that I should make sure I have a renter’s insurance policy that covers this kind of thing, but what I would like to know is if there is anything I can do to get them to compensate me. I’m planning on calling them back tomorrow and trying to speak with a supervisor, but I’m not optimistic of that route. Is it worth it to take them to small claims court? Could I have a lawyer write them a demand letter?    Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
215	Posting for a friend. Female was Injured on the job at a grocery store due to constant lifting. Coerced into not filing a workers comp case, but has x-rays and a chiropractic visit on record from that time period. The company continues to schedule her for active shifts after hr filing her into a non active shifts which she is unable to do.     On top of this, she makes 12.80 an hour. Less than 20k a year. I was wondering what public assistance she might be able to take advantage of to help stay afloat and any recommendation on legal routes to obtain a lawyer.      Thank you	No
216	... and I live in Naperville, IL (Will County); and live almost half a mile from the nearest man-made lake. My house was newly built 6 years ago. It first flooded around 18 months after we moved in causing around $3000 of damage. This one wasn't too bad since the water had only seeped into the unfinished parts of our basement and we did not need to replace any of the carpet or the padding. Several other houses in our neighborhood had also flooded at the time and many people were experiencing similar damages (not too extensive, no need to replace their entire carpeting or anything). This didn't really cause too much worry to us so we didn't take any additional action other than draining out the water.  2 years later, our basement was completely flooded with nearly 5 inches of water everywhere. All the carpet was soaked, some of our valuables ruined; over $10,000 in damages. At this point, we hired plumber to re-irrigate our house to ensure that all water that comes near our house would be drained into a set of pipes and pumped into the sewage system. We also had the plumber add two more sump pumps in our basement so that the total pumping capacity is enough for a house more than triple the size of ours. We replaced all of the carpet with tile so that if it ever flooded again, we would not need to replace the floor. Our home insurance company also told us we were too much of a liability and attempted to sever future ties, unless we increased our deductible to $2,500. Though it might not have been the best decision, we went through with it. However, our minds were slightly rested since we re-irrigated and added in the new sump pumps.  They say that the 3rd time is the charm. My house flooded AGAIN. After we installed 3 sump pumps, after we re-irrigated. It somehow managed to flood again. The only explanation I could think of is that my house lies on top of a waterbed. So any time it rains too much, the water level rises under the ground and starts seeping into my house too quickly. When we built this house, on this specific lot, shouldn't it have come with a warning label of some sort? Shouldn't the builders have tested to see if there's too much water in the area to build a house. Or shouldn't the lot have at least been devalued because of this?  I'm just not sure what exactly to do, if our house continues to flood every two years, we can't continue to pay for the damages each time. We have home insurance, but even after last time they threatened to leave us. New insurance companies won't come near us either due to our high risk and liability. Not entirely sure if this was the right subreddit to post on, but I just need a little advice.	No
217	My Grandmother died recently and left her home to my Mother. my grandmother had outstanding Medicaid debts so the state filed a claim on here estate. She only had 900 dollars in her checking account at the time of death and her home is only worth 20 grand max. We tried to file an exemption through my mother's(awful) lawyer. And she was denied her hardship claim. So the state took the 900 dollars and put a 4000 dollar lien against the house.   Now here is the thing. My mom is disabled and on SSI. And simply doesn't have a lot of money. Her benefit payment is less than 1200 a month. And she lives by herself. It was my understanding if the child of any age is disabled of the deceased person they are exempt from that law.   We have tried to get another lawyer to look at things and either they don't want to deal with it now that it is already said and done or don't want to deal with it because of the proximity to my others lawyer(i don't understand this one either). It is a small town.   Is there anywe we can get my mother an exemption after the denial. Or can someone point me in the right direction or what to do?  Also the house is payed off, and the state AG hired a local attorney  to do the Estate recover.	No
218	I used to live in a house with 4 other people and we finally (after 2 months) received a bill from the previous landlord of the damages we owed. I moved in last year and took the room from a friend and when I moved in there was no walkthdough or anything. My former roommates had moved in two years prior and there was no walk through at all when they moved in. The previous tenants before there were friends as well, and they had left a lot of stuff in the house before they had moved in. They landlord actually charged us less rent because the carpets were already so bad and she was going to replace them anyway.

We expected not to get our deposit back and we she did the final walk through with us before we moved out she did not mention anything major to fix or clean and she said was don't expect your deposit back. This house is a modern house, probably built early 00's but still has seen a lot of wear and tear over the years and we did not cause all this damage. Any help would be appreciated, thank you all in advance!	No
219	TL;DR: Is the landlord responsible for a high water bill if the bill is due to broken lawn sprinklers on common property in an apartment building?  I live in a multi-unit property and due the sprinklers being broken we have an excessive water bill. All units are being charged almost 500% of our typical water bill (the bill is usually divided equally among the tenants of the building).  The lease explicitly describes that in the event a high water bill is issued, we must pay in the same timely manner we normally would. But, it describes examples such as leaky faucets within a tenant's property. The sprinklers are are apart of the common exterior property and there are no references in the lease that we have a responsibility to maintain that property (just not actively damage it).  I'm hoping to find a statute in Colorado or something that makes explicit that, since it is not written in the lease, an excessive utility bill due to something occurring in common spaces of the building is the responsibility of the landlord. Any help is appreciated!	No
220	To provide some backstory, I moved up to Colorado a few years ago and when I did, my best friend's mother allowed me to stay at her house. I ate their food, and received some gifts from them. I did some chores, as well as assisted with a renovation of the house I leased with her son (again, my best friend). Fast forward to today, I've decided to move out and separate from my best friend for personal reasons. My move out date is August 4th and our landlord has been generous to allow us to stay past the end of lease date while we sort a few things out, presuming we pay another months rent. (no contract has been signed for this month's rent. The landlord could kick us out on the 31st and there is nothing preventing them from doing so.)   Their mother is now threatening to sue me if I do not pay my full half of the August rent, when I feel it's reasonable to leave with paying 1/3 instead. Based on what I've told you folks, does she have any reasonable course of action in a court of law?	No
221	I’m in some deep shit.   I asked someone for a rental application. They sent a document which I filled out and signed. This turned out to be a lease agreement which I’m now on the hook for. I just signed a sublease agreement with someone else. Now I’m on the hook at two places. What can I do?	No
222	I'm asking for my brother-in-law. His wife wouldn't let him in the house last week, so he stayed at his mom's house and my house. Yesterday, after the fifth day away from home, he decided he would just go back home. His wife and 2 year old daughter were at a friends house. She let him come get the daughter so he could spend time with her.   He kept her at the house last night and his wife stayed at their friend's house. Wife is now wanting to come back and take the daughter and keep her for the week....which would mean dad only got to see her for one day in a two week span.  He wants me to come over and be in the house when she shows up...no idea what I would do.   He wants to keep the daughter at home with him (I'm obviously biased, but I think he's the more responsible parent). Would it cause problems if he packed up some bags and came to my house or went to his mom's house? Would that be twisted into some sort of kidnapping type situation when the divorce proceedings *do* start?  She has made it clear she has no desire to preserve the marriage. Neither one has sought legal council yet, but I have told him to quit calling me and call a lawyer. Right now I'm just looking for a quick answer to what will go down today.	No
223	As stated, My roomates and I each have signed our names to a lease for an apartment. Together we make the required 3x monthly income. However he recently bought a car that makes him unable to move, but is willingly to keep his name on the lease. We can make the payments for the apartment, without his aide.  However, would we be penalized for having his name on it.  If he doesn't live with us? The lease is signed with five people, but only four will be living there.	No
224	On last months wireless bill AT&amp;T did not include the amount for my installment plan, and it wasn't even mentioned on the bill. One this months bill, which I'm calling this months bill because the amount due for the billing period is due this month, they included both last months and this months installment payment. The amount per installment is $61.50. Times two, $122 on this months bill.  Now, these also are the final two payments of the the installment agreement. The device is payed off after this periods bill is payed.  I contacted AT&amp;T via chat, phone, and visiting a retail store(who politely informed me everything is done over phone and they don't know why I was sent there), and I asked them if I could have one of the two installments moved to next month.  They refused, and insisted that I pay the entire bill amount. I said I was open to other arrangements to lower this months bill and pay the rest later, and reminded them that it was AT&amp;T who made the mistake by not including it in my bill the previous month. One of the 7 or 8 people I spoke with said that it was a known issue that happened to several of their customers last month, and was resolved.  I don't think I should have to pay the $61.50 that AT&amp;T neglected to include in my bill and then added the next month without notice. However I am willing to pay it if they spread the 2 payments over 2 months as they should be. I did not ask AT&amp;T to forgive the installment, but I did tell them many times that I was willing to do it over two months, inline with what I originally agreed when I bought the device.  First, what organization(s) should I report AT&amp;T to, and how should I do it?  Second, how can I best get out of paying the $61.50 they did not charge me one month? What legal grounds do I have there?  Thank you for your help. I realize the dollar amount here is not that much, but AT&amp;T's absolute refusal to work with me on payment options makes me want to pursue legal options.	No
225	I apologize if I come frustrated but I am. My landlord threw out, I really mean disposed of, all my belongings from my apartment even though my lease does not end for a good week. I had everything packed and ready to be moved and they all disappeared. The landlord takes full responsibility. So far I have a lawyer and am making a list of inventory for all my belongings. What else should I do. How should I estimate the worth of my items. Thank you.	No
