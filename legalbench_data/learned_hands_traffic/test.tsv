0	I have had to do some travelling in Texas for business and I had went through some tolls this year and last. I received some letters stating I needed to pay my tolls and meant to do it but unfortunately got busy and forgot. I recently got a letter saying that the toll bill went to a law firm for collections and if I didn't pay they would send it to court. Some of these tolls are for like .50 cents but they tacked on $35 dollar fees.  I wanted to try and call the law firm but every time I call any of their numbers I'm on hold for half an hour and then it goes to a full voicemail box. I feel like this is part of their strategy to get you to pay to full bill.  What are my options? I'm willing to pay the bill and be more responsible with my toll bills in the future but that would really suck in the short term. Ideally I'd like to at least pay on it and work out terms with them. I mean I can't even get a hold of anyone to verify that my account will be cleared. Has anyone else dealt with something similar?	Yes
1	"Yesterday I received 3 notices of traffic tickets from Florence (Originally perpetrated in March) where I ""was driving within the limited traffic area without authorization"". Two infractions were within 40 minutes, and the other was 2 days later. I don't recall seeing signs, or being on a road that seemed like I shouldn't, but I don't speak Italian either!   I am an American citizen living in the US that was using a rental car. It's important to note that these notices seem to be from the city police directly, and not through the rental company. All 3 notices are for 81 + 37 Euros for procedures.   It ends up being $403 USD. What are my options and what would you recommend? Can I just not pay? Will I not be allowed to go back to Italy?"	Yes
2	So I was driving home from my weekly UA and classes as required after last DUI (wouldnt have even been in that town if not for these obligations). Sober all day, and days prior to that.  For some reason I seizured, passed out, etc behind the wheel not 10 minutes after meeting my PO.  Single vehicle accident, hit a curb.  Eneded up goin to the hospital to get checked since I was frightened I may have had a seizure or something Consented that I'd do the state test via blood and UE.  Nothing to hide.  All came back clean for everything.  I wasnt worried, just thought I'd get driving under suspension...Well this cop finds an empty package of Kratom which was not consumed anytime prior to the accident. He writes me a DUi (which I've had a few guilties of but learned my leason)...With this additional charge I could face substantial jail time even though I was not in anyway intoxicated.  I was never given sobriety tests, read rights etc.  This cop may have just ruined my life right as was rebuilding it, so pissed!  Any advice?	Yes
3	The adult son of the neighbor across the street backed into my husband's truck at midnight and took off. He hit in in such a way that the suspension was thrown off and we ended up with a body shop repair estimate of $3500 :/  Here's where it gets fun: the son had recently gotten his car back from the shop after damaging it in a DUI. His license was suspended. According to him, his girlfriend was driving (we suspect that she wasn't) when our truck got hit. The police came and took a report in which it identifies that she was driving. The car is registered to the son's mom (his dad's ex-wife) and is also insured by her. According to her insurance, they will not pay our damages because they cannot get in contact with their client.  The insurance says that all insurance companies will not pay out on a claim unless they can confirm with their insured that the vehicle involved was in an accident while being driven by an authorized person.  All she has to do is literally NOT answer her phone and that's that. Now, we have no idea what to do! NO ONE is cooperating nor taking responsibility for the damages to our truck and we are out a vehicle!  Can we continue pushing the insurance? Can we sue the insurance or the kid's mom? Do we sue the girl that was supposedly driving? Do we call the propety owners across the street and let them know that they have 6 people living in their 2 bed/1bath house? What can we do? What recourse do we have in a situation like this?	Yes
4	"Driving at the start of May of this year in South Florida, I rear ended another 2017 Toyota at about 25 mph. There were no injuries reported at the scene of the accident, my 2004 Toyota sustained most of the damage, and I received a ticket for careless driving which was dismissed in court. The couple in the car I hit is middle-aged and they repeatedly and emphatically stated their lack of injury for three hours while the police officer was at the scene. About a month after the accident, I was notified that the couple was claiming bodily injury (soft tissue damage) and was seeking money to cover their chiropractic treatment through my insurance. I'm 19 and had my own insurance policy at the time, but the couple (or their lawyer I suppose) also tried to get compensation through my mother's insurance. We just received notice that my mother's insurance ""hereby disclaims and denies any and all liability or obligation to you and to others under policy number ... issued to you."" Does this mean that the couple can now retain their own lawyer to come after me personally? I'm very nervous and stressed about this because I am supposed to be leaving Florida for college up North in a week and I would never be able to afford to pay these people for their supposed injuries. Thank you."	Yes
5	Hey guys I was in a motorbike crash on the 2nd July, I was going down the motorway in the fast lane and it turned into a merge lane so I merged. About 10 seconds later all I see is brake lights come on so I tried to brake aswell, couldn't slow down fast enough so i had to swerve to the right and clipped the rear right side of the car in front, now comes to my problem. I have decided not to claim and just wanted to fix my bike up myself without getting insurance involved but I have just had a claim made against me by the other party involved. My insurance ran out on the 12th so I wanted to know if I would still be covered and how to handle the claim against me. Any advice would be helpful .	Yes
6	"Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18.  - What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?  According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case. - Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?  So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
7	So my town does angled parking spots on some streets. Town ordinance (though it's not actually posted on any signs on the streets) states you have to park head-in in the angled spots.  I was pulling out of a lot onto a 2-way street with angled spots on the right side. Before I did, the person in the angled spot immediately to the right of the lot exit I was using left the spot.   The proximity of the spot to the lot exit was such that, instead of turning right onto the street, reversing, then pulling forward head-first into the spot, it was faster/easier/safer to just pull forward and back right into the spot.  When I got out of lunch, I had 2 tickets. One for $30 for violating the head-in ordinance - that one I understand. Ignorance is no excuse, etc. However, I also had a $54 ticket for a Section 39:4-135 violation. Here's that text:  39:4-135. Parking; direction and side of street; angle parking; one-way street The operator of a vehicle shall not stop, stand or park the vehicle in a roadway other than parallel with the edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the right-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway, except as follows:  a. Upon those streets which have been designated by ordinance and have been marked or signed for angle parking, vehicles shall be parked at the angle to the curb designated and indicated by the ordinance and marks or signs.  b. Upon one-way streets, local authorities may permit parking of vehicles parallel with the left-hand edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the left-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway.  I think that violation is in error. In (a) it states only the angle of parking in reference to angled-parking ordinances. I took photos of my car, it's at the correct angle and between the space markers, it's just backed in.  What do I do here? I doubt it's worth it to fight the head-in violation since that one's pretty cut-and-dry, but the 2nd violation really seems like it's not valid. I've literally had 2 non-parking tickets in my life, one was speeding that I hired a lawyer for when I was like 17, and 1 was driving without an inspection sticker on a car I bought on eBay that same day, so I'm pretty green to this. If I plead not guilty, am I gonna have to go word-against-word with some douche traffic cop? This is also the town I live in, and it's a very quiet town with a ton of bored cops, so I'm worried that making any sort of waves is gonna mark me and my car to every cop in town forever. $54 isn't going to break my bank account or anything, but it really steams me. We literally went out for lunch, and it went from a $50 meal to a $134 meal.	Yes
8	Hello,   I am from Korea where car seat laws are pretty lax. While most people choose to use car seats, there is no law requiring them, so many people will often just hold their babies in their laps while riding in taxis or buses, etc.  I'll be travelling to Boston and staying there for a month this fall, and I'm wondering about car seat rules for my one year old. I will be using a car seat for my everyday rental car, but what about taxis, commuter rail, subway, shuttle buses etc?  From what I read on the internet, it seems like Americans are really strict about car seat laws, so I don't want to do anything to upset CPS or the police.   Will I be in legal trouble if I don't use a car seat on the taxi or shuttle bus at their airport. And what are the standards when travelling with a baby by subway or commuter rail? Is it okay to just hold the baby in my lap?   I did do a quick google search which told me that car seats were not required on taxis, but I wasn't sure if the site was trustworthy.  Thank you so much in advance!	Yes
9	"Police saw I had a fake or otherwise not mine, parking pass one day while I wasn't with my car. Long story short They found me a week later in my car about to leave it on the street in a 2hour parking. I didn't give it to them but I may have given them enough information to meet the low standard of probable cause. The officer wanted to meet with me later in the week so I could hand him the pass and, ""aren't in any trouble just want the pass"". I talked to two criminal attorneys that said to not meet or give up the pass to this guy. My thing is, during the initial talk I gave him my license to check and my cell phone #. If he does end up trying to call me my idea is to not answer. Not that the problem will necessarily go away but I don't want to give any more information to this guy. Thoughts?   If i get a criminal complaint, will be hiring a lawyer for the clerk hearing for sure."	Yes
10	Hi there.  I'm a 26 year old female who just started driving. (Don't judge.) I got into an accident this past Monday, and I don't have my license or permit, Even though I've passed the test. I was just driving my mom's car and found out that she didn't insure the car, and I'm kinda stuck on what I should do next. I don't have insurance at the moment, and I'm not sure what to do. No one was seriously injured, but the cars are damaged for sure. I was found at fault because I had a stop sign, but I didn't see her barrelling down the street. She hit me on the passenger side. This is in Seattle, and I usually don't drive there, but the day off the accident, I was trying to pick up extra shifts for work. I realize what I did was incredibly stupid but honestly, we're moving soon, and this unexpected accident coupled with the other financial strain is starting to get to me.   The person who got hit, is insured, and their claims representative is trying to get proof of insurance, which I don't have. Is it possible to ask for a payment plan of some sort, or how receptive will they be? Also I haven't gone to court yet, it's only been a few days. Should I fight it to get the fine reduced a little?	Yes
11	"Back in Oct. 2010 I got a DUI in FL. My license was suspended until the completion of 6mos Interlock and a DUI class. I've spent the past few years using public transportation and have also moved out of FL. Where I've most recently moved in NorCal is very, very rural (I live on 40 acres, and all the plots are 40 acres) and I'm also in the process of getting a small Tech Support business started. So, I knew I'd need to get my license squared away.  FL tells me I need to get the Interlock device on a vehicle (which I have), then go to CA DMV with the paperwork, they will verify and issue a limited license (for work, school, errands, etc.), and once they issue my temporary license to mail a copy of it, along with some paperwork, to the FL DMV and they'll start the 6mos for my Interlock ONLY THEN.  I go to the CA DMV and they told me as long as FL has a hold on my license there's nothing they can do for me, Interlock or no. The DMV worker gives me the Mandatory Actions number, but they tell me the same thing.  It seems I'm stuck in a catch-22- the lasy with Mandatory Actions actually told me ""you may have to move to FL for 6 mos."" :|  Does anyone have any insights? Feel free to ask me any questions to help clarify, etc"	Yes
12	**TL;DR:** Should I go to court over a 1110(a) violation based on the defense that I am an out of town and not regular NYC driver and the sign was not visible to me? Or take the 2 points and pay the fine?  **My problem:**  I received a traffic ticket for violation of 1110(a) (2 points) in November 2015 in Brooklyn. All I can read on the ticket is: Disobeyed...traffic...device. I had an initial court date of September 2017. I was unable to attend, and it was rescheduled to 5/2017. Then, I got a letter in the mail that it was now 8/2017.   I wanted to know my best approach. I am not sure what details matter so I included as many as I could remember.  **Background:**  I turned right after another car on a busy intersection at a green after sitting and waiting for pedestrians to clear. After I completed the turn, I was pulled over (the other car wasn't).  It was a no right turn intersection. I am not a regular city driver. And I had never seen this sign. It was new to me. I am trying to find out the date of install. At the time, it was blocked by a truck, and I was behind a big truck. I followed another car and turned right. The cop was aggressive with me and implied he could do more than ticket me which I felt to be arrest, and I did not challenge him beyond an inquiry.   At the time, I was back and forth in NY and did not drive in state, and I had an out of state license. Now I live in NY, and I have not got a NY license yet because I don't drive and didn't have a SS card and enough ID points (I do have a NYC ID card). Now I have both, and I am not sure if I should retain my out of state license for point reasons or get a NY license this week. This is my first ticket on this license (had a license at 16, let it lapse when I stopped driving, retook the driver's test in my 20s).  **Questions:**  1. Is it worth fighting this ticket on this basis? Or should I just pay the fine?  2. Do I need an attorney?  3. If not, how will this hearing go? What should I be prepared for? This is all new to me.  4. Should I get a NY license (and won't be driving) or will the outcome affect my new license? Or keep the out of state until the court date?  **Secondary questions:**  1. I can find a database about parking signs but not traffic signs. Any idea I can find when a traffic regulation began at a particular intersection?  2. My new hearing time is at 4:30 in the afternoon. Is this typical? The TVB closes at 4:00. I have an evening class, and I wondered how long I could expect to be there.  3. If I go to DMV and request a new date, are they likely to give me one with school conflict?  4. Why would the DMV change the hearing date on their end?  Thank you for any and all help. I appreciate any insight. I have no idea what to do or expect. Have a great week.	Yes
13	My friends car was stolen out of my driveway last week and the cops found it 2 days ago and towed it to a local impoundment. My friend is in Europe for the next 2 weeks (from US) and will obviously not be able to pick up. The impoundment is charging $30 per day which will add up to about $400 plus the cost of towing. Is there any way that he can give me permission to get his car out? The impoundment is claiming there is no way anyone can retrieve it besides my friend.	Yes
14	From what I understand, they go easier on first-time offenders.  Let's say somebody accidentally rear ends another car.  There are no injuries.  A ticket is issued for failing to stop.  The court reduces his offense to impeding traffic, due to his clean driving record.  Four years later, the same driver commits the same offense.  Is he considered a first-time offender, as the points only stay on record for 3 years?	Yes
15	Just recently transferred a car from my dad to me and they copied my address down wrong and my new title should be 2700 my street address but it is 2706 my street address. Does this really matter, and if so are they going to try and charge me for their mistake?   Don't know if it makes a difference but the address they put on it does not technically exist.	Yes
16	My brother was driving at 11:30 at night. I was in the passengers seat and had hopped out to help him pull into a spot when he scrapped the neighboring car with his mirror. I did not hear or see this. After he told me it occurred, I told him to leave a note. He left his car parked but didn't leave a note and is now being charged with a hit and run. Since I was the licensed driver in the car, am I going to be charged?	Yes
17	Okay let me start this off by saying I was 100% in the wrong. I could have gotten a reckless driving ticket but didn't. Instead I got a Speeding Ticket (2 Points/$160) and a Failure to Observe Lanes Ticket (2 Points/$165). This was my first offense and I know I'm in the wrong. My question is it worth it to go to court to try and reduce/remove the points or should I just take the blessing of not getting a reckless driving ticket/losing my license. Thank you in advance.	Yes
18	This happened on Wednesday, I'm pretty much not injured, my motorcycle hasn't been towed to the shop yet, I don't know the damage figures (I just hope it won't be totaled, my dumbass 23 year old self didn't get GAP insurance)  According to Russ Brown (or at least someone from them) since I wasn't majorly injured, there's nothing they can really help me with. I haven't received a copy of the collision report by the police, either.   As for the accident itself, I was riding down the freeway, going about 20mph between lanes (HOV and fast lane) when a Toyota Camry that I was either about to pass or already passing, turned into the next lane(one of those, gotta get in that lane, theres space, quick turns without looking) and hit me, I went down. I only remember the impact, then rolling. Then 2 gracious men, helped me get from the middle of the freeway to the far right side, along with my bike. After they checked if I was ok of course, they also called the ambulance for me.    I did not rear end the Camry, all the damage is right behind her passenger side rear tire.   I'm just afraid I won't be able to get my motorcycle back, that motorcycle is all I really own and I don't know what to do.   I won't be able to go to work until it's fixed, Interviews are iffy, I'd have to borrow my parents truck but it's a salvaged truck that isn't working right a lot of the time. I commute from Fontana to LA, uber would be too expensive. Plus because of this I missed out on the last two days of my contract with an agency.   What can I even do? I'm just rambling at this point.	Yes
19	I was involved in an at-fault accident recently.  This is my first accident, and hopefully my last.  The cop told me he needs to prove to the insurance company that it was not the other guy's fault.  He wrote me a ticket for failing to maintain a safe distance.  Couldn't he have acknowledged that this was not the other driver's fault in a police report, but not issue me a ticket?	Yes
20	"Well, there were no responses to this but I wanted to submit one in case somebody came here looking for something similar.  I did *not* have a bench warrant. The lady that initially told me there was a problem with my license was saying that I probably had one, but, as it turns out, they just communicated my unpaid traffic fines to the Georgia DDS.   I called first thing this morning, and the folks at the courthouse told me how much I owed and allowed me to pay over the phone. They then told me it would be immediately removed from the system, BUT in order for there to not be an issue getting a new license, I can call their courthouse with the DMV office I'm going to tomorrow, and they will contact the office directly and let them know of the status.  Basically, I can get my license again and be legal now that I paid my fines, and I only had to Uber to work one day. :) Yay. I'm by no means saying that this was a good situation to be in, but I was absolutely terrified of what this meant when I initially realized what was going on. Google searching ""Didn't show up for traffic tickets in Georgia"" yields terrifying results. I was surprised I wasn't arrested right then and there at the DMV after googling all night.  But, this is a lesson learned."	Yes
21	"I'm in Virginia.  My ex and I purchased a car together in 2008. We broke up in 2011. No divorce, because we weren't legally married, but we agreed that my ex would keep the car and pay for it. Both of our names were on the loan, which put both of our names on the title.   Due to the following circumstances, my name remains on the title. I want to get it off the title and my ex - who wants no contact with me - told me that I have to take care of it. This is an issue because my ex doesn't pay his car tax (he owes three years' worth), and the state of VA could come after me for it since I'm listed on the title. And the kicker: The tax bills come to me since my name is the first one on the title. I text photos of the bills to my ex and he acknowledges them. (I have all the texts in my phone.) He told me that his therapist told him not to talk to me, so that means I have to handle this. (Yes, I'm angry.)  The circumstances:  1. My ex paid off the loan in 2014, but the credit union is still holding the car title because he owes them money for a defaulted credit card.  2. I declared bankruptcy in 2012, the year after we split, which discharged my responsibility for the loan. My ex told me that I could no longer talk to the bank about the loan since my bankruptcy placed it into collections and he was the owner of the loan.  3. In 2014, my bankruptcy lawyer arranged for the bank to allow me and my ex to sign the title and pay them $12.50 to get my name removed. My ex said he would do it but ultimately didn't.  4. In the meantime, my ex has not contacted the bank about the debt or the car title.  How can I get the title from the bank? My understanding is that I have ownership but not possession of the vehicle. Do I have standing to contact the bank? Should I try to work through a lawyer? The last time I contacted a lawyer, he was baffled by my case and recommended that I gather DMV paperwork to show my ownership to have him write a ""strongly worded"" letter to the bank. Is this the best option?"	Yes
22	y friend has been caught driving on a suspended license 7 times so when she got pulled over this time, she gave my name because she didn't mine is suspended as well. They didn't check for an ID so she got me a couple of tickets and now I have to go to court. I don't want to get her in trouble for driving on a suspended and giving false information but I don't want to go to court and have the officer recognize that I'm not the woman he pulled over and get myself in trouble either. I have no idea what to do.	Yes
23	I received a speeding ticket today driving 57 in a 35. I received the ticketed driving from Kentucky to Knoxville Tennessee. I was pulled over in Oneida Tennessee where the speed limit dropped from 55 to 35. The sign can not be seen until crossing over a hill, which gives you roughly 50 yards to slow down. Naturally, I did not see the sign and was pulled over immediately. I know that this was obviously a speed trap, characteristic of small towns on states borders, but I am extremely about this. Do I have any means of getting the case thrown out, and if so, what approach should I take?  I am 22, work a low paying job in a town 3 hours away.	Yes
24	"I involved a car accident last September 5th. since then I had Dr. visited almost every other week. My auto insurance paid some medical bill, but deny other. I consider hire an attorney to file a lawsuit. I want to clarify the ""1 year anniversary"" thing.  Let's say I have a treatment 12/1/2016 which auto insurance deny the payment, I must file lawsuit before 11/30/2017, or 9/4/2017?  Second question, what's the threshold to hire an attorney. Let's say if unpaid bill is $1000, I probably just go with my medical insurance (I still need to pay about $1000 for the deductible). But if it's $10k, I definitely want to hire an attorney. But how about the figure is in between? Last time I review my bill, it's about $3000.  I wonder if it's wise to go with attorney route?"	Yes
25	"So I received a parking citation at 12:30 AM for parking in a residential neighborhood without a permit. I'm guessing there were no pictures taken as it was pitch black out. The person who issued the ticket put the wrong license plate, and wrote that the VIN is ""not readable"". I checked the status of my ticket online and put in my actual license plate and nothing showed up, however I can access it with the citation number. Should I wait this out and hope for no further consequences or should I just pay it?"	Yes
26	I was pulled over for doing 98 in a 75 in Arizona, the officer decided to not impound my vehicle and instead write me a ticket. He said because I was out of state I could call the number on the ticket and see if I had to show up to court. I called the number and was told that I didn't have to show up to court and that I would have to e-mail the court e-mail address and ask if I could pay my fine in payments or all at once. I did that and it has been about 2 weeks with no response. I haven't received any communication regarding my ticket. This is my first ever traffic violation, what are my options?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
27	I was driving home in my work truck when the brakes suddenly gave out. I have a feeling the brake line burst, but still waiting to hear back from the mechanic. I felt fine yesterday but today I'm feeling sore in my lower back and my neck. Is there any legal action I can take towards my company for the accident?	Yes
28	I got a ticket a month back for not stopping at a stop sign and driving 1-10 mph over the speed limit. I did not commit either of these. The information on the ticket in wrong. Although my licence information is correct, the police wrote down the wrong year, make, model, and license plate of the car. I went to court to fight the ticket but the police officer did not show up so the judge dismissed the ticket. I did not disclose to the court or police department that the ticket contained the wrong information. I received a letter in the mail saying the officer that did not show up to the informal hearing in front of the magistrate is appealing the ruling and that I am required to come to a formal hearing in front of a judge. What are the chances that the judge will rule in my favor? Does the fact that the ticket was originally dismissed influence the decision of the judge? What should I look out for during the formal hearing? I will hire a lawyer tomorrow.	Yes
29	Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my personal account.   Tonight, I was pulled over for speeding and just given a verbal warning. I was incredibly freaked out and didn't ask the officer any of my questions when he asked if I had any, so now I really need a little peace of mind.   What are the consequences of a verbal warning? Is it possible to receive a ticket after the fact, like the officer changes his mind and decides I should have been ticketed? Does anyone have to find out about this verbal warning (future employers, insurance company, parents)? How will my driving record be affected (I've never been pulled over before)?   Sorry for all the questions that probably seem obvious, I've been trying to do a ton of research but I'm having a hard time figuring out a solid answer. I saw a post on this sub from 2 years ago that someone was pulled over, issued a verbal warning, then got a ticket in the mail later, which has me all kinds of worried.	Yes
30	I think i made a big mistake. I saw a firetruck in the distance ( i thought it would come in about 30 seconds so I made the turn . however, it came to be alot faster than i thought and instead it was closer to 10 seconds. When I made the turn, the firetruck turned out to be much closer but by the time i realised, i was already about 1/4 way in the turn. I quickly accelerated making the turn   by that time the firetruck was where i was at the turn, he was 4 seconds away   I thought I really had more time. Do you think Ill get in trouble for not waiting  I havent been pulled over but im scared that someone will report my license	Yes
31	he was in the process of giving a ticket to someone else. He was in his car. I passed him and i moved over a little in my lane without crossing into the next lane. He caught up to me about a mile and a half and said he pulled me over because (unbeknownst to me you cant pass an emergency vehicle) I did not move into the next lane. Gives me a citation and sends me on my way. It 438.00. Is there anything i can do to bring it down or to argue it. I had never heard of the law before, nor do i have any tickets or accidents. Just 1 warning for speeding.	Yes
32	"I have a 22ft Grumman Olsen Curbmaster bread truck with two axels and six wheels that as registered as a personal vehicle and used like one. I don't use it everyday, but frequently enough for it not to be abandoned. I park it along a back alley near my work. There is a graveyard blocked by hedges on one side, and a storage place on the other. The closest residential building is over 200 feet away and around the corner.   Today I was confronted by that homeowner 200 feet away and told me that he had called the police, twice, and that Monday, my truck would be towed. I asked him if it was against the law. He said yes, that it was illegal to park anywhere for more than 24 hours,  and then it had two be moved at least 4 blocks away. Before leaving he said, ""I'll let you know, I am an expert on parking laws. I'm not asking you to move it, I'm telling you."" which, of course makes me want to leave it there much more because I like to watch rude people squirm...  Anyway, personal matters aside, it is going to be a real pain to move it 4 blocks every day into real residential territory where people have a real right to be upset (like right in front of their house). The only laws I could find on the internet was that you cannot park a truck in front of across from a residence for more than 8 hours.   I see Laurelhurst park surrounded with full time RV livers and I doubt I'm that high on the to do list for the police even if I am parked illegally.   So my questions are,  1) am I parked illegally  2) will it really be Monday when I am towed? Isn't this city overflowing with RVers who are obviously lived in and illegally parked? (I'm thinking Laurelhurst Park) Will they have to give me some kind of warning sticker?  3) where can I park this thing if I have to move?  I am completely ignorant of all things law, and don't know even where to look for myself so I really appreciate your advice."	Yes
33	As it says in the title, I received a ticket for doing 70 in a 55, but I just looked at the ticket and the name and home address were of a complete stranger from another city. The car information on the ticket is correct, and everything else seems to be correct.  My question is this: Does this mean the ticket can be dismissed? Also is the stranger now in legal trouble? What do?	Yes
34	I understand completely that I am at fault for rear ending somebody.  The insurance is covering the other driver (just their back corner was hit), but my car is being totaled because I fell into a ditch.  Nobody was hurt.  This is my first offense and I am only 18. I do not want any legal implications to ruin my life/my parent's insurance rates for the next few years. My options are 1.admit guilt 2.admit guilt with explanation 3. Deny  From what I researched, Michigan assumes that the driver who hits the car from behind is at fault.  What are the realistic outcomes as to what could happen with each decision?  Do cops really show up to court if I choose to plea not guilty?  Does the prosecutor/judge go easy on first time traffic offenses?  Which one is the best choice, given the context?	Yes
35	I received by email a speeding ticket for 17mph in a 10mph from my HOA. The speed limits are 15mph outside parking structures, and 10mph inside parking structures. I remember the day I got clocked since the patrol (which is HOA security, not police) was standing from the opposite end of the parking entrance aiming towards the parking entrance (transition between 15mph to 10mph). I didn't get stopped by security that day (thus the email). What irritates me is that I recall checking my speed and being good. The radar gun looked old and I doubt they calibrate it.. but I doubt they'll care since it's HOA. Please help? What are my options? (And I'm already moving out so I don't care of burning bridges)	Yes
36	Hello all  Tomorrow I have a pre trial conference for a headlight that was out. I was given a fix it ticket but apparently it was not received in time. ( I have a credit card statement of an auto zone visit the day it was fixed). This is not my car and I was physically un able to fix it or sign the ticket myself. It was fixed in due time tho. I am bringing a copy of the statement and a video of the headlights working.  Would this be enough to possibly get it thrown out? If I'm offered a deal should I just take it?  Thanks for the help.	Yes
37	"Currently, I live with my bf who owns 2 vehicles. Unfortunately, our apartment complex only allows one parking spot per person living in the apartment. I have 1 car and my boyfriend has 2 which obviously leaves us one space short. The next part of the story is super important, at the time of move in and multiple times afterwards (via email as well as verbal) the apartment complex I currently live in told us that the street across from our apartment is a public street meaning that we could park our extra vehicle on that street without paying for an additional spot. That was what we thought was the end of that. Additionally, at least 20-30 cars park on this street daily as spill over from our complex.  My boyfriend primarily uses one car over the other; however, both cars have been used throughout the 8 months we have lived there and we have never had issues up until this point.   A little bit of background on a separate incident but related in the sense that the same officer has issued all the tickets to the vehicle in question:  On 12/16/2016 my boyfriend received a parking ticket for being ""more than 12 inches away from the curb"". Not really thinking to take a picture of the vehicle before moving it, accepted the ticket and paid the appropriate fee.  Back to the current story:  After running into my neighbors and talking to them about what happened everyone I talked to had similar stories! I figured ""I guess this is how the police deal with their time in a sleepy town and while annoying parking tickets are apart of life"". I sent an email to my leasing office explaining the situation and the leasing office sent a reply saying their policies are their policies and to their understanding we are legally allowed to park on that street. I still have a copy of this email for my own records.  On 06/08/2017 we received a warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location (I do have this warning but it is not with me. I can upload this ticket late if need be). So not thinking much of it, my boyfriend moved the vehicle a couple of streets over with additional public parking(which I pass on my way to work everyday and can visually see the windshield and would noticed any ticket or warning).  On 06/29/2017 on my way to work I noticed that the car was not in it's normal ""spot"" which I check daily on my way to work. I sincerely make it a point to check everyday as we almost missed the deadline to pay for the first ticket due not seeing the ticket. I frantically call my boyfriend and explain whats going on. At first we thought the car had been stolen but after looking online realized it could have been towed. We contacted the local tow company and sure enough that was the case.  We promptly went to go retrieve the car; however; because the police department was the one who issued the tow, we could not retrieve the car until we have payed the associated fees with the police department. Great. At this point we were livid as we had never received any notification that car was going to be towed.   We go to the police department and to our utter shock there were apparently 2 outstanding parking tickets for ""parking without permission on public property"" (WTF does that even mean?!?!) and that we had received ANOTHER warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location. Outraged we said we were never notified of the tickets or the second warning to move the vehicle (The tickets are bright pink and I visually check the windshield daily and would have noticed these tickets/warning) and would be appealing them but unfortunately we were told we had to pay the additional associated fees if we wanted to retrieve the car from the impound lot. Additionally, we stated we had moved the vehicle after the first ""dead"" vehicle warning so clearly it was not a dead vehicle. The clerk stated all she could do was give us the tickets and pay the fee but if we wanted to appeal the tickets we would have to submit additional paperwork (we have the paperwork and are currently filling it out).   We then retrieved the car which had NO PARKING TICKETS ON THE WINDSHEILD and after getting home a reviewing the tickets realized ALL THE TICKETS WERE ISSUED BY THE SAME OFFICER!!! Including the first parking tickets we received in December.  I have no clue if what is going on is illegal or not and I am just really looking for advice on how to move forward. This situation does not read right to me and after everything is all said and done (and if we end up having to pay the tickets) we will have sunk 1k into this whole ordeal.  I can't help but to feel we were specifically targeted as about 20-30 people park on the street across from our complex all the time and never get towed. My head is spinning and the idea that a police officer can get away with what has happened sickens. I'm also having a hard time stomaching a 1k loss without any idea on how to prevent it in the future as my bf was about to go to college and we had to dip into that money to cover this expense.   /r/legaladvice please help. What can I do? Is this legal? Should I file a complaint against the police officer?"	Yes
38	I am in the process of buying a car from my boss.   I will be making payments toward it but it will remain in his name until I pay it off. Everything is going smoothly and we even have a contract drawn up, and have a reciept book set up so there will be a proper paper trail there.   We live near the state line, him in Indiana and I in Ohio so I'm unsure how to go about insurance. It's part of our contract that I have it for the duration of me paying off the car (and legally have it to drive, duh). So, do I need to go through Ohio or Indiana to get it? I have no problem getting it myself, or would it be better for me to be added to his policy and just pay him the difference?  Thanks!	Yes
39	"So this is my first ever speeding ticket - I honestly have no idea how to approach this. I got the ticket about a week ago in Bishop, CA while driving on a road trip. From about a mile away, I saw a black SUV and knowing my brother was nearby, I sped up to see if it was him. Once I got close enough to realize it was actually a patrol SUV with the words ""highway patrol"" on the rear, I immediately slowed down. But by then, I'm assuming, the cop had already matched my speed. He pulled to the side, allowing me to get ahead of him - then he proceeded to pull me over.   The court appearance that I have is about 300 miles away from my house. I'm willing to show up if it means I can get out of the ticket - but is there anything at all that I can do or say to make this ticket go away? I know it's a long shot, but I have to try!"	Yes
40	Quick question for everyone here. I just got a speeding ticket via photo enforcement in Washington DC. I was going 16 over so it's a 150 dollar fine.   I have two questions for everyone here.    1) If I go to contest the penalty is there a judge that I speak with or is it a random person behind a desk? I ask this because it looks like the address is just a suite and not a court house.   2) What are the odds that the judge lowers the fine if I've never had a moving violation before? (Been driving for over 6 years) Is it even worth me going in? Or should I just pay it.    I am obviously guilty of speeding. I'm not contesting the ticket itself. I am wondering if the fine can be reduced though.	Yes
41	I was driving home from the gym and there was a car parked in the narrow street right outside the gym. I thought he stopped for the red light but he was parked the entire time. As I was waiting there thinking he would move a car hit me from behind going slowly. I was driving at pathfinder whereas he had something along the lines of an accord ? And his license plate was dent whereas nothing really happened to my car. When i went home however I noticed that my rear bumper had a crack on it not really noticeable. Unfortunately I'm an idiot and didn't bother exchanging information with him. Can I still ask him to fix it ?	Yes
42	"My Fiancee and I were on driving back home from Montreal to NJ yesterday morning, July 30. Literally around 10 miles after crossing the border from Canada back into the US, I got pulled over for speeding, 80 mph in a 65 mph highway (I-87). My question is if it's worth it fight the ticket, whether driving back for the court date or hiring an attorney. A few bullets below:  * Last speeding ticket in NY was like August 17, 2014. * Had a speeding ticket in CT in Feb 2015, but it was reduced to a ""traffic violation"" * I live right by NYC, so it would be a 5 hour drive to the local courthouse. * Worried about the fine/points since it would technically be within 3 years of my last conviction. * As stated, it was 80 in a 65. * I was driving with a couple of cars near me on a Sunny, clear morning. * I was driving in the left lane and slowed down once I saw the officer.  So what do you guys think, would it be worth it to fight it, or just pay it and plead guilty?"	Yes
43	So I was extremely stupid and sped in Virginia on I-95 on my way home from North Carolina. I had my cruise control set for 78MPH and didn't realize that the speed limit changed to 55MPH so I messed up big time. Luckily, the officer wrote the ticket as a general speeding ticket rather than wreckless driving, which he said it technically was. I don't know if I should attempt to go to court for it to reduce the speed or not bother because the cop already did me a favor. I am fine with paying the fine as this is a totally legitimate ticket, but I just want to know my best plan of action. This is my first ever ticket	Yes
44	She is not 21 yet. She bought a car and had been wanting to in awhile. I did not know about this but I am willing to help family unconditionally.  I just need to know why they need me. I think it's because she is under 21 and since no one else is currently able to sign, I will have to. I leased my own car years ago, so I am murky about the process.  Do I need to watch out for anything when I go to the DMV and sign my name to it? What do I do after she turns 21?	Yes
45	I recently got my first speeding ticket and called the courthouse from the county I got pulled over in to ask some questions about how and when to pay for it, and the guy on the phone said the biggest mistake people make is not attempting to reduce their speeding ticket fines. Especially if it's their first offense. He was super nice and gave me some advice about writing a letter to the judge. So I was like yeah sure I'll give it a shot.  Some websites say don't admit fault, and some websites say to apologize in the letter. Apologizing is admitting fault.. so what do I do?	Yes
46	My question involves a traffic ticket from the state of: Washington  Hey guys, seriously appreciate any advice here.   My car was parked in my apartment complex's lot and had a resident sticker in the windshield after I registered it with management 2 years earlier. I had left for about 2 months to take car of my father who had a stroke, I didn't let management know I was leaving, paid bills on time while away. Looks like 30 days after I had left they decided they wanted to give everyone assigned parking spots, and if you didn't move your car for painting within a specific date, they would tow you. Obviously didn't move my car cause I wasn't there so car got towed and sold at an auction. I understand it’s my fault for not letting management know I was leaving but I never received any phone calls, emails, or anything from them that my car would be towed, or that we needed to move our cars for the parking assignments. I did receive a letter in the mail from the tow company though, which I only saw 30 days later when I returned home.   I haven't had a chance to speak with management yet because I just got back.   This is over a $10k loss for me if I can’t be reimbursed for my car...  Reading around on google looks like I have to take it up with small claims court.   What do you guys think?  Any feedback is greatly appreciated!!!!	Yes
47	Hello, I just received driving permit under AB 60 from Stanton DLPC (I'm over 18). I want to make an appointment for driving test, so I called the DMV. Then I was told to call a number that says on my paperwork but I didn't get any paperwork other than my number. They said I have to call a number starting with 805, or DMV will call me but that's uncertain. Is the interview required? (Since stanton dlpc didn't mention anything) or will they call me? (How long then?) Thank you	Yes
48	So i was out the other night with a couple friends and not so wisely decided to bang out a couple doughnuts in an empty parking lot. Shortly after a cop rolled up and wrote me up for reckless driving. I am not sure weather or not i should hire a lawyer to fight this and court or what the cost would be to do so. Any help would be great, -Ryan	Yes
49	"I live in an area of Los Angeles where parking is extremely tight and limited. My complex has 100+ units and 10 private parking spots. It looks like some people have taken to spray painting red zones to create additional parking spots that look like other zones which are painted white. In addition, I was operating under the belief that your front tire has to be within the boundaries of a parking spot when a red zone is involved.  I received a ticket for an LAMC 80.56E4 violation, which reads:  &gt; 4.   No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle at any time in any red ""No Stopping"" zone or portion of street posted with signs reading ""No Stopping Any Time"", except that a bus may stop in such zone or portion of street marked or sign posted as a bus stop.  Such ""No Stopping"" zones shall be in effect during all times unless limited to specified hours and/or days by posted signs.

Here was how I was parked. I was right up against the boundary because the car behind me created very little space in the front while they had plenty in the back to get out. Do I have an argument to contest the ticket?  http://imgur.com/a/5IQM9"	Yes
50	**Background**   August of 2016, I was ticketed for driving without insurance and for speeding.  I went to court and was given a fine and the ticket was removed from my record  for good behavior.   The speeding ticket was thrown out.      Two weeks ago, I was pulled over for failing to yield at a stop sign. I was also ticketed for driving under a suspended licence.  My car was impounded  due to the traffic stop.   I did not know the reason for my drivers licence being suspended.   I contacted the dmv as soon as I could to find the reason i was suspended.  I found out when I changed insurancce companies I neglected to add the sr-22 to my insurance plan.    I quickly got it corrected.     **Plan**  I dont have any money for a defense attourney. My court day is August 21.  I plan to go Tuesday during open session to get this sorted out,   Here is what I am planning to do  1.  Bring proof that I had no lapse in insurance. 2. Explain that when I got new insurance I neglected to get sr-22 due to thinking it was automatically added by the system. 3. Explain I would have never driven if i knew my licence was suspended.  4.  I was not sure if i should bring this up.  I am going to vietnam to volunteer teaching children English.  This is my biggest concern  that i will no longer be able to go.   How should I handled talking to them? Should I answer only questions presented? Should I ask to explain my situation first? Any tips would be greatful!!	Yes
51	"Would welcome your advice if I need to see a lawyer as well, and if so, what type.   I live in Virginia, and was driving in a construction zone in Washington, DC.  There was a flash and a camera recorded me speeding.  A $100 ticket was mailed to me.  However, due to health issues, I just opened my mail, and I missed the original deadline, so now the fine is $200.     But DC offers this option ""Admit with Explanation"" where I admit liability and explain by mail or in-person. An examiner will review my explanation and consider reducing my fine.     However, I can't tell if my insurance would increase if I admit fault.  This is my first speeding ticket EVER. I can write that I have a clean record and this was unintentional.  Should I mention my medical issues for my delayed response?  How do I find out if my insurance rates will increase if I admit to this ticket?  Thanks."	Yes
52	My parked motorcycle was totaled  by a woman last year on July 17th, and the insurance company didn't cut me a check until September 6th. I agreed by phone to the number quoted by the agent and he said he would also be paying the estimate and storage fees at the garage so I could pick the bike up. The check was smaller than the number he originally quoted me (he didn't say on the phone that various deductions would be made), I later saw he greatly undervalued the bike (didn't account for almost $5K in after market parts), and he only paid the $200 estimate but not the $1000 storage fee. I'm still in dispute with the woman's insurance company over the remaining balance.   My question is- seeing as (I've been told) it's the law here that I'm owed loss of use on my vehicle from when it is disabled until I receive a check, but the check didn't reflect the correct value the bike OR to have it released from the garage, am I still only entitled to the cost of a comparable rental between those two dates?	Yes
53	I received a parking ticket in the mail from U of I in Urbana, but I've never been there (I live in Wisconsin). In addition, the ticket was dated 2009 but my plates were issued in 2017 (they had the right plates for me). The number and website on the form seem to be legit University of Illinois parking services. I called them and the ticket is on record for them, but the vehicle description is wrong and they couldn't provide an explanation for the date. Will this negatively impact my credit or anything? How do I fight this? I've already sent a vehicle abstract from the Wisconsin DMV to the U of I parking services website to prove my plates are relatively new.	Yes
54	Hi, Reddit! My brother bought a Prius last year from a local dealer. Within a month, one of the battery cells went out. The dealer fixed it and said the problem was solved. And then it happened again. The dealer fixed it the second time and promised it wouldn't happen again. After the third time, my brother asked to exchange the car or to have someone else fix it because he was tired of being stranded on the freeway. The dealer then blocked his phone number. When my brother tried to call from someone else's phone, the dealer would block that number as well. When he went to the dealer in person, the receptionist would say the dealer was on lunch, in a meeting, etc.  It's been a year of this runaround and the car has been sitting in our garage. My brother stopped making payments since he couldn't use the car. No one from the dealership contacted him about this. The dealership has gone out of business so there's no way to return the car. So now, he'd like to junk it, but the title is still in the dealer's name. He sent a registered letter to the dealer, asking to work out some sort of solution, but it came back as undeliverable. Do we have any options?	Yes
55	"Hi guys,  I purchased a 2007 Ford Fusion in Ontario, Canada in May, 2017.  In June I noticed some irregularities at low speed and got the tires balanced ($50). Despite the balancing helping a bit, the car was still a little 'heavy.' Checked all my fluids and realized power steering was low, filled it up and all was good for a bit. July: car still wasn't smooth, so I purchased new tires ($800). This didn't help much... Now power steering fluid goes out faster than I can pour it in and I also notice a leak in the transmission fluid. Before I can even get to the repair shop for a check I drove over a small speedbump at low speed and everything falls apart. Strugglebus it to the mechanic and they take a quick look before telling me I should contact a transmission shop.  Left front wheel barely spins and power steering/transmission fluid is everywhere, so there might be more wrong than what they listed here: *Front right axle is leaking *Transfer case is broken *Driveshaft is broken *Major power steering leak *Major transmission leak  The transmission shop quoted me a repair at $2500 minimum. They asked if I had been in a major accident and ""confirmed"" that it was incredibly unlikely that all these problems were caused by me.  Do I have any rights with regards to probably getting screwed over by the dealership &amp; safety test?  Thank you"	Yes
56	"I am a young girl and I was pulled over today after taking a picture at a red light. After the light turned green I no longer had any contact with my phone. I was soon greeted with blue lights and quickly pulled over. The first thing the police officer said to me was ""I saw you texting on your pink phone"" which was weird considering my phone is not at all pink. I told him I took a picture at the red light and he took my license. He came back after a while and said ""Now we are going to have some fun."" I didn't know what to say so I sat there and he said ""take out your phone and take a picture of my car and post it for everyone to see"" I obliged and he then said, ""Good, now everyone should make fun of you for it."" Then proceeded to hand me my citation where I could see that he wrote as a note that ""driver had both hands on phone typing while head was down looking at screen while vehicle was in motion."" Now this is a complete lie because all I did was take a picture at a red light. What are my options and how do I get out this expensive ticket considering I'm a broke college student!"	Yes
57	The second woman that hit me made it clear she would rather pay out of pocket than have a claim on her insurance.  I realize it may not be the most ethical thing to do, but would I be breaking any laws to accept a cash payment from her, and make a claim with the other rear-enders insurance?  I realize it's a bit shady, I just need to be clear on whether or not I would be breaking any laws.	Yes
58	Lets's say Driver A rear ends Driver B.  There are no injuries.  Driver A wants to admit fault without inolving police.  Can Driver A somehow let the insurance companies know that he was at fault, just so Driver A does not have to go through the court process by involving police?	Yes
59	Got into a car accident with a brand new lease car. I'm at fault and I have no insurance on the car. The leading agreement for my cAr too says I need to have full coverage at all times during the lease. So the contract for the lease has been breached as well and the repairs for the car are too much for me right now. I need help or some type of direction on what to do now. I know I messed up bad	Yes
60	I was riding down a street in the bike lane. There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while. My bike kept going and it got run over by their car being completely destroyed. The driver was immediately apologetic and claimed responsibility. They provided me with their contact and insurance information.   So my problem here is I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I'd prefer not to get lawyers involved because she was extremely nice and wanted to work with me on this. I do want her to pay for my hospital visit and a replacement to my bike. My bike I bought new and got it in a rare situation of the bike needing to be sold because it was a year old model and got it for about half the msrp with also haggling. I'm pretty sure I can't get a bike like that again for the price I paid for it.  My main questions: 1. I have not been in a situation like this before. Do I call her insurance right away and report the situation? 2. What do I tell them? (Might sound silly but I don't to say anything wrong that will prevent me from getting covered) 3. Can I provide them with the make and model of my bike to get the msrp value for it instead of receipt value?  Thanks in advance for any advice.	Yes
61	"Hey, Guys! It's my first time posting here but I've been a long time lurker of this Sub.  I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do here so I figured I would ask.. Back in mid June my fiancé and I went to see a movie at the local theater. We were leaving and back on the main road that has a few exits onto a main highway. It was very busy and the traffic was stop and go. While trying to change lanes into the lane to our left the traffic again paused very quickly and we hit the back of the car in front of us. It was a low speed collision and there was absolutely no damage to the other car, not even a dent. We took pictures. We have been in contact with the other drive since and there have been no issues with her car. Our vehicle took some damage but we later found out it was cosmetic only and only because our inner rebar had rusted. The damage was minimal enough that we did not go through our insurance.  Cops were called, everyone gave statements.. As far as car accidents go it was pleasant. I was not driving (I currently have an injury that prevents me from doing so but didn't drive previously either). My fiancé was. He has been driving for over 10 years and had never been in an accident before. This was his first. We get a ticket to appear in court.  We get there at the court date and are given a packet of info pertaining to the case. Included is the full police report as well as a plea deal. His plea deal was for a $85 fine and 2 demerit points. We were shocked... Both of us had assumed it would be a fine only. We considered taking the plea but then started looking through the report. The summery that the Cops wrote does not match what actually happened at all, nor does it match the statements from either of us or the other driver.  In the report it states that we were turning onto the road we were already on from a completely different road and literally turned into her from there. This sounds much worse than what actually took place and there is a diagram to match this false account. At the court was the first time we had seen this report. It also states that the other car had a dent and took damage which is untrue and we have pictures to prove that. I am able to take pictures of this if it would help for advice on here.  I'm at a loss. When we got to the judge he tried to explain that the report wasn't correct but all we got was a new date to appear, which is this coming Wednesday. This is new territory for both of us and I'm not sure what to do next or what he may need to say to get this dealt with. The original plea is still on the table. The technical charge is ""Changing Lanes Not in Safety"". There was a woman ahead of us in court who was there for ""Wreckless Driving"" which originally held a charge of 6 demerit points and her plea was for 2 and a fine.  Neither of us think his plea accurately reflects the accident. We're just really shocked at how all of this went down considering he has such a clean record (like, not even a speeding ticket!).  Really, we just need advice on how to move forward. Thanks in advance. :)"	Yes
62	Posting from Virginia, residing in Norfolk. I got a reckless driving ticket in Lexington/Rockbridge where I went to court and was found guilty and got my license suspended for 3 months. This was on 6/28. I went to the DMV today (7/18) in Norfolk to apply for an ID card since after my court date they took my physical ID and I needed something to show when asked for ID. I go up to the window and I'm told my license isn't suspended and that there aren't any unusual notes or anything. I ask for my point balance, and the points from the ticket were not added either. At this point, the DMV attendant asked if I still wanted an ID card or just a license replacement card since I can't have both. I went ahead and just asked for the replacement license.   My question is, is this some sort of glitch? Is it possible that the system has not updated yet? It has already been 20 days so I feel like it would have been updated by now. Also, I'm not sure if I want to report this or call the court. I don't know what the procedure is if they did in fact in error did not apply the points/suspend my license. Would they just notice the error and go ahead and apply it, or would their error go in my favor?	Yes
63	"Hello, so like the title suggests, i've received a parking ticket in the city of Ottawa while visiting from the United States (New Hampshire) My Hertz rental car (Florida plates) was correctly ticketed when i forgot to move my car.   Now, the ticket correctly identifies my car via the plate number, but in the Province section it says  ""FL"" for florida.  Not sure if that matters.  I've heard that out of province people don't have to pay the ticket because it's not legally enforceable. I understand that New York has an agreement with Quebec if this happens that it is enforceable.    So here's my question. Is this something I should pay? Will I have any issues entering the country in the future if i don't? And will they notify Hertz? (Hertz is available in Canada) because the car belongs to them (Hertz USA)   It's a $120 fine, or $100 if paid before ""01/08/2017"" which i'm guessing is  DD/MM/YYYY, so August 1st."	Yes
64	Bottom Line:  I bought a used diesel truck from a Volkswagen dealer, and my local mechanic told me that it is fully deleted (catalytic converter, diesel particulate filter, and EGR have all been removed/bypassed).   When I was originally talking to this dealership I made it clear that I need a diesel truck to tow my 5th wheel, but it needs to pass a smog test. I asked the salesman if the truck had stock exhaust, and he said yes. At the time, I hardly knew anything about emissions or tuning modifications so I believed what the dealer told me. I settled on a Ram 3500, and drove it home.  Now, I find out the truck can't pass emissions. The state in which I am registering the truck does not have smog tests, so there won't be an issue getting the vehicle registered. However, I think it is a federal offense to not have a DPF or Catayltic Converter on the truck. Getting a misdemeanor or a felony charge, if I were to get pulled over, could jeapordize my career.  The parts alone are going to cost me over $4k to get the truck within EPA guidelines.  Basically I have two questions:  1. What can I do about the dealer? They told me it was OEM exhaust, but it's not. Now I'm expected to pay several thousand dollars for something that shouldn't have been an issue if the dealer told me the truth (I wouldn't have purchased this truck)  2. When I look up federal EPA guidelines, it talks about being a federal offense to modify or tamper with a vehicle's emission system. I did not tamper or modify them, it came this way from the dealer. Am I still liable in this scenario?	Yes
65	A little back story here. I was given two tickets, a ticket for stunt driving and ticket for driving without consideration. Me and some friends were out in the industrial area of our town late at night(no houses in the next 10km). It's a pretty well known area of our town for people to come down and drift or race there cars . Cops have come there before and usually just make sure no one is drinking and driving, or say to go home, I've never seen a ticket issued. So at about midnight I was doing some doughnuts. We saw some head lights coming down the road, I moved into the parking lot and shut my car off. The officer drove behind me and turned his lights on saying he saw me burning out my tires ( there was over 10 people there all drifting in the same colour of car, could have been anyone of us but I'm owning the situation here). It was also raining so sound of tire squeal would be minimal. I got my car impounded for ten days, $200 driving without consideration ticket (which I disputed), a stunting ticket which I was unable to dispute, had to pay $600 in impound fees, and lost my license for 60 days. I feel I was treated excessively as this was my first ever ticket, no one was in danger or at risk, we've been verbally told to come down there if we want to do things like this by one officer instead of harming people on the streets. There's my spiel any help would be great .	Yes
66	I stopped at a stop sign and checked to see if there was any incoming traffic from the left. After checking, i proceeded to turn right but then I saw a person in front my car, crossing the street. So I quickly pulled over my brake and the person saw me coming at her and she quickly back paddled. Then she walked over to the driver's seat and when I pulled over my window to ask if she was alright, she said she WASN'T alright and asked for my information. So i gave her my phone number and my name and she just walked away after verifying my phone number... She was not on the ground, and from my perspective at the time, the only contact that my car had with her was with her hand at the front hood of my car trying to maybe.. prevent the car from lunging at her?   Is there any charges that I can get from this incident?  I am residing in Washington State.	Yes
67	"Specifically Little Flock, AR which might as well be Bentonville. First things first, the failure to appear. He has open court on the 24th of this month. I would like to get that dropped for him. What is the best method there. The truth seems best but I am open to suggestions. He wrote the wrong date in his calendar and missed the actual date. In the interim he lost his job and his mom moved two states away. He freaked out and didn't do anything. (He's 18) Explains it all right? I was thinking go early to court and try to talk to the prosecutor, tell him the story and hope for the best. Any other suggestions?  Second question. He was going 40 in a 25 and the officer wrote him for ""more that 15 miles over the speed limit"". Do that math! If we plead not guilty to ""more than 15 miles over"" does the officer just write a new ticket or does the judge dismiss it or what?Any and all advice would be appreciated. I am just a dad trying to help his kid and maybe save him some money."	Yes
68	"I've been trying to find what the law is on this. I saw something written about obtaining a permit for yellow strobe lights (red and blue are reserved for official emergency vehicles) but I haven't been able to find anything about whether they're allowed to exceed the speed limits...   Story:  Today I was stopped at a red light, a white van pulled up behind me. I noticed that it had yellow strobe lights built into its side mirrors which it didn't have on when it pulled up behind me but at some point it turned on. The light turned green, I guess I was 2 seconds slow to notice because the van behind me honked at me (the car in front of my had just started to move as the horn sounded).  So I proceeded to drive in this two lane road, there were cars next to me.  I noticed that the white van was following me very very closely. I increased speed a little (5 above the limit) but I was able to maintain a safe distance with the car in front of me.  After some point, there was a break and the white van moved to pass me on the left. He exceeded the speed limit by at least 10mph to do so and then quickly merged right in front of me without using his turn signal.  It was at this point that I noticed a sticker on the back of his (very dirty) van that said ""Emergency Roadside Assistance, 24 hours"".  Shortly after this, the speed limit dropped by 10mph as we were passing a fire station with somewhat poor visibility and this van was now driving 20mph above the limit as he tore away from me.   I didn't have the presence of mind to try to memorize his license plate but I didn't see any kind of other identification number I could use to report him.  My questions: In my state, what exactly is the legality of yellow strobe lights? Do they require a permit? Are there specific circumstances when they can be used? Do they allow a vehicle to exceed the speed limit or drive in any other dangerous/aggressive ways? If so, under what circumstances?  I will add, that in the bright daylight when this happened, his yellow lights were not very noticeable. If I hadn't thought to check my rear view at the stoplight, I don't think I would have noticed them at all. Additionally he did not keep the lights on the entire time he was driving. He turned them off at some point while following me, then turned them back on when he passed me, then back off when he was in front of me and going 20mph above the limit.  This is a little different from the types of questions I usually see here... I'm not looking to take any kind of legal action or anything I just want to know, did I screw up? Was I obstructing a legal emergency vehicle in some way? He only used his horn once at the stoplight, never to indicate that I should move over for him or something like that..."	Yes
69	So I got a DUI in Louisiana. They issued me a temp license. I have not had my first court date, so I'm not actually convicted (I'm assuming). I have since moved to Arkansas. Can I get a driver's license here before my court date?	Yes
70	In Staten Island, NY asking for a friend. From what I gathered it seems like the first postponement is allowable and every subsequent postponement is up to the discretion of the TVB. Was just curious if that is true, and if it is how much time is allotted to each postponement.	Yes
71	Recently got my first traffic citation for speeding and for tinted windows. Want to know if i should plead not guilty on both tickets and go to court and when i go to court, remove the tints on my car and plead not guilty and plead guilty and pay the fine for the speeding with the possibility of not having points added to my license. Like i said, this is my first traffic citation. How should i approach this? Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
72	I was recently cited on my motorcycle for violating CVC 22530:  &gt;No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property.   I was on a 2003 Suzuki GSX-R750 which makes about 140hp to move under 600lbs with me on it in full gear.  I pulled away from a red light and leisurely accelerated (the crown vic caught up within about a quarter mile, and I had a head start) to about 70MPH in a 45 zone on a divided expressway with 3 lanes in each direction and no traffic on my side. I was exactly [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.391026,-122.0668735,3a,75y,121.29h,75.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sE1gMpLnvlf_lxzWkbcKPJg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).  The officer wrote down 65+, told me he paced me (no radar) to about 70, and that he had the whole pull on video. The ticket notes that I had just come from CA85 which also has 3 lanes in each direction of a divided highway but a 65mph limit.  The whole pull from the light from the freeway to where I was pulled over was about half a mile or less. I slowed down as soon as any other vehicles were visible in front of me, and at the same time saw the police car coming up behind me. It's hard to look directly behind you and I didn't see the cop til then.  At first I was completely accepting of my mistake and assumed I would plead guilty and ask for traffic school. But after reading CVC22350 I would argue that nothing I did was unreasonable for the conditions.   Any advice before I call a traffic lawyer?	Yes
73	In 1996 I was stopped and ticketed for speeding in Oregon and never paid the fine. Last week when I tried to get a License in Washington, I was told that I couldn't because of this 20 year old citation. Does anyone know what the Statute of limitations on a traffic ticket is in the state of Oregon?	Yes
74	Hello. A truck hit my car a few months ago and drove off. The car was parked and in the am we found the damage. We were able to find the company by pulling tapes from surrounding buildings, but the time I lost just tracking them down (I am a freelancer) took me over three days. I asked them to compensate me for the time, but they refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Small claims court? I am  in New York City if that helps. Any advice you can offer would be amazing. Thanks Terrie.	Yes
75	I got a ticket that cost 500. I didn't stop to turn right on a red light.   I got the notice back and it said a traffic school is an option. My question is does going to traffic school allow me to avoid the $500 fine? or it's just avoiding point deducted so my insurance will be cheaper?	Yes
76	Hello guys. Im a dual diploma student. I was a student in the US, was going to sell my car but i couldnt(couldnt find a customer who didnt look like a weirdo from craigslist), so i gave a friend power of attorney to gift/sell my car. I allowed him to gift it because there was a family friend to arrive that year so he could take it if he wanted it. I forgot to turn the license plates over before i returned to my country.  Turns out the guy i gave power of attorney got pulled over driving it(which i in no way allowed him to do) after the insurance expired. The police took the license plates and towed the car. He took it back after paying some fine.   I immediately made him sell the car for really cheap as i didnt want it giving me any more trouble than it already did.  Now the question. Im still not done with my university in NY. When i return to the US, is there any chance i might not be allowed into the country? :(	Yes
77	I applied for my drivers license and have a scheduled appointment for the driving test, and everything seems to be in order, no hold ups or issues. After getting back home and looking over the huge packet that came with my parent taught drivers ed I realized that I did not complete all the classroom hours required for the license, I noticed my mistake but the DMV doesn't seem to notice the problem. What do I do? For more info, I turned 18 this April.	Yes
78	A NY State Trooper gave me a citation for failing to shift to the left lane while she was stopped on the side of the road. The only problem is that she mistook me for the person who did it as we had similarly colored vehicles. She caught up to me several miles down the road and since I loosely fit the description (even though both I and the guilty car passed her quickly leaving her little time to both conduct her business and get a good image of who blew past her) she pulled me over.  I tried to explain but she was angry that someone blew by her as she tried to get out of her cruiser and she gave me the citation without hesitation. Any advice as how to fight this?	Yes
79	Hi - I just created this account. I am hoping someone here can help me.  To make a long story short: the police allege I hit a telephone pole and then abandoned the vehicle on the side of the road. There was no collision with any other vehicle, nobody was injured, and there were no witnesses.  The police came to the scene, found my vehicle pulled off to the side of the road with the hazard lights on.  They waited about an hour, then had my vehicle towed - is what they told me.  Note: The vehicle is actually owned by my dad, but he gave me permission to drive it.  Anyway, the next day I called around and found out where my vehicle was towed.  I went there to pick it up, and the towing place said that the police have a 'hold' on it and that they aren't permitted to release it, unless the 'hold' is lifted.  I went to the police and asked them to release the hold, and they said they are investigating it.  I left.  Today, they called and said that they want to speak to my father (since he is the owner of the vehicle) in order to release it.  My father called and asked if he comes in, will they release it. The police said no, because they still have to do investigating.  I was not charged with anything, nor was my father. This happened last week.  As far as I know, the police are saying that 'they have all of this evidence that I hit a telephone pole and committed a hit-and-run'.   Can they keep my vehicle at the tow yard without a search warrant and without having pressed charges? It seems extremely unfair, especially since I am accumulating towing costs each day it sits there.  They won't release it, because they said the vehicle was 'abandoned'. Clearly it wasn't, provided that I called the next day to retrieve it.  Any advice?  Thanks!	Yes
80	"California  Earlier this month, a drunk driver crashed into my parked car. My car was towed and later deemed a total loss. During the entire ordeal I was studying abroad.  It's been taking quite a while to get this sorted out. The claim has just been sent to a settlement adjustor who is hunting down the responsible party's insurance. My question is, since this is not a personal injury issue on my part, is the settlement only limited to the value of the car? Or is it possible to argue for a settlement that considers the stress of dealing with the problem while abroad, the emotional ""pain"" (for lack of a less dramatic word) of losing a prized possession, and the inconvenience of not having a car for over a month (I need to get a job for the summer, but not having a car is making that more difficult than it would have been)?   Must these negotiations take place solely through insurance, or is it possible for me to file a separate claim outside of insurance? And would I need to hire a lawyer for that?  Some supplemental information: if not already obvious, it's my first time dealing with anything car accident or insurance related. I'm a student that classifies as low income by most measures in my area.   A quick Google search indicates the responsible party comes from the family of a wealthy and powerful former city council member, so I have some trepidation in trying to negotiate as good a settlement as possible."	Yes
81	I'm a college student in Florida and hit a parked car in my neighborhood while I myself was parking. I've only been driving for around a year now but have always been a safe driver. I immediately parked, went up close to asses the damage and then left a note on the dented backseat passenger door telling the driver to call me. So later in the day she texts me and is very understanding and even asks if I rather not get insurance involved. We both call our parents and I'm ready to go get a quote on the damage but she doesn't text me for 2 and half months so I'm thinking she's forgotten about the whole thing or gotten it fixed herself or something.  Now she's texted me back asking if we can get her car fixed by the weekend. Just looking at the price estimates for fixing dented doors + chipped paint looks like it'll be at least a grand, I really only have a 300$ limit right now so i'm kind of screwed. What would be the consequences if we got insurance involved? (It's my dad's insurance as the car is still under my father's ownership)  Thanks in advanced for helping the nervous college kid out	Yes
82	"Went to update my address with the DMV, and noticed they still show the car that I scrapped years ago as titled to me.  I remember doing the paperwork with the scrapper and signing the title over to him. In FL, the scrapper is then supposed to ""junk"" the title.  However, I don't remember any details about which scrapper it was, and the paperwork from that sale is who-knows-where.  What steps can I take to get this title off my DMV record?"	Yes
83	"Good afternoon!  Several weeks ago, I was pulled over.  When the officer had approached my car initially, he said he pulled me over because I was close to the middle dotted line (195, highway with 2 lanes going one way, two the other way, separated by a rather large grassy median) and had pulled me over to make sure I was OK to drive.  I'm assuming as if I was drunk, or under the influence.  The stop continues, the person I was in the car with got picked up on a warrant (irrelevant to me, I'd believe).  He came back to the car after arresting my friend, and notifies me that he has written me a ticket.  He did not explain the ticket, but handed it to me as the final interaction (basically, call the court if you have any questions, here it is, bye).  When I looked at the ticket after leaving the place I was stopped, it had said ""Unsafe Lane Change"".  Which didn't make sense because when he initially pulled out, I was not changing lanes.  Anywho, I got to the court, talked with the prosecutor, and he had told me the ticket was actually for not keeping in the right lane (keep right, pass left).  There was a bit of traffic at the time.  I was in the left lane with a stream of other cars also staying in the left lane, and I didn't have the opportunity to get into the right lane until further down the road when the officer had made his way behind me.  So, all in all, I think I was given the ticket erroneously.    Anyways, I need advice on how to obtain what information that would help support my case.  I would like to avoid hiring a lawyer, as I'm pretty low in the funds department, and if I can represent myself, that would be a very awesome alternative.  Thank you and please let me know if I can provide any other information."	Yes
84	"Hi,   I currently study at a college in Georgia. It used to be a unspoken rule that you couldn't/shouldn't back in to a parking spot. But no one ever actually got a ticket for it. Until today when I pulled in from a run to the store when I noticed a car next to me got a ticket. I read it out of curiosity and it said ""Unauthorized back-in"".   I back in to a parking spot because I consider it safer than trying to back up to pull out since I can see around other cars earlier and some asshole can't get the drop on me if he decides to burn out of the lot like I've seen some of the motorcycles here do.   I understand that there's very few things private property holders can't do when you're on their grounds in the US.   I wanted to bring it up to the administration as a safety issue. I guess I was just wondering if there's any sort of legal ground I could try to stand on to keep from getting laughed out of the room. Could bringing it up even put a target on my back?"	Yes
85	While in a parking lot, a guy reversed and hit my car (I was in my car). He tapped me very lightly but he just ignored me and just left the parking lot. Normally I wouldn't care, but I was mad he just ran and I don't want him to do this to anyone else either. I got video evidence and his license plate. Should I report him to the police?	Yes
86	Throwaway account. I am a fully insured driver, was driving to church (honestly) this morning and went to make a right turn. There is a bicycle lane on the road I was turning off of. No light at the intersection, it is a suburban area. I passed the bike rider on my right, and went to make a right turn. There was enough time that if I continued my turn without stopping, I would have been gone before the bicyclist got to the intersection.  As I was turning, there was a female waiting to cross, so I stopped and waved her across the intersection. I was stopped in the bike lane while she crossed, and as she was about halfway across the bicyclist hit me in the rear. He immediately said that I hit him, but I don't think that's in dispute since the lady crossing gave a statement that she saw me wave her across and I was stopped when the guy hit me. He got up and walked to the side walk but said his shoulder was hurting. He thinks he hurt his clavicle, but refused an ambulance trip to the ER.  Cops came and took statements, they gave me a ticket for failing to yield the right of way to the cyclist. I am going to fight it in court because I feel I was yielding the right of way to the pedestrian. I also feel that since the guy hit me when I was stopped, he should be at fault for not stopping or avoiding me as I think there was enough time (he hit me in the rear, not the side, so I didnt cut him off with no chance to react). Is there grounds to fight the ticket? If the insurance companies get involved and he tried to sue me for damages, am I already going to be liable since the cops gave me a ticket? Any advice welcome.	Yes
87	"I'll try to keep it brief. I was just pulled over (petty traffic, improper signal). No biggie, until cop comes back with license ""you're driving on a suspended, we're writing you $500 in tickets and impounding your car"". Uhhhhhh....what? This was just now.  More info:  I had let a ticket lapse, but two months ago I paid 1/4 of it off and setup a payment plan, this is what I was told I needed to do to reinstate my license. I've made every payment on time and have even paid more than the minimum to pay it off quickly. I have another ticket that is newer that I have not paid off or setup a payment on, but I went to the courthouse and spoke with a clerk before a work trip where I was responsible for driving a company vehicles and I was told I am still within the 60 day ""grace"" window. I am still supposedly in that window.    I know I need to go to the courthouse to figure this out tomorrow, but my question is: will I be able to seek damages from the state for not following their own rules? I'm not going to be able to work this week (need to be able to drive), and the impound fees are always a nightmare. I'm sure a judge will throw out the tickets given this is apparently an administrative glitch...  I'm in Oregon."	Yes
88	"I'm speaking on behalf of my parents. These past 2 months have been very unfortunate financially. So this is what happened.. (My dad is a trucker) Yesterday my dad was unloading on a companies lot during the day. Just in front of the company the other lot is owned by a restaurant. Later that night after unloading, around 8:00-9:00PM my dad got tired and moved his truck ONTO the other lot (restaurants property) to rest a little bit. The truck was still running, my dad was in the truck. The only sign that was there was ""no overnight parking"" which I'm assuming is after 12 not before. They locked up one of his wheel before coming up and banging on his door to talk. Apparently they didn't have any ID's or anything. My dad called the police and the police couldn't do anything about it. Apparently towing companies in Charlotte won the bill where it seems like they can give a ticket for any amount they want. Seems very unregulated to me. This price is very hefty on my parents and they had to pay with credit. Is there anything we can do? My parents called their lawyer and the price added up to 200$ +200/h. They don't think it's worth it. Help would be much appreciated!"	Yes
89	Hi, I am not entirely sure where to post this but I have a question about insurance.  6 years ago when I was a drinking alcoholic (since in recovery, 4 years sober!) I got a DUI. My insurance rates have been high because of this. I was recently married and my mother suggested I get my car fully insured under my husbands name and the rate would go down. We called and it would, by about $2500 a year, even at completely full and comprehensive coverage.  But is this legal? Does the car technically have to be insured by the primary driver or is it different because we are married? The car is under my name, but we can always transfer it.  His agent said it should be fine but I feel like if it were that easy everyone would do it... Does anyone have any advice on this?	Yes
90	Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
91	Recently, a NY friend of mine lost his license and has to pay a huge fine due to driving without car insurance. However, during the time the DMV claims he did not have car insurance, he, in fact, did. He can't drive down to anywhere because of that, which makes it harder to take care of any of that. What should he do?	Yes
92	New York STATE. So I purchased a vehicle on may 2, the temporary tags expired on the 31st. I called the dealer and notified him that the temp registration had expired and he said that he would extend the date in his computer, I spoke with him last week about not recieving any registration from the dmv still and he said that he would extend it again until we know whats going on. Well today I got pulled over and given a ticket for expired registration that expired on the original date of may 31st. I called the dealer and he said to email him the ticket and that he would get it taken care of. Not sure what I am supposed to do in this situation, is this something the dealer can take care of or am I going to be forced to go to court for this?	Yes
93	Hey r/legaladvice. I am looking into taking a ticket to court. I have 2 speeding tickets on my record. 1 a couple years back and 1 in april.   Today I got pulled over for running a stop sign based on what the officer saw. I drive a very small car and actually stopped but I believe the officer did not see this as there is a picket fence on the same corner that he was coming from. I usually stop a good distance back because there is a railroad track on the other side that cars fly over.   My issue comes down to the attitude that these small town police have. He set my court date as next Thursday even after I told him that wouldn't be possible and requested that he at least give me a week to request vacation. I have also heard horror stories of people paying court fees for bogus tickets and these police getting their way anyway. I feel like the only way to get out of this ticket is by having the officer not show up but I can't make it on the date he set.  If I call the courthouse and reschedule, won't that put a target on my back for this officer and he will make sure to be there in an even more pissed off state? Should I just make sure I'm there on the third? I wouldn't fight the ticket if I didn't feel I did anything wrong. My previous tickets were paid as soon as I could make the payment. But I don't want to waste my time and money if I'm just going to get screwed either way.	Yes
94	Hi sorry if everything is jumbled I'm trying to figure everything out.   I got a call from my husbands phone this morning saying he was just hit by a truck while on his motorcycle. He was on the freeway when this happened and was slammed by a truck and he slammed into the side of a semi. I have no idea what the state of his bike is but chp gave me the number of the wrecker towing company that took his bike.   I called the company who has my husbands motorcycle and they told me the fees was close to 500$ (I'm in such a panic state I almost forgot the exact number they told me). They also informed me that it'll be an extra 70$ past 5pm and everyday so on.   Right now I unfortunately don't have that money due to us having another emergency less then a month ago so we already used our emergency funds we had saved.   I've already called our insurance, I called CHP to get the other drivers insurance information but they said they won't be able to give it to me until tomorrow. What steps do I take from here, my husbands been asleep most of the day due to his pain meds so I'm really a mess trying to figure out what to even do from here. Is there a way to get the other persons insurance to pay for the bike fees to get it out? Our insurance hasn't been helpful because the policy is under my husbands name and they keep telling me that they need to speak to him.   I'm sorry again for the erratic mess, I can't process my thoughts correctly right now.   Edit to add this is in California.	Yes
95	I sold my first ever car with a broken transmission to some guy who claimed to own a scrap yard and told me he was going to scrap it. This appears to have never happened and now the car I haven't seen in 2+ years has been impounded by the city of Houston. It says I am the REGISTERED owner and also says there is a registered lien holder as well. I do not want to be on the hook for a $20 daily storage fee and the tow. What can I do to help make sure the city knows I am NOT the owner of the car still? I signed this title over to this guy at the scrap yard, who from my understanding was supposed to SCRAP the title but he did not. This is in Houston, Texas. I do not have a copy of the bill of sale right now and I'm currently looking for it	Yes
96	I'm in Indiana. I was in the car with him (he's 18 I'm 20) and I'm 90% sure it was yellow. There was a guy in the other intersection that turned on red into our lane and i think the officer saw that and thought we ran a red light. However he still gave my brother a ticket for $300. Also it was his first time being pulled over. About a week later another officer gave him a ticket for not having his seatbelt on even though he had it on. The officer sped though almost 1/2 the town during construction to catch up to him and give him a $25 ticket. Would it be worth fighting the tickets in court or should he just pay the $325 worth of tickets and move on?  Also, how would he go about fighting it in court? Do we need a lawyer for that?	Yes
97	A while back I (car driver) got into an accident with a bicyclist and had a police officer come and file a report. The police report pretty much stated that the biker was at fault (because he was biking in the opposite direction in the bike lane) and I filed a claim to my insurance company afterwards. My insurance company also said that he was 90% at fault for this accident and agreed to send me a check for my cars repair. The said they would send me a check for the total amount minus the deductible; meaning that I would have to still pay my deductible. My insurance company said they would reimburse my deductible if they were able to successfully pursue and obtain money from the biker but they said it was unlikely because he is not insured for this accident.  I feel like I shouldn't be paying the deductible if I'm not really at fault so what would be my best option here? Is my insurance company really not capable of obtaining money from the biker? Should I go to a small claims court? Should I take the loss and just pay my deductible?  Any information/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.	Yes
98	The incident happened because he cut me off and braked instantly. There was only a foot of a distance between my cars front and his trucks rear after he instantly merged into my lane. So when he hit the brakes I only had a split second to brake. I couldn't brake all the way and managed to hit him. My radiator broke and the cars balance is weird do to the impact. I wish I had a dash cam, but I never thought I'd need it... After the hit, he didn't stop, he tried to run away and ended up driving into a dead end street. Where he quickly got out of his truck and yelled that it was fine. And got back into his truck to try and leave. I yelled at him to look at what he did to my car. That's when he pulled beside me with. I told him we didn't have to involve his insurance if he paid me cash, since he looked scared. As I know how his insurance bill would increase. I asked for his number and called it. After they I told him I have to go to class and proceeded to go turn off my car incase the damage to my car was bad. He then gassed it. Idk if he ran or mistook it for a conversation end. I wasn't gonna be late for class. So I quickly hit the gas a couple of times to see if my car sounded well enough to get me to class. It's imperative that I never miss a college class lecture otherwise I will fail. After class I called him multiple times and he wouldn't answer. Until he I told him I would report him to the police. He then said I'm he was at work, which is a lie. Because when I was him he was dressed in trailer trash clothes. The incident happened around 5:30pm and I called him after class at 8pm. So I called him at 10 which is when he said he would 'get out of work'. He said he spoke to his wife and wants me to give him my insurance info as if he was the one who's to make the claim. I then said my insurance was expired. But I read on forums where  lawyers say that if you aren't at fault it shouldn't matter. I told him to give me his info. He said his name was ... and that his insurance was progressive. I said I would call his insurance and then. Told him to text me his policy number. When I called the insurance couldn't pull up anyone with that name or insurance policy. But said an investigator from their insurance company would call me next morning. He did and he asked more details about the incident. They also couldn't get ahold of him as he wouldn't answer his phone. I gave them his number when the fake info he gave me that same night. I then texted him saying to send me a picture of his state ID and insurance info to make a claim to his real insurance and would file a report if he didn't. He then proceeded to avoid it by saying I didn't have any insurance and the police would laugh at me, because no matter what who ever gets rear ended is innocent he said. I filed the report and later that after noon. The investigator said, he finally got ahold of him and that he wouldn't give any info about him other than that his insurance wasn't progressive, he had a ford-150 and that my car already was damaged before the incident. Which is total bs. He lied about everything. And then had the nerve to text me saying his tired of this shit and that his lawyer wouldn't press charges for harassment if I texted him again. I know it's a bluff, because he's a liar and just wants to get away with it. I haven't been called by the police. But if I someone get the calls from my service provider as evidence along with my texts. I should win and have him lay for my cats damages right? I'm a poor college student. And can't drive my car anymore since he broke my radiator. And I have another class lecture this Monday. He never asked me to lay for his damaged rear since he knows he was at fault. But is this Enough info for me to win this case? Thanks	Yes
99	We both were fined on the basis of violation of title. Is there any angle I can argue in court? He has rented a car in the past and been pulled over with no repercussions. Can I argue that I did enough due diligence? Thanks for the help	Yes
100	As the title says I was pulled over for speeding and found that my license had been suspended due to an unpaid ticket, which I thought I had paid. It had been suspended for quite a while, over a year. I've paid my fines and gotten my license reinstate. Colorado laws says I have to have knowledge of the suspension but I'm not sure how I can prove I was unaware. I can't afford an attorney. I can bring bank records to show I used Uber to get to work from the time I was suspended until it was reinstated. I remember receiving notices in the mail about the ticket but got nothing saying I was suspended, when spoke with the credit agency holding the account for my unpaid ticket they had an incorrect address for me, should I mention this? Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know what to do or what to expect. My court date is Thursday. Thank you ahead of time for any advice or encouragement.	Yes
101	I know, I know. We (my boyfriend and I)should have called the police. We took his information and thought that was enough. We called the police and they told us that since we both left there scene there is little we can do now. They informed us that if there is an agreement made on site it becomes a civil matter.  We have pictures of the damage, of him in the driver's seat of a car that doesn't belong to him without a license. We took his information but he didn't take ours.  It seems like this is a fairly common thing to do, just take the other person's information and charge them with the bill, I've done it before. There has to be something we can do in the case of him backing out of this verbal agreement. Any advice is appreciated.	Yes
102	Long shot here. I was going 15mph over the speed limit in a construction zone with no workers present when a sheriff pulled me over. The sheriff was actually sitting inside the cones. This was during the period where all construction projects statewide were frozen due to a budget impasse. Is it still considered a work zone, and do I have a chance at getting the fine lowered?  Lake County, Illinois.	Yes
103	Around 11 pm last night I was caught going 100 on a 55 mph highway (way too fast, I know), given a misdemeanor and a court date.   I've never been to court before and I am freaking out. I have a job and commute to two colleges, so more than anything I'm afraid of having my license suspended for 30 days.   What are the chances of a suspended license and should I get an lawyer?   Thank you for the help.	Yes
104	Last month I got into a car accident. I was turning left from one direction, the other car was turning right onto the same street from another direction. My car was completely totaled. Theirs was damaged but taken care of by insurance. No one was injured. That said, I have a required court date tomorrow. As far as I know, the other driver does not. i realized too late that I was supposed to submit a 10 day notice if I wanted to plead not guilty if I wanted to avoid multiple appearances. I can't seem to find any information at all on how much I would be paying if I pleaded guilty.  This is my first offense and I don't have any idea what I should do. Please help.	Yes
105	"Hello,  I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop.   Reference:  ""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic stop for another violation.   Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement. Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""  From the Arizona state legislature.  The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.  The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.  I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt.   I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this.   Thanks"	Yes
106	So I don't want to pay this ticket because it's my hard earned money and I just found out I'm being transferred to a different state today. I got the ticket yesterday. If I don't pay it will they transfer the ticket to the new state or will it just stay and I shouldn't come back here	Yes
107	Happened in Lima, Ohio. Not denying I was speeding because I was. Just want to know if it's worth going to court and if so do I need a lawyer or will it be simple enough for me to talk for myself? And if I am talking for myself what exactly do I say? (If I'm trying to get the ticket reduced)	Yes
108	Hello r/legaladvice. I received a traffic ticket last Friday but the courthouse still hasn't received it. They can't give me a definite price until they receive it. Don't I get in trouble if I don't pay it before my court date?	Yes
109	Hello all, I did something terrible and I hit and run a parked car. What happened was I made a slight dent on someone's bumper while parking. I left a note, parked somewhere else and left. Someone saw me and watched me place the note but didn't make any moves to write my information down or call the police. The next morning, I saw my note on the ground near the car and I made an impulsed decision and decided to trash it. I know what I did was wrong but I'm a poor college student who couldn't afford to fix it right now. The parking area doesn't have any cameras and I believe no one documented the incident at all. Am I okay? If the police somehow found out, how would they contact me?  Location: CA	Yes
110	I'm currently about to purchase a vehicle off of a man who lives in NC. I live in TN. Here in TN we do not have electronic titles but in NC they do. After I purchase the car from the guy he will have the responsibility to send me the title in the mail (I live 5.5 hours away). It will take about 2 days to get the paper title from NC. What documents do I need to have him sign so I don't get scammed? I am going to have a notarized bill of sale. Is there any other documents I will need so he doesn't try to say the car is still his? I will be meeting him at his bank to pay off his lien on the car.	Yes
111	"I was in a minor car accident where my car reversed into another car who also reversing.  The damage to my car was much more severe, and the opposing driver had light damage. I was parked legally, while the other driver was parked in a spot that clearly stated ""no parking"".  Who is considered liable in your opinion? Do I have any defense?  Thanks!"	Yes
112	"Bought a used car in Harris county, Houston, Texas, from a small car dealer at his residence.  Before purchasing the car, I did have a call out mechanic inspect the vehicle. After I had thoroughly inspected and driven the car.  Hours after purchasing the car, the IMA (Honda Civic Hybrid battery) and the catalytic converter are showing errors.  We have already paid $3,700 for the car cash in hand and owe him $400 for the cost of registration which was in the paperwork we signed. Also stating we would not sue and buying the vehicle in ""As is"" condition.  The seller states he can transfer the vehicle registration and that he does not need the vehicle for the vehicle inspection report.  I need a car as there is little public transport. What options do I have either for the mechanic or the seller to fix the problems with the car? Or is it possible to get my money back?"	Yes
113	Hello everyone, I just received a letter from the DMV about an accident I was in where I lost my fiancée and where I was injured myself pretty badly. I admit, I was at fault for failing to yield on a left turn. I was in an area I wasn't familiar with and I thought it was a four way stop and it wasn't. To make matters worst the pick-up I hit was speeding and my car went flying and flipped 3-4 times according to witnesses. I was in the hospital for 3-4 days after emergency surgery on my left arm, I was unable to eat the entire time I was in the hospital and I was very weak when I was finally discharged. I was unable to walk on my own for days and was in therapy for months to recover the use of my left arm. In midst of this mess I didn't know I was required to submit MV-104. I am now summoned to court for failure to submit this form and may have my license suspended. I already had my license suspended for 6 months from the ticket I received at the time of the accident. I have no idea what to do, I checked the NY DMV website and apparently neither of us submitted one, there is only a MV-104A on file. The accident was on 8/15/15. What should I do?	Yes
114	Hi there,  Few days ago, I received a letter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stating in that I had used the toll road twice in locations in Massachusetts in which that wasn't me. The requested payment was $2.60. Even though the amount was very little, I do not want to pay for the amount for something I didn't do.   So, I started googling on what I should do because I was afraid this was some sort of scam. I started reading articles about a lady who didn't know she was being charged and ended up owing $49,000 as a result. I started worrying about what I should do to resolve this matter so it doesn't come back to me again.  I apologize if this is not the right post for this subreddit. Could you please guide me to the correct one if that's the case? Thank you for taking your time to read my post. :)	Yes
115	"Hello friends, i hope everyone is having a nice day.  On 05/15/2017 i received a ticket for ""Reckless Driving 20+ MPH over the speed limit. 78/55mph zone/Distance 1341 47"" (Law Section 2.46.2.862). This happened in Virginia while i was driving from New Jersey to Myrtle Beach. I was speeding, there is no denying that. However, i spoke to a lawyer and he basically told me i was screwed and that its going to go to a criminal case. I cant go to jail for 180 days for a speeding ticket. I have my last semester of college coming up and i wouldn't be able to graduate. Is there anything i can do? i can provide more information if needed. Thanks all."	Yes
116	I recently got into a fender bender with the other person being at fault. Their car is fine, mine is not, and I have to pay a $500 insurance deductible to get my car fixed. Does anyone have advice or tips for how to get the other person to pay this deductible, or at least pay part of it? I've heard I can take him to small claims court, but how successful would I be in doing so? I'm a poor college student and I can't afford another $500 when I just spent that amount 2 days before on new tires.	Yes
117	In early May, I got a speeding ticket in Magnolia, Texas. According to the ticket, I'm entitled to the evidence against me. I also could not make my assigned court date due to work conflicts. I sent the Municipal court a letter requesting evidence and a court date conflict. Never heard back. Court says letter never arrived, and now my ticket is in 'default' cause I didn't showed up for my date.      I sent a second letter, certified, via USPS. Tracking number says it made it the Magnolia post office, but after being 'out for delivery' for ten days, the post office opens an investigation. They tell me that because of the huge volume of mail going to the court, not all of it gets scanned.  A clerk at the court cannot locate the letter. They tell me to get a DVD of my ticketing incident, I have to submit a written claim in order for them to send me the form to request the evidence. They cannot accept the request over the phone.       I call a lawyer for help at the end of June. He tells me I may have a warrant out for my arrest now, and that my fines may have gone up. Offers to call the court on my behalf to see what's going on, and to see if they'll accept a fax instead. Is unable to get a hold of them for three days. Oh, and he keeps forgetting to call me back.  I've given up on him.      I sent a third letter via UPS earlier in July, which *was* filed as delivered. I've been calling the Court three-four times a day for four days now, and I cannot get anyone on the phone to confirm they actually have it.       It's now been two months since my ticket. I'm going insane, and I don't know what to do. I haven't received any mail from the Court. I feel the ticket was predatory, and I don't want to spend $250 for allegedly going 51 miles per hour from a stopped position in less than one mile of travel time. I don't live in Texas, which makes my options limited.      Can I file a complaint against the court? Because this is a fairly rural area, ticket lawyers are really hard to find.	Yes
118	So I was dropping off uber passengers in the City of Chicago on wrigley field.  They told me to stop on the street on the main light. Cops were there and they started writing a ticket on me and she pulled out a paper and was probably writing my licence plate.  No one was behind me, so I just went off. Could they mail me a ticket with just my licence plate? Or did the cop give up and let me go?	Yes
119	First I'd like to say how much I hate Atlanta police department and their court.   July 7th got a ticket coming straight off the highway onto a 35mph zone in Atlanta Georgia. It's a speed trap, they had so many ppl pulled over using a lidar gun. It's not fair that we get no time to slow down coming off a ramp, but whatever. I get the ticket and it's only 10days away from court date. Is that even legal? They say even on their website it can take up to 2 weeks (10 business days) to process. That would be passed my court date.   I called the municipal court. This lady insisted I was reading the wrong date. I'm not. Even the cop was like 'call if 10days is too soon'. Uh yeah. So I check every day to see if it's processed. I asked the lady what do I do and she just responds with 'uuh, I guess you're just gonna have to wait til it's processed'   I have a feeling it still won't be processed by the court date. I wanted to sign up for the Pre-Trial Intervention to maybe get the ticket dismissed or lowered, but even that you have to sign up before court. I cant even request to postpone court date without it being processed! I can't even pay it if I wanted to avoid court.  What can or should I do? I'd like this to be dismissed.	Yes
120	"My friend [early 20s F] lives in the dorms on her job's campus. Monday night, she was at an employee social until early in the morning, but ended up getting a fairly good parking spot near her dorm. She was the designated driver for a few of her coworkers. Later on Tuesday morning (around 11am) she discovered damage to the back corner or her vehicle. Deep scratches and a missing reflector. She was unable to find the reflector anywhere in the lot, and assumed cleaners had picked it up. Of course we were both upset, but there isn't much to do when the parking lot has no cameras.   Cue Saturday morning. At my advisement, she finally tells her mother about the damage to the vehicle since the car is not titled in her name. Her mother is a bit of a hardass, so she told a white lie and said she was unaware of the damage until today (since she had waited so long. Strike one against her).   Saturday afternoon, she's summoned to the local police station and is questioned by officers. She called me right after the questioning, but I have little details as to the tone of the interaction. Whoever had hit her car originally had taken the reflector and given it to the police, stating she caused the accident. STRIKE TWO: she told the police she was unaware of the damage until today so her story would remain straight in the eyes of her mother. I disagree, but I'm currently too far away to take action about it. I believe I can pull text messages from five days ago where she told me she discovered the damage.   While I'm furious with her over that, there isn't much she can do about it at this point. What steps should she take now? My late grandparents were retired police officers when I was growing up, and I wouldn't dream of lying to an officer. I have no advice for her now. I met this girl in college and we have been close for awhile now-I would love to find a solution for her. Is there anyone who knows what to do in this situation?   (There is also not a doubt in my mind that she is innocent. The fact that it took the other person four days to present this ""evidence"" to the officer should also be of credit to her.)  TLDR: Friend is being framed for a hit and run by the actual perpetrator days after the accident. There are no cameras or witnesses. How should she proceed?"	Yes
121	"Have scoured the internet for this one, but all information only mentions BAC or rolling retest violations being reported or forwarded to VASAP/court system.  Are the ignition start/end times data being analyzed as well for possible restricted license violations? Or can you only ""get caught"" for that by being pulled over? Just want some clarification. Thanks!"	Yes
122	So I'm from Michigan, insurance is in Michigan also.  Girlfriend was driving my car in Chicago, where she love-tapped someone's front bumper while backing out of a spot.  There was no damage to my car.  He claims his bumper was cracked and basically needs to be replaced.  The post-accident scene was handled badly by both sides.  He took 1 picture of the damage to my car (was actually a pre-existing scratch, but my girlfriend didnt know that), a picture of my licence plate, and a picture of her licence, and they also exchanged phone numbers.  His bumper had very obvious previous damage on it outside of what may have just happened.  Sketchy part No.1: No insurance information was exchanged whatsoever.  Police were not called.  My girlfriend (20) is a nervous wreck while this is all happening, she had never even bumped a car before.  He never said anything about exchanging insurance information.  He was a 30ish year old man driving a car worth at least 10x of what mine is.  I begin to suspect this man doesn't have insurance.  A week or more passes, suspicions seem to be confirmed when...  Sketchy part No.2: He texts said girlfriend about shopping around for a body shop to get estimates for his bumper.  After talking to me, we agree that we should tell him to call his insurance company and send a picture of his damage.  This seems the right thing to do because insurance companies usually know how to handle these things.  He never sends picture.  Again suspicions that he has no insurance and there was no damage caused anyway.  Three weeks pass, suspicions seem to be confirmed again (until today...) Sketchy part No.3: Another text is received, saying that 1. He already sent her a picture of the damage (he didn't), and 2. I should call my insurance company since he was not at fault.  Was I right to be suspicious about his activity, namely not exchanging insurance information, the length of time between communications, the already present damage on his bumper, and his apparent non-willingness to talk to his insurance company?  What the shit is going on here?  Can someone help me untangle this mess?	Yes
123	I was pulled over yesterday while on my way to work. I had just lit a cigarette and I guess I was swerving a little bit while trying to light it. It was my first cigarette of the day so I had a pretty strong buzz from it. Usually I don't get much of a buzz but that morning I overslept and was late so I hadn't had breakfast and had only woken up about 15 minutes prior. The officer asked why I was swerving and I told him it was because I was looking at my lighter while trying to light it and told him that I guess it had given me a small buzz. At that point I had no buzz but he told me to get out of the car. He made me do all the things that you'd expect if you were driving drunk and I know I had absolutely no problem doing them but he claimed that I was stumbling and having trouble and arrested me anyway.  At this point I just got home and I'm wondering if any of this could possibly stick? I've never heard of being charged for DWI for nicotine. Is this even possible? What do I even do now?	Yes
124	"A few months ago I was pulled over for a failure to stop at a stop sign in Wisconsin. Not a huge deal, but long story short I don't think I actually did it.   Written plea of not guilty goes through fine. I show up for the meeting with (I believe) the DA and say that I don't think I did it and she keeps trying to lead me to accepting the no point no contest she has as an option. I say no I want to take it to court. Fine.   I get the date in the mail and everything's great. Two days before the date work needs me to go out of town for a client, and I look at my ticket and it has a ""requests to reschedule must be made 48 hours or more before scheduled date and time"" so I let work know I can go and call and leave the message.   Cut to two days later, an hour before court was scheduled and it's the clerk letting me know that I didn't give enough notice and everyone involved is there. The clerk asks if they are willing to reschedule and I'm told they are not willing to ""put up with this"" anymore, and I'm just guilty of it.   I did follow the procedure I was given, but I realize I likely have no recourse. Can I appeal the judgment or should I just deal with the points and fine?"	Yes
125	Pulled over yesterday and told I was swerving. I was not drunk, but was pretty tired because it was the end of a long drive. I had a major panic attack during the field sobriety tests, I was shaking too hard to stand, and when the officer did the visual test I almost passed out from locking my legs. There is no way I passed those tests. The attack passed by the 3rd test (balance test) which I was able to do fine, but I was not allowed to retake the previous two.   Officer thought I was on some kind of narcotic, and brought me into the station. The did take a urine sample, which I'm positive will come back clean, I don't do drugs. I did have a few beers earlier that afternoon but this stop happened over 4 hours after I had drinks, and I did not have enough to even get buzzed. I did tell the officer when I had the drinks, and complied with all testing and requests, and I was incredibly polite through the whole ordeal.  This is my first OBI, I have no priors, and I have already spoken to a lawyer and have things in motion to meet before my arraignment hearing. What should I be expecting to happen here? Is it normal for a first time offense to be downgraded into a reckless driving charge? Should I expect the book to get thrown at me and to receive the manditory 72 hours in jail? These questions will obviously be asked to my lawyer, but I was hoping to hear some positives to this before going in because I'm freaking out right now.	Yes
126	"Hello  I am a college student, and this is my first ticket.  I hit somebody's back corner and then I fell into a ditch, totaling my vehicle.  The other driver only had corner damage on his car.  Nobody was injured.  I received a traffic ticket for failing to stop for assured distance.  I had the cops come to the scene to simply prove that the other driver was not at fault.  I was surprised that I received a ticket.  Later, I learned that calling the cops is not necessary, as long as information is exchanged.  The other driver was not jumping to call the police right away.  I regret involving the police.  I feel that I screwed myself over, beyond what was necessary.  I feel that totaling my car and denting the other guy's car does not call for a citation, especially considering the other guy did not offer to call the police.  I have a pre-trial soon.  I have to talk to a prosecutor and make a deal.  I would ideally like to drop the whole case, as my father's insurance is taking care of vehicle damage.  I am educating myself about courts.  I learned that the prosecutors want to spend more time prosecuting midemeanors/felonies and other serious issues.  They just want to get petty tickets out of the way.  Would it benefit me to ask for my case to be dismissed, and if he doesn't budge, say ""I want to learn more about the court process, so I am going to have trials regarding my ticket, so I can explore all of my options.  I have time because I am out of school for the summer.""  Would this make the prosecutor want to back off and not want to deal with me, especially because I am young.  I have had my liscense for about a year.  I know it costs a lot of money to run the courts.  I recognize that it's assumed that people who hit cars from behind are at fault, but the reality is, traffic court is designed to suck money from people.  The other driver wasn't upset when I talked to him.  I just want the insurance to fix the other guy's car, and move on with my life."	Yes
127	Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm just looking for some quick advice. Yesterday, I got pulled over in Crownpoint, Indiana for going 104 in a 70.(Yes, I know it was stupid and I learned my lesson). The officer that pulled me over said he was only going to give me a ticket instead of something worse. I'm just wondering how much the ticket would be since I have to wait four to six weeks. Also, since this is my very first offense, does it lower the price or anything? Don't know if this means anything, but I admitted fault to the officer and told him I was in the wrong. (I guess that's why I got off with just a ticket and not a misdemeanor or anything.) Thanks in advance.	Yes
128	Hello, in my state there is a reduced offense you can plead guilty to, a $500 fine and no points, in exchange for removing a violation with points such as speeding. But you are only able to do it twice in 5 years. I did not realize I reached the limit when I mistakenly plead to it a third time. But as this should not have been available to me I wanted to know if any legal action can be taken against the municipality where the allowed this egregious error on their part.	Yes
129	Essentially title.  I previously posted about a minor fender bender. The other vehicle will cost ~$700 to fix, which is below the reporting requirement of my state ($1,000 or more total property damages).  My vehicle had some minor damage, but I don't plan on getting it fixed and have not gotten the damage valued.  Per my state, I'm required to report accidents above a threshold, but if I don't get the damage to my vehicle valued, and I don't care about repairing it, do I need to factor in my vehicle to the total estimated property damage?	Yes
130	It's been my understanding that when a cop pulls you over and cites you for speeding, he's acting as witness to your offense. Is this still the case if it's on the advice of another?  Didn't actually happen, just saw a bear clocking folks on an overpass on 40 and a few more hiding on the on ramp immediately following.	Yes
131	18y/o Bergen county, NJ,USA  So I never respond to texts while driving, but I while I was going to get bagels, my mom texted me. I picked up my phone looked at the text and put it down. Got pulled over.  I have a court date in February. It's municipal court. What can I expect there? Do I need a lawyer? or should I just plead guilty and pay the fine? I found online that for the first offense there's no points and it's a $200-$400 fine, is this correct?  Thanks	Yes
132	"Hello Reddit: I recently received the verdict for a trial by written declaration I submitted regarding a traffic citation I received in California.   On the Decision paper there is an unmarked checkbox that says ""The evidence submitted by defendant is enclosed.""  I guess that they aren't required to show me the officer's evidence.  But, I am filing a Trial de Novo and I would like to see the evidence is possible.  Does anyone have any advice for getting this, and also any general advice for fighting a Traffic Light violation in court?  The light was yellow when I was in the intersection and the officer wrote me a ticket based off of his visual assessment of the situation (no camera).  Thanks for your time."	Yes
133	Allegheny and beaver courts, PA. So I've finished my dui suspension length and have satisfied all my requirements, aside from paying off all my court fines. Under act 122 the court will not release my completion of treatment to the DMV until I have paid all court cost/restitution. I went back to school shortly after my duis (3 almost 4 years ago). Since then I haven't been in any trouble legally but I haven't been working because of school. So my license would be very helpful with travel requirements for work/internship. I've made regular payments over this time, but they aren't enough to cover all of my costs. Is there a way to petition for certification of my completion to be transferred to the DMV from courts, without paying all of my fines?? Thanks for any advice!	Yes
134	hello everyone,  My boss co-signed me a car 5 years ago. Its all paid off and I would like to sell it now. The title has both my name and co-signer's name.  I took it to carmax today and they told me that the title needs to have only my name.  My question is how can I remove co-signer's name from my car title? I can't get hold of my old boss.	Yes
135	My mom is 66, on disability for multiple sclerosis. She's been unable to work for about a decade. She has cataracts. She has neuropathy. She has 0 reaction time. She has had a fender bender on every single corner of her last car, which my brother then totaled. She also has no night vision. She also falls asleep all the time. ALMOST like like narcolepsy. It's mostly her overextending herself, but she will nod off driving or sleep in parking lots til she feels ok. She also has lymphedema in her legs which are swollen enough to impede driving. The last year she was driving she received 19 red light tickets.  She agreed not to drive. And the insurance paid for her car. Now she's bought a new one, about 6 months later. Our relationship is terrible. I hate her. But I want her licence taken away before she kills or cripples someone(s). I'm no contact with her, but my brother still tries and he cares about this a lot.  I've spoken with the DMV IN MY state, not very helpful.  Can i contact her insurance? Do I contact the police? Has this happened to anyone else?	Yes
136	Background: I got pulled over on Christmas evening in NY for going 70 in a 55 on I-95 North (I didn't even know there was a speed limit that low on I-95).  I'm going to traffic court later today, I don't really care about the fine but the ticket carries 6 points with it which I'd like to avoid at all costs. How do I go about doing this? I am bringing a copy of my driving record that shows I am in good standing with 0 points on my license currently. Do I admit to speeding and straight up ask for the fine but no points? Do I just present the fact that I'm normally a safe driver and hope the whole ticket gets dismissed? Should I tell him I was trying to be safe and keep up with the flow of traffic (which was technically the case) or should I say something else? Please help me beat this ticket, thank you!	Yes
137	"I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...  tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.  Full story: I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail).   The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.  I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.  A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.  I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.  So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.  So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily."	Yes
138	"In Dec 2006, I was in the process of making a move across several states. While driving up, I admittedly going WAY too fast, trying to make it to a job interview in my new state. (I previously had never had any traffic tickets.)  Anyways, I got pulled over in Dinwiddie VA, ticketed and cited with ""Reckless Endangerment"" for how fast I was speeding. This was also the last time I drove, as I was in a friend's car (with her egging me on, speedwise. No excuse, but I shouldn't have given in to peer pressure) as I had already sold my own to finance the move.  Because every last dime I had went to a new place to live, I couldn't afford to a.) pay a ticket or b.) even make it back to where I was ticketed to go to court.  It's been nearly 8 years, and having this outstanding ticket has been killing me. I've wanted to set it right, go to court, take my punishment and move on with my life. I've been utilizing public transportation for the last 7+ years, as I'm certain my license was revoked.  I'm still dirt-poor, but finally in a place, financially, where I'm getting close to having enough to afford a lawyer, the trip and hopefully the ticket, so I went back to the VA General District Court website for the first time in a few years, and it appears that it was dismissed last year?  Is that possible?  Under the ""Hearing Information"" it has two dates with different results:  01/28/2010- Continued  05/09/2016- Finalized  And under ""Disposition Information"" it says  Final Disposition: Dismissed  Everything else under ""Disposition Information"" is blank, or set to 0. (Like Sentence/Suspended Sentence/Probation/Operator License Suspension Time...)  I was expecting to pay something to the tune of $2500+ to settle this out. Does that mean it's gone and I don't have to go to court/pay a ticket?  Could I walk into a VA DMV (I reside in VA, just on the other side of the state) and get a new license after so many years, or am I looking at consequences for letting it go this long?"	Yes
139	Hey guys. Yesterday my friend hit a woman's car as he was backing out. The damage was extremely minimal and nobody was in the other car at the time of the incident. It was just a scratch and he asked the lady not to report it to the insurance and he would just pay the damage. She decided to notify the insurance anyways and I wanted to know how this will affect him? Is there anything he can do to help him ease through this situation a bit better? Also, is it true that mechanics will charge more for repair if they know insurance is involved? Thanks so much to anyone who helps and I apologize if this is the wrong sub to post this on.	Yes
140	I was backing out of my driveway and I stupid stupid stupidly was distracted and hit my neighbor's van. They were parked across the street. There's a dent in it now and I just drove off (it was around 9 pm). I later saw that they parked the van on their driveway from the street. I don't have insurance yet, and I feel bad making my parents pay for it because we're having a lot of financial troubles. I just feel so so so guilty because they're such good and nice people. :( and my car doesn't have any dents on it - just a scruff. I know I fucked up massively and I know I'm a huge fuckup for doing this.	Yes
141	"A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.  State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.  The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.  Now this is where it gets really shady. Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.  So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!"	Yes
142	This is (was) a 1999 luxury car, lien was paid off in 2004.  Trading it in and title nowhere to be found.   Searching lien holder on google barely shows it ever existed, how to get replacement title?	Yes
143	I was driving on the lane beside a school bus when it stopped. I don't remember very clearly (I panicked a little after it happened), but I think I was already beside the bus when it stopped, so I didn't know if I should have braked quickly or passed on. In the moment I decided to pass it, which looking back was not the best idea.             I saw the camera on the side of the bus and I believe that the driver honked at me (it could also have been another car close by either honking at me or someone else). There were no children getting off the bus, it looked like a man was just talking to the bus driver. the bus may or may not have been empty as well since it is summer and it wasn't at the end or beginning of the school day.             My question is, am I definitely getting a ticket? I'm not actually from Maryland so I'm not very familiar with its traffic laws. Should I have stopped if I was right beside the bus and not behind when it stopped?              Thanks for the advice!	Yes

He will eventually be purchasing my car, but can not get a state driver's license or registration until he has a social security number. This can apparently take up to 6 weeks.

147	Hi guys, so here is the scenario. I took my car to get a free code scan to an autoshop (Goodyear). They gave a sheet with the codes and gave me the car keys back. When I went to my car, I found the car smashed in. I went inside and asked them what happened. The manager and the employee who drove my car denied the car crash. They said they didn't do anything and it was there already. I called the cops and then the manager made a claim through their company corporate. The manager told me that the company doesn't have its own insurance but it has a third party insurance. The manager told me that the car will be inspected and an estimate of the damage will be calculated. Afterwards the company will either have a body shop fix it or pay the amount for the damage depending who is seen to be at fault. He said that their insurance will be contacting my car insurance. He only said that my car's front bumper is damaged, when in fact i disagreed. The car's bumper is dented in; the grill came off; a part of the undercarriage frame is bent; car takes longer to crank up now. UPDATE: Goodyear's insurance denied the car crash and they denied the claim that was requested by the manager. The Goodyear insurance person said that the damage was not caused by the employees but it might have been one of their customers since they claim to have a footage from a nearby store. Here are the problems that I have with this: 1. This cannot go through my insurance, there are way too many claims (all no fault) on there already. I won't be able to afford a further increase for the car insurance. What can I do if they refuse to reimburse me from their insurance company? Would the next step be to go to small claims court?  2. If I take it to small claims court, how does the process work? and how would i get the amount for the damage the manager said there is and also the damage he said there is not?   3. Should I use these estimates as proof to claim there is more damage than the company agree to?   4. This is what i prefer: I want the company to pay for the damage and I want to fix it myself. Is this possible? What do I do to get them to pay me instead of fixing it through their body shop?  5. What should i do if they claim it through my insurance company? I don't want this  I know this is a long post, I am frustrated and confused. I don't know where to start, please give any information you think is helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read my whole post.	Yes
148	I would like to state that I am appealing this ticket with or without a lawyer, and I am asking for advice on my best course of action.  There was a crazy amount of traffic where I had to drive today.  There was the usual Tourist traffic for people heading down to the cape, alongside the typical traffic, and also a funeral procession clogging things up.  I was in a position where to travel at a safe speed of 75 mph (speed limit is 65mph, but the average travelling speed is between 70-80mph) I had to change lanes frequently.  My goal was to get around the funeral procession travelling at 65 mph in the middle lane, and to not get trapped behind the individuals travelling 70mph in both the left and middle lane (the person in the right hand lane was not passing, and was in fact slowing down for some reason).  I had to change lanes numerous times, but did so using my turn indicator and while paying attention to where my vehicle was.  I observed a state trooper fly up the highway with damage to his driver's side front end.  I was currently in the right hand lane, to the right of the two cars travelling at 70 mph.  He had his lights on, and as I pulled over he pulled over VERY close, and I pulled forward another foot or so to avoid being struck.  I pull out my licence, wait for the cop.  He reaches in and takes it without a word from either of us.  He comes back and hands me the ticket without saying anything else, he was positioned in a way where it was hard for me to look at him or see anything.  I say thank you, he gets in his vehicle and leaves, with me stuck in the breakdown lane in heavy traffic for 2 miles.  Tl;dr I was trying to get around really slow and distracted drivers, did so in a way that was a bit rushed, and a state trooper who was obviously having a bad day gave me a ticket without so much as a 'Do you know why I pulled you over?'  ----- The ticket states...  89-4A Weaving x6 $105  89-4A Unsafe Lane Change x3 $105  90/17 95 in a 65 with no boxes checked (Posted, Not Posted, Clocked, Lidar, Radar, Estimated)  I know 100% that I wasn't travelling at 95 miles per hour.  I was at most 80-85, and only so I could pass the traffic that was inconsistently between 60-75.  I do not have the best record, I had a similar ticket 4 years ago (which is the last spot on my record, which goes away in 5 months).  With that said, my record has been improving over time.  My question here is, is a traffic lawyer going to do me any favors, or is it not worth the time?  I was quoted $700 flat from a lawyer earlier today, which would make sense long-term if this entire ticket gets dismissed, but I am not sure if that would even happen.  How much more likely is the case going to be dismissed/reduced with a lawyer present than if I represented myself?  I am capable of looking up laws, cleaning up my appearance, and get to the court on time.  With the information above, if you can offer any insight it would be appreciated.  I have never been to court before (no criminal record, never fought a ticket) and want to do my best.	Yes
149	I was driving through Mississippi and received a speeding ticket because of restless bodily functions and was wondering how it would affect me. They don't use a point system from what I found, at least. I'm almost certain it will affect my rates, but I'd like to know for sure. Also, I've taken a defensive driving in the state of Texas for a Texas speeding two years earlier to knock one off. Am I eligible to take a course again in Mississippi? Just not sure if it's by state. Thanks!	Yes
150	"The place where I work has street cleaning from 7:30am to 8am and today I parked my car in front of my workplace and my phone said it was 7:59am so I got out to feed the meter. Now the block where I work is one of those super long blocks and currently there is only one meter which is on the other end for me.  I am putting money in the meter when I notice a traffic cop walking towards my car. I quickly cancel the meter and run to my car and I get there before she can scan my car and I get in to just move my car across the street but she is just standing in front of my car refusing to move. I get out and pleaded with her saying I was about to feed the meter but she wasnt having it. She told me ""Its not a race"" and that she was giving me a street cleaning ticket no matter what.  Frustrated I take the ticket from her and on the ticket it says Street Cleaning violation and time was set to 7:58 which is weird because it was past 8 at that time. Do I have a good shot at disputing this ticket? I know that there can be a 1-2 minute discrepancy when it comes to time and I do have a meter ticket for 8:04am which I got as soon as she left."	Yes
151	I received a ticket with court appearance over the weekend for Driving While Suspended. I was 81 days into serving a 90 day suspension for a DUI.   There was a cop on the road, ran my plates and I was pulled over. The rest is history, I'm a complete idiot and I regret driving. I was 9 days away from getting my license reinstated.   Wanted to know if r/legaladvice can give me any guidance	Yes
152	Hey all,  Did not see this in the list of threads or with a search, but forgive me if something similar has been posted....  I was recently involved in an at-fault accident when I backed into a coworker's car. I am hoping to resolve this out-of-pocket and want to ensure that I am taking the correct steps. Below is some information:  * State: MA * Total damage to other car: $1,500 (dent in BMW so bit more $$$ than I hoped for) * Other party was not in the vehicle * Insurance deductible is $500 but filing a claim will add 3 pts to my driving record, which already includes a speeding ticket from last May  Ultimately I am worried about my rates going up and I would rather take the hit to my bank account now than deal with the headache on my insurance record.   After doing some research, I am looking to have my coworker sign a *Release of Claims* and was hoping someone might be able to tell me if this is the correct step to take to close out the incident once payment is given. If so, is there a particularly well-formatted template to use, and does it vary by state?  Also, if there is anything else that I should be getting in terms of documentation please feel free to suggest. I do not expect the other party to swindle me into more money, but I also would rather be safe than sorry. I appreciate the help!   **TL;DR** - Had an at-fault car accident, will pay out-of-pocket but want to ensure that the incident is finalized with a Release of Claims.	Yes
153	The other night I was pulled over by a state trooper in Wisconsin and clocked doing 26mph over.  I did some reading and saw that Wisconsin was one of the few states that did not agree to the DLC and thus is not required to share information of driving records with other states.    I'm wondering if this is likely to appear on my Indiana records and increase insurace premiums/add points to my Indiana license.  If the points don't transfer I'll probably just pay the fine and be done with it, however if the points will likely transfer, I might pursue a safe driving course or other options for getting the ticket reduced/dismissed.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
154	I'm finding a lot of different answers when searching for a definitive answer through google. My best guess is that it is legal unless they are under 16, in which case the vehicle must be going 25 mph or slower. Besides the overall legality of it, are their stipulations? Like a maximum speed limit, number of passengers, etc?	Yes
155	I live in an apartment complex in Ohio and my car was towed on the grounds that it is a private lot and that a permit is needed to park there (which I have, it hangs from the rear view mirror like it should be) you should also know that there was a no parking sign nearby (which I didn't notice at the time, just worked a 13 hour shift, I was tired) but that wasn't the reason for being towed on the report (I called the city and asked, it was just because of the supposed lack of permit). Now, there have been several issues with my apt complex before where they have changed things to fine people more, screw people over, etc which is why I'm asking this question. According to ORC 4513.601 (A) The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign, that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:  (I am not listing a-c, as they do not apply here)  (d) The telephone number and the address of the place from which a towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;  (e) A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of section 4505.101 of the Revised Code.  In order to comply with the requirements of division (A)(1) of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.  The no parking sign is not 18x24 inches, it does not provide the telephone number and address where the vehicle is located, it does not state that failure to recover vehicle can result in loss of title, and it has not been modified at all via stickers or addendum. Is this sign still legal? Is there any validity at all to it?	Yes
156	Paid for parking at a college and was mailed a pass, in the meantime I printed a Temp Pass which states I paid for Summer Parking + my vehicle license plate. It expired 2 days ago and I got a ticket ($35) for displaying an expired temp pass and not the one that was mailed to me. {I understand the word of the law is the law, I just feel the cop was unnecessarily being a dick}	Yes
157	Hey guys, so a few months ago I got a speeding ticket, I went to court and got it reduced to a small fine and traffic schools. I opted to pay the fine in monthly installments since at the time I was preparing for a newborn and didn't account for the extra expense of the ticket. So a few months go by and I thought everything has been settled and having completed traffic school but I get a letter in the mail saying I only made one monthly payment. It turns out I had to manually make the monthly payments and they weren't recurring. I called the courts offices and they said I can't do anything, I need to pay it through a collection agency now which almost tripled the ticket and if I write a letter to the courts they might allow me to retake traffic school since they couldn't accept it the first time due to not having completed payments.  Is there any other option for me?	Yes
158	Hello, I'm 17 and in Austin, Texas, today i got pulled over on i-35 for going 86, although my spedometer said 80. I am not trying to say I wasn't being stupid (I was) but I was wondering what the best course of action would be. I can pay the ticket but I am very afraid of the insurance charges added. I have read a couple of posts but mostly by people going 20+ over. I want to know if I should just pay the fine, or if I should contest and hope the officer doesnt show up to court. I am insured, thank you for any advice	Yes
159	I bought a truck on Craigslist I tried to do my research looked up the vin and wasn't stolen or damaged. When I made the deal took a picture of the guys license and the license plate of the car he drove, I payed cash. when I went to go register the truck they told me the trucks title was fake as well as the owners license but that since the truck wasn't stolen they could make me a bonded title but would need to contact the police. The police came and told me they needed to take a truck and open an investigation that if everything was fine it would be returned in a weeks top. It has been almost a month and I haven't heard anything back. What can I do ?	Yes
160	Okay, so here the post begins.  My case is currently working it's way through the courts. In what I believe is the first stage of the trial. Details: -- Car Accident:  2 cars on back road, head-on collision.  me- plaintiff. Was hit at approx 40-60 mph by defendant in a head-on collision (admitted by defendant)  defendant was ticked in the case. Reckless driving, speeding, ect.  This caused me to impact my stearing wheel and break the steering collomn with my face, as well as it to crack ribs and strain muscles in my neck and forearm. The vehicle I was driving was older with no airbags.  Short term injury sustained: Hospital trip, around 25k medical. (paid by health insurance.) approx 3 weeks bed rest. bruised/cracked ribs. 3-4 doctors trips (time off + cost of services) (paid aprox 50$ out of pocket copays) -no use of eye for around 3 day, full use returning in 2 weeks. -Pain/Suffering ect.   Long term injury substained was a 2-3mm droop in my right upper eye lid. Caused from impact on steering wheel. Will worsen with age, could be treated with injury however will still maintain +-1mm difference from other eye over time.   happened in VA area, have a lawyer for the case. However was wondering what the aprox value for such a case would be. First offer was aprox 26k, however lawyer said in his opinion it should be higher. However not by set amount.	Yes
161	I own a VW that is part of the whole Dieselgate scandal. I have not yet received any compensation from the lawsuit.  I was hit by someone running a red light. Although I live in a 'no-fault' state, he was ticketed for running the red light as there were three witnesses to the accident. Insurance is saying that their preliminary evaluation is a total loss on my vehicle.  My question is what to do to fight for proper valuation of my car. Dieselgate caused the value to drop- am I going to get screwed by the reckless behavior of VW execs? I owe more than KBB is saying it is worth.  I'm also told that I don't have rental coverage through my policy (made sense at the time due to access to another vehicle), but the officer told me I can get it through his policy? Is this true?  Getting a full medical work up now. Have had a lingering headache and low back pain.  Thanks in advance for your time and advice- I've never been in an accident before, so this is all new to me!	Yes
162	"Hey! My girlfriend was at fault in a minor car accident about a year ago. What I saw was minor damage to the bumper of the car in front of her. The person she hit was pretty nasty at the scene and was holding her neck saying she might be injured but refused an ambulance.   Girlfriends rates went up and she got a notice from her insurance that the other person is claiming injury.   However this other person happens to have a public Instagram and is a ""fit chick"" so lots of posts of her doing workouts/headstands/skydiving.   Is there anything my girlfriend should be doing about this? Passing along the info to her insurance?"	Yes
163	So about a year ago I, at the time, a 22 year old Texas resident was in oklahoma and recieved a speeding ticket.  I only paid about half of it, which of course I knew would turn into a warrant but I rarely go to Oklahoma so i don't care.  I have since moved to Colorado. Which brings us to thursday, I get a message from a private debt collection agency on behalf of this Oklahoma county with a lady telling me I have a warrant, which I already knew about.  I was just surprised it soundes like a collections agency, so I called them back and spoke to the lady who left me her extension.  When i state who I am and why Im calling she chuckled and said, oh yes Ive talked to your mother.  Excuse me what? Im 23. I go off on the lady and eventually hang up because she said she was not part of a police department. I then called my mother.  My mom claims the debt collector had called both hers and my dads cell phone looking for me and I assume telling them of my warrant ( which they already knew about.)   So my question is this, is it legal for debt collectors to call my parents about a debt not belonging to them? Also is it even legal for police to send info about warrants or debts to private debt collectors? Can I get arrested in colorado or Texas if im in the state, and lastly, is it legal for the said private debt collector to give out information about my warrent to others?  This is why I stay out of Oklahoma.	Yes
164	I recently got a bike citation for failing to stop at a stop sign while riding my bike. The fine is $257 &amp; after reading up on some other posts on reddit about other citations and fine amounts, I find this a bit excessive??? I do not have the money to pay at the moment. I requested a 30 day extension, but what are my options? Is it possible to get the fine reduced? Do I have to show up to court?	Yes
165	[near Lachine Canal, QC, Canada] So, I fucked up really badly. I don't know what to do or how exactly I should proceed, so I'm turning to good ol' reddit. Disclaimer: I have a very severe anxiety disorder, and panic attacks are a usual occurrence for me. So, I left work 45 minutes earlier than usual today, because I was feeling dizzy, had heart palpitations and a high blood pressure. I needed to lie down, so my boss gave me the OK to leave. Living 45min away from work (traffic), I started heading home at 3:17pm. It is now ~3:45pm, and I'm 10/13min away from home, finally. I start to feel uneasy once again, and decide I really do need to get get my blood pressure under control, considering the possibility of needing to go to the hospital. I get to the stop sight right before the train tracks. It is my turn to proceed, and as I start to accelerate, a grey van perpendicular to where I was decides it's her turn to go as well. I brake suddenly to avoid an potential accident. At that point, I'm beginning a panic attack, and I get flustered. The grey van is now in front of me (don't have the plates, I was too panicky to think of that), so I accelerate along with it. At that point, the lights and sirens of the train tracks are getting louder and stronger... The grey van and I are stranded on the middle or the train tracks and I'm panicking even more. The grey van then accelerates quickly, but just as it passes the tracks, the wooden bar comes down in front of me. I react right away and reverse as quick as possible, only to have the second bar fall right on top of my car's roof (FUCK ME). I'm panicking, scared.. and what comes next? The police comes out of nowhere, sirens and lights blaring. I'm happy they were there, because it calmed me down and they helped me get off the tracks.. however, as a repercussion, I got a 139$ ticket (which is not what I'm upset about). With the ticket, I got a monetary fine, but I also got 4 demerit points. Keep in mind: I have a probationary license, which only has 4 points on it. Bam, licence is lost for 24 months. I fucking lost my license because some guy decided to cut me off at the stop sign. I'm turning 18 in 5 days, so things would've been different. Damage to the car and rail were minimal, thank goodness. Anyhow, the police tells me that both my infractions led up to the ticket I received, and that the guy in front of me was in the wrong, however I was the one who got caught under the bar, and I was the one they caught/had to first help out. I will be contesting the ticket via lawyers from Tickets911, however I want some outside and objective opinions about this. What should I do? What are my chances? What can I do to at least get 1 point back, to possibly be able to keep my license? Any opinions/tips are welcome. Thanks, reddit.	Yes
166	The title says it all. If someone could PM me with help deciphering this thing that would mean the world to me. I really don't want to go to court. I just turned 18 and it'd be really nice to get this out of the way over the weekend, so I don't need to take off work.  Thanks, P03	Yes
167	"Im from out of state and drive through NY regularly. One day I got pulled over and the cop cited me for going 75 mph in a 50 mph zone. I noticed after being pulled over that it was actually a 55 mph zone for cars but 50 for trucks (i have a car). I saw the ticket would be the same price either way though. I didn't want to fight the ticket because I wasn't going to go back to NY just to go to court. So i just paid the ticket. A few months later i get a letter in the mail saying I need to pay another 300 dollars for some sort of ""safety"" act where drivers with 6 or more points in NY need to pay. (We dont have this system in my state so i had no effin clue this was even a thing)  I looked up the point system and saw you get 6 points for going 21-30mph over the speed limit. But only 4 points if you go 11-20.  Long story short, the Cop f**cked me over by saying the speed limit was 50 and not 55. But i already paid the ticket. Having no idea that there was these extra fines based on point systems. WTF GUYS  Anyone have similar experiences or see any recourse i could take?"	Yes
168	So back in April I got a new prescription for my glasses. The doctor tells me that due to my eyes needing two different prescriptions I may feel a little crossed eyed for a few days. I take his advice, go next door to the glasses store to pick out new frames, etc., and I'm told they'd be ready in about two weeks. Two weeks later I pick them up and notice the cross eyed sensation immediately but think nothing of it. A couple more weeks go by and I still feel crossed eyed while wearing my new glasses when I get into a minor accident while backing up my work truck. I honestly didn't put two and two together until I got into yet another almost identical accident soon after. The next day to go back to store  where I got my glasses to have them checked and they say it must be the fault of the eye doctor. Lucky for me both places are next door (I don't think they're affiliated though) and they deny it's their fault saying this store has had this issue before. That being said, I walk back into the store, tell them what my doctor's office said and they say something along the lines of if they had known I went to this particular doctor they wouldn't have sent me away due to this guy being a super hotshot eye doctor or something who's apparently never wrong. This time they actually bother to look at my glasses and it turns out my prescription is focused in the lower corners of my lenses instead of over my pupils. As you would expect they replaced my lenses (another couple of weeks). I recorded the whole ordeal (audio not video) on my phone but didn't mention anything about the accidents to them so not to spook them but now I fear this whole mess may effect my career later on down the line. I had to beg my employers to allow me to keep driving, not to the financial penalties(a whole other story I'm not worrying about right now unless you guys suggest otherwise). My main concern is my driving record. With aspirations of pursuing a new career that also requires me to drive a work vehicle I fear this whole mess may have stunted my professional growth.   TL;DR I got into a couple of of work related accidents within a short period of time of getting a new pair of poorly crafted glasses and have an audio recording of  the company admitting thier mistake. Now I fear this may hurt my career long term due to tarnish driving record.   Do I have any opitions or am I screwed for life?	Yes
169	So I was waiting at a stoplight today and got low-speed rear-ended. It wasn't bad, but did give me a fright. My car was still perfectly drivable, even with the dings and scratches. I took pictures of my car, her car, her insurance and license plate and submitted a claim online. I didn't call the police on her because I am certain it wasn't bad enough to cause injury, and accidents are accidents, but she started being a little cagey after all of this and kept repeating that she thought some of the damage was there before, which it wasn't. I don't expect any issues and I'm not trying to get some payout, but was there anything else I could do besides calling the police to prevent me from being screwed over?	Yes
170	A teenager saw, but I don't think he saw my plates let alone cared enough to remember them somehow. I don't know what the neighbors are like there but the car looked new (at most five years old), and seems like the neighbors might know one another. What legal repurcussions do I face if ever caught? Going forward what would be my ideal actions? I don't think I can ask my friend about this.	Yes
171	I leased a car, and then moved states and registered my car in MD. I got a letter from Honda Financial that said by error I have received the original Certificate of Title for the vehicle and I should send it to Honda FInancial (they enclosed a pre-marked return envelope). Do I own the car now? If I don't send back the Title, and claim the car is mine now, will they just sue me for it or request an updated Certificate from the state?	Yes
172	"Here's the provided evidence, my car is the silver SUV behind the white car.   https://streamable.com/4902w  http://i.imgur.com/bOMhlFb.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/6YWqWsy.jpg  On the citation it says ""Yellow Time: 4.2 sec, Red Time: 0.2 sec"" which from what I can gather means the light had been red .2 seconds at that point when I crossed the line. I am really surprised that they are mailing me about a ticket for .2 seconds and it honestly sounds ridiculous. It's literally fractions of a second. I googled around a bit and found some other state had their law written that nothing less than .3 seconds was ticket-able which I guess is slightly more reasonable.   Do I have a good chance to get rid of this if I dispute it or do you guys think I'm clearly guilty and .2 seconds into red is illegal?"	Yes
173	Last week myself and two other employees were riding from one part of our employers property to where our store is located. The drive is less than quarter of a mile. Our work truck is a regular cab Ford F350. My two other employees hopped in the cab. Seeing as though it's a bit cramped with junk in the cab + two employees I decided to hop in the uncovered bed of the truck. On our very short trip back to our store a NYS Trooper saw us and pulled a U-turn. I knew he was coming to stop us, but didn't think it was anything serious. Just a warning. I ended up hopping out of truck and headed inside as did the passenger of the truck. The driver went to park our work truck and the Trooper followed him into our parking lot. Turns out our employee was driving unlicensed(lost due to DUI) and without a seat belt. Originally we were stopped because I was in the bed of the truck. The police officer spoke with me, asked for all of my info and explain why I was stopped, but was not ticketed. He ended up speaking to our other employee for well over 20 minutes and later gave him a ticket for driving without a seat belt and without a license. Am I liable for paying half of this ticket when it has nothing to do with me? I'd understand if he was ticketed due to me being in the bed of the truck, but from what I read about our law I'm above the age where it's illegal and we were traveling less than the illegal distance.	Yes
174	"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	Yes
175	"I received a citation on Northern Cheyenne tribal land in Montana (WA resident), on US 212. [48 in a 45](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg). I don't want to give these people any money, but I also don't want a mark on my credit.   She claimed I was going 49 in a 40. Then when she came back with the ticket, it was 48 in a 40. I said it was 45 mph zone. She changed the speed zone to 45 (as you can see on [the front](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg)) and said ""there I changed the zone, but it doesn't matter, you were still speeding"" I said the speed zone is what it is, which is 45 and why would she think she can change it on the ticket if she was insisting it was 40. She shrugged. Normally when a cop gives you ""a break"" they lower the observed speed, not raise the zone. Odd.   She then got a big fake smile on her face and said **""you haven't even heard the good news!. Since this is tribal land, this doesn't go on your record, isn't reported to your insurance, and the *fee* is only around $25!""**  I asked ""And how do I pay this fee? Is there a website or something"" After she laughed about how they are in the middle of MT, they don't have online payments, she flipped the paper over and showed me [the back](https://i.imgur.com/7kBRC5h.jpg).   She said **""call this number at the bottom (I covered in black for privacy) and give them your citation number and your name. They will tell you how much the fee is, it should be around $25, and tell you where and how to send it in.""** I asked what happens if I don't pay, and she said they will send it to collections. I said ""I think I know how this will play out, I will end up paying this, and you guys will still send this to collections anyway."" she shrugged and gave me a ""what ya gonna do about it"" look.  She then said, while laughing, ""if you want to fight this, you will have to come all the way back here and im sure you dont want to do that. It's only $25, just pay it. It's not a big deal for you. It doesn't go on your record. Your insurance wont know. Just pay it."" I was about to tell her I will pay her right there and then if she rips it all up and lets me go. But I didn't.   This all seemed very sketchy to me.   I asked for her calibration records and she claimed she could not show them to me as they have personal information in them. She did have me lean into her truck, over passenger seat to see her radar system readout. It did say 48. I asked for the time this reading was taken, she said there is no time. I asked what the consequences are if I do not sign, she said ""nothing"". I told her I can not sign this citation and she wrote ""refuse to sign"".   If you look at the [back of the citation](https://i.imgur.com/7kBRC5h.jpg), it specifically says ""Send a **money order** in **the envelope provided** for the **amount of the fine** listed on the citation."" There was no envelope, which I assume has the address I should send this to, and there is no fee amount listed anywhere on [the front](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg). When I see the words ""money order"", it screams scam to me.   From what I have read, tribal police have no jurisdiction over non-tribal people except to detain you for a state or federal officer to arrive. So this citation is pretty odd to me...**does this mean that any person can issue citations to anyone, demand a payment, and if they don't pay, send to collections?** If only a portion of those people pay, you can make a good bit of money...which is what I think is going on here.   I have spent far more than $25 thinking about this and typing this out. *I don't want to give these people a dime for something so shady.* But I also do not want the headache of a collections agency going after me. I am hoping that someone has experience with tickets on this specific tribal land and can tell me if they do in fact send these to collections. I also want future people to be able to search for this story and have something to take away from it, because I could not find anything myself that satisfied me when googling around. This has already been a huge waste of my time and I don't want others to waste theirs. I am leaning towards just paying it so any doubt about it being sent to collections is moot. If I do not pay this, I am not sure how a collections agency would find me. Perhaps they can just search my name at the credit reporting agencies and send a letter to my current address that is on file with them? If they can not find me, perhaps that makes the situation worse and it goes right on my report without having a chance to send a letter demanding proof of debt.   Some additional facts:  * I have not contacted them yet. * They don't have my current address, as my state doesn't require me to get a new license with an address change. And she did not ask me for my current address. * They don't have my phone number  * They DO have the license plate number of my out of state vehicle. Which is registered to me. * I have experience with a small amount of $20 going to collections, where a shady newspaper guy signed me up for a year subscription of the local paper which I never paid the renewal for. This was for $20, and I sent in a certified letter to the collections agency and demanded proof of the valid debt. Nothing came of it. * I do not know when this is due and they would send to collections. But it has been 31 days since the citation and 16 days since the court date. * My dash cam does in fact indicate I was going 48 in 45. I reviewed this footage later. There are no landmarks near the road for me to get a VASCAR-like computation via google maps to check if my camera and her radar system were accurate. But if they are both the same, they are likely correct. My dashcam has the mic disabled, so no audio of the conversation was recorded. * Their [fee schedule](https://i.imgur.com/sOgNziM.png) on their website indicates a civil complaint would be $25   **Are the chances of a mark on my credit low enough that I can get away with not paying this?**   **Can any one just give out citations and demand payment and send to collections?**   https://imgur.com/a/fi7w6"	Yes
176	So recently I got a DUI and the lawyer was able to get me an agreement on a suspended imposition. This is only in a couple of states, South Dakota and Missouri I believe. Well my question is, will I still be found guilty under the courts judgement or convicted?	Yes
177	My father has been involved in a biking accident a few months back. Luckily, he didn't sustain serious injuries, and only had (substantial) damage to his (racing) bike. The other person involved in the crash was a woman who sustained heavy injuries (fractured skull, and cannot recall the accident) and spent 2 days in the hospital. She is now holding my father accountable for the accident, and we are wondering how to respond, as we firmly believe he was not the one at fault.   He (and his friend) describe the situation as follows:  The two of them were heading home after a long tour on their racing bike, and cycling up a hill in the town center. My father is on the left, nearer to the middle of the road, and they approach the cross road where the accident happens. At the side of the road, the view is blocked by a large white van, as there are parking spaces right up to the cross road. BEFORE they reach the cross road, and can see past the van, a woman aproaches from the right, first hits my father's friend (lightly, causing him to fall) and then has a full on collission with my father, causing my father to fly headfirst over his bike, while she falls backwards. My father was protected by his helmet, which has broken in multiple places, she, sadly, has no such protection. Both of them are lying on the ground next to the van, a good distance before the cross roads, on their side of the road. The woman claims that as she was approaching from the right side of the cross roads (Dutch traffic law) she had right of way, and my father is liable. My father says they were not at the crossing yet, hadn't been able to see her because of the van and she 'cut corners', and so she is in fact at fault. Police arrived only after they had already left for the hospital, took their statements, and decided the aftermath was left for the insurance companies to decide. So there is no proper   Today, he received a formal letter, to inform him she will hold him accountable and informed her insurance of this. Now, as we are insured this doesn't really matter, not even affecting his deductible (?word?), but he does resent being blamed for something he feels he is not responsible for. Or at least, not solely, as his friend was also part of the incident. Aside from that, he also has significant damage to his biking equipment (upward of 200 euros) and though nothing compared to her ordeal, it's no small ammount.  He is planning to put this all into a proper letter in reply, and has had contact with his own insurance about what is going on, but I am wondering if you people have any advice how to proceed?  Thanks in advance!	Yes
178	"So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit. So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help.."	Yes
179	Recently my girlfriend was hit in the rear of the vehicle by another vehicle changing to her lane. I have no idea how he did not notice her or how this had happened. No big deal right? She calls the police for a report and not knowing the law or good habits after being involved in a motor vehicle collision I think she incriminated herself by saying the wrong thing.    The third party (person who ran into her) had his story straight by saying he was in the same lane as her the entire time and that she had pulled out in front of him.   After spending 15 minutes talking to the third party the police officer asks my girlfriend 1-2 questions and then gives her a citation for failing to yield right of way.  This does not make sense to me looking at pictures because she is all the way in her lane and accelerating at the point of impact. This basically puts her word vs the third party since the cop was not a witness and nobody stepped forward.    The options are basically this. 1. Pay the citation and do a 4 hour course to prevent points on her license.  This is scary because it's basically an admission of guilt.  2. Have a lawyer write a letter explaining how she was in the right and hope he sides with her.  3. Take it to court and hope the judge says that she had the right of way being completely in her lane and not that the third party had the right of way from already being on the road.  The third option would be the best because there is a high chance the citation is dismissed completely through lack of evidence or what not but it is also the most risky and expensive route.  The first option would be great if it is possible but I'm not sure how the insurance companies do their side of things. The main concern is to not get an absurd insurance rate increase. I want to discuss further and see what the best options are. I plan on getting the police report when it is available.  Thanks for reading, Matt	Yes
180	So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	Yes
181	I remember when it happened. I was in Hermosa Beach doing uber and I was waiting outside a bar late at night with other uber drivers with lights on parked in red. I know I'm not supposed to.   I saw a parking meter worker pull up behind me but didn't turn on any lights or anything. About 30 seconds later my riders came out and got in. I looked in the mirror to see if the attendant was flagging me down but she didn't. I put my car in drive and slowly drove away. She made no attempt at stopping me. She never issued me anything.	Yes
182	I went to Wisconsin in June for the only vacation I could afford in years. On my way back I was passing someone when they decided to speed up so I couldn't, I was running out of room so I too sped up and finished my pass then let off the gas. I came over the hill slowing down and about a quarter mile up the road I saw a state trooper. He claims I was doing 23 over, I wasn't, I was issued a 225 dollar ticket that I can literally not afford to pay. Nor can I afford the increase in my insurance if I pay the ticket admitting guilty. I read on multiple sources that all that will happen is I can't go back to Wisconsin since they will put a warrant out for my unpaid fine. What do I do?	Yes
183	"Yesterday I received 3 notices of traffic tickets from Florence (Originally perpetrated in March) where I ""was driving within the limited traffic area without authorization"". Two infractions were within 40 minutes, and the other was 2 days later. I don't recall seeing signs, or being on a road that seemed like I shouldn't, but I don't speak Italian either!  I am an American citizen that was using a rental car. It's important to note that these notices seem to be from the city police directly, and not through the rental company.  All 3 notices are for 81 + 37 Euros for procedures. It ends up being $403 USD.  What are my options and what would you recommend?"	Yes
184	A couple months ago my friend's car was towed. There was another car, same make and model, in the lot which the tower had a lien for. He sold the lien to my friend for cheap (waived the towing/storage fees because they just wanted to make room in the lot) and towed it to his house since it doesn't run well/have a key.  My friend planned to register the car as non-op and use it for parts but found out at the DMV that it's got $700 in fees and can't be registered non-op until the renewal date which is in a few months. To claim the lien (or whatever proper terminology is here) he needs to get the car to pass smog and pay those fees so he decided to temporarily hold off on the registration.  So he's in this catch: can't register the car as non-op yet but there's no way to pass smog with it not running. Can't scrap it because it's not in his name until renewal date. Also the DMV fees are steep and un-anticipated.  Currently, he'd like to swap out a couple parts on the car and be rid of it if possible (and hopefully without huge expense). Any suggestions to this end are appreciated. A few questions: Since the sale isn't recorded with the DMV is it legit? Does the towing company still own the car technically and is there any way to void the sale? Is there a way to junk the car before the renewal date? Is there any way around DMV fees and this catch with the registration?  Thanks in advance for any advice or info!   tl;dr: bought lien of non-running parts-car, hit with fees and a catch with DMV registration, haven’t registered yet, trying to smoothly and legally exit situation	Yes
185	"1) Is it illegal to pass a vehicle inspection without the vehicle? 2) In a bill of sale, what would ""Title Fee: $400"" legally mean? Would it be seen as the cost of registration, taxes, and fees in the buyers name. Or is it too vague to mean anything? 3) If someone registers the car with a fraudulent VIR, is there a way to prove that?  For all of you people who seem to want to criticize me for buying a used car, and being unhappy that it broke down the next day. I have taken the story out and only left with the questions I need answering. If you need background, I won't give any as you will just insult me."	Yes
186	A few days ago, I was in an accident where the other driver seems to think I could be at fault for this. I was driving with no stop light or stop sign at the intersection and the other driver seems to think it was my fault.  This is the closest thing I could find that shows the type of intersection. http://imgur.com/a/8LE92 I am the blue car and the person that hit me is the white car. The only difference is there were three lanes on each side on the street going east to west.   The white car tried to cut across the lanes and crashed into my passenger side. I was in the far left lane and the white car made it across the two lanes next to me and I guess the driver expected me to let him through? Is there some law that says I should have stopped or any way I could be found even partially at fault?   And sorry if this question is better off being asked in another sub. Thanks!	Yes
187	I have recently been stopped by a CHP in Southern California going 65 on a 55. I explained to the CHP that I've had a chronic series of bladder, prostate, and kidney infections the past few months and was in the middle of an episode on my way to get treatment at a clinic close by. He seemed to chuckle a bit and proceeded to give me a ticket. Do I have any legal standing or way of fighting this ticket in court?	Yes
188	So today my gf got a call from a claims agency saying she owes ~$200 for a ticket she received last fall. She never received a ticket and if this is the case, it was when her brother used her car to drive into Queens, NY for work as he was borrowing her car at this time.  So, the crux of the issue is since it is in claims court, she cannot see any of the detail regarding the violation and needs to drive into Jamaica, Queens to pay. We don't know what her other options are. If you never received a ticket or summons and was never able to give any kind of plea because of this, is there any way to fight the ticket?  It seems kind of shady to me that a collection agency is the first to contact her about a ticket from last fall. She hasn't heard anything at all from any law enforcement about this ticket. She can't even see a record of it on her DMV driving record.  Does she have any options other than pay?	Yes
189	"The accident happened in Irvine, CA. I was giving my girlfriend a ride to work on my motorcycle in the far left lane before HOV. With the intent of using the HOV lane, I waited for a break in the yellow lines, hit the turn signals, looked over my shoulder and then mirror, saw that there were no vehicles in the HOV, and made the lane change. Maybe ~10ft from the point where I changed lanes, I heard another motorcycle's tires screeching (assuming he locked up his tires), and the rider going down in my rear mirror. Pulled over and did a police report. He and his bike suffered some rashes; neither my gf, my bike and I were harmed. I received a warning letter from the DMV saying that I will be receiving a point on my license from that accident for ""failing to notice (the rider) approaching from the left rear"".  I got a copy of the report today and found out that in his statement, he said he was ""driving (his motorcycle) on I-5 s/b splitting lanes between the HOV and #1 lane (far left)..."". Is it legal to be splitting lanes in between four solid yellow lines? If legal, what can I do next time to prevent a similar accident?"	Yes
190	I hope this is an OK place to ask this.  I got a ticket in Nov of last year in CA and did a trial by dec. and lost and I just completed online traffic school about 2 days ago.  My insurance is due and is higher due to the ticket. Insurance told me I need to get proof of the ticket is gone from the DMV then send it to them and they will credit me the overage. So whats the typical amount of time for the DMV?	Yes
191	My mom had parked my car on her driveway because it's broken as a way to help me. we haven't been talking due to personal reasons and at some point in the past two months she had my car towed from her driveway onto the street outside of her house. It's been getting ticketed I believe every night for almost a month.  She never told me she was having it moved onto the streets. Can I take her to court for these tickets? Is there anything else I can possibly do?	Yes
192	"First time posting here, so please let me know if there's more info you need from me.   I'm 23, a NC resident, and just got my first speeding ticket ever in Virginia for going 76 in a 60mph zone. The charge was speeding, and the fine is $157 total.  I went to the North Carolina DMV website to look at what points I should expect on my license, and saw this:  ""Regardless of the number of points on your record, the NC Division of Motor Vehicles will automatically suspend your driving privileges if you're ticketed for offenses like: Speeding over the limit by 15 MPH while already driving faster than 55 MPH.""   That obviously applies to my circumstance, and now I'm not sure what to do and am frankly pretty panicked. I had been planning on just paying the ticket, thinking I would just have to deal with points on my license and increased insurance rates, but I absolutely can't get my license suspended--I am a graduate student with two jobs, and that's just not an option for me if it's at all avoidable.  Is my bet bet to go to my court date in VA? If so, what does that process look like, and what would I need to say/do to avoid getting my license suspended?  Is hiring a traffic lawyer a better option? What would this process look like, what results would I be able to expect from getting a lawyer?   Thanks in advance for any help or guidance anyone can offer."	Yes
193	I was caught by a speed gun going 85 mph in a 55 mph zone, after the fine was payed I was told by my fathers legal adviser to plead not guilty and to fight for a lower punishment. What steps can I take to not make myself look like an idiot. Here is what I have noted so far: * I was in a 55 Mph zone * I have driven over 10000 miles since I got my car this fall, driving to soccer practice for the school, for my soccer club that is an hour away, school , work, games, leisure.  * Driving for me is a daily task, and to be able to accomplish the things I need to do at this time in my life (Soccer identification camps, touring colleges, work, odds and ends) I need to drive because of my parents work schedule. * The car I was pulled over in was not my vehicle, it was my ex-girlfriends, it was a newer, better accelerating car.  *I am not saying I had a justified reason for speeding, I am cut and dry guilty, but I had SAT's in the morning and I was driving home from a late soccer game, I wasn't thinking right and I just wanted to get home.  That is all I have for now, can I get advice on whether this useful information, and what else I can add. Any advice is appreciated.	Yes
194	Long time lurker, first time poster, so please excuse any formatting mistakes or anything.  Basically, back in June 2015, my dad was tight on money, so to help him out, my gf and I decided to purchase his 2011 Nissan Murano off of him. She got an auto loan to pay the car for approx $15,000. This mean my gf would have a total of two cars, an Infiniti Sedan, and now a Nissan Murano SUV. Every time we approached him to sign over the title and registration, he claimed he was too busy and stuff (we opened a restaurant together). On our off days, he was always wanting to stay home and do his own thing instead of just signing it over, and he would sometimes get mad when we bugged him about it. This all happened in NJ. We currently posses the only copy of the title, but it is in my dad's name.  Fast forward to about Feb 2017, we got into a series or arguments that basically ended in me and gf moving from NJ to CA. As stated before, the 3 of us (Gf, myself, and dad) opened a moderately successful restaurant in NJ, but the my dad was essentially emotionally abusing us throughout the course of the restaurant (calling us worthless/names constantly, yelling at us all the time, throwing things near us to scare us). We could no longer deal with it, so we packed our bags and moved to CA, and took the Infiniti as the car to road trip in. We finally got to CA in April 2017, and we realized we still haven't gotten the title or registration transferred to my gf's name. We are still paying the auto loan for the Nissan (loan under her name), and the Nissan Murano is still with my dad back in NJ. We obviously live in CA now, so we can't just take the car, and we would prefer not to speak to him, but will do so if it benefits us financially.  I sent him an email about a month ago telling him he needs to transfer the title and registration to her name, or he needs to take over the loan payment. He did not respond.   Right now, as it stands, these are the issues:  1.) We are paying for a car that we do not possess (we are in CA and the car is in NJ).  2.) Dad is currently using our car for his own work/personal use (He is in NJ using the car).  3.) We are paying for the auto loan that is under our name. We took out that auto loan to purchase the Nissan Murano from my dad.  The possible solutions that I would like to happen would be:  1.) We are able to bring the car to CA, and preferably sell it just to pay off the auto loan  OR  2.) He takes over the loan payment.  I am not too comfortable on letting him take over the loan payment as he has abused his power in the past, and he is the type of individual to not pay the loan just to ruin my gf's credit.  OTHER INFORMATION:  He currently owns the restaurant that me, my gf, and him worked on together (he financed, we put in sweat equity, no pay for 1.5 years, but that's another issue). He definitely has the money to either purchase the car back OR purchase another car of his own. We just do not want to be stuck with a payment for a car that we do not have. When we finally get the car, we would most likely sell it to pay back the loan.  My questions to the readers are:  1.) What would be the best route to obtain the registration?  2.) How would we transfer the name of the title and registration to my gf's name?  3.) How would we get possession of the car?  4.) Is there anyway to punish my dad for his actions? Will there be any punishment on our end for being unable to transfer the title and registration to our names?  Thank you all so much!	Yes
195	My father gave me an old car when I was 16-ish. Had different issues where I couldn't drive it. Father gave me a different car that was drivable and I signed the title back over to the one I had no use of. Now 10 years down the Rd my sister's moved my dad to a senior care center in Miami and his old house was foreclosed on by the bank and purchased by someone else. The new owner of the home reported several abandoned vehicles on the property to the police department. One of them being the one I signed over to my father but he never changed the title. The police department then contacted me to notify me. What should I do? They said my sister's refused to act on the other vehicles. I don't live near there and the one car isn't technically mine. I'm afraid of being fined or sued because the car is still in my name legally, but on the other hand if I do something to it, like sell or have it junked, I don't want it to turn into a possible theft situation from the perspective of my family). (My father isn't there mentally and my sister's don't care for me in the least).	Yes
196	So early last week in Minneapolis, MN, I had an accident on the interstate involving two other vehicles, in which I hit one in to the other (I will mostly focus on the car I hit.) Traffic was moving under the speed limit (55 mph) but was steady. I was thinking I needed to be in the next lane, so I had looked over my shoulder to check my blind spot, and when I turned around, the vehicle in front of me appeared to have virtually stopped, leading me to be unable to stop in time.   No one was hurt, and the air bags did not deploy in either vehicle. I am unsure of my speed, as I was just keeping up with traffic, but I did know that it was under the speed limit. I told the state trooper that I was unsure of my speed, but it couldn't have been over 45 mph. The officer cited me for failure to drive with due care (MN Statute [169.14.1](https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?id=169.14)). He voiced being unable to print off my citation due to computer troubles, which I found weird as he was able to print off the crash report, but whatever, frankly I was too frazzled to care. So once I receive the citation, I learn that I have a mandatory court appearance in Minneapolis.   So, now I'm sort of freaking out. First of all, I have never appeared in court before, and Minneapolis is 3-4 hours from where I live. Secondly, while I see how I'd be found at fault of the accident, I do not understand the citation nor why I'd have to appear in court for it. Insurance has already decided that it was my fault and my car was a total loss.  I'd really appreciate any advice, as I don't even know what to expect.	Yes
197	I got pulled over for speeding.  The wiki says to hire a lawyer and not too much else.  What should I be asking aforementioned lawyer in order to minimize insurance premium hikes?	Yes
198	I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended license, and completely spaced the court date. I'm fairly certain that means I will now have a bench warrant for failure to appear, in addition to having to take care of my original charge.   I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker.   I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next? I take care of a parent and kid so it would be really bad to go to jail. (Otherwise I'd just bit the bullet and go for a short period.)   TL;DR: What's the best bet for getting my warrant cleared, without spending time in jail, and can I do it on my own? How likely (approximately) is it that I'll get arrested if I go in on my own?	Yes
199	Posting from the scene of the accident. I was driving down the road at ~40mph in a 40mph speed zone. A bus was stopped so I believed that it was letting off passengers. I slowed a little bit and was not in the lane of the bus. A person pulled out of the plaza unable to see my vehicle and hit in to my front fender. There is little damage to his vehicle. We exchanged information and got photos of the damage on both vehicles and license plates and insurance information. Police have not arrived yet and I have already made a claim. What next?  Damages: My vehicle: 99 Accord Coupe LX Broken headlight Tire fell off Bumper fell off  His vehicle: 02 Nissan Frontier Cracked front bumper	Yes
200	So back in Feb 2017 I was very stupid and drove after drinking. I have a lawyer and he has looked at the video and everything and says that while the stop may be challenged that if I loose then I have to go through the trial and I could lose more because I was clearly drunk in the video. I've reviewed the evidence myself and I agree with him completely.  I am mostly just concerned about the First Offenders Program in general. I live in MD and never plan to drink or drive again. I don't mind doing the classes, or getting the evaluations, or joining AA because I was wrong and I could have really hurt someone or myself.  I am just wondering how this is going to look on my record.	Yes
201	My wife was recently involved in a car accident, the first either of us has had in the United States since moving here (state of Washington). She was on a highway with about a 45 mph speed limit, 2 lanes in each direction plus a center bi-directional turn lane. She was in the left lane. An on coming car moved into the center turn lane. The vehicle in front of her (also left lane) made a left turn at speed from the left lane, colliding head on with the car in the turn lane. My wife swerved right to attempt to avoid the collision in front of her, but couldn't quite get over fast enough - causing damage to her drive side front wheel and surrounding body pieces. She also isn't entirely positive but thinks the vehicle in front of her may have just passed her on the right and effectively turned almost from the right lane, but she's not positive. She appears to be mostly physically alright, although will seek some chiropractic care due to some back pain.   She talked to insurance only enough to open a claim and report minimal details. The adjuster assigned isn't in until Monday.   State patrol gave her a ticket for following too close. She also got information via the state patrol officer for the other two drivers. Witnesses at the scene indicated that the driver in front of her making the turn was being wreckless, although she does not have contact info.   We are in the middle of moving and this comes at a terrible time, not that it's ever good. I'm curious to know if there are any things to expect, things to push with our insurance provider (allow drivers have different companies, for what worth), things to not bring up, etc. Also, how important is it to fight he ticket? If the ONLY impact is the cost of the ticket, we'd rather pay than deal with fighting it. If it will hurt insurance or something else, then we have to consider that.   Any thing else I'm not thinking of? What would you do in this scenario?	Yes
202	Hi everyone! Short and sweet: I’ve never gotten a speeding ticket before. I grew up in VA and I know the driving laws.  The minor violations I’ve incurred are:  Driving too closely (minor fender bender in early 2014) in VA  Red light ticket a few months ago in Illinois  I moved to Chicago recently and drove all the way to Virginia Beach in one day (not that big of a deal but context is important). When I reached Lexington, VA I got pulled over going 90 in a 70.  I had my cruise control on UNDER 80 almost my whole trip; I think I had taken it off due to the twisty nature of the road, I had to brake a lot. Anyway, the road was empty, I was just in the zone driving, and I guess I had pressed too hard down and was pulled over at 90, not realizing I never put my CC back on.  Anyways, I’m devastated. I don’t really know what to do. I know better than to go over 80 in VA (or anywhere, really), yet here we are.  Any advice is much appreciated.	Yes
203	Hello and thank you!  I recently tried to start driving for Uber/Lyft for some extra income, and they told me no due to my driving record... About 5 years ago I got ticket for driving with no insurance. Car wasn't mine, so I paid the fine and continued on with my life. Unbeknownst to me, the moment I paid the fine, my license was automatically suspended until I got an SR22 on my insurance. Well, a year goes by, and I get pulled over... now I have a driving while suspended. Once i figured out that nonsense, I got the SR22 and they reinstated my licence. I maintained the SR22 for 3 years and haven't had a ticket since. Is there any way to get this crap off my record? Please, I need help! :(	Yes
204	So to start, my car was towed due to dead tags from my trade in at the dealership I bought my newer car from. Both cheep cars. Either way the cops towed my car and didn't give me a single paper or notice or ticket. Now I got pulled over for the same thing a day or two before and am taking care of the ticket I was issued that day currently. (For the dead tag) my question is shouldn't have I gotten some kind of documentation about the towing at the live stop? And who do I call to get what I need in order to get my car out of what I assume is the impound Lott?? I live in philadelphia in the city.	Yes
205	"Today I was pulled over.  When the vehicle came to a stop I cracked the window to about 1/2in, enough to hear the officer's commands and hand over my identification.  The officer approached my driver's window and stood there.  Said nothing, then opened my driver's door.  I was flabbergasted, I asked him what right he had to open my door.  He replied, ""You didn't put the window down.""   As I see it, if I had something illegal in the door of my car, he would not have known about it until he opened the door.  Which seems to me like an illegal search.  Could someone weigh in on this?"	Yes
206	In my area you can fight a ticket online. I admitted responsibility and asked for mercy. They lowered it, but it still has points on it.  I don't want to appear in court because I feel like it could backfire, and it would also balance out my time in terms of paying the $140 if I have to miss a full day of work.  Opinions? Thank you.	Yes
207	What should i do about this?  I got pulled over doing 100 mph in a 65 mph zone in New jersey.   I'm 17 years old.   I have court in 6 days ON MY BIRTHDAY. Fuck my life.	Yes
208	I'm 20 and am expecting to go to trial. I had to get a police report in before I could have my car get towed after my collision in which I took a breathilizer and managed 2 points below a dwi (0.06). I have to show up in court in a month.  So now I'm wondering what first steps I should take before the court case's consequences such as getting my license suspended, getting a restricted license etc.	Yes
209	Okay, so I am staying at a college while I am interning for the summer. I do not attend this particular college, but do have my car registered there for temporarily parking. Last night, I parked my car in a handicap spot, so I could run in and print something. Took me 2 minutes and there were literally 10 open handicap spots ( I know still a horrible decision). Well got a $375 ticket. Do I have to pay this?	Yes
210	A pedestrian island on a very heavy and busy area of Arlington, tx (Collins and Abrams) is protruding  into the lane and during heavy rains is in seeable. I was driving past the area and was unable to see the curb. My right tire hit the curb causing a blowout of the tire, I was able to maintain control and the tire held up for the mile I had to drive to get home.   Is there any legal recourse to the city I have since this curb is so far into the lane and is not clearly marked?	Yes
211	Hearing was in May and didn't bother going as I didn't know the judge could change the ticket to a lower speeding offense or a non-moving violation.  Is there any way I can have this changed at this point? I'm past the 60 day window for a Motion to Reopen. Could I file one anyhow and hope the judge would rehear the case? My driving record is clean besides this ticket.	Yes
212	I was driving on I95 at about 40-45mph in a 65mph zone. This was due to the weather and road conditions at the time. As I continued to drive in the express lane, I hit a long puddle which pulled the nose of my car towards the middle barrier. I immediately let my foot off the gas and corrected the steering towards the lane. My car corrected and when the rear of the car hit another puddle, it pulled the car the opposite direction. My vehicle then started to hit the plastic pole barriers which no matter how much I tried to correct, pulled the car facing the outside of the highway. My car came to a stop. My front passenger bumper was then clipped by a vehicle in the lane next to me, and spun my car facing the middle barrier. We both pulled off the road, there were no injuries. I was already on the phone with the police, after the officer investigated, he wrote me a citation for careless driving.  All that being said, the officer didn't witness the accident. And I was able to maintain control of the vehicle within my lane up to a complete stop. I was also driving in a safe manner due to road conditions.  I understand that law is black and white. However with extenuating circumstances, I don't feel like I was driving carelessly. That being said, how valid is the citation? With extenuating circumstances is it something I should fight?  Also, my vehicles lease expires on Thursday and I have an $8,000 damage waiver. If I turn the vehicle in, and the insurance company doesn't pay a claim. In addition, if I choose to fight it and the citation gets dismissed will my rates go up in a no-fault state?  TL;DR: Spun out in the rain. Maintained vehicle within lane as much as humanly possible. Got clipped by another vehicle after mine came to a complete stop and received citation for careless driving. Fight or pay it?	Yes
213	Today I was driving and got pulled over, I wasn't breaking any traffic laws and going the speed limit in traffic. There was an officer running what I assume was speed radar from the emergency turn-around, who pulled out about 4 cars behind me, and proceeded to pull me over. He confirmed my identity upon coming to my window, and told me the reason he pulled me over was because my license had come up as suspended, which was accurate. I provided him with my work privelages and he let me continue on my drive.  I am not in any legal trouble nor did I receive any ticket, but I am very confused - I did not break any traffic laws, nor was ever followed by this officer for him to run my plates. How was he able to see my license was suspended? Is there technology on officers that lets them automatically scan and flag license plates going by even at those high speeds? Also, is it legal to run plates like that without any suspicious reasoning? I felt very violated that I got pulled over going down the road - I understand my plates run as suspended with privelages, but I didn't break any traffic laws or do anything to give any officer suspicion to that.  Like I said again, I am not in any legal trouble, nor was the officer anything but polite to me, I just had some questions about the entire interaction! I've passed several police like that going to/from work before and this had never happened to me before. Thank you!	Yes
214	is a lawyer needed to get your driving record expunged?  I have several things in my 10 year print out that are preventing me from working many driving jobs.  any help is appreciated.   first timer here,  thank you!	Yes
215	Dunno what's really pertinent here but I have a record in two states living in a third. I'm a pretty stable schizo with two jobs and a BA. I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb. I received ~$200 pair of tickets for operating w/o insurance and driving on a suspended registration. I paid the tickets well ahead of deadline but came home to find info staying that a bench warrant was put out on me but apparently according to the clerk's website I'm good. So what's the deal with this type of situation. I'm not even clear on if these are simple tickets misdemeanors or whatever (WI).	Yes
216	So I got a ticket for parking in a zone that only city vehicles could stand in (Section 4-08(c)(4).   However, the address under 'place of occurrence' is ~300 off (listed '125 w __ street' instead of '425 w __ street').   Additionally, under expiration date they entered 'N/S', despite the expiration date being listed on both the rear license plate and a sticker on the windshield. This is a vehicle with out of state plates.   I have a picture of the vehicle parked at 425 w _ street and pictures of the license plate and registration sticker as evidence.	Yes
217	Hi all! If I was parked in a parking lot and I open my door as another person drives into the spot next to me (fairly quickly) and my door creates a deep dent in his bumper, who is at fault?   We're currently trying to settle this through cash and haven't notified out insurance agencies, but I feel like it might not have been my fault.   I do recognize that I erred in not checking to make sure it was completely clear next to me before opening my door, but I would think that a pedestrian getting out of a car would take precedence over a vehicle driving into a spot, no?   This is my first time in an accident so I could be ignorant.	Yes
218	"Tuesday around 2:30 AM a couple friends and I were leaving a bar. I knew I was drunk and shouldn't drive, but this isn't about me justifying myself. Well, I was heading from one parking lot to the other across the street to take my friends back to their cars, where someone would have taken me home or I would have Uber'd (more on that later). I turned left on a road where I didn't know there was a median, crossed the street, got to my destination, but before I could pull into the lot I had lights on me. Since I already knew I was driving on the wrong side of the road like an idiot, I figured that's what I was being pulled over for. It was. However I just left the bar, I had 3 (and a half) beers between 10:30 PM and 2:30 AM, so I'm sure I smelled, or my non-driver smashed passenger did. Officer has me do field sobriety tests, I probably failed, but while under the impression my sentence would he lighter if I blew, I consented and went along with it.  Blew a 0.121, arrested, and I was allowed to leave the station with my stepdad.  Totally cool with paying the fines and the 90 day suspension and even the classes as I know I shouldn't have been driving drunk, even if it was just to cross the street. Got off lucky that no one was hurt, I acknowledge that. The important part for me is when my court date came, the judge told me I was being charged with 2 counts of DUI, one for driving and one for blowing over the limit, meaning my first offense is counted as my second. He said I'm facing something like 180 days in jail/10k fine/1 year suspension. I wasn't even in the car for 5 minutes. Sidenote: my breaks are broken and I was driving my brother's car. How big of an issue is this? (Again, I know I shouldn't have, even to cross the street, but honest to God I was JUST crossing the street, I was not driving home. I was on the wrong side of the road, so me getting pulled over is justifiable, I just didn't think it through. I would have gotten pulled over sober because I'm just stupid.) Though it's not my place to say, is that ""fair""? I have an attorney who I can hopefully afford, but I can't meet with him until Friday. I just need some peace of mind, and knowing how much trouble I'm in could definitely help me prepare mentally."	Yes
219	Hey! Long time lurker, first time poster.  I got pulled over tonight because my headlight and tag light are out. Fair enough, I knew my headlight was out and my fiancé was planning to help me fix it tomorrow. Unfortunately, I forgot my wallet at home this morning, so I didn’t have my license on me.  The officer cited me for not having my license because it’s “easy to deal with” - however, I’m a teacher and I’m at work all of the times the courthouse is open. I’d have to take a full day off (nigh impossible during testing season) to go to the courthouse and pay 10 dollars.   I don’t want my kids to miss any instruction - my days are thoroughly planned to make sure they get what they need before the state tests. If I just pay the 116 dollar fine without going to the courthouse, does it look any different on my record?	Yes
220	So, I received a notice from a collection agency regarding a towing on a vehicle that I do not posses or even own in California.  More a year ago I was trying to buy this acura integra for my friend to use. I was unable to title the car in my name due to not being able to pass emissions, therefore I never finished the application for change of ownership and title. The car was sold to someone else by my friend and was eventually stolen and then towed while I was at school in San Deigo.  All I can do now is write a letter to dispute the validity of the charges.  I'm a bit stressed over this and wondering what options I have to use, if any. Thanks.	Yes
221	Wells Fargo did this nefarious insurance nonsense to me last fall and I refused to pay until if was rectified. They called 10-12 times a day then repoed my car. I was going through some personal stuff and depressed so never took it anywhere. I just paid cash for a new car and told them to f?!$ off since my attempt to build credit through this loan was screwed. I just did not have the energy to fight. Now I do. What do I do? Call WF and work out settlement? Call attorney? What type of attorney?  What should I ask for?  IE $2000+ rental bill until I found new car. Harassment. Credit screwed. Insurance issues.   https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/wells-fargo-unwanted-auto-insurance.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;referer=http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wells-fargo-charges-800000-customers-for-fake-car-insurance-steals-25000-cars/	Yes
222	I drove less than a mile to the store, I drove past a downed stop sign (it was literally on the ground because somebody else hit it) and was struck by another car. Nobody was hurt, we were going fairly slow. Damage to my car was worse, he had a scuffed/slightly dented fender. My window was shattered and the door was pushed in.   I freaked out because I know I'm not supposed to be on the road and I saw the sign I drove passed. I said sorry, claimed responsibility and we took pictures.  He seemed nice and agreed not to involve the police, assuming that I'd get into trouble. Said he had no interest in taking advantage of me, however it was a company car and somebody has to pay.   I'm confused, my parents are in the hospital because my mom got injured from something unrelated. I have no idea what to do.   I don't have money, I am disabled and subsist off of SSI. What the hell do I do? My friend guessed it would cost around 1100-1500 for repairs. I have a trashbag on my window.   Why don't I have insurance/license? Long story nobody cares. Why did I risk driving without them? Well, I'm a fucking idiot apparently.   What do I do?	Yes
223	About a year ago, I went on a long international trip and forgot to make payments on my car. Eventually, it got reclaimed by the leasing company.  Before the vehicle was redeemed from the repossession agency, the agency suspected the battery was dead and charged me for a replacement, keeping the original battery. (This was unexpected because the car was only a few months old, and its battery was new.)   Little did I know that the battery they installed was a large aftermarket battery, which blocked the AC hose, preventing moisture from exiting the car. Over the last year, the blocked hose caused the car's floor to accumulate moisture. Last month, the electronics suddenly became fried and the car would no longer leave the first gear.  Repairing this damage is estimated to cost 90-95% of the car's cash value.  When I asked the leasing company about this, they said that the damage was my responsibility, given that almost a year had passed and that I had already signed off for the vehicle upon pickup.  While I understand their argument, I believe the repossession agency ought to be responsible, provided that they installed the large battery, leading to major problems.  I don't understand why the leasing company isn't going after the repossession agency. Is it my job to do hire a lawyer to do that? I don't know where to start. For some reason, the repossession agency won't give me records on service and maintenance performed on the car, only to the leasing company. Also, my insurance is not going to cover the damage because I do not have comprehensive coverage.	Yes
224	Hello! So my girlfriend has received a traffic citation on Friday from an apparently hit and run accident on June 18th. It's a misdemeanor failure to stop property damage citation with no insurance/registration(She has proof of both)  She is very unsure of this whole deal, I'm just trying to find some answers to help ease her uncertainty. I know the basics of never talk to police, get a lawyer etc. but I don't have much knowledge and feel bad I can't help more.  She is claiming not to remember any accident, or damage to her car. I believe there may be a scratch on her mirror that's about 2cm but she says it's been there before.   Anyways I'm wondering what to tell her to do besides getting/talking to lawyers, what's the worst case scenario outcome, no criminal record, first offense, one speeding ticket 6 years ago etc. and since there is only the failure to stop property damage citation(well no insurance and registration C/I's that she has proof of so no biggie), does that mean it's just the only accusation we have to worry about? Reckless/careless driving or other things at a later date from this incident isn't a concern right?    Just want to give her some clarity on everything and what she's facing, thanks so much. Let me know if you need anymore info.	Yes
225	I was recently stopped by an officer who was diving in the opposite direction. He said he clocked me at 15mph over. I don't think I was speeding but had not been looking at my speed until he puled me over. Does anyone have advise on how to dispute the ticket?	Yes
226	While delivering at work in my personal car.  I was involved in an accident that was not my fault.  I had the right of way and the other driver was cited at the scene.  Law enforcement came and I went to the hospital for minor  injuries I sustained in the accident.    If the other driver is completely at fault will my ability to accept pay out be at risk since I was delivering in my personal vehicle?	Yes
227	I got a phone call an hour ago from my son, who is 26. My son lives in the state of Texas with his mother. His mother and I have been divorced since he was two years old. I have always strived to have a connection with my son; although it has ever been easy (he suffers from Asperger's syndrome, suffers from intense anxiety, has difficulty making friends, his mother loved being passive aggressive and generally make my life a living hell, etc) I have always loved my son and supported him when I could. If the fine folks of /r/legaladvice could advise me on the following dilemma my son has moronically gotten himself into, it would be greatly appreciated.  A few things about my son: he lives with his mother. He makes about $1,400 a month (after taxes). He dropped out of college his freshmen year and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social phobia shortly afterwards, hence the low paying job and general lack of motivation he suffers from. Because my son can be sometimes be very thick and obstinate, as well as terrified of speaking to people, he neglected to get insurance for his car for a whole month. I know; I chastised him for his gross irresponsibility, but I have long ago accepted that I cannot hold myself responsible for his decisions, however misguided as they can be. I love my son. He told me on the phone that he had been in a car crash a few months ago (on a car he had just bought) without having insurance. He received a ticket for failure to yield (resulting in the accident; according to him, he had just gotten off a 12 hour shift, he hadn't slept well in days due to his anxiety caused insomnia, and he had thought he had the right of way when a car slammed into him. Afraid of the financial difficulties of paying a fine for both things, he consulted his best friend, who happens to be a cop, and his friend advised him to get insurance for the car involved in the accident that same day, so he could present proof of insurance to court in front of the judge and have the fine removed.   It appeared to have worked. He dropped the insurance for the same car after paying his failure to yield fine. However, today (months after the car crash in question) he began to receive phone calls from his car insurance company about a claim placed on behalf of the other party involved. My son's car wasn't covered by his insurance at the time.   How can I best advise my son? Should he confess to the insurance company that he did not have insurance at the time of the crash? Would that make him liable to be sued? What are some repercussions he could face? He pays for his credit card, phone bill, car, rent, and groceries, so despite his gross negligence he tries to be good. He has fucked up enormously, but he is my son.  Please. I am desperate.   -concernedfatherofmoron	Yes
228	So couple days ago, someone hit and run my parked car. I called the police and filed a report. So I spend the next few days looking around my neighborhood looking for security camera. Lucky I was able to find a footage of the truck hitting my car and was also able to get the U.S. DOT number of the truck(which turn out to be a small trucking company). Unfortunately, the license plate was a blurry and couldnt make out the complete plate. Tomorrow my insurance company is coming down to take a look at my car and the footage. Should i contiune looking around to see if i can find the license plate of the truck or is the US Dot Number enough to make the case?    Many Thanks	Yes
229	Hello - I was wondering what would be best to do in this situation. Some guy crashes into my girlfriend's car in front of our house in the middle of the night. A neighbor ended up getting the license plate number. Girlfriend only has liability insurance and her insurance company just told her they can't/won't do anything. The person left a note but ins't answering phone calls. We have his name, phone number, place of work (hopefully), and license plate number. Should we confront him at his work? or would that hurt our case. Should we file a police report or give him more time? Thanks for the help!	Yes
230	Now not reckless driving, but the one point negligent driving. It keeps coming back for job background checks and I disclose it now after the first time I was called out on it because I had no idea it was not a general type of ticket when I was 18 and then forgot the ticket was and never thought twice. I can't get a straight answer on if it is a misdemeanor or not? Also I have a lot of driving tickets (4) from the age 18-21. Will that impact me forever? I am embarrassed of them now especially since all my future employers can see them. I haven't had a ticket in two years (23 now) and drive much more responsibly now. I also live in Florida now with the one ticket at 21 in Florida, rest are in Maryland. Will all these forever show up?	Yes
231	"I was in an accident a few months ago. I was on a provincial highway and I entered a 2 lane roundabout. This was my first time driving in one as I have only had my license for 3 years and I just never came across one. I accidentally entered in the outside lane not realizing I needed to be on the inside lane. I intended to go all the way around the roundabout and there was a large truck (I drive a mini hatchback) to my left on the inner lane of the roundabout who decided to exit. He saw me and still decided to just exit and slammed directly into my driver side.  Police arrived on scene and because I was in the wrong lane (unknowingly) even though he was supposed to be looking out for other vehicles I was the only one who got a ticket for an ""unsafe lane change"" because technically I was in the lane that was supposed to exit. So although I didn't actually change lanes I remained in the roundabout when I should have exited.   Its all very confusing. But I know on the accident report it says that I say I did NOT see the truck and the guy driving the truck says he DID see me. So I feel like he has some culpability and in fact he is the one who made an unsafe lane change because he didn't bother to check for other vehicles around him before exiting the roundabout.   I understand I was in the wrong lane and that's totally my fault but at the same time I wasn't intentionally being unsafe and I didn't make a lane change unsafely I just didn't realize I was supposed to exit if I was in the outside lane.   My early resolution meeting is today and honestly I cannot afford a ticket like this. I'm a single mom, I work 3 jobs, and attend school. I have been told that they cannot convict me if they can't prove the exact offense on the ticket. But I'm not sure what to say at this early resolution meeting I have today.  Also want to make mention that this is a ticket for a provincial highway under the highway traffic act.   Any advice is very much appreciated. Thank you."	Yes
232	The initial accident happened ahead of him. People were swerving out of the way. One of the people in the initial accident got out of her car and ran across the freeway. Fate would have it that she ran right in front of my friend's car. She died on the scene.  I have another friend who was a firefighter/first responder on the scene. He said that there was nothing my friend could have done. It was the other person's fault for getting out of the car. He doesn't know my friend, so there's no bias. The family is not pursuing legal action.   Fast forward to last week. He got 2 letters in the mail (or phone calls... I don't remember the exact details.) One was that the insurance company in formed him that there will be no liability on his part. The second one was the DMV saying that they were suspending his license for being involved in a fatal vehicle vs pedestrian accident.  Any advice for him?	Yes
233	A vehicle was stopped in the road. He then began driving very slowly. I decided to cross the double yellow line and pass him. Lucky for me a cop saw me and ticketed me. I explained he was driving like an asshole but she said it was a no passing zone. I want to plead not guilty as I can just barely afford the $170 ticket. Any professional input is much appreciated!	Yes
234	I try to make this quick. My friend's car got towed, she called both the police and the local tow agencies and could not find it. Reported it stolen. And about a month later got a letter from the tow company saying that they were in possession of her vehicle. They are now trying to charge for almost $2,000 in fees for a vehicle that's not even worth that much... Anything we can do? The timeline is towed early June. Called the day after to find it, told by police and tow company they didn't have. Received a letter June 23. Called to recover vehicle, and hit with fees dating back to early June.   Located in Southern california fyi.	Yes
235	"So I got a ticket for driving my 16+ year old mini van which didn't pass the smog test. Since the smog didn't pass I couldn't re-register my car and was driving it for 9 months without registration when I got pulled over. I already have a moving violation and have taken traffic school for in within the last 18 months so it is not worth it to just pay the ticket and get a point on my license especially since I'll be heading off to college and have no use for a car. If I sell/donate my car before the required date that I need to re-register without getting a points on my license will I still get a point on my license? If I do decide to sell/donate the car, what would the process be to make sure everything is done right? I'm leaning toward donating the car at this point. This is in the State of California and the CVC violation is 4000(a)(1)  The ticket is also a correctable ""fix-it"" ticket. Not sure if that matters or not."	Yes
236	So to make it short, I was out late driving on the highway and was pulled over while going slightly over 30 the speed limit, resulting in an over $400 ticket.  The ticket is not the issue, however, as I will pay for it.  The thing i'm worrying about is my parents insurance.  I know what I did was stupid and a giant mistake, and i'm wondering if there is anything I can do to reduce the hit on our insurance, or get it cleared off the record.  I am very unfamiliar with all of this so any help is very appreciated.  I'm 18 for anyone wondering, thank you Reddit in advance!  I've talked to a friend who was in a similar situation, and he suggested pleading not guilty and going to court to apologize to the officer and such.  I'm not sure how much this will help but i'm willing to try anything to remedy this mistake.  There's not a class to take in the county, either so I can't do that.	Yes
237	This happened in Tualatin. I crossed the intersection as, according to the photo, the red light had been red for 0.17 seconds. I was going 43 mph in a 45 zone. There is a video online of the crossing, and two cars can be seen crossing the intersection immediately before me, although it was definitely yellow for them.  The presumptive fine is $260. Should i just go ahead and plead no contest at my court appearance and hope to get it cut down to $130? If I were going to plead not guilty, what sort of mitigating factors are admissible in this kind of case? The two main reasons I ran the red light were that I was driving directly into the sun at 11am and I didn't have my sunglasses, so my visor obstructed my view of the light. At the same time, because I was following the speed limit, I had two aggressive drivers jockeying to get around me, creating a stressful driving situation. It's one of those things like, shit, I should have been going 55 like them and I would have made it through the intersection legally. Any advice?	Yes
238	[TX] I was driving in the left lane of traffic on highway 361 preparing to pass another car that was 1000 feet in front of me, I realize that I might have gotten into the left lane a little early but they were going slow and we were the only people on the road. As I'm coming up on the car I see a black SUV sitting in the median facing the wrong way and I slow down kind of panicking that they're going to pull out in front of me. I do not change lanes because I'm watching the SUV to see if they pull out in front of me. As I pass the SUV they turn their lights on and I realize it was a cop, I was not speeding at any point. I get pulled over and issued a ticket for driving in the left lane, the cop will not listen to the fact that I was preparing to pass a car until I saw him facing the wrong way in traffic and slowed down. What are my chances of fighting this? It's a $500 ticket and as I wasn't impeding the flow of traffic I don't really see what I did to warrant a ticket. The law is so ambiguous, and there is not place (that I can tell) that tells you when you can officially get into the left lane to pass.    Also worth noting, I have a Conceal Carry License but I've never owned a gun or really had anything to do with guns. Got it because my boyfriend is in the military and wanted me to get a gun and I kinda forgot I had it. The cop ran my DL and saw that I have a CCL and came back screaming that he could arrest me for not giving him my CCL with my DL but when I took the class they told is that we're under no obligation to give the officer our CLL granted we do not have a gun on our person, which I most definitely did not. I would really like to file an official complaint for this because as far as I can tell, he's just making up law to suit himself but I want to be sure that this is correct before I raise hell at the police station.	Yes
239	So I just turned 18 on July 6th. But I got a speeding ticket a few weeks prior. Being underage, he took my license as insurance and gave me a court date of August 2. Now that I'm 18, can I still even be punished for a crime committed as a minor or am I pretty much showing up to be sent home right away? I'm pretty sure that not much will happen to me because he said I might get court ordered supervision or something but I don't even think that will happen. I live in Cook County Illinois by the way. Any help will be appreciated	Yes
240	"So for those of you who are familiar with Chicago, we have a large amount of speed enforcement cameras and red light cameras throughout the city. While driving down north clybourne, there were alot of young kids and adults jaywalking, causing me to brake suddenly twice in a one mile section.  I ended up only going 25 mph on a 30 mph because I feared it would happen again, and a speed enforcement camera ending up triggering on me  and the car behind me as we passed it and as I was going five under. Would it be possible for me to receive a citation do going too slowly, even given the circumstances? Is it possible the camera triggered due to two cars occupying it's ""zone"" at the same time? Would it be possible to contest the ticket in front of a hearing officer and using the testimony of my passenger? Sorry for what probably seems like a run of the mill post; I'm just afraid and annoyed that I might get ticketed for trying to be safe in an area they want to fine people to drive safely in."	Yes
241	I bought a 2015 Jeep and I don't think it's all I wanted. All I've done so far is just put down a deposit and signed a few papers and then they let me drive off with it to come back tomorrow for finalization. I don't think I want the car anymore though - I just feel it was too hasty. Can I return it? Im fine without getting the deposit back.	Yes
242	PREFACE - I am in Ohio. The I-70 incident occurred in Columbus, and the I-75 incident occurred in Cincinnati.  Ill start from the beginning to lay out all the facts. Thank you in advance for reading.  Feb '17 - I hit a large pothole in a construction zone on I-70, causing a sidewall bubble on my front right.  May '17 - I learn of ODOT claims, and filed a damage report. They defer me to the construction contractor who, for all intents and purposes, laughs at me. I am out +$100 for an alignment and now have a sidewall bubble.  July '17 - I hit another massive pothole on I-75 which blows my right front tire. I make it to a tire shop, and paid $618 for 2 new front tires and an alignment.  Today - I have filed another ODOT damage report, and attempted to file a claim but realized I was in over my head.  **I am looking for some advice on how to move forward. Here are my questions:**  What are my chances of repayment? This is the 2nd time in 2017 an ODOT liable interstate caused damage to my car.  What else can I do to accomplish repayment? Does this involve a claim?  Since my car did not need to be towed, and there was no police contact, there is little official documentation of the incident. Will they believe me?  I drive a performance car which has all wheel drive. This stipulates that all four tread depths must be similar. Now, my front 2 tires are new and my back two are 1 year old. I did not have the money to cover all 4 tires when replacing, so I did what I could. Since my car requires all four tires to have similar tread, is it reasonable to claim that the state pay for all four tires?  Thank you again for reading.	Yes
243	I've been working to get all holds on my license taken off. I was told I owed $1,300 to a county in Louisiana (I currently reside in Arizona). I paid the money, but realized the hold never came off my license. Turns out I have a seperate ticket in the City Court that has a bench warrant attached to it. They said I owe $710, must be paid in full (No payment options) or I can get my butt to the court where I will be jailed for 45 days as retribution to the ticket. I don't have 710 bucks and honestly I would do the time if i could get to Louisiana but that's not an option, either. Is there any other way I can go about getting on a payment plan or fines reduced?!? I just had to take out a damn loan for the first 1300 bucks and am paying on that, so another loan isn't really an option for me.	Yes
244	I am not from Virginia but I was pulled over while moving from Philadelphia to Atlanta. The officer said I was clocked at going 93 in a 70 zone so it was automatically a reckless driving charge and I had to appear in court. I didn't realize at the time but apparently Virginia is the worst place to get pulled over for speeding. This is my first offense, Ive never even gotten a ticket before. So my question is how do I prepare for this? Do I need to hire a lawyer? I do not have a lot of money but law offices have been sending me letters saying they could represent me. I looked online and apparently you can do jail time for this and I'm pretty young and don't want this to ruin my life. I tried to do some research but it seemed like a lot of lawyers trying to scare people into hiring them and it worked a little on me. Pretty much I have no idea what to do please help!	Yes
245	Yesterday I got a speeding ticket going back home to Central Arkansas from a trip to Bentonville with my girlfriend. My car was totalled in a flood a few weeks ago, so we took her car, and she wanted me to drive back home. The officer clocked me going 91 in a 70 (which I don't exactly believe I really don't think I exceeded anything more than 87ish). Im 18 years old. My court date is September 11th in London, Arkansas, but I will be in college at UofA and at the moment I have no transportation to the courthouse. Most importantly, I have not told my parents about the ticket yet. Is there any way that they will find out if I don't tell them? The officer said something about asking the judge about waiving a civil penalty and the ticket won't go on my record. I know this post is a mess and confusing, TL;DR: I'm an 18 year old who was pulled over for going 21 over in girlfriend's car, need to know approximately how much the ticket will be, if my parents will find out, any advice about how to be prepared for my court date and how to make the ticket not go on my record.	Yes
246	"This happened in Dallas. I got cited for out of date registration in Dallas Thursday of last week. I took my car to get it inspected on Friday and plan to get the registration handled today.   However this morning a DPD police officer gave me another citation for the out of date registration. I showed him the earlier citation from the same police department and showed him how I was doing my due diligence on getting the inspection done so that I could get it registered.   He did not care. He told me that he ""Had no choice but to cite me.""   Now I am looking at 2 23.50 dollar fees at the dallas municipal courthouse. Its a 20 dollar dismissal fee plus 3.50 for using a card.   Does this not fall under double jeopardy since this is the same PD for the same violation?"	Yes
247	At the beginning of June, I was in stop-and-go traffic and a woman in her car flagged me over to the side of the road. She claims I rear-ended her. I didn't think I did, and saw no evidence of damage to my car. I asked her if she wanted to file a police report, she said no. I gave her my information, never admitting fault, but not wanting to be accused of fleeing the scene of an accident. I let her take a picture of my insurance and my license, but it had my old address (I had literally just moved that day). I did not provide my new address or phone/email. When my insurance agency called, I disputed the claim and gave my version of events to the best of my ability. A few days later they called and said they were not claiming liability on the accident. Hooray, I thought I was done with this. Today, I received a letter from the state police. It has a driver Information Exchange and an Illinois Motorist Report enclosed, asking me to mail it to the department of transportation.  The reason that I'm worried is because, due to an issue with an emission test, my car's registration was expired on the date of the alleged collision. Because of that, I have a few outstanding tickets for registration violation that are currently sitting on seizure (they will boot me if they find the car). My car is currently parked in my garage until I can save enough to pay the tickets and re-register. I also have not yet reported my change of address to the DMV. I'm worried that this lady's meddling is going to get me in trouble with the DOT.  I know there's a lot there. What is my best course of action for responding to this letter? What can I do to strengthen my case that I did not collide with this woman's car? What actions should I take with the city to avoid getting an arrest warrant or something? Do I need to inform the DMV of my changed address immediately? Sorry to be so uninformed.	Yes
248	Hello guys! I have a good one for you today.   So my friends and I were driving M's golf cart around the neighborhood. We're all 16-17 and there's 3 of us total. So I drive into his driveway and drop them off because they wanted to get a ball from the house. T and M hop out and then I pull out of the driveway and a decent speed (5-10mph) and then as I was pulling out I realized that I should straighten out the wheel and BOOM! I hit my friend's uncle's truck.   I'm not asking for pity or anything I was stupid and by my own stupidity I hit the truck. I called him outside and we discussed the damage. He said he wanted to make it easy on me. At first he said it was fine but I kept insisting to pay him a lot of money. So as we were outside observing the damages he said that an estimate would be around $500-$750. My heart sank but I knew I had to pay it. I gave him my number, address, and email. He said he'd contact me after he went back to his home state (he was visiting from across the country)  The next morning I get a follow up from him (IRL) and he tells me the new estimate is $2700. I thought 500-750 was bad you could imagine how I felt about this. I held it all in and with a terrified voice I said alright.   I took some pictures of the damages and I don't see how on earth it could be $2700. The pictures included show the only damage caused to the truck. The reason why I'm here is to ask you guys on your opinion/estimate/what I should do. I'm fine with paying him but the new price tag makes me a little hesitant. I think what I'm going to do is let him go back to his home state, and get a couple of estimates on the car and send them back to me. I'm not sure what the car is.

249	"Hi guys.  I went to get my license changed to a new state (TN) and realized I had two outstanding tickets in Vienna, GA. One was for speeding (46/35) and the other for driving with an expired license.  I completely forgot about them because I was on a work trip, I had left my license with my laptop at the office I was working at and the guy said he couldn't find my new state license (KY) but that he would issue a ticket against my old GA license, which was expired, if I didn't go to the police station and present my ID before with left. I ended up getting called to a different location that night, and now, two years later, am having problems.  I know ""Get a lawyer"" will be the first advice, but I was wondering if I called down to the courthouse and asked about my options since I am out of state what might happen."	Yes
250	I was in a car accident and the other driver was at fault. The car was totaled and my insurance is paying ~$6,000 for it and I still owe ~$7,000. I have GAP insurance so that should cover the rest of what I owe, and the insurance said the other guy's insurance will cover the deductible. I have no help for getting a new car though, can I pursue having the other driver pay for the new car?	Yes
251	I was in a collision on my motorcycle a few weeks ago and the police report stated that the other party was at fault. My left index finger was broken and I needed surgery because there was a piece broken off in my middle joint. The surgery went well but i may not be able to fully flex or extend my left index finger for the rest of my life. Therein lies the main issue: I'm a professional musician and my surgeon says I may not be able to play again. I'll also have to take 6-8 weeks off of work due to my injuries. So with her being fully at fault, should I get a lawyer?	Yes
252	I have a pending suspension on my NJ license for misstatement of information to obtain a license; I applied for and received an NJ license but was not aware my license was already suspended in FL (my vehicle did not have insurance while it was waiting to get repoed). My move to NJ was sudden so I didn't prepare to have my mail forwarded to me, so I didn't find out about the suspension until later. I'm just now getting my FL license reinstated. I've spoken to a couple lawyers and I'm being told at least 750$, 1,000$ (currently unemployed full-time college student). What are the chances I can prove I didn't know my license was suspended in another state?	Yes
253	We hit each other on our back drivers sides.   It was a 20mph zone. And I was pulling out of a junction turning right.   The other driver came from the right and went around a parked car about 100 yards from the junction. Instead of returning back to his side of the road he continued the 100 yards to the junction on the wrong side of the road and we scraped each other. I had already pulled out.   He was speeding but I cannot prove this. So he did not stop in time.   He said he was continuing to drive on the other side of the road because there were cars parked further up the road and there's was no point pulling back in because 'everyone does it'.   Legally, I feel like I am at fault because I was pulling out of a junction, however he was 100% on the wrong side of the road. I didn't see him as I pulled out (creeping and peeping) because he appeared at the last second going maybe 40mph in a 20mph zone.   Who is at fault?   [A picture of the accident ](http://imgur.com/a/NrdxG) the back dots on the cars are where we scraped.	Yes
254	I just got a phone call from my girlfriend who is currently moving into her apartment with her mother in New York, all the information I have about the situation is through her and the accuracy may not be 100%. She received a phone call from her brother (16), who does not have his license, took their mother's car out on the highway, with multiple passengers, and caused a crash which totaled both his car and another.   From my understanding he is at fault, but all parties involved survived the accident, though I do not know the extent of any injuries.   What should they do? Would it be considered theft that he took the car without permission or supervision, with the owner halfway across the country? Depending on their insurance provider could their mother maintain her rates due to the accident being caused by someone not covered by insurance?  With a single mother putting one child through college and another going into his final year of high school, they don't have much money-mainly what is the best way to minimize financial damages? Thank you.	Yes
255	Title is pretty self-explanatory, I got into an accident, my rear bumper got ripped off 2 weeks ago and I just got a ticket in the mail for careless driving. The cop did NOT see the accident and the entire encounter was overall friendly. Now I know I can just talk to the prosecutor before court and have it knocked down to unsafe driving but that's a $400 fine that I'd rather not pay if I didn't have to. Since the cop didn't see the accident and the other driver isn't gona show up to court to testify against me if that were the case, so what are my options? Any advice would be greatly appreciated	Yes
256	Hi, I'm from San Diego. I began receiving tickets for expired registration for a vehicle that could not pass smog and that I could not fix so I sold it. I was just wondering, does releasing liability count as a correction or do I pay the full fine?	Yes
257	I got a speeding ticket that I did not deserve (there were circumstantial factors at play, not going to get into it) while passing by a small county in Colorado 3 hours from where I live. I would contest it but I don't want to make the drive and deal with going to court in general. I looked up the ticket number and it says it's not in the system. Today I finally got around to calling the court and they said there is no record of it anywhere and had me call the Denver DMV. The DMV said there is no record of the ticket at all; the lady thought that maybe I received a summons and I was past my court date (which would explain nothing showing up), but it's a speeding ticket with a court date set for 8/4 (I think). She told me to call the police station to look into it. Legally, am I supposed to call the police station? I spent a bunch of my time dealing with this and doing everything I can to pay it and I don't really think calling the police station and sorting out whatever paperwork is my responsibility. Is it? What happens if I don't do anything?	Yes
258	"So I was driving (using cruise control) which was set at 80mph when I got pulled over. Mind you this is a 70mph speed zone. So I understood the why I was pulled over.  But then he came at me accusing me of going 96 in a 70. So I told him to test his radar because it must not be accurate. He never tested it all he did was come back with a ticket.  So I'm reading over the ticket and he yanks it out of my hand while I'm reading it over and he says ""I don't have time for you to read over your ticket my shift is about to end. If you spent more time reading over the seed signs we wouldn't be in this problem"" so he yanks the ticket out of my hand rips me off my copy without me ever signing it. Walks away and drives off.   The ticket is for a summons in court. I doubt this will hold up in court. What do you guys/girls have to say on this matter."	Yes
259	I live in St. George, Utah, and got pulled over for speeding. The officer noticed that my airbags had been deployed (because of a crash in the past) and wrote me a citation for failure to repair airbags. I went in to the city building and learned that it would be 500$ for the citation and scheduled a meeting with the judge. The meeting ended up with another court date in August.  Is driving without airbags installed illegal? The citation page sounds like it only applies to a person repairing a vehicle and I was just driving, did the cop fuck me over with the wrong citation?  Citation link: https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title41/Chapter6a/41-6a-S1624.html	Yes
260	I just got caught going 108 in a 75 on a deserted highway in Colorado; just under the 40mph cutoff. I read that it carries a six point penalty on the license, which is fine, but being unfamiliar with the law in Colorado I was wondering if anyone knew what I could expect at my court date in Burlington; or if there is any way I can avoid traveling back to appear (I'm from the east coast). Are they typically lenient with out of state drivers? Is there anything specific I should say to the judge? Where I'm from the court will virtually always plea it down to something else. Is that how it works out here as well? Do I face jail time? I have some money, but not a lot, and the plane fare both ways is going to kill me this year.	Yes
261	I got a speeding ticket about a week ago in Florida. Not my county but next over. Its only $131 and I just want to pay it and get it done with. I called and the lady said give it a few days and told me to check again and I did and its still not there. They use a 3rd party ncourts for payments. They have no record nor the county clerks office! Don't they have to make it available for me to pay? What are my options here? Should I challenge it? I dont mind paying I just need it taken care off to not worry. What should I do, and the officer also did not mention anything about points on my licence, is was doing 79 in a 70. He followed me for 25 min through another county until I entered his just to nail me.	Yes
262	This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	Yes
263	So I'm from Missouri, and I went to Alaska for a couple years as a missionary for my church and had to get an Alaska driver's license (DL). Returned home, then went straight to school out of state without giving it a second thought (I mean, I probably actually look at the DL no more than once every 3 months)  My Alaska DL is going to expire in a couple of months, but I have no plans (or money for that matter) to return home just to get a new one, but I'm also not sure that I should get one in my school state, as I'll most likely only be here for another 8ish months.  I really don't like the idea of trying to live off of an expired license, so should I just get one here, even though I won't be here that long? Or is there a way to remotely get one from home (my research so far says no though)?	Yes
264	"I was on my way into work on the interstate when the car in front of my slammed on the breaks and I couldn't react fast enough and I slammed into the back of his truck leaving a hole in my front bumper and scratches to my hood but nothing to his car.   And as I know, rear ending is always the person in the backs fault but when we pulled off to check our cars that's when things got weird. When the other person got out of the car I realized he was a cop and before I could even say anything he said ""my cars fine"" and hopped back in his truck and sped off. Also, he had a trailer hitch in place and left a hole in my bumper and I believe it is illegal to have a trailer hitch if you aren't towing anything.   Do You think he was helping me by not taking my insurance? Should I call the police? Should I make a claim. Any advice would be awesome. I'm kinda shooken up cuz I'm younger and I've never been in this situation.   TL:DR Rear ended a cop, no damage to his truck because of tow hitch but my front bumper is messed up , cop left before I could even say anything. What should I do?"	Yes
265	Excuse my naive question...    My car was parked in front of my house when I was hit. I wasn't wearing a seatbelt so I got thrown around. The other driver and I went to the ER. Medically, I'm fine and will follow up with my primary doctor to be safe. My 2013 Civic was destroyed. Today I learned the driver doesn't have insurance. My question is how will she be punished for this? I know she will have to cover her own medical bills and her car is likely totaled as well, but I looked up her name in our state's database and it seems like she wasn't taken to jail or given a citation.   To clarify I have comprehensive/collision/underinsured/uninsured coverage.    My questions are as follows:  1. I will have to pay a $1000 deductible for everything to be covered by my insurance . Will I ever see that money again?  2. How does totaling a car without insurance impact someone's driving/legal record? In other words, how does driving recklessly without insurance impact people down the line?   3. Does it make any sense to sue the driver? I *currently* have no medical issues other than soreness...and my ER bills are being covered by my uninsured bodily injury coverage.   4. Any other general advice for this situation would be great. I'm so happy to be walking after such a bad wreck but I'm frustrated that it happened and would like to handle it properly.    Thanks!	Yes
266	I got a speeding ticket going 49 in a 40. I tried pay it a week ago through a link from my Clerk of Court's website (myfloridacounty.com) There was no citation found. I called my Clerk of Court and asked them why I wasn't able to pay it online. They couldn't find it in their system either. It's been about two and a half weeks and it still isn't there.  What does that mean? What should I do?	Yes
267	"So I moved into this apartment complex in Anaheim, CA in September and have been parking my car inside since then. This morning, my car was towed because the permit I received from the office was deemed ""invalid"". When I went to speak to the property manager he looked in his system and couldn't find anything about my car being registered to park there (or my roommates for that matter) and refused to believe that I've been parking there since I moved in. He even accused me of falsifying a parking permit. He then refused to have my car released from the towing company and told me there was nothing he could do. The very same day I moved in one of the other property managers made copies of my registration and drivers license and gave us the permits himself. But now since they can't find any proof about it, I get screwed over. What can I do to have them repay me for the tow? It's not fair for me to have to pay for their incompetence."	Yes
268	Hi reddit,   I recently sold a car to someone off craiglist for $700. I filed a report of sale a week later (after the 5 days).   Fast forward a month - two later, I get a call that my car was towed from being abandoned at a mcdonald's parking lot down in kent (i live in edmonds) but now the towing company says **I am liable** for the charges not the buyer of the car. **they are arguing that I filed the report of sale incorrectly**   The charges are up to $800 now including the parking fees at the towing lot.   How should I proceed? Is there a way to get out of this bill? I have proof of my report of sale.	Yes
269	I know this is small potatoes for all y'all, but I'm curious.   I got a parking ticket that I deserved by forgetting to move my truck off the street during street sweeper night. I attempted to pay it tonight, and both the online and phone methods of doing so say it's been dismissed and I owe nothing. No payment was ever made on the citation.  My 13 year old was looking at the printed ticket w me tonight and noticed that the cop indicated our vehicle was a Chevy (it's not) - but all other info on the ticket is correct. Is that enough to dismiss a parking ticket in Ramsey County? Everything I've read says it shouldn't be. Did I just get lucky? Thanks.	Yes
270	Background: Over the winter I was cited for going 45 in a 25 mph zone. I messed up my first court date and was a day late so I have already been found guilty of my citation. Afterwards I filed a summary appeal and tomorrow is my new court date. My biggest worry is not the fine itself but the 4 points that will be put on my driving record. I am looking for some help/pointers on what to expect for my trial tomorrow, how I should plead, what I should prepare to say to the judge and what steps I should take to get rid of or at least reduce the points in my license.   TD;LR - already found guilty of speeding ticket looking for help/pointers on the process and what to expect.	Yes
271	I'm a 21 y/o male from SD just for reference. So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through. Anything at all will help thanks.  (Also sorry for formatting and grammar issues I'm on mobile)	Yes
272	I’ve tried to find information about this online, but everything I’ve found assumes that I’m bringing a car with me.  I currently have a NC drivers license and a car with liability and collision insurance. However, when I move to Chicago I will not be bringing the car with me. I am going to have it put in my brother’s name and have him keep it for about a month to make sure I will not need it, at which point he has agreed to sell it for me.  My license doesn’t expire for another four years, and I don’t want it to expire. I want to have it transferred to Illinois when I move to Chicago and establish residency there, but I don’t know if I have to have a car or car insurance to transfer my license from NC to IL. I am planning on cancelling my car insurance before I go also, but I would like to be able to rent a car in the city whenever I need one, and am not sure if I have to have insurance before I can drive at all, even if I do not have a car.  So my question is, can I transfer my NC license to IL without a car or insurance?	Yes
273	I was on my way home from picking my girlfriend up from work about 3 weeks ago. It was just after 11 pm and I had a friend accompany me since we were hanging out anyways and we wanted to grab a bite to eat after. I pull up to a red left turn arrow and waited for it to turn green, the light proceeds to turn green (green, not flashing yellow, to be clear) so I accelerate to get onto the ramp that heads onto the freeway, halfway across the intersection I see headlights to my right side and half a second later an F350 with a pushbar is shearing through the front end of my car and I'm screaming what the fuck. The airbags did not deploy for whatever reason. I go into emergency mode and tell my passengers to get out of the car, and get to safety since my car was smoking and I didn't know if it would start on fire or not. The other driver (who's truck was totally fine) walked over and admitted fault, I proceeded to bitch at him for being a reckless fucking idiot who could have killed all 3 of us while also contacting police. So the cop shows up, takes mine and my passenger's statements, and goes to talk to the guy who had just gotten off the phone with his boss since it was a work truck. This was my first accident so I was totally caught off guard and didn't have much of an idea of what to do. I took pictures of my car and the intersection, and also took a picture of his license plate and insurance information. The past 3 weeks have been a jumble of phone calls and trying to figure out what the hell to do to get what's owed to me. Fast forward yesterday, I finally get a hold of their insurance agent amd she tells me she will send out an adjuster to estimate the damages and whatever else they do so here I am waiting until I get another call from their agent today. Apparently they are denying my claim due to insufficient evidence that it was their drivers fault. I've never been involved in anything like this and I have no idea where to start besides getting a hold of the police report. So I guess my question would be what the hell do I do now?  Sorry for the wall of text, not good at formatting on mobile.	Yes
274	An old man backed into my car today. When he got out of he vehicle it became clear he was high. I was able to get his insurance info, but he couldn't tell me his name or phone number due to slurred speech. When I said I was calling the police because he seemed intoxicated, he fled, almost hitting someone.   I called 911 and reported he was on the road that very moment and high, and then went and filed a police report.   I am not injured, though I had a wild panic attack on the phone with 911. What do I do now? I filed a claim with my insurance and I have the accident report I filed with the police. Do I need a lawyer, even though I'm unharmed? My car's bumper will need to be replaced, and I'd like this guy off the road so he doesn't do this again, potentially fatally.	Yes
275	So my wife and I took a weekend trip. The highway we took is one of the older highways that has a ton of little towns where speeds go from 65 down to 45 and back up again constantly. At one point there was a speed change that my wife didn't notice and she was also coasting down a hill doing 60-65 we aren't sure in a 45. The cop stops us an writes her a ticket for 70 in a 45. My wife is also in the process of getting a job where a clean driving record is a must. Is there any recourse we can take to ensure this doesn't make it to her record? She got the ticket this weekend and after months of back forth with a company she got the job offer today. It's her only ticket and no prior warnings either. The state is arkansas.	Yes
276	"Hello all,  I read the FAQs and still had a brief question. As the title states, I'm a Wisconsin driver that got a speeding ticket in Georgia.   The ticket is for 20 over the posted limit on an interstate, which qualifies for the ""Super Speeder"" classification in GA, according to the cop. I was not driving a vehicle that I own. I've already learned my lesson and am prepared to deal with the consequences. I have 3 main questions here:  -WI DMV site says ""No points are assessed for convictions from other states, however, the conviction is entered on the Wisconsin driver record."" I already know about the DLC and NRVC (both of which WI is not a part of), but can anyone put into simple terms what this means, mainly in reference to insurance? If it means that my insurance may be able to see this and raise the rates, it may be something that I want to work to get reduced.  -When I go to the website listed to pay and enter the information, I can see the fee. However, it says nothing about the ""Super Speeder"" fee of [I read $200, but that could be incorrect]. It's not really clear whether the additional fee is something that I'll hear about after the fact, or if that's included. Can anyone clarify that by chance?  -Has anyone else from WI gotten an out of state speeding ticket that can comment on whether it was/wasn't worth taking time off from work to go to court in hopes of getting the charge reduced?  I'm leaning towards just paying everything and being done with it, but I want to be sure I'm not setting myself up for other consequences further down the line by doing so. Any *advice* is appreciated, and I fully understand that I am only seeking advice.  Thanks!"	Yes
277	*DISCLAIMER* I did not hit/run over/injure anyone. No accident occurred. This post is purely out of curiosity.   Tonight I was driving on a very busy highway in my town. I was going about 5 under the speed limit, but some homeless guy was on the grass median and then walked in the middle of the highway as I was going 60 MPH. Luckily I noticed him from about a mile away so I was already slowing down, I was going about 35 MPH when I honked at him and skidded to a stop. I was probably 10 feet away from him when I stopped. I was not under the influence of any substance. The sun was still out.   Let's say I didn't see him/couldn't slow down enough in time and hit him. Would I be liable? I have full coverage insurance and have no instances on my driving record. I was pretty shook up about almost hitting him. I keep thinking about what would have happened if I injured or even killed him.   Once again, nothing happened (thankfully), I am just wondering how this kind of thing usually goes down.  Thanks for the input.	Yes
278	I cut my finger good enough with a workplace appliance to have to go to an urgent Care facility. Got a tetanus shot and some stitches. Workers comp seems to be the way to go, but I am fairly confident I will test positive for marijuana if drug tested. Does this have potential to impact my workers comp? Seems completely unrelated...	No
279	I live in Iowa.   Relevant information:  In March of 2016 I move into a house for rent and put 950$ down for a deposit, 200$ nonrefundable pet deposit and I sign a paper to say he can automatically withdrawal 950$ on the 1st of the month.  There was no washer and drier in the place when I moved in, so I knew I would have to provide my own. When I signed the documents, I was also finalizing a divorce.  I signed all the documents (first name) (married name)-(maiden name).  I told him once the divorce was finalized I was to go by my maiden name.    January of 2017 I tell my landlord I'm looking for a house to buy and I've had no issues with him or the place, and would keep him up to date on my hunt.   I get a house, approved and signed in like 2 weeks. It happened way faster than expected.  But I couldn't pass this deal up.  I love my house.  But, there's a crossover month of rent and mortgage payment.    I asked Landlord if he would consider letting me out of the lease early and he wholeheartedly agreed over the phone.  He stopped the recurring 950$ payment and I was not charged for my final month. I moved out February 27th when we had our final walk through.   He didn't find much to fix up, basic paint and small scratches from my dogs.  Nothing major.  He said he would take off the carpet cleaning from the deposit and any other cleaning things.  Totally reasonable.   We also had an agreement that I would leave my washer and drier there and he would buy them from me for 100$ total.  I just didn't want to deal with them.  They were working when I left in February.   All is good in the hood as of Feb 27th. We shake hands and walk away.    In April (I have the texts)- I ask him when I would receive my security deposit check. He tells me over text that it was returned via post office and he was out of the country.  Once he gets back on May 6th, he would reach out.   He never did.   I call again on May 15th.  He picks up and we have a phone conversation in which he apologizes and says he'll talk to his wife (the bookkeeper) and he will get back to me asap.   On June 1st I text again asking what's going on.  No reply.   On June 5th I call and no reply.   3 voicemails, 6 texts and I'm fed up.  I call my uncle who is a lawyer in Pennsylvania and ask him to send a letter. Im very aware he can't do shit in my state, but maybe it'll get the ball rolling.    Out of no where I get a certified letter that's dated July 3rd, I just get notice of on July 29th. I go pick it up on July 31st and it's a letter from my landlord letting me know he is not going to give me the 100$ for the washer and drier because in April the new tenants tried using it and they were broken.  The receipt for the service provider was dated 4/4/2017, a full month after I had left the premises.   I just received my second certified letter, this morning, dated August 3rd stating that in order to get my security deposit check I need to:  -meet him in a public place -sign a document that the original envelope is unopened (dated 4/6/2017) that was returned to him  -I will sign a cease and desist document - I will acknowledge that I received the certified letter dated July 3rd about the washer and drier.    More relevant information:  -the original check envelope is addressed to (first name) (married name). This hasn't been my name for about a year at this point. This is why it wasn't forwarded to me in the first place, but I texted and left my forwarding address to him  -the way I understand the Iowa law, he has to send me information regarding the check (and receipts) within 30 days.  According to the original check date, he was past that date.  (I moved out February 27th, the certified letter was April 6th)   Should I just take him to court for the 1050$ or go meet him in person and drop it?  What should I do?  It's 85$ to file which I think I can tack it on... should I also include interest?  He never attempted to resend the letter even after telling me over the phone he would... 3 months ago.   It's kinda bullshit that I left my washer and drier there (and they were working) and he gets to decide after a month of having them that they don't work so he doesn't pay me?   That doesn't make sense or sound legal at all.	No
280	We married in 2016. She has about $50k in student debt. She has family about an hour, hour and a halfish from her school, where she also works part-time. We have split rent about 75%:25% since we moved in together.	No
281	So my wife and I just had our second child yesterday and now because my wife told our doctor that she had used marijuana throughout her pregnancy they want a social worker to talk to us. The baby was full term and she is healthy as can be. I would just like to know what my rights our in this situation. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you in advance.	No
282	So I was an idiot and signed a year's apartment lease without noticing that there was a notice that the building is being converted to condominiums at an unspecified date, and that we can be obligated to leave because of this. My roommate saw this and won't sign, and neither will her co-signer. Am I still held to this lease and responsible for covering all of the rent? The contract does not allow subletters. In the event that we can leave, are we entitled our security deposit back?  Los Angeles people, does this kind of notice to convert and remodel generally mean that demolition would occur during my lease?	No
283	I'm a part of the alumni board of my old Fraternity.  Recently, we've had one of the kids break in a couple of interior doors after imbibing a little too much.  Regardless to say, he's being a little s*** about it, and we're having difficulty collecting money for the damages, even though we feel pretty good about the evidence we have against him.  We've gotten to the point where we've gave him one last opportunity to pay, and now the question is whether to take him to collections or to small claims court.  The first door he broke was when he was still a tenant at the house, and there are clauses in the lease regarding damaging property.  The second door was a couple months after he graduated, and after his lease was up.  One other issue is that the guy now lives out of state.  I forget the final cost of the repairs, but we're only asking for $600, which is less than the total.  While we still want the money, we're really at the point right now where we want to set a precedent, and we don't want him to get away with it.  With all this said, what's the best course of action: small claims court or collections?	No
284	"I live in King County, WA and have been casually informed that a part of my property will need to be taken for a large public project.  Fortunately, it is the part of my property furthest from my house. I have yet to be officially notified (have spoken with a ""Community Outreach Specialist"") nor have I received the final area of land that will be taken.   &amp;nbsp; I have two questions:   1) I am currently improving the general area that will be taken.  Some landscaping, some plants, etc.  At any point will I have a duty to stop improving my property that may/will be taken away?   2) I bought the house in late 2014.  I was recently informed by a neighbor that they were initially contacted in 2008 about this project and the potential for eminent domain. Should the owner at that time (who sold the house in 2011) have notified the previous owner, who could have notified me?"	No

288	Throwaway for obvious reasons.  So, I've been living with my boyfriend for about 3 months. I have a room here, my stuff is here, everyone knows I live here. I receive some mail too.   I am not on the lease. He rents from a couple. I also do not pay rent. I have not changed my address on my ID just yet because we've been having trouble lately and I pretty much assumed it would end in a breakup, which it basically has.  I'm wondering what he can do if we breakup. Can he force me to leave his home tonight? If he calls the police on me and I have done nothing violent, can they arrest me?  Can he legally lock me out of the house and refuse to give me my things back?  What if he destroys my things?   I'm so paranoid. I'm waiting for him to go to work so I can move my things out without him here, but until then I would like to know my rights.  Thank you in advance.	No
289	Stockton - California (USA)  Let me just get to the core of the situation. My friend and her husband are sharing an apartment with her husbands Mother and Sister. All costs are 50/50. Mother wants to move out with daughter so she went to turn in a thirty day notice with her (mom's) name and daughters name. She was told the notice wasn't valid unless all names are on the notice, so she promptly put the names of my friend and her husband without their consent on the notice. Now the leasing office is refusing to listen them about how the signatures were put on the notice without consent. The leasing office is now refusing to allow my friend and her husband to bring on another qualified tenant to help pay for the apartment even though they wish to resign a lease. What legal actions does my friend and her husband have since the process that started this was void to begin with? The leasing office is refusing their complaints. My guess is because it is due to rent control and by releasing to new tenants they can raise the price.	No
290	Our original move in date was August 4. We signed a lease for this. The lease was then voided and we resigned the most current lease to move in on August 1. We went in this morning to get our keys and discussed the money that was due. We wrote them a check for the money due and started moving in. Now they are emailing us and saying that what they accidentally charged us was the prorated rate as if we moved in on August 4, and that we owe them a little over $100 to cover August 1 to August 4. Are we responsible for their accounting error? Thanks!	No
291	Hi Everyone,  I'm looking for some advice because I am a first time home buyer and don't fully understand if I have any chance getting some help from the seller. We purchased a home six months ago and have made many repairs and upgrades based on the feedback from the home inspection. However, the home inspection did not uncover a few major issues.   Pool- large in ground pool in the back yard. We were unable to get the pool inspected before closing because it was covered for winter. We found out that the pool was not properly winterized when we attempted to open it and had to pay about $1500 for a new motor and pump. We were able to use the pool for a month before we started leaking water. Cost of new liner and new inground stairs lowest quote we received was $6250.   Roof- leaking from around a sewer gas outlet pipe caused wood rot in a section of the roof. From the inside of the attic we can see shingles in the area. This wasn't caught on the home inspection because the damage was behind a plastic sheet vent stapled to the inside of the roof. The skylight is also leaking due to flashing issues. Quoted estimate for repair $2600.   As I mentioned, these were not caught during the home inspection and the seller did not mention them on the seller disclosure. The seller had not been living in the house for the past 8 years; rented it to a family member.   Is there any possibility that we can work with the seller to help with these repairs or are we on our own? I was thinking about sending them an email explaining this but I am hesitant that I could say something that could ruin our chances in court (if that's even an option).  Thank you in advance!	No
292	I will keep this short.  I am currently enrolled in a summer program at a private university in Vermont. I was recently injured, and the university offered me housing in a different area of the same building to accommodate for this. While I am grateful for the offer, the university has refused my request to inspect the room prior to making my decision. Are they not required to do so? Many thanks!	No
293	Dear Reddit,  I really need your help!  A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.  Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.  I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.  How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?  How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?  And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?  Tbh, I've been really scared of this day. I've been trying to avoid even talking about it but the 2-year limit is ending. I really do need you guys' advices.  Sincerely,	No
294	Location - Car hit Rock in Nevada we live in CT.  We rented an SUV for our road trip. We are hikers and were driving down a dirt road from a trail with our rental. While going down a small hill, our breaks seized up and we ended up hitting a backpack sized rock. There is minor damage to the bumper and the skid plate came off.  The AC also no longer works.  Other than that the car seems fine. The car is driveable and does not seem to have any large problems. Since we did not have cell phone service there and the car was driveable, we drove it to our hotel a few hours away.     Now wondering how to approach reporting the damage and to protect ouselves. We have not contacted our insurance company or the rental car company yet. Should we contact a lawyer? We also have rental protection via a credit card company. Our concern is that we were on an unpaved road, so we want to make sure we handle this properly.	No
295	The estate has plenty of assets to cover all debts so that is not the issue. Am I okay as executor to cover the post-funeral dinner for the relatives of the deceased from the assets. It will probably be $1000 out of an estate of $4m.	No
296	I have been assisting a family member (the respondent) with a separtation. I have all correspondence and pleadings to date. Some letters and emails are between the respondent and the applicant's lawyer. Some are between the respondent (or myself) and the respondent's lawyer. Legally, can I make these letters, emails, and forms public online? The application, answer, reply, affidavits, and financial statements are part of a continuing record that is already a public record, is it not? And I have the respondent's (since all of this information was mailed or emailed to him or myself) permission to do so. We are hoping to change lawyers. Until we find a lawyer who is a better fit, I thought that by sharing all of this information online, anyone who has the time can read the information and offer advise. I thought there may be legal professionals who are retired, or suffer from insomnia :), who may be interested in helping. That is my reason for wanting to make this information public.	No
297	"I moved into my first apartment with two roommates in October 2015. We moved out June 30th, and today I received a letter from the apartment saying we owe $1000 for ""carpet repair."" I have pictures of the carpet and they are in fine condition. The apartments also claim our security deposit was $300, which I know was actually $1101, however I don't have anything to prove it.   Is this worth fighting? Should I take it to small claims court? Help!"	No
298	As a naive recent college graduate, I came upon an opportunity to work on a side project for a small business owner. We agreed that it would be a side project and I had to get permission from my full-time boss before I could take the project on (proactively avoid any conflict of interests situation).          My boss said he thought it wasn't the best idea because he didn't want my focus being pulled away from any client I would be working for at my full time job, but ultimately was okay with me doing the side project (with the caveat of no phone calls for side project while at a client site, and my full time job always comes first). I communicated this situation to the small business owner and he was okay with the situation.         Long story short, I completely underestimated the project (right out of college, estimation abilities weren't based on reality) and had to enlist the help of 3 other acquaintances to help. We all were working on the project on and off for over a year and there was still some minor development work to be completed plus user testing/bug fixes at the time of him deciding to call off the project.         Over the course of the year he paid me two payments of equal amount and he paid me as a 1099 employee (the second payment only for the sake of being able to include it in his 2016 taxes). From the first payment I used almost all of it to pay 3 work friends for their help. Almost half of the second payment ended up going towards paying my own taxes from the 1099 income.         At the end of 2016/beginning of  2017 his business took a huge hit after losing a major client, and he had to downsize to the point where he might be quitting altogether/finding some other opportunity. In the stress of his business falling apart all of the sudden, he burned a lot of bridges and took a lot of his stresses out on others. During this time he told me that we were going to have to scrap the project because he no longer really had a use for it.         Now, about a month later, he calls me and basically says that he doesn't have a finished product to show for his money and he wants it all back, even if we have to come up with a monthly payment plan. I brought up my time and energy spent on the project and he basically told me that my time doesn't matter, I was supposed to give him this product and I didn't so I owe him everything back. I even told him how half what he paid me had gone to outside help for his project, a large portion to taxes, and I only had a small portion left to show for my own efforts and time; to which he basically replied that that was on me and that my time and efforts are worthless and that if I didn't pay him back he would have no choice but to get his lawyer(s) involved.   So, r/legaladvice, am I pretty much screwed in this situation, or would I even stand any kind of chance in court? He decided to give up on the project and he paid me as a 1099 employee, does that matter in this kind of scenario? I know he is trying to recoup from losses in his business, but just because my efforts are less tangible in his mind (lines of code), it shouldn't discredit my hundreds of hours of effort.  Any help or advice would be appreciated!	No
299	I was cleaning out room and came across a written check from my employer that is over a year old. I know there is typically a 6-month period in which checks need to be cashed but my boss is giving me a hard time about getting a new check reissued. Are they legally allowed to refuse to rewrite a check that wasn't cashed after a set amount of time? Trying to make sure I am not getting screwed here. This is taking place in NJ if that has any bearing on the matter.	No
300	About a month ago our landlord moved an ex felon in the upstairs apartment from us. Since then we have made numerous noise complaints and the police have been out five times. There are def undercover cops watching the house now.  Our landlord told this big dude that we can call the cops whenever we want. We have sent him a text saying he made the place unsafe for us and are moving out. He told my wife that he is going to sue for the remaining rent owed (like 4 months)  Does he have a case at all?	No
301	"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	No
302	"My big brother has been chronically homeless and unemployed due to severe alcohol and drug addiction for many years. He was recently diagnosed with a serious condition that is unrelated to his substance abuse. He has also been diagnosed with depression and PTSD, and CTE stemming from a tragic car crash he survived as a teenager as well as sports related head injuries.  He has lived in a series of charitable homes and mental hospitals in Maryland in recent years. He recently got the first of a 3 part surgery, where they knicked an artery and had to operate on him a second  time. The botched surgery has caused further complications that have made him very sick.   He was approved for disability shortly before that, and was owed a bunch of retro disability. He assigned a ""payee"" who has access to the account and the money. He trusts this person not to run off with his money. He was afraid he'd binge on alcohol and drugs with all of the money.  He is constantly having to move from one facility to another because either he relapses or they have strict rules about leaving, but he will have to leave for follow up appointments at the hospital.   My family and I have made a ""no enabling"" policy in the last ten years, but I feel my brother's issues have gone so far beyond his addictions. I believe he is slipping further into mental illness from years of drug use and doctors seemingly using him as a guinea pig. He has had every anti depressant and anti anxiety med under the sun as well as ect (brain shock therapy) treatments.   His recent surgery complications have weakened and endangered him greatly. One more relapse could be the literal nail in the coffin, and I'm wondering if leaving him to his own devices isn't actually the correct approach anymore.   I have been considering trying to convince him to make me his payee and move him back home to NJ. I also wonder if I should get medical power of attorney, and all that that entails: ie, Would it allow me to admit him to drug rehabs or make medical decisions on his behalf, things like that. I think it would be better for him to live near his relatives and not bad neighborhoods in Baltimore, so even if he does relapse, we can be in the know about his whereabouts and condition, and he could have his housing funded so he wouldn't be living with us, but nearby. I also don't know if he could continue to get disability benefits in NJ based on meeting the requirements in MD.   If anyone can at least steer me toward some resources, even if you don't know of something I could work out, I'd greatly appreciate it."	No
303	According to our lease, our ex landlord was supposed to bill us each month for water for 2/7 of the bill for the entire house(it was a duplex and were supposed to be billed for number of people in our unit vs total number of people in the house). Not once did he send a bill to us for the entire year despite our numerous documented requests for the water bill. Our lease has been up for two months now and our ex landlord is now saying he will keep the deposit and will settle the balance for the water with that, and will send us the remainder or bill us for the amount still owed depending on how much the water bill comes to. My SO and I do not trust him at all to bill us the correct amount and want him to send us the deposit that we are owed in full, and then bill us for the water, so we are going to send a debt validation letter to him via certified mail using a template we found online. Will this be enough to cover our asses in small claims court if he does not send verification of our water bill and/or does not return our deposit? What else should we be doing?	No
304	"Specific location is Santa Monica, which has incredibly tight rent control and thus tenant rights. I've been in contact with the city attorney's office and the rent control board but all they can tell me is to file a complaint with them and see where it goes.   I am also already seeking counsel but am unsure what I can justify paying for a relatively small issue.   It is a three bedroom unit with three of us residing. One of my roommates and I have been in the complex since January in a 2br and switched to a 3br in March. The girl who joined us has been seeing a therapist for a while and was prescribed an emotional support animal. She chose a wonderful Doberman named Athena who moved in with us a little over a month ago. Due to her prescribed disability and an aggressive confrontation by the landlord (he attempted to enter the unit when he found out, then yelled at my roommate and threatened eviction) she was unable to communicate with them about Athena so I became the go between.   The courtyard of our building has three cabinets under the staircases. When I moved in one was in use by a tenant (locked) and the other two were abandoned, stuffed full of junk. I started cleaning out the two abandoned ones. I found files in them which indicate they had been in use by tenants for at least 20 years.   The tenant using the third cabinet moved out and relinquished it to me as I was moving into his unit (the 2 -&gt; 3br switch). At this point it was March and I had locks on all three cabinets. It had been a lot of work to empty and clean them - even the one I inherited had been essentially abandoned, he told me to keep or toss what he had left (which was all junk).   I didn't want to be greedy and started offering cabinets to my neighbors. None of them took me up on it, except for one lady who liked to maintain plants in the courtyard. Once I convinced her I really did want her to have it she put her gardening stuff in there. Soon after one of my other neighbors who I share a garage with realized she wanted some space, and one of the other neighbors put a little in there. I gave the remaining cabinet to my roommates and kept one for myself.   The cabinet I gave to my neighbors had a faulty hinge (old, rusting off) and the latch couldn't set unless you really struggled to lift it. I put in the time, materials and work to replace the door and hinges. Theirs and my roommates could only use a padlock (door is just a plywood sheet), I drilled out mine (proper door) and installed a deadbolt.   Yesterday my landlord left a note on the courtyard gate saying to vacate the cabinets. I called this morning and they seemed surprised to find out that other units besides mine used the cabinets. While I was listing who used which cabinet he said that I ""went into that one with the deadbolt a lot"" - clearly, they thought taking these away would hurt me. When I asked why they needed them back the property manager said to ask the property owner. When I asked the property owner they said to ask the manager. When I pressed them they said the common area was theirs and maintenance might need it. However I had already asked the maintenance guys and they said they had no knowledge or need of it. Plus, they've been in tenant use for at least 20 years.   So my landlord is trying to take away these cabinets because of the emotional support animal. What can I do?"	No
305	TLDR is, degree, terrible job, want to change my life in any way I can. It's incredibly depressing, and I want to know what are my options. I heard conflicting things:  * it's easy/hard to get tuition paid on unemployment  * you have to be a minority they recognize  * you actually have to be on unemployment for &gt;24wks before they even consider helping you, which seems incredibly counter-productive  * even if you get it, you're not getting essentials covered by UI, just tuition  Help me /r/legaladvice you're my only hope. As I'm too broke to do much else. Thanks for reading	No
306	Was recently attacked by two dogs who broke through a door while walking in my subdivision; total of 12 stitches to my upper right arm.  Report was filled with the police and animal control and the owner is being investigated. Dogs are still in the home.   I contacted my HOA president and suggested she notify the neighborhood residents of two dogs and the attack; especially since they broke down the front door to get after me. She stated that she will not notify the residents, for fear of being sued if she mentions his address. Rather send an email out reminding people of our HOA rules. Everyday since the attack, I watch families and children walk in front of the same house and cringe thinking it will happen again. Should my HOA notify the residents? Can they be sued for mentioning his address even though the police report will be public knowledge? Unfortunately I have a feeling that the HOA president knows this dog owner and that is playing a part in her decision.	No
307	Hi there.   Im leaving my apartment 2 months before the end of my lease and I have found someone else to take it over. If I had stayed my rent would have gone up 1.5% meaning for me it would have been an increase from 1260 to 1278. My question is would this still apply to the new tenant if they take over my lease or can the apartment management give him a totally arbitrary number for rent? He wants to sign for a full year but Im not sure whether he would be paying my protected price of 1278 after september or some higher number that the company would like to give.	No
308	Basically we all had a student flat over the year. Towards the second half of a year one of our flatmates were starting to struggle towards rent and fell behind about £600+. In response to this our landlord has taken our deposits (held with a 3rd party) until it's paid however from speaking to him over facebook, it seems clear that paying off his debt is not a priority for him and that we will most likely not be seeing our deposit money.  I was wondering if there is any grounds for a small claims court over our deposit (if we don't get our deposit back)back because of this person (our landlord has confirmed this to us) refusing to pay off his remaining debt.	No
309	Are knives equipped with SpeedSafe® Assisted Opening by Kershaw legal in California?  I know that laws in California are fairly restrictive when it comes to knives, so I always stick to small everyday carry knives that you can only open using 2 hands. Recently I came across this one being sold in walmart in California: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kershaw-Blur-S30V-Steel-Stonewashed-Knife/21980329, I was fairly surprised, given that it has some sort of assisted opening. I later asked few friends of mine from the police department, but I would also like to know the opinion of the lawyers. More about the technology is here: https://kershaw.kaiusaltd.com/technology  My question is specifically about this knife model, so I will appreciate if people only comment if they have specific knowledge or experience.  P.S. I don't know if mentioning a specific brand or retailer is a violation of the rules here, but I am not affiliated to any of them and not trying to promote or otherwise affect brand visibility.

311	Hello there, so for some time now I have been aware that my older brother (28) has opened up credit card accounts in my name using my social security number. I'm not sure how he could have done that, but in the past he had forged my dad's signature and spent $20k on a credit card opened up in my dad's name. I am 24 years old and live with my parents and occasionally I check my credit report because of student loans. I made an account with credit karma before my brother started the fraud, so that is really the only proof of my own identity. Great Lakes Student Borrower services doesn't even use my name tied with my social security, it is my brother's name now.   I tried confronting him about this two years ago and he has accused me of being on drugs and denied it all. I am pretty much 100 percent sure he is committing fraud against me, and the closer I get to finishing school and thinking about living on my own, the more I realize how screwed I am because of this identity fraud. I am a resident of the State of Wisconsin, my brother is now living in the State of Hawaii and I am suspect that he has also taken out a mortgage using my identity as well, any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
312	"Hey, r/legaladvice. First time posting here, thanks in advance for responses and sorry in advance if I'm breaking rules.   My problem is outlined below. My question really boils down to, what can I do about this?  Begin  *****  A couple of my friends have birthdays around the same time and decided that, to celebrate, we should get a group together and go on a sweet looking 90s booze cruise. Tickets were ~$65 and about 15 of us bought ticket, likely in addition to others. I will call the event company that was putting on the cruise EC for short and anonymity. EC sold the tickets through a separate company I will call TC for ticket company. The cruise was scheduled for the night of May 19th, and we bought tickets at least a week in advance. I personally bought 2 tickets.  The day of May 19th comes. It is hours before the planned starting time of the cruise, and I receive the following e-mail from TC on behalf of EC:  &gt; San Diego, &gt; &gt;We are having to postpone tonight's event due to a cancellation of the artist we had planned for you all tonight. we are sorry for the inconvenience. The new date will be on Saturday, July 29. Everyone's tickets for todays event will give you entry to July's event. If you have any questions or concerns or want to inquire about a refund then please contact us at [e-mail address for EC] &gt; &gt;Thank You  I immediately requested a refund, as did many of my friends. On May 21st, I received the following message (again from TC on behalf of 90s EC):  &gt;San Diego, &gt; &gt;People who requested refunds we have received your emails and please allow 5-7 business days to see it back in your account. &gt; &gt;Cheers!  I never got the refund, and most of my friends did not (though one did, strangely). On June 15th I contacted TC support saying:  &gt;Hello, &gt; &gt;I purchased tickets to the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for Friday, May 19th 2017. The day of the event of the cruise an e-mail was sent out informing me and the other customers the cruise was cancelled due to an artist cancellation and will be rescheduled. I requested a refund and was told via a mass e-mail that all refunds would be credited with 5-7 business days. It has been much longer than this time and a refund has not been credited. Friends of mine corroborate this. &gt; &gt;Promptly refund all tickets. Personally, I purchased two and should see a refund in the amount of $131.66 &gt; &gt;[My Name]  TC responded saying:  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;Thanks for reaching out. &gt; &gt;Funds from ticket sales are held for 48 hours after the end of an event to allow time for buyers to dispute the charges. After 48 hours, the funds are paid out to the organizer and any refund requests must be processed by them outside of Universe. Although the organizers seem to have promised refunds, they did not issue those refunds at that time, nor did they reach out to us to issue them on their behalf. &gt; &gt;We have reached out to the organizers of this event to attempt to come to a reasonable solution to issue refunds on the event that was re-scheduled, however, they have not cooperated. Unfortunately as Universe no longer holds the funds for this event, all refund requests must be directed to the organizers of the event who can issue refunds at their discretion. They can be reached at [EC email address] &gt; &gt;We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. &gt; &gt;Cheers, &gt;[EC name] Support  I responded to Universe saying:  &gt;Thank you for the info. Can you please send more contact info for the event managers? Phone number, company name, persons involved, etc.?  I also forwarded my exchange with TC to the contact email for EC and said the following, which they did not respond to:  &gt;Hi [EC name], &gt; &gt;Please see the message below regarding the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for, and canceled, last May. (Insert exchange with TC here) &gt; &gt;I am wondering why refunds have not been credited as promised? Please refund the tickets. &gt; &gt;Thank you,  I then sent TC this email before receiving a reply from my previous e mail:  &gt;Additionally, your service rules make the following points that sellers cannot (taken verbatim from contract on TC website): &gt; &gt;(7) offer, as a Seller, any items that you do not yourself own or have permission to rent (without limiting the foregoing, you will not list items as a Seller if you are serving in the capacity of a broker, rental agent or listing agent for a third party); &gt; &gt;(10) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with any person or entity; &gt; &gt;(13) as a Seller, submit any Listing with a false or misleading price information, or submit any Listing with a price, service or activity that you do not intend to honor. &gt; &gt;These terms are in question of being violated based on the way 90s booze cruise handled the event. There is no evidence they had owned or had permission to rent the service they offered. The fact that they canceled the event hours before the time is highly suspicious and suggestive that they never intended to honor their service. If either of the above is true, it follows that they misrepresented themselves and their affiliation with artists and vendors. &gt; &gt;I trust there will be proper due diligence with regards to these potential breaches of contract and that appropriate legal action will be taken if necessary. &gt; &gt;Please inform me how you plan to proceed.  I received no reply to this as well.  I disputed my charge for the tickets through my credit card and was promptly refunded. While my desire for justice was left unserved, and some of my friends never got their money back, I got my mine back and decided to put the matter to rest. However, I was surprised to get the following e-mail from TC this morning (July 17):  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;We are writing regarding the dispute for $130.00 USD charge to your card ending in XXXX on Monday, July 17, 2017. &gt; &gt;The charge was for 2 tickets to the 90s Booze Cruise- San Diego event. &gt; &gt;The organizer of this event, EC, uses TC to sell their tickets. The event took place on Friday, May 19, 2017. We have attached your tickets and receipt here. &gt; &gt;Please call the number on the back of your card to let your bank know that you understand what this charge is for and reply to let us know when you have done so. &gt; &gt;Best Regards, &gt; &gt;TC Support  I responded with the following lengthy message. My response includes a consolidation of all the communication between myself and Universe, so I have not included that since it has already been posted above. My response:  &gt;Dear TC, &gt; &gt;You are mistaken. &gt; &gt;This event did **not** take place on May 19, 2017. This event was **planned** for that day, however, it was canceled only hours before it was **planned** to start. &gt; &gt;*(Here I copy and paste the messages from Universe regarding the event being cancelled and then the promise to refund tickets).* &gt; &gt;I never received the promised refund, so I followed up with TC support to obtain it as it was promised. This exchange between myself and Universe can be summarized as follows: &gt; &gt;*I asked TC for a refund due to the cancellation and unfulfilled promise for a refund; &gt;*I was told funds were released to 90sbooze cruise and I had to ask them directly; &gt;*I attempted to contact EC and received no reply; &gt;*I provided evidence to TC that EC breached their contract with Universe on multiple grounds and *requested legal action be taken to hold them accountable for what appears to be a scam. This final request received no response from Universe. &gt; &gt;**Here is the full exchange** *(copy/paste of full exchange between myself and TC here)* &gt; &gt;**(end exchange)** &gt; &gt;Now that I have cleared up the apparent lack of communication between departments in your company, I'm sure you understand why I disputed the charge and that I will not be calling my bank. I have already explained to them this situation and they readily agreed to reverse the charge, standard practice when a purchased service has been grossly misrepresented and not rendered.  &gt; &gt;So rather than *me* call *my* bank and explain what the charge is for (I know what the charge is for better than you do, apparently), I suggest *you* call 90s booze cruise and explain to them that the contract they signed with *you* has been violated and that they need to issue refunds to **everyone** who asked for one. If they don't, then *you* should contact your lawyer (or acquire one if you do not have one) since your contract has been broken.   As all evidence points to this ""event"" being a pre-conceived scam, taking the above actions will show that you are not a co-conspirator with 90s booze cruise in what amounts to false marketing and, quite frankly, stealing. Failing to take action (as you did on my last request) shows you are either woefully incompetent, unfortunately apathetic, or outright criminal.   Please take action as I've outlined above, **and reply to let us (us being myself and all other ticket purchases) when you have done so.**  **Best regards,** --  [My Name]  **P.S. Can you confirm that the event has been successfully rescheduled for Saturday, July 29th? If so, please send me all relevant event info.**  **P.P.S. To remedy the lack of communication between departments of your company, might I recommend slack messaging?**   *****  As of now I am awaiting a reply though I expect there will be none. Can anything be done about this? Part of the issue, I believe, is 90s booze cruise is shrouded in mystery. All I have is the e-mail address provided through Universe. I do not know where they are based (I think NY) or have any real contact information, nor, can I connect an actual human to the company. I suspect this is on purpose. It does appear they have advertised this event elsewhere. I am not sure if they followed through with it in these other locations or if it is a systematic scam in multiple locales.   *edit: concealed identifying information and formatting*"	No
313	So my neighbor owns the lot behind our house. The lot seems to be used not so often and they're home is on the lot behind another neighbor's house (they own a lot of land). Anyway, the lot behind my property is overgrown. No big deal, don't really care about that, my only issue is they have black berry bushes that are growing over the fence and into our back yard. Can I cut the branches that are in our yard without worrying about any legal repercussions?	No
314	I have had an eCommerce business for about a 1.5 years and never filed for the LLC, but I have the branding, domain name, etc.  I just went to check the Secretary of State's site to lookup my name, and I found that just this May a corporation from Las Vegas, named **United States Corporation Agents, Inc.** filed for my exact name.  I know for a fact that no one would have picked the name of my eCommerce store randomly in my state, so I'm guessing they are doing this to try and make money off me.  Just look at how many other LLCs they've filed randomly: https://www.sosnc.gov/search/regagent/6542001  What can I do? Can I still get my name if I've had the domain name and branding for over a year?	No
315	Hello,  Odd scenario synopsis - I lease a home which I live in. I sublease some of the bedrooms (with permission from the landlord). I rented one of the bedrooms to a new tenant and had him sign a standard 6 month lease and had him pay first months rent along with a security deposit. I called him a week later (3 weeks before move in) to arrange a move-in time and his phone was off. I have tried calling him everyday since then and his phone has remained off. The move-in date has come and gone and he has not returned to the premises nor contacted me. I don't have an emergency contact or alternate number. He also has a very common name so it is seemingly impossible to track him down on Facebook or other social media.   What are my options here? It's clear something has either happened to him or he does not want to be contacted/found. This is a unique situation because he has not taken possession of the property. He does not have the keys and he has not moved any of his belongings in here. If he will not be returning I need to find another tenant ASAP to fulfill MY financial obligations to the landlord. Thoughts?  Thank You!  Edit: Located in PA	No
316	I'd just like to say that I live in a rural area. The road I'm speaking of is off the main road, it is more narrow and unmarked. There is a sharp turn with a lot of trees and grown up weeds, so you can't see anything until you're going around that turn.   My neighbors have a few kids, none of them high school age. Middle school at most, probably. Amongst those kids is a handicap child. Not sure how old he is, just that he is in a motorized wheelchair. The parents let their kids go for walks to their friends house, so sometimes the handicap kid is supervised by them. However there have been multiple times where I've gone around that turn and had to slam on my breaks to miss the kid in a wheelchair and he was alone. I drive pretty safely but that is such a blindspot and I'm terrified of hitting him.   I was going to make a post about this awhile back and if it'd be calling CPS worthy, but it had stopped for a long time. I assumed someone had talked to them.... Until now..  Tonight, DARK OUTSIDE, on the turn there was the dad pulling a trailer with a riding lawn mower with no lights on, and the kid in a wheelchair was riding in front of him (also no lights, obviously.) Only thing that prevented an accident was a car that came from the other direction flicking their lights to signal to slow down before the turn.   I don't know the law, I don't know things that should be called in to CPS, or things that are perfectly fine.	No
317	So 4 of us are trying to rent a house together. 1 applicant was living with his relatives when they were evicted, his siblings were counted as unknown tennants while it was counted that he was  evicted twice, the renter said we just need it signed by a judge that he's not liable. We have no idea what's required to start the process, do we need to set up a court date? Or contact the renter? Or is it just something you can go up before a judge and knock it out? How long would the process take?	No
318	"My landlord charged us for a cleaning service ($225), professional carpet and tile cleaning ($320), landscaping and new vertical blinds ($350). We've been talking via email and I told her I was willing to drop the cleaning service fee if she refunded the other two charges (we got the carpet professionally cleaned- her assistant lost the copy of the receipt we turned in, our lease says nothing about professional tile cleaning, and we reported the blinds damaged). She has not yet responded. I just checked our lease yesterday, and it says: ""Landlord is responsible for all landscaping."" I'm wondering if she's at this point broken the lease and if I have leverage to ask for the other fees. On a side note, they put the house up for sale after we moved out. We think we've being charged for making it extra presentable. The house is in California. Thank you for any and all advice!"	No
319	Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	No
320	"I [23F] posted a few months ago abought my roommate [25F] who became upset that I no longer wanted to socialize with her. She then put my room up for rent on Craigslist without my permission. I am on the lease and there was no way for her to legally force me from my room. Since then she has become verbally abusive from banging on my bedroom door to scream obscenities ""You know you're a fucking retard!"" ""Get the fuck out already"" ""Yeah hide in your fucking room"" trying to intimidate me. She recently threw a fit because she thought I touched her chair. That's it. That warranted a few minutes of pounding on my bedroom door and screams.  Unfortunately the only harassment I have documented is a security camera video of her entering my room without permission and text messages from her. These are just a few examples of the way she talks to me. [Example A](http://imgur.com/HA7teNb) [Example B](http://imgur.com/5Vxs05d)  I won't reply unless 100% necessary because she is very irrational and hot headed so engagement has made things worse. She has gone out of her way to text me that she showed my professional online website to someone in the entertainment industry and told them I wasn't a good person to work with, now she's damaging my career.     I already gave her 45 day notice I'd move out which is what she demanded, if I get my name off the lease and my full deposit back. The lease is scheduled to end December 2017. However, because we obtained our lease through the Irvine Company's Moderate Income program, we've just been told that no changes can be made to the lease, including replacing me with another qualified person.   I was already considering getting a restraining order because I'm scared to leave my room when she is home, but figured I would be out at the end of the month anyway. Would a restraining order help me remove myself from this lease so I can get away from this potentially dangerous girl? Thank you."	No
321	Hi I'm 19 years old from Ontario Canada. My roommate and I were renting together from July 2016-to June 2017. It was a house, we rented the top floor and there was a different unit on the first floor. When we moved in we had discovered mice lived there as well. It wasn't too big of a deal and the landlord bought us mouse traps. We'd catch like one mouse a month.  Now around April, the tenants beneath us moved out and left the unit beneath us in disarray and the landlord didn't clean it for about a month. I'm pretty sure the mice multiplied a bunch. I believe around May new tenants moved in and the first night we saw at least 5 mice and they were literally running everywhere, in our bedrooms, in the kitchen, running around the hallway, into the bathroom. I set up 5 traps and caught my first mouse literally minutes after setting it. We contacted the landlord, my roommate had asked that he hired a professional, because we both felt that mouse traps were no longer adequate because of the sheer amount of mice. He brought us more mousetraps, and made an arrangement with the new tenant downstairs to help us set up the traps periodically.  We both moved out pretty much immediately and continued paying rent until the lease was up. I had contacted the landlord and tenant's board about the issue and they had told me to put in a maintenance claim. Now I didn't really want to have to take him to the board so I didn't submit a claim. Mostly because I've never done this before and I'm kinda scared and don't really know what's right.  The thing is, my roommate put in a maintenance claim, and put my name on it. I obviously didn't sign it, i didn't even know it was a thing lol. So I just got a text from my landlord, asking if I'm also going to be signing it because his lawyer needs to know. Should I sign it and take him to the board? If I do sign it, does any one know what the process is after that? Should I be getting a lawyer? I haven't a clue what to do. Thank you so much in advanced.	No
322	Okay, so my friend has been renting an apartment for a couple years near the campus of the university that we attend and every semester his landlord has called him and asked if he wants to renew his contract for the next semester. Well this semester instead of calling him, his landlord sent him a letter saying that all of the contracts in his building had been sold and that he would need to be out of his apartment by this coming Saturday.   So we understand that it's not her obligation to ask him every semester if he will be renewing his contract but is it legal to give him 2 weeks notice to be moved out of her apartment? Is there anything he can do to stay a bit longer until he can get a contract at another apartment?	No
323	Hello Legal Advice,   As stated our previous tenant owes us a sum of money and the sum was sent to a collections agency. The collections agency learned the individual was arrested and sentenced to jail for 10 years.    I am being told the statute of limitations for suing him is 4 years so we are out of luck. Is there anything I can do?	No
324	Not sure if I used the right legal mumbo jumbo in the title. My family co-signed for an individual that was subletting an apartment. He failed to pay rent, and was evicted (after 5ish months). My family had to pay the 6 months of rent that the lease was signed for (roughly $5400). It is my understanding that I can sue in small claims court in PA (limit is 15k). Does anyone know any additional information about situations like this? How complicated are cases like this, as I know there are a ton of tenant protection laws and such. Is it worth the trouble when I am unsure I will get any money out of the individual even if it goes to collections (I do know that the individual is a manager at a retail store, and might possibly have a second job as well). Any help or comments would be much appreciated, thanks!  TLDR: Co-signer had to pay 6 months of rent after primary leasee failed to pay rent and got evicted. Wanting to sue primary leasee in small claims court.	No
325	Our refrigerator broke broke down on Sunday. we contacted maintenance to let them know Monday and they are just now in my apartment. I have lost about $200 worth of food, from Frozen things to refrigerated things. Is there anyway I can get reimbursed for the food I lost? We have also had a mouse problem that maintenance and the landlord have been aware of for months and have not taken care of.	No
326	The other side has told me that they have drafted some kind of stipulation or other agreement to announce to the court at the upcoming hearing, which was supposed to be the date of the trial. They say it closely tracks the original agreement. I am not sure if this is proper or necessary.	No
327	"Here are the facts: -I am about to move in with my friend, who currently has a different roommate. Rather than draw up an entirely new lease, we are just doing a ""Roommate Add,"" meaning that I am being added to the existing lease and the current rooomate will be removed. -Doing ""Roommate Adds"" requires the current tenant to relinquish her rights to her deposit. The landlord will then credit that deposit to me, and it will be returned to the tenants whose names are on the leases at the expiration of the lease. (I'll include the language of this relinquishment at the bottom of this post). -Over dinner, my friend casually brought this to my attention (I was previously unaware of it). He told me that she was going to sign the relinquishment form and then I would have to pay her the deposit that she paid ($800). I didn't exactly agree or disagree, but I didn't protest this. For all intents and purposes, there seemed to be a reasonable expectation that I would agree to pay her back. I'm not sure if I created the expectation or if he just assumed I would pay her back, but the expectation is there. Under the assumption that he told the current tenant that I would agree to pay her back, I have the following legal questions:  1. Is this contract enforceable? My friend, a person who is completely independent of me, i.e. he is not an agent of mine and  does not have any rights to legally make me liable for something, has seemingly entered me into this ""contract."" I never made any  sort of direct agreement with the current tenant (verbal or written) to pay her for any part of this deposit that she is relinquishing. She has not reached out to me and asked if I would indeed pay her back after she signs it over to me despite having the means to confirm  that with me. Can this quasi- verbal agreement that seems to have been made between me and my friend obligate me to pay the  current tenant? 2. Does the Massachusetts Statute of Frauds say anything about this? Isn't there a necessity of writing for contracts regarding money  matters over a certain amount or promises to pay debts back?   I understand that she is probably doing me a favor by doing this ""Roommate Add"" instead of drawing up an entire new lease because ultimately a new lease would be more expensive, but I don't feel I'm obligated to reimburse her - she is relinquishing it and she never discussed with me the issue of repayment. PLEASE, I AM SEEKING LEGAL ADVICE, NOT MORAL ADVICE. I am probably MORALLY obligated to pay her back, but I am inquiring to see if there is anything that LEGALLY OBLIGATES ME TO BE REIMBURSE HER.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Language of Relinquishment Form that she is signing: I acknowledge that I am a co-tenant at the above-described premises, the lease for which is expiring. Since one or more of my co-tenants are remaining at the premises under a new lease and we desire to keep the entire security deposit and prepaid rent now held by you on account for the new lease, I hereby relinquish all my rights for Apartment #____ located at _________ as of . I also relinquish my rights with respect to any security deposit and/or pre-paid rent (and interest thereon) for the above-mentioned apartment under a lease dated ____. I understand that as of______, I will no longer have any rights with respect to this apartment. It is also my understanding that my security deposit and/or pre-paid rent will be credited to the continuing and/or the new tenants on a new lease and that at the conclusion of this new lease, the amount of security deposit/pre-paid rent will be refunded to the tenants then listed on the lease."

I am sure my wife knows this so she will offer me nothing more than the Standard Possession Order at all.  My goal for this custody battle is to get 50% of my son's time. Question is - should I settle at the Mediation for time equivalent to the Standard Possession order or go to Court for the Temporary hearing and get teh Standard Possession order (SPO) there?  The reason I ask this is because - It seems that if I voluntarily ACCEPT an offer equivalent to the SPO, I will probably not get anything more later. If I do not accept, it will be on record that I did not accept and I can continue to fight for more.  Is my reasoning right here?	No
331	"I'm sorry if this is mostly a rant as I am sweating my face off and extremely frustrated.   Background: I have lived in this duplex since May of 2013. I enjoy living here, the rent is cheap and the landlord has generally been good about getting things done if needed. In my time here we have had the attic water heater rust through and leak through the walls, resulting in the carpet being ripped out and replaced with wood-look laminate, the breaker box has blown (I'm not sure if I'm correct on the specifically but something to the effect) where we did not have any type of power for less than 24 hours, and a few other things which have always been fixed in a very reasonable amount of time.   The situation: I have been trying to get my air conditioner fixed since July 5th. I originally called my landlord to tell her about the issue, which is that during the day the unit cannot keep my tiny 800 square foot place below 84 degrees. It is Texas and it is hot but I have not had this issue in the years previous.   The landlord sent a repairman out quickly, he basically just blew out the area where the filter is inserted and left. It worked fine as far as I can tell for about a couple of days but was back to hot very quickly after.   I emailed my landlord on July 18th when I had time for a repairman to come in and get it done again, and they sent someone out again the next day. He arrived in the morning before it was hot, did the same thing as the previous guy and said it was working fine. This time there was no result and the temperature was back up to 80+ by 3pm.   I emailed my landlord again same day and specifically requested that someone come out later so that they could observe that the temperature was high. One week ago the man came at about 9pm and observed the heat, climbed up into my attic and said it was pretty cold up there (meaning the duct work likely needed to be replaced) and left within 15 minutes saying that everything was operating fine and he didn't know why there was no cool air in the apartment other than that the insulation was insufficient but they would ""get it fixed.""   I never heard anything further. I emailed my landlord yesterday evening to check on the status and she said she has a call in to the owner and she will let me know the results. It is currently 84 degrees at 5:30pm and will likely continue to be until at least 10pm. I am at my wits end, my air conditioner is running constantly and my bill is $250+ a month to heat this tiny stupid place. I don't want to move and I don't want to sue, but I also don't have the money to get it fixed myself. What in the world am I supposed to do?  Does e-mail count as a method of notification if I have to move forward with a lawsuit or do i need to send a certified letter?  TL;DR my air conditioner doesn't work and it's been 22 days. What now?"	No
332	"They let her out after a week even though I begged them not to. She was obviously still clearly psychotic and that night she burned a tower of my dads belongings in the back yard with her grandchildren and threatened to kill my dad. She was readmitted to the same hospital even though we asked for her to be sent to a different one.  They are now discharging her again although she is clearly still manic. They tried to place blame on me for not being a part of the ""plan"" although I live ten hours away. They have not contacted me once except to tell me that they are diacharging her the same day. She has asked them to stay as well. They will put her on the streets with no resources and she is clearly still severely manic, but they claim that's for the doctor to decide.  She is on Medicaid and I have a feeling this has to do with getting money from insurance. The doctor that is treating her also prescribed her chantix years ago. Chantix is an anti smoking drug that is very well known for causing psychosis even in stable people. He was treating her for bipolar when this happened and she went manic.  This is in the rio grande valley which is well known for Medicaid fraud although I don't really know what that entails. In fact this same doctor was ruled guilty before, but I'm unsure what he did exactly.   TLDR hospital/doctor continue to release my mother when she is a danger. She has damaged possessions and put the family in danger as soon as she was released"	No
333	"My 21 year old deaf stepdaughter is a full time college student at a prominent university in New York - our home state is Florida. She signed a lease for an apartment at a student housing complex (not affiliated with her university) last November, along with four of her deaf friends. In the process, she signed my husband's name as a cosigner to this lease. We just found this out in the last two weeks.    To give you some background info, because of her deafness, she essentially operates on a lower maturity level than most people her age - she acts and functions on about a 16-17 year old level. While I understand this is not an excuse to not act like an adult, we genuinely believe she didn't understand what was happening or what she was doing or how serious it was (she STILL is having trouble understanding the gravity of the situation). The entire time she dealt with this student housing complex, she thought she was filling out an application, and that was what she had communicated to my husband and I at the time. When she asked him for information about financials, he thought it was for a credit check for the application. She rushed all this at us last year in a few hours one afternoon while we were at work - everything had to be immediate because the housing complex was pressuring them to apply because ""all the apartments were going to be leased so fast."" He never saw the lease, and she signed his name to it without him knowing she was doing that. He would not have signed this lease if he'd known or read it. She didn't tell us anything about this until two weeks ago, because suddenly all her friends are also not going to live in this apartment because none of their government funding, which all five of them rely fully on, is going to cover off campus housing, even though the apartment complex told them it would be no problem. So really, there are five students here who have signed this lease, and none of them plan to live there.    I have no idea what anyone else's parents are doing, but we've tried explaining the situation to the apartment complex, and they are adamant that the lease is binding and the only option is for the students to find someone to relet their rooms to. However, if none of them move in August 1, the entire rent defaults and is due immediately for everyone. They all live down here in Florida, and only are able to talk to their friends and post on facebook groups to find someone to relet to, which is proving futile. The apartment complex has placed them on a ""relet list"" but they only refer to that list once the entire complex is full, which it isn't at this time. We're now on the hook for over $10k for this because my husband's name is on this lease.    I don't know enough about real estate law, or if there's anything we can do about this situation, or if we're just stuck because our name is legally on this lease. We're trying to get in touch with the legal services at the school, but because it's still summer, it's hard to get a hold of anyone. Is there any way we can get out of this lease? What would happen if we pursued legal action against our daughter for signing my husbands name without her knowledge? While paying the $10k bill monthly or immediately is really going to be incredibly hard for us, we could feasibly consider paying for a lawyer if it could get us out of this lease.    TL;DR - deaf stepdaughter fraudulently signed our name to lease as cosigner for student housing; will not be living there, can't get out of lease.  Is there anything we can do?"	No
334	I know this isn't as important as some other matters on here, but I haven't found a solid answer on it.   I work as a news reporter at a regional newspaper in Minnesota. Our local radio station has been reading my stories, with exact quotes, on air without giving any credit.   The radio station has a news reporter, but she doesn't show up at most events, or cover any of these stories. I hear shortened versions of my stories being read pretty much every day and it's mildly infuriating.   I've asked them to stop, or give credit, but get no response. My company doesn't do anything about it.  I'm having trouble understanding the grey areas of fair use law. Basically, is there anything I can do about this?	No
335	Hi legal advice! This is one of my favorite subs and an old situation has been bugging me on and off for years. At the insistence of my partner at the time I let the situation go but I've always wondered what I might have done.  My partner and I lived in a daylight basement of a split house - we had the entire basement and our neighbors the whole top. When moving in, the landlord mentioned in passing past plumbing issues but said all had been resolved. After a few months, our section flooded with backed up wash and toilet water (approximately 2-3 inches of poop scented water), leading to the damage of some electronics. The culprit was deemed the upstairs neighbors flushing 'flushable' wipes which caught in and blocked a poorly designed section of plumbing, leading to sewage backing up through a floor drain. Upon talking to the plumber, the landlord had been previously advised the system would continue to backup until the bad piping was replaced but he had elected to do nothing. Basically, he lied to us about the plumbing issues being rectified. We confronted him about this and, as he claimed to have insufficient funding to fix actually fix the issue, offered to let us out of our lease early and with only ten days notice. He also offered, via email, to replace the electronics if we provided him with an appraisal of value.  We proceeded to find another home while the apartment filled with sewage water another three times. We literally found floating nuggets of feces at one point. The smell was awful so we stayed with my parents. During this time, the landlord became aggressive, repeatedly telling us that he would hold us fully responsible if he found we had contributed to the clogging in any way. I provided the valuation and the landlord dragged his feet, never giving me a date for which I'd get a check. After a couple of weeks, I demanded an update on the status of the reimbursement. He claimed due to my rudeness he had rescinded his offer to replace my damaged goods. We attempted to get the plumber to provide us with written documentation regarding the landlord's refusal to fix the plumbing. They called the landlord to get his permission, and he promptly called and lambasted us.  Upon finding a new unit, we gave written notice and calculated prorated rent for ten days. After delivering the notice to the landlord, he became extremely aggressive, saying we would pay for the entire month of rent or he would take us to court. I wanted to prorate the amount anyhow, especially since the apartment was uninhabitable, but my ex-partner was spineless and insisted we just give in and forget it. I was a chump and went along with her, despite wanting to take him to court.  After leaving, he refused to perform a post-move walk-through with us but deducted the entirety of our deposit due to the state of the apartment, all caused from backed up sewage, and claimed the window mount air conditioners were all missing, a complete fabrication, and demanded we compensate him for their value. I told him to get bent and he threatened to sue but never did. All in all, we were out about $1200 (~$2500 if you count the electronics), not a lot but a sizable sum at the time.  Oh sages of /r/legaladvice, what sayest ye? Should I have taken it to small claims court or was it not worth the trouble, as my ex-partner insisted? I actually still have everything documented, could I possibly even sue now, four years later?	No
336	My financial situation changed due to me leaving an abusive relationship and at the time, the best decision for my son was to let him live with his grandparents while I got into a better financial and living situation. (GA, USA) The problem is ever since I started talking about being ready they started alienating me from my son (now 6 yrs old). So now that I'm fully ready and without doubt can give him the life he deserves, I have filed a petition for terminating guardianship, which was rejected and now has led us to court soon. I have a few questions about what is admissible in court specifically: Text messages, and call logs (where calls were not answered or returned), a notarized statement from a witness, can I have a (sibling) character witness?  It has been about 2.5 years since I signed over guardianship and I've continually requested and been shot down for visitation through the last 2 years. and have been trying to convince them to terminate for at least 6 months now.	No
337	My lease expiring in four days has standard information about how tenants are responsible for professional carpet cleaning from an approved list. The approved list is an addendum piece to the rental agreement with one company listed. We signed this a year ago not knowing that this carpet cleaning company was run by the landlord's brother. I've called and he's quoting $650 to clean a 2-bedroom apartment, while other places I've called are saying it'll be more around $200. Is this enforcable/legal?	No
338	Hi,  I have an issue, in Alberta, I believe we have two acts that govern living spaces.   The space that I am asking question about was intended to be leased under the In-Keepers Act, but I believe that the lease was written in error and may be covered under the Residential Tenancy Act.  My mom's english isn't good, and she bought a property in Alberta that was intended to be rented by room to students and/or working professionals in that area.  The basement is rented by suite, but main floor is rented by room.   The issue is that the tenant filled out the standard lease template and filled out the entire address rather than filling it out with the address plus indicating the room it is renting.   This tenant keeps on referring to the residential tenancy act stating we do not have right to enter the property without 24 hour notice, etc. hence, it is quite difficult for the landlord to do its job and rent out other rooms, or look at the common shared areas.   So the application for rent stated it intends to rent one room, but the lease template states that it is renting the entire address. That's the mistake is my mom signed the lease agreement with the entire address rather than stating room #1.   In my opinion, the lease is defective, because the price paid for the entire house doesn't make any sense. This tenant is paying $600 for the entire house, but on rentfaster or kijiji, etc, renting the entire house is at least $2,400, etc.  And all other leases  signed in that property shows address + room 1, 2, etc.   My mom had verbal conversation with this tenant and it is my understanding everything was agreed for one room. But this tenant is treating it like she's renting the entire house, and uses everything.   We are currently having a family member moving in there, as we have a spare room for them to use.   Everytime we try to show the empty room for rent, she would complain about us not giving her a 24 hr notice, and she's picky she wants it to be a paper taped on back door notice, she won't accept emails, text messages, etc.   She also blames everytime we show the property, there are things missing, or she lost $, or something breaks, and she also claimed my dad kicked her dog, discriminate against women, harassed her, etc. Also complaining that she isn't getting her peace and enjoyment due to these things, and asked for free rent or reduced rent.   If we can goto court and correct the lease and help it fall under inkeepers act, i believe we can kick her out without any notice.   Finally, this lady is running for an office space, which is rediculous, as I thought these people should maintain a certain level of reputation.  Sorry, lastly, she knows we messed up on the lease, and said she would correct it once she cools down. But afterwards, she will not correct the lease indicating she's only renting 1 room there.  What are the best steps to prove to the court that she's only renting one room?   Thank you!	No
339	"I am male, and I recently had several job interviews at a company that is ""WBE certified"" and several of the questions were in line with the one above.  ""If a female co-worker was promoted ahead of you, how would that make you feel?""  ""Can you work in an office where most of your co-workers are female?""  I didn't get the job, and I kinda feel like I'm lucky since so much concern was front-loaded about gender. But I felt like most of these questions about gender were invalid in the least. For example, I see no reason why gender has to play any role in being a good manager.  Anyway, did these questions cross a line?"	No
340	Hey all! I've recently started an NBA blog. I'm currently writing posts to fill up the site before I begin to promote it a little bit, and, I use images (which don't belong to me) in posts. My parents have mentioned that this might get me into some legal trouble, but I wouldn't think so as I don't profit off the blog.  A lot of NBA YouTubers use images such as the ones I use on my website. As well, many use real footage of the NBA. These are monetized videos with hundreds of thousands of views. If they never get into trouble for using the material, is there any reason I would?  I'm planning on getting this site to be fairly big (I have the ability to promote the site pretty well, so there's a decent chance it can get pretty popular -- that sounds kinda braggy, I don't mean it in that way though haha). I figured I should mention that because I'm guessing it's a bigger issue legality wise if the website is popular.  Thanks so much for any help! Feel free to ask any questions in case I left anything important out.	No
341	For the last 32 days both our AC unit and dishwasher have both been out of service. Also for the last month local temperatures have been ranging from 75-102 daily - including two week long heat waves where the weather wouldn't be lower than 80 at 10:00pm at night.   They did install a temporary AC unit but it literally only cools within a 5-foot radius of the thing and doesn't reach any of the three bedrooms or kitchen. I bake as a part-time job from home and spend upwards of five hours at a time in front of the oven which is miserable in this heat.   I just got an update that they'll be installing the new dishwasher (that's been sitting on our balcony in its box for the last three weeks) next Wednesday the 19th. Apparently they haven't had the man power to install it.   We pay $2,765 for a 1,192 sq foot apartment. Our energy bill last month was $206.09, compared to our usual bill ~$130.00 - because of constantly having to run the temporary AC unit.   I told them about our high energy bill and they offered to credit our account $300.00 - which covers our PG&amp;E Bill and (1) day of rent which calculates to $91.16). Not only that but because it's already mid-July I'm positive we'll be expecting another ridiculous energy bill.   While I'm grateful that they offered to cover it, but is that enough of a credit because we've had to live in this miserable heat indoors while also not having a functioning dishwasher?   Any info would help - thanks in advance.	No
342	I'm 15 and got caught stealing at Walmart I know I'm really dumb so don't bother commenting saying I'm dumb i know I am for this but in all honesty I need to know What my options are here . I stole under $30 worth of merchandise (2 iPhone chargers) and they caught me and took me to a room and officers came and wrote me a ticket or whatever . I gave them my first and last name as well as the first initial to my middle name but keep in mind this happened in Texas and I live in Florida. I gave the officers my old house address which is a rental house and they said I have until august 7th to go to court and pay a fine or they will put out a warrant for my arrest. So the question is should I tell my parents or just leave it alone and don't worry about them trying to find me back in Florida ? since they don't have my real address. Will they be able to put a warrant for my arrest in Only Texas since this all happened in Texas or Florida too ? or would they still be able to find me? can I pay this over the phone without showing up to court since I leave Texas tomorrow ?	No
343	I just found out that my husband has been having a year long affair with multiple women.   I am a stay at home mother and full time student with two kids (6 and 1.5). I have not worked in over 6 years.   My husband and I own a house together, though it is primarily in his name as he has income. I am, however, in the paperwork showing that I also own the home.   I feel so lost. I never wanted to be in this position and I have been busting my ass to finish my degree to make sure I could provide for myself if need be. So I guess my question is - now what? How can I protect myself and my children? What kind of government assistance is there for women like me? How much of his paycheck will go towards child support? We live in Texas, and he makes roughly $45k before taxes.   He's my best friend, I'm not out to be vindictive, I'm just trying to get by while I finish my Bachelor's.	No
344	An officer came to my home to speak to me after I specifically told him on the phone that I wanted to speak to him the following day instead of the day that he called me. When we spoke he asked me a broad question to which I replied yes. He took that as an admission of guilt and said I was guilty to everything. Now a police report is going to be filed. Everything was in person, I never wrote a statement and there is no real solid evidence against me besides that I'm a suspect. This is about a texting harassment case.  Basically my question is what will be in this police report? Will he say I'm guilty even though I answered a broad question?  Montgomery County-MD	No
345	This whole thing is going on in PA. I'm 33, my GF is 25, her Ex is 28 (i think) and their son is 4  So here's a rundown of events  I'll refer to my girlfriends son as G from here on out  My girlfriend is very into giving her son education opportunities. Last year, she was able to get G into a very organized and solid Pre-K program (at no cost due to her low income)  Her ex fought her on it. They have split custody, almost even amount of time is allocated between parents (a little heavier on the moms time).   The dads main beef was he'll lose time with his son, not to mention he had no transportation to drop him off or pick him up. Her ex lives with his parents, and they are great grandparents, but I think they are tired of their sons bs. He doesn't really have his life together.   We understood, so we setup a special thing with the school where G could go part time (1/2 days, 3 days per week). Since G was only 3 at the time, he would be eligible for the same Pre-K program the following year (coming up) and go to kindergarten the year after that.  It was kind of a pain agreeing to her ex'es demands to go part time. Her ex has no ride, so my GF would drive across town before work to take him to school even though it wasn't her day with him. I was in a position to pick him up around lunch time without issue.  Her ex verbally agreed that if their son liked going to school, he could go full time the following year.  Now the time has come to officially enroll him for the upcoming school year, and her ex is absolutely refusing to allow G to go full time. He likes the agreement where G only goes part time and we drive G back and forth.  A couple weeks ago he said he would agree to whatever G said he wanted. And G said he wanted to go to school more, and his dad agreed, and even verified all this via text to my GF. But her ex also had G for 3 days following this conversation, and once we picked G up, her ex said that G had changed his mind and didn't want to go to school more. When we press G why not, he says he doesn't want to make his dad angry (I don't suspect any physical abuse). I told G that dad wouldn't be mad att him, he would be mad at mom. But G is clearly a bit upset about the recent mom &amp; dad fighting on the phone, and being pressured to make a decision.  My GF is fed up with it and told the school to enroll G full time anyways, the ex called the school and told them not to. And now the school says we have until the end of this week to make a decision or G will lose his spot entirely. We view her ex's attitude as extremely selfish at this point, and find the mental conditioning he's trying to put on G very disturbing.  Is there anything legally we can do to get things moving that benefit G the most? Something that might be a small wake up call to the dad?	No
346	"My leasing company has a form for Emotional Support Animals that they want notorized. My counselor's supervisor (who doesn't know of my condition) read the form and was uncomfortable with the wording saying that my condition ""requires"" the aid of the ESA. My counselor crossed out the word ""requires"" and wrote ""receives substantial and important benefits from."" She also wrote a letter saying that due to my PTSD it is medically necessary for me to have the ESA.  I sent both the altered form and the letter to my leasing company and they are talking to their lawyer about it. Everything I read online says that only a letter is required to hold up in court. Is my landlord able to deny my ESA request?  My building is all condos and the HOA is very dog friendly. All of my neighbors have pets.

347	"Hi all,   This is my throwaway because obviously. This all happened in NYC.  My ex and I had a tumultuous relationship, we separated in May of 2015 after a year of marriage, a full no-contest divorce followed in early 2016.   We had a huge wedding (100% her choice/decision, I wanted something smaller and much less grand). Neither of us were making much money at the time, and she had received a large inheritance from her grandmother previously which she used to pay for the wedding.   When we separated and ultimately divorced we stayed friendly-ish, but she always carried a resentment over the money she spent on the wedding. I told her (though never in a documented format) that should I ever be in a very comfortable financial situation I would be happy to repay her a portion of the wedding fund.   A little current add on, I am technically homeless, make very little money, and although I have prospects on the horizon by no means could you call my situation comfortable, something closer to strained.   She emailed me recently about a ""financial situation"" she wanted to discuss with me, after some pressing she explained that she was threatening legal action to recoup half of the cost of our wedding as well as interest starting from our separation in 2015.   I'm sure the main advice would be to get a lawyer, which is rough as I literally have little to no money. My main curiosity is, is it even possible for her to sue me for that, especially since that's something she would have had to have handled during the divorce, and without any documentation of me stating explicitly ""I will pay you such and such"" does this threat have any real validity? My main assumption is that she's hurting for cash and knowing my situation thinks if she threatens legal action she will be able to squeeze a few pennies from my well.   Thank you all in advance for any advice you can offer."	No
348	"I'm going to try to summarize this as briefly as possible. By the way, I'm in Virginia. Basically, my mom was impregnated and my ""dad"" didn't want anything to do with it. To protect me, my family had him sign something saying he wouldn't contact me or contribute to my welfare. This applied until I turned 18. Now, as an adult, I've attempted to make contact but he has responded that he has no interest. Given that I didn't make the decision to essentially sign him off all parenthood duties, do I have any legal grounds at all to sue for child support as an adult?"	No
349	"We had several improvements done to our front yard about one year ago (new walkway, new sprinkler system, planting, etc).  The general contractor we hired subcontracted out the concrete work.  After all the work was completed, we paid the contractor the final installment (50% was due before the job started, 50% due after).  Total job was ~$8,500.  Now, a year later, the subcontractor drives by my house on a Saturday and lets me know he hasn't been paid.  This is certainly news to me!  He has been stiffed by the general contractor and says he will try to come after me.  He then showed me the invoice for concrete work that was supposedly unpaid by the contractor (nearly $2000). He said he sent me a notice in the mail ""a month ago"" that he was going to file a mechanics lien and wanted to know if I got that notice.  I never received that notice.  At this point, my Saturday morning chores are pretty much the last thing on my mind and I am very concerned.  After 20 minutes of reading articles (from a google search), it seems like contractors and subcontractors have 90 days to file a mechanics lien.  It also says that they must file a notice to the property owner before filing the mechanics lien.  What do I do?  I have no evidence that the contractor didn't pay the subcontractor.  The contractor could very well have paid the subcontractor and I would never know!  Seems fishy, it almost seems like the subcontractor is trying to collect twice.  Since we are way beyond 90 days here, is this even something I should worry about?  What happens if I never got the notice he said he sent and he still filed a lien somehow?  Thanks in advance for your help.  I really appreciate it!"	No
350	"Woke up this morning with a notice on my door that said, ""your new lease is ready to be signed. Need by 8/1/17"". Our lease was supposed to end in October. We were told it was a 1 year lease that automatically renued for 3 years, and are currently coming up on the end of the second year in October. With this new lease they are increasing the rent by 50$ as well. I'm not sure if any of this is legal, so I've contacted the local county pro-bono office for low income people. What I wouldn't mind doing is signing the new lease in October when the old one ends, but a 15 day notice for a rent increase and attempting to force me to sign a new lease just doesn't sit well with me. Any advice?  Edit: the location is in northern Alabama."	No
351	As a general rundown, I live in a college town where dogs are very rarely welcome due to students not taking care of their pets and not paying deposits. Unfortunately, this blocks good pet owners like myself from being able to keep their furry friends themselves.   My therapy dog has been in my family for 8 years and came up to college with me as soon as I was able to bring her. This year, roommates and I agreed to move into a house for the next school year. Unfortunately, two of my roommates signed their part of the lease before I was able to read it over. When the landlord learned that I was planning on bringing my 5 pound poodle mix, he freaked out and would not let me sign my lease. He told the other two friends that they were stuck to a four bedroom house that they would have to split the rent between the two of them. After a week of pleading emails, he finally agreed to let me sign, so long as I signed a contract agreeing not to bring my dog or try to claim her as a therapy pet next year or I would be evicted. Normally I would be angry with people who sign at an apartment complex without planning anything for their dog, but I was in a bind where I had to help my roommates out and knew my family could take care of my dog if need be.   After a few months, I've grown angry and generally curious about how legal my landlords actions were and whether or not there was a way for me to bring my therapy dog with me next year.	No
352	So I live on a property where my lot, neighbor 1's 2 lots, and neighbor 2's 2 lots are all part of a restricted covenant. According to the restricted covenant, none of us are not permitted to have animals besides the usual household pets. Regardless, they have chickens and roosters. The chickens and roosters are on their property but are physically closer my house than they are theirs. This means I hear them ALL THE TIME. Now, these people are total a-holes. I went and spoke to them earlier and as I approached the end of my property to speak to them, I saw one of the chickens had actually flown into my yard. Had my dogs been outside it would not have ended pretty.   What can I do to enforce the restricted covenant to keep them from having these disturbing chickens anymore? Pic of restricted covenant in comments. TIA.	No
353	27, male, married for 11 months here. No kids or assets besides the house, bought in my name before marriage with all of my own money. Unofficially separated at 6 months. (Have a letter she wrote agreeing to leave if I asked her. I did, she changed her mind.) I make around 90k/year. Wife's name is not anywhere on the papers. She does not work and has never held a steady job. I filed for a no contest divorce, as we have no assets or children together. She was served two weeks ago. She says she is going to respond that she does not agree and wants to attempt to pursue a fault case on the grounds of adultery. She says she is going to go after the house and half of what I earn. Right now we live in the same house, although half the time I live with parents because I do not want to be around her. My lawyer has told me that I cannot kick her out of the house, but I also cannot afford both the house's mortgage and a new apartment for me to live in. She pays nothing toward the bills and is living in the house full time, as she has done throughout the whole marriage. She is able bodied but just refuses to work because she feels she doesn't have to. Is there anything I can do? How do I get her out? If  judge finds me at fault, is she entitled to the house and half of everything I own?	No
354	i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	No
355	"I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.  He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.  The day of my flight to California I texted him to confirm that he could still host me, still wanted me to come, and could still afford everything. I even told him if money was an issue for him we could reschedule and I could meet him another time.  I got on my flight, and when I landed and called him he told me his check didn't go through, and that I was on my own. I have his address, his full name, as well as some of his family members added on Facebook.  I have incurred costs from a hotel, as well as a very expensive flight back home 2 days later. I had planned to stay 2 weeks, but since he would not even agree to meet out of embarrassment I decided to leave ASAP.  Could I legally take him to court because he agreed over text and email? I had asked him multiple times, as late as before I even boarded the plane to make sure he still wanted me to come and was able to host me during my stay.   I wouldn't have got on the plane if he had just told me he didn't have the money. I'm incredibly upset by the whole situation and at this point I just want the money back for the 2 nights at the hotel and the flight back home.   Would suing him in small claims be realistic or do verbal or text agreements not hold up in small claims court?   I have him plenty of oppurtunities to speak up and potentially mitigate and costs I would incur but he literally waited until he knew I was on my way. The last text I got before landing was ""are you ok the plane?"" To which I told him I was boarding. I honestly think the guy did it purposefully. Do I have a chance at winning a suit against him if I file? The total cost for the 2 nights and the flight was $976.40."	No
356	Im renting a house with someone I thought was a friend and the lease started in July. I'm not currently living there over summer because I'm a student with a job back home but am still paying rent for the month. My roommate was supposed to mail in our rent check and said he did, but our landlord has not received it. We've all (about 3 of us) have been calling/texting/messaging him for 7 days now asking him to void the check (if he ever even sent it) and to send a new one. Our rent is now almost a week and a half late and I literally cannot do anything unless I get ahold of him. What are my options? The house and my (ex) roommate are in Oregon, by the way.	No
357	"I'm still pretty upset. So yesterday my landlord texted me and asked if he can bring someone over for a walk through. My lease is up August 31st. We set up for 4pm because I was supposed to work but another guy wanted hours so I let him pick up my shift. About an hour ago I get a knock at the door and as I'm getting up from my bed (butt ass naked) he opens up the door and has the new tenant with him. I was so embarrassed and ran back to the room as quickly as possible. He then yelled ""we'll give you a minute!"" And laughed and his tone was like ""oh this guy is so dumb"" as soon as I opened my room door they walk in and it was so awkward. I was just cleaning as we went and kept apologizing, it wasn't filthy but embarrassing like I had my weed jar out (yes I have my med card) and underwear in the bathroom floor, plates on he counter, I was planning on doing a quick clean up before they came.  They actually got done quick and then he came back and talked to me like I was a kid telling me I need to keep the place clean and stuff. Also questioning why I told him I would be at work. I told him I don't owe him an explanation and that we had an agreed time and he got upset and was like ""ok whatever I know what we talked about"". I have texts as well so I don't know why he even went there.  This isn't the first incident though. In March I come home to him leaving my unit and he said it was a leak they found during the inspection and he came to fix it. He then said he needed to grab some tools and will be back in 30. After working a 12 hour shift I was just ready to go to bed and after about an hour I said fuck it and assumed he's not coming and feel asleep and wake up to my bedroom door opening up and him telling me he was back. He then began looking in closets and shit saying he was trying to find the leak. (But he got the tools already to fix the kitchen sink) also they found it during the inspection so what was he looking for?   This feels extremely invasive and annoying. Is there anything I can do legally? It just upsets me because I'm wondering how many times he's came when I'm not here, and he brought the girl over to view the place when I told him I would be at work.   I've also found long blonde hairs around my place and no one with blonde hair comes over. At first I thought I was going crazy until if felt like every other day people at work were telling me I had a long hair hanging from my beard I blew it off months ago but now I'm starting to think that he may bring people over during the day, as I work mostly during the day and I work from sun up to sun down most days.   Also I noticed its times that my living room tv would be on( I'm not even in the living room unless company is over) or I had 2 less packs of ramen. Things that are big enough that I noticed but small enough where I don't look into at all. I know I can't prove any of this, but what options do I have? I have the neighbor looking out and she told me he does similar stuff to her but with her it's just him popping up and not having stuff out of place.   Is he within his rights?"	No
358	Hi, this is state of Florida.   I have proof that my former apartment building overcharged utilities and charged fees that are illegal in my state. I am waiting until I receive my deposit back before sending them a certified letter with proof and an itemized list. If they do not, I will be taking them to small claims court. What is my statute for sending the letter and also (if it gets to it) suing?   Thanks	No
359	My parents in California recently got documentation stating that a lawsuit has been filed against them from the distributors of solar panels for a contractor company that we hired to install solar panels on our roof top. The contractors received parts from distributors but apparently haven't paid the distributors for the parts. They have already installed the solar panels on my parents house.   Previously my parents had received a Lien of Mechanics from the same distributors. This was the first contact they had with the distributors. My parents informed the contractor company. The contractors claim that they have paid the distributors already but did receive a second bill which they have not paid because they believe they have been wrongly double charged. They assured my parents they had taken care of this situation with the distributors. The contractors said we would received a letter saying this was resolved from the distributors legal representative. But instead my parents then received notice of the lawsuit.   The contractors have been informed once again and said they will handle this. Is there anything my parents can do in case the contractors do not resolve this issue?	No
360	My husband had a DUI in Pennsylvania in 2009. He went through ARD to have it removed from his record. Will this impact his ability to enter Canada through Alaska for a fishing trip?  Thanks!	No
361	Earlier this week, I opened my front door to let my dog out into our fenced in yard, and the mailman was standing on the front porch with a package.  As you might expect, my dog (50 lb 10 year old mutt) was startled and started barking, and before I could react we were both pepper sprayed, the dog lunged, and the mailman fell down the front steps trying to run away.  The dog didn't bite him, but he did skin his knees and was limping when he left.  It was a substitute mailman, my normal mailman leaves packages outside the fence, but had apparently not bothered to tell the substitute that my yard has a dog.  My dog has never bitten anyone, so bite history isn't an issue.  How much risk am I at for being sued, and is there anything I can to do to prevent this from becoming a problem?	No
362	After many years I finally decided to cut off contact with my mother a few months ago.  I'm well into adulthood, but the abuse has had some pretty lasting effects.  She came to my house tonight, unannounced, at supper time to give my children birthday gifts.  While she was here she mentioned that she was thinking seeking a lawyer with the intention of suing for visitation rights.  What legal rights does she have to my children?	No
363	I’m currently in settlement negotiations with a creditor for approximately $3k.  It’s not a whole lot of money, so I am trying to negotiate that the creditor remove all information in my credit report before paying them.  The attorney representing the creditor said ‘no,’ but I can’t imagine the creditor willing to pay more for a lawsuit than what it actually owed.  Do I have any leverage here at all? Does the creditor even own the account anymore or did they account to the law firm? The creditor is a nationwide company.  Any info or advice about negotiations would be appreciated.  Please hold any holier-than-thou speeches of paying bills on time.  Thank you.	No
364	"I’m moving for a job. My future employer has given me a set amount for relocation reimbursement, but I need to submit receipts. Per my contract, I will have to do a partial payback to my current employer (didn’t stay the specified time). Ideally it would be nice to use some of the moving stipend to pay off my current employer.   Here are my questions:  1.	Can I set up an LLC moving company and hire my own company to move me? And then submit the invoice? I would rent a moving truck and then use family/friends help. 2.	What is the legality of this? If I can’t set it up under my name, can a family member set it up for me?  If it’s legal:  1.	How difficult would this be to do? Could I use Legalzoom or something similar to set up the LLC? Would there be any other costs? 2.	How hard would this make taxes? 3.	Is it worth it?  Thanks for your help. Throwaway account for obvious reasons."	No
365	Whenever I go to my orthodontist, they have a bunch of dentistry chairs in the back so each patient is getting treated side by side with no privacy. In this same room, there's a big television in the middle with patient's names, reason for visit, treatment for the visit, who they're seeing, appointment time, et cetera. This seems to me like a very clear violation of the law. Am I correct in thinking this?	No
366	Bought a house at the beginning of the year with my now ex-girlfriend and her parents. I am on the mortgage and the deed to the house. It was probably a very stupid thing to do but I really thought I was going to marry her, had the ring picked out and everything. Fast forward 7 months and she told me she is unhappy and thinks we should break up. So my question to you oh great lawyers of Reddit, is what do I do next.	No
367	On mobile, throwaway, first time posting, etc etc.   So I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada on vacation. I'm originally from Alberta Canada. Tonight me and a group of girls went out for some Asian fusion. Unfortunately I am anaphylactic to peanuts. I carry meds in case of a reaction and always tell the waitress of my allergy.   So at dinner we decided to let the server just bring us food that would end up totalling $40-50 each and sharing instead of each ordering something individually. I told her at the beginning that I am severely allergic to peanuts. This allergy includes peanut oil. Server says great she understands. Awesome.   So our food comes out, one dish being chicken satay. I double check with the server that dropped it off (not our waitress) that the satay does not have peanuts. He says nope, it does not. Great! He said the dressing in the salad (which wasn't on our table yet) might have peanuts and he'll go check. So I start dishing up. I use chopsticks to put some veggie dumplings on my plate. I then grab some other food and eat it. Notice an immediate allergic reaction. Not awesome.   The waitress then hurries over and says don't eat the dumplings as they are cooked in peanut oil. Unfortunately I used the same chopsticks to pick up the dumpling as I did to eat something else. So serious cross contamination. We call the hotel paramedic and an ambulance. I spend about three hours in the hospital for observation. I gave myself my epipen and Benadryl at the restaurant. They gave me prednisone at the hospital. Had an IV and fluids given.   My question is do I have any grounds to sue? I'm pretty pissed since we're here on vacation and I felt like shit. I do have travellers insurance so the hospital stay will be covered by them. I'm really just curious what my options are. Thanks!  TLDR; told restaurant about peanut allergy, served food with peanuts, spent evening in the hospital emerg.	No
368	"Hello legaladvice! I am a long time reader, but this is an obvious throwaway because my main account is easily connected to my real name.   I have a 10 year old. ""M"" They are diagnosed with things that make their life a little more difficult, including being on the spectrum.   M called me upset over the weekend to tell me that they had been ""kicked out"". I asked M to clarify, thinking it was a game. M explained that they were having a disagreement with their stepparent ""SP"" and the SP got frustrated and threw M's clothes all in a bag, and then outside the door. SP then told M to go outside as well. When questioned further, the other parent was in full support of this action. M was brought back inside, after being asked if they were ready to be a good person now. They proceeded with the rest of their evening and M called me per our usual schedule, and that is when they let me in on what was happening.   There is more to the story - but that is the gist of it. When M's therapist was informed, the therapist reported M's other household to Child Protective Services. From what I understand CPS took the report very seriously, and I should expect contact from them.   Onto the current issue. As I was tucking in M just now, they stated that they did not want to go back to the other home. They said ""I am scared to go back, I don't feel safe there, and I don't want to get kicked out again.""   Our legal custody agreement is that M goes to the other parent before art camp tomorrow. Then afterwards we are all go to the regularly scheduled therapy session.   I can't really contact his therapist for advice, or even call a lawyer because it is so late. Hand off is before things open in the morning as well - so there isn't anything I can do between now and then.   The only two options I have thought of is: a) to take M to the pediatrician when they open and let M go in alone to tell the doctor how they are feeling.  b) to take M to the courthouse with me in the AM, missing the hand off, and getting an emergency order from the DA.   I also thought of just heading to the police station now to see if I could ask an officer what to do, but then my spouse reminded me of this sub.   So... am I totally screwed? How can I protect my child?"	No
369	The short story is that the repairs our landlord has done to this house, starting from long before we moved in, are dangerously bad - ie; tin foil and duct tape holding together pipes, rags tied around pipes in leu of insulation, etc.   The latest issue is that water started pouring through the furnace and electric outlets because the roof is bad, we asked them to fix it, they came and dabbed some tar in random spots on the roof and left.  They insist that this was appropriate (they didn't even know where the leaks were inside the house and didn't come in to look and see if it was even safe with all the electric and water) and we had to shut off power to the furnace and ceiling because of all of the water and the antique cloth covered wires.    We have a baby due in two months and with all of the water/electricity being maintained in this way, there is no way it's safe for us to keep living here.  So we (while completely paid up to date on rent) told them that we would not be paying any further rent and are moving out as soon as possible, with a maximum of 30 days.  We have done several thousand dollars worth of improvement on the house, and we even told them to keep the security deposit.  We were late on rent one time last winter and the wife came over at 10pm at night with no warning screaming and accusing us of being liars, when we were genuinely just waiting for a check to clear.  They are very angry with us for blowing the whistle and calling it time to go, so with the wife's history of late night drama, I don't really feel safe having them come in the house when we are already this stressed and trying to move.    They are demanding entry, demanding to start showing the house and threatening to bring the police over to let them in.  As far as my legal knowledge goes, they can't possibly do anything of the sort - can they?  At this point this whole thing just seems insane - I just want to move somewhere where I know that my family is safe! We are in Michigan and this whole thing started on Monday.	No
370	I'm going through a divorce right now and I was hoping to get some guidance here. Im currently stationed in Virginia but was married in Alabama and thats where my soon to be ex-wife is currently living with our 2 children. So we have a mutual agreement contract which states she'll be taking all payments of the second vehicle and Ill be giving her a certain amount of money for child support until our children have reached the age of 18. The contract is signed by both of us and is notarized as well.  So on the beginning of this month when the contract was supposed to take place she told that she didnt want to buy the car from me because she doesn't want it.  So now Im stuck paying for another car I cant afford and was wondering if itll be worth getting an attorny to help with that along with the divorce paperwork. Like what would happen if I got an attorney to press that case for me? What would be the negative consequence of her breaching a contract? Or would I be out of more money than before because I now have to take that route. I was also hoping someone could tell me how long we have to be separated in Alabamas laws in order to file for divorce. Ive googled and I cant find anything on an amount of time we need to be separated. I know Virginias laws and they're easy to find but thats not the case for Alabama since we were married there.   Im planning on getting an attorney but I want to have as much knowledge as possible before I do. If you have any questions please ask. I'm activr military and Ive already spoken with legal quite a few times but it always comes down to then telling me to find an attorney in Alabama without any real guidance.   Thanks in advance!	No
371	Family law cases, including domestic violence and child custody, represent the largest category of cases closed by LSC grantees each year. Millions of women, men, and children experience domestic violence in the U.S. every year. Legal aid is essential to protect domestic violence victims and their families and to help them overcome many associated problems that can endanger their safety and stability.   In 2016 LSC grantees closed 115,977 domestic violence cases involving nearly 282,014 victims and their families. This represents nearly 16% of all cases closed by grantees nationwide.  Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. On average, nearly **20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States.** During one year, this equates to more than 10 million individuals.   Often survivors face additional legal problems. Ninety-seven percent of low-income households with survivors of recent domestic violence or sexual assault experienced at least one other civil legal problem in the past year, including 67% that have experienced 6+ problems.   A study by the Institute for Policy Integrity found that civil legal aid is more effective than access to shelters or counseling services in reducing domestic violence—by as much as 21%. Increasing a woman’s chances of obtaining a protective order is the most effective way that legal assistance can reduce domestic violence. Survivors of domestic violence rate the filing of a protective order as one of their two most effective tools for stopping domestic violence, second only to leaving the abuser. Representation is critical in these cases as **83% of victims represented by an attorney successfully obtained a protective order, compared to only 32% of victims without an attorney.**  LSC grantees help clients [provide safe, stable environments for their children](http://www.lsc.gov/legal-aid-helps-domestic-violence-survivor-save-her-home), [build violence-free lives](http://www.lsc.gov/protecting-mother-six-domestic-violence-alaska), and [reunite with their families](http://www.lsc.gov/helping-father-reunite-his-children).

372	"Ontario, Canada  My husband and I bought a new car in March. It was a showroom demo, so it was last year's model and had 10k on it. The manufacturer rebates let us upgrade to a nicer model because it had those kilometers on it.   At the beginning of May, we brought it in and told them it was leaking from the arm on the driver's side. They tried to say oh maybe the door wasn't shut right. I insisted they look anyways and once they pulled the interior plastic off and put the hose to it, it was like a sprinkler. They ended up pulling off the windshield and reseating it in new seals. At that point I paid nothing because of the warranty.  Now here we are over two months later. We've had a bad smell in the car for about a week. Took a few days to get into the dealer's shop. Asked them to do the free full inspection we got at 3 months owning the car and try to find the smell.  Turns out the back seat floor carpet (we are very very rarely in the backseat as it's just the two of us) is soaking wet and growing mold.   It's been raining a ton here lately, and we're both anal about closing windows since water in car = bad and nobody likes a wet butt. A couple weeks back it was raining so hard people were pulling over from low visibility, and we thought we heard water in the car but assumed it was splashing in the wheel well.   When the dealer service guy called back he told me this, said I had to have left a window open, and that I'd need to get the car detailed to ditch the smell.   I explained while it's not impossible that we left a window open, it's very unlikely, and our car had an established history of fucking leaking water inside. The guy repeated what he said and told us our car could be picked up. I hung up with him and called back to speak to the manager in service.   I told the manager I was beyond frustrated because we bought new specifically to avoid things like this. If we were gonna dump this much money into a car every year instead of it being a 13 year old junker trying to stay driving might as well buy new. I explained I didn't like being told it's my fault too bad, same as last time when I was told I must have ""shut the door wrong"" and it was a leak. That I suspect it's a leak again. That I don't want to come back for ""oop third time's the charm found all the leaks"". Service Manager laughed and said he doesn't want me in again unless it's routine service.   At this point the manager is sending it to a body shop owned by a good guy who my family sends all our business too, and I called him and he'll have his guys go through the car top to bottom to make sure everything is sealed right.   I'm very concerned about damage to the car. It's not even 4 months old.   1. At what point is the car a ""lemon"" and does that kind of thing even apply here?   2. What happens if the floor boards are rusted from the wet carpet for so many weeks (and who knows how long before that? Last summer when the sales guy drove it around?)  3. What happens if I keep finding leaks for all eternity?   4. What steps should I take to resolve this if things aren't being fixed? Like dealer/owner first, then corporate, then lawyer? My insurance? The warranty people?   This is our first time owning a brand new car that won't end up being sold to a scrapper for finally dying down. Please help. I'm lost and angry and not sure where to go next while I wait for the verdict from the body shop."	No
373	This is in KS.  My father passed away this morning. I am helping my mother through the process.  My family, including my mother, is worried about my brother going forward at this point. He has leeched off my parents his entire adult life, and now that my dad has passed we fear my brother's sense of grief and sympathy will not overpower his entitlement and he may try to take property or try to get money from my mother in her vulnerable state.   My father had a (small) life insurance policy and gets SSI. Other than that their assets are all in farmland/machinery/livestock.  What is the best way to go about making sure my mother is protected going forward so her, not my brother's, best interests are met?  Thanks.	No
374	State: North Carolina  As the title says my mother is having her children taken away from her, she has 6 children I am the oldest (23) so I no longer live with her. I have two brothers and three sisters ages range from 2-14. My mother, Stepfather (were divorced years ago but live together for kids) and his mother all lived in the same house. A month or so after my stepfathers mother died my stepfather has taken it upon himself to give my siblings to my grandmother (mothers side) and he is planning to pay no more bills on the house they've paid upwards of $100,000 on and is letting it be foreclosed upon and he simply wants to move into his place of business and drink/smoke the rest of his life away (Age 70), this is ruining our family, my mother was told to find somewhere else to stay which would put her and my two year old sister on the streets. (She was born after divorce, different father) My mother cared for my stepdads mother for months before she passed away (was 92) taking her to Dr visits, bathing her, feeding her, cleaning her room, washing her clothes and linens ETC, and now that she has passed my stepfather is basically self destructing claiming he will let house be foreclosed on (It is his own house that was handed down to him after his mother passed) and is separating my siblings apart by letting them stay with my grandmother, when my mother and stepdad were divorced he won custody but she retained her parental right. My grandmother moved in to assist with my siblings when my mother moved out. After 2 years my mother moved back in  to care for his mother and my grandmother moved out.   My siblings went and stayed with my grandmother for the weekend (as they normally do), when they all left on Friday my mother was told that she would bring them back Tuesday, well, that turned into two weeks and about 50 missed phone calls from my mother to my grandmother, when she finally got in contact with her she was told they  were living there now. This was all done behind my mother and my back, we were completely unaware that my stepfather/grandmother were planning this.   Is there anything at all my mother can do to keep her children (take them back from my grandmother) and continue living there? If not living there just get her children back?     My mom does not have money for a lawyer and is really side  swiped by all of this as we didn't see any of this coming.  I really do not know what to do to help her so I'm posting here, Thank you so much to whomever can give me some advice.	No
375	"I understand that getting legal advice like this on the internet can be complicated and I'm certainly not looking for definitive answers. I'm also aware how during a divorce there is always hearsay and he-said, she-said or just the old two sides to every story. I would ask though that given this is my life and my family, whom I know intimately and have decades of anecdotal evidence I'm basing this off of. I would ask that within the constraints of this post we just more or less take my statements and fact and then offer your advice accordingly. My intention here is to find a starting point with some good professional advice in what is likely to be a long and complicated road ahead.  My mother married a mentally unstable and physically abusive/alcoholic narcissist. It has taken me many years of living on my own to be able to get my bearings and see him for what he is and although he was certainly not always this way he has started to get worse as it seems he's now working towards an agenda.   I don't see him as this particular mastermind as it is clear he is riddled with mental issues which have gone undiagnosed all his life as he both denies any and all of it and also refuses treatment. However I have recently learned from my mother that a woman, lets call her Becky, with whom my father has had an affair with in the past is back in the picture. Rather she never left the picture, it's just that Becky and my father have gotten sloppy and my mom has noticed. Becky it seems also has a long history, looking back in hindsight, of being EXTREMELY effective at manipulation and extracting money from people. My father is also one of those people (some of you may be able to relate) who puts external social validation WELL above the needs/validation of family....  Becky started out as a family friend about ~15yrs ago. Because my father so vehemently vouched for her it took a long time for her shitty personality traits to shine through on its own and about 9 yrs ago my mother, brother and I all confronted my father and explained to him that she is no good. That we no longer are willing to deal with or finance any of her bullshit. Especially if it means doing so puts our family in financial distress. Then perhaps 5 yrs ago my mother had to overhaul their finances and discovered my dad had several maxed out CC's which he was in the process of having sent to collections. At the time just his off-center personality explained these away and we did not dig into it much more but I've recently found out. That as far back as 3 yrs ago my mother was informed through a trusted friend that Becky and my father were seeing each other a few times a year.... every year... now those CCs make more sense. My father also has not worked a 9-5 in his entire life. He has had some work in the past but has mostly been living off my mother and drinking for the last ~10yrs.  Again, I have to stress that I don't think my father is capable of scheming so much as Becky is capable of putting thoughts and words into his head. It would seem that he is convinced that if my mother were to divorce him, since they live in California, he would get alimony and half of the assets. He and my mother are on the deed to their house however my mother is only one supporting them and paying the mortgage. Given the most recent phone calls I've had with my mother and hearing the distress in her voice with all the mental gymnastics my father knows how to put people through I get the impression he is hoping that a suicide would leave everything to him. Not that he can afford the mortgage, but he could certainly liquidate, downsize and then Becky would be able to live off of that for quite some time. The thing we discovered about Becky, again, hearsay, but people who know her who have reached out to us... this was many years ago. Said she was involved with another man in the exact same way. She leeched off of him and his family for many years and then the wife ""killed herself."" I'm laying this out because this is the kind of sick and twisted people my father is associated with. I wouldn't put anything past him at this point because he does own guns and I'm sure if Becky told him to kill my mom, he would just do it. He has done more irrational things in the past on a whim and I know in a divorce situation emotions run high and these threats can be thrown around without there usually being much validity. It's just that knowing my father I know he is more than capable of it because he's not mentally sound and he's clearly working for the interests of a person who while not crazy is certainly not a good person and like my father I feel I would be making a mistake by believing there is some line of rationality and reason which these people will not cross.  In my mind I want to treat this as a ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"" kind of situation.  I hope that was mostly coherent enough, as it is I had to spend 30min on the treadmill to clear my head enough and organize my thoughts.  Any advice is much appreciated."	No
376	So In January I signed a lease for an apartment with three of my friends. In February I was diagnosed with GBS. A rare spinal cord disease. Now I'm unsure on my ability to return to school (3 hours from home) this semester. My university wants me to wait one more semester before I return. Can my medical status be used to get out of my lease?	No
377	"Like the title states I'm currently employed in Chapel Hill North Carolina and am interviewing for a new job this coming Wednesday. I've only been back from vacation for 13 days and if on Wednesday I am offered a job and give my two weeks notice the same day I will not be safe from the 6 weeks restriction. The policy verbatim from the employee handbook states   ""I understand that payment for PTO is subject to continued employment. If I am seperated for any reason within six weeks of the use of PTO I will not be entitled to receive pay for time not worked. If the PTO has already been paid, the company may deduct this from my paycheck. Payment for PTO is subject to home office verification of eligibility.""  This may be a stupid question but this is my first full time job where vacation was even offered and I'm not sure if this is common practice. Any help is appreciated."	No
378	I finally moved out from the apartment and all my belongings were safe and sound. Before the move out period, however, she made some insults and neglected her duty of keeping the place clean.   She's asking me about $500 for the extra week's stay, $150 for the labor for installation, and electricity bill that came when she specified that previous one was the last one I had to pay.  Now, none of these were written on the paper and I don't think I am legally required to make these payments. She still hasn't apologized and what not. Should I just move on with my life and not pay her a cent? (I did pay for the door cost and transportation for the door)  She originally tried to rip me off by adding personal purchases onto the recipt and overcharging the whole cost and now she's down to all minimums.	No
379	I had some misdemeanor charges expunged at the start of the year.  I know at the county level it's complete. They made mention that it can take a bit more time at the state level.  I'm being offered a job and I need to fill out background check info. Im not sure if I should put it on there or not.  I know that some BG check companies 'cache' backgrounds so it might still be listed, but I can't find any info online about my case. The TN site doesn't show anything, but I'm not sure it ever did.  What should I do?	No
380	My deceased grandmother died in 2009 and she left me money in her will. My aunt is the executor of the will but won't pay it out, and I'm legally an adult now so what options do I have in claiming this? Also the will dictates that there is cash money in my name but my aunt says that the money was put into a 529 college plan for me.   What should I do?	No
381	"Hi /r/legaladvice,  Let me preface this post with some background on the situation. I'm beginning college at the University of Washington in Seattle, and I found an apartment community several blocks away from campus. It's a wonderful place with a plethora of amenities, and rent is fairly reasonable considering the exorbitant living cost of Seattle. I was set to move in on August 1st. Everything seemed great until my family and I actually visited the apartment several weeks before my lease began. The entire community is designated as no-smoking, and their contract explicitly states that “smoking is prohibited at the Residential Community, including the Leased Premises…” However, when we first viewed the place on July 21st, there was a clear and pungent cigarette smell in the bathroom, as well as in the washing and drying machines. Moreover, the living room walls were dotted with nail holes and scuffs were easy to spot on the walls. Okay, no big deal. The manager mentioned that the painters had not furnished the apartment yet, and most of the damage would be restored by move-in day. We were just getting a “preliminary tour” of the room.  We visited a second time on July 24th, this time with friends. The four of us spent a while checking the place out, taking measurements, etc. To our dismay, the smell was ever present, as were the scuffs and everything else. I made a comment about it to the other manager showing us the place, who claimed the painters had already been here and done their job. Clearly not.   Fast forward to today, August 1st, which is supposed to be my move in day. Upon arrival, we were baffled that the smell *still* lingered, and the walls hadn’t even been painted since our first visit! I compared photos from our preliminary visit on July 21st to the current state of the apartment, and the same scuffs and cracks are visible! Everything is exactly as we first saw it. There wasn’t even an *attempt* to mask the wear-and-tear from the previous tenant!  I confronted the manager about this, and she insists that the painters and cleaners have already cleaned and repaired the previous tenant’s damages. This is wholly false, and photographs speak much louder than words.  I'm honestly at a loss for words right now. The nicotine smell in the bathroom, scuffs on the wall, and cracks in the corner of the alcove don’t bother me. What does bother me, however, is the fact that I was blatantly lied to. The manager claimed the apartment had been furnished and touched up by the painters and cleaners, when there is little to no sign of any effort to restore the place.   This situation violates the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment that was promised and expected on move-in day. I paid a $300 deposit that covers any holes, scuffs, cracks, or other normal wear and tear that I leave behind after my lease is up. Perfectly reasonable, right? The Move-Out clause of the contract reads, “residents will be charged for damage to the Leased Premises beyond ‘normal wear and tear’. Repair and replacement damages will be billed at actual charges."" Damage beyond ""normal wear and tear"" includes damage from cigarette smoke, so I'm confused why management did not charge the previous tenant extra for cleaning costs. Why am I stuck with this lingering smell, when it was management's duty to prevent it?  What can I do in this situation? I can’t move in until the apartment is actually furnished, which was supposed to be today. I am currently writing an email to management explaining the situation. Anything I should draw specific attention to?  Thanks all for the help!"	No
382	A few months back, I had to quickly leave my apartment due to unsafe living conditions, and asked a friend of mine if I could stay with her for a bit. She agreed, and after a few days we had talked and come up with the idea that she would probably just sign the lease over to us and find another place to stay since her sister had moved out. After a week of me staying with her, she accused us of hiding dog shit under her covers and kicked us out with a night's notice. So, we had to pack up and leave in a rush. After that we were homeless for a few weeks until we were able to find an apartment, and have been living quite happily since. A month ago, our former friend texted me saying that she wanted me to pay for subletting fees that she was charged and damages to the room and carpetting of the apartment saying that she had been charged by her landlord for subletting fees and having 4 cats and a dog in her apartment.  Now, it has been a few months since we lived there, but on our way out I don't remember anything being stained or damaged. I don't even know if she has a case against us since we didn't pay her any money or anything like that and I'm unfamiliar with how civil court works in regards to this? Any info on what I could do or if she even has a case against us would be greatly appreciated	No
383	"Hello guys,  Well, the mother of my child is moving away with my kid about 300+ miles away from me. We were never married but have had split custody without any official court order for that matter.  I have had a personal addiction problem which I have sought treatment in recently after getting into Rehab.  She gave me the heads up of her move well over a year ago and I did not put up with a fight due to my admittance of personal demons.  At the moment I am clean and have turned a new leaf although I am within 3 months of recovery I'd rather not elaborate.  Despite my problem I have always held down a job, often two when no overtime is available.  I live with both parents, one who is retired and taking care of my child most days of the week and another who is retiring within the year to dedicate bringing my child to school and taking care of her.  Now this was something the mother of my child and I were ok with as our plan for 5 years.  However, she is still adamant of moving away.  She virtually has the worst credit score, car repo'd, lives with either her spouse or family.  I am not on child support however I make sure to give her a couple hundred+ monthly which was originally for day care services however, she hasn't been in day care for over a year.  (Maybe longer, it's hard to believe her at this point.)  Now with my health and wellness getting in order I fear for my child.  Her mom still plans on moving to LA despite no vehicle, credit score, and no family in that area, let alone a true job option or place (she is waiting on section 8).   She's ""almost done"" with school  and does not have a good employment history.   I really want to fight for full custody and keep my child with me and my parents, we even had a school lined up a few blocks away from my house but the mother of my child immediately interjected at my suggestion with ""shes not going to school here"".  With her vehicle repo'd I told her that I wanted my child with me being that you don't have a car nor stable home to live in and she was adamant of her moving to LA.  Despite no vehicle her response was ""she'll just have to school late"", she will be attending 1st grade.  I am really trying to not let the stress get to me.  I do NOT anticipate a relapse nor am I considering it, but I really want full custody of my child.  I work 7 days, 56 hours a week as my parents depend on me to maintain my good credit score (they have filed for bankruptcy) and despite the economy, there retirement pay supports our household."	No
384	My grandfather is 86 years old and stubborn and pretty much what the title says. He lives in his own room in my parents house where he has his own bathroom, he doesn't drive so my dad drives him to the grocery store for groceries.   He will not go to the doctor even if there's something wrong like he has a cold or something like that. He doesn't shower and lies to my parents and says that he does. He doesn't wash his bed sheets or clothes and he doesn't throw anything away. A lot of his shirts are stained with holes.   He has a mini fridge and freezer in his room, but he stores items on a shelf when they should be refrigerated such as mayonnaise and eggs.   I know my dad doesn't want to physically make him do things, what else can they do?   Can my parents get in serious trouble for letting this continue? Is this considered elder neglect?   Thank you	No
385	Greetings,  I've recently unearthed a bit of a problem with my home. There's a 300 sq ft addition on the house that was previously a screened patio. It was enclosed pretty cheaply, but it feels mostly like livable space (it has a step-down from main structure due to patio foundation, its own wall A/C, and it is attached / open via doors to the main structure, painted drywall, tile floor, etc)  The problem is that I've only recently discovered when trying to replace the roof that this addition is almost definitely NOT up to code, and wasn't even permitted. So any permit application for roof work will not pass, and could even require me to demo the room.  The sellers' listing, an appraisal, and my inspector all seemed to count it as livable square footage (my inspector did point out the framing is a metal patio framing and not a 'structural wall', but as a first time home buyer and no explicit mention of a code violation / it being unpermitted I didn't pay much attention to it). According to the roofing contractors speaking on my behalf to the county, it absolutely should not have counted. The county's field-appraisal also counted it (building code and appraisal/tax offices being different) and I've been paying taxes on it. Lost property taxes for a couple of years are less of a concern than how to fix this structure and get myself up to code.  I'm considering talking to a lawyer, but I don't have a ton of cash and don't want to burn through several hundred here and there on things I may not need when the end result could just be that I have to rebuild this as a costly, to code home addition. My understanding is that verifying the square footage is the responsibility of the buyer during the inspection period, but this seems a little extreme and I feel as though may have been misled about the value of the home when I bought it.  A few other considerations: The county's property appraisal site had a permit listed titled 'RESIDENTIAL - ADDITION'. I always thought this was the permit for the room, and I'm guessing it may have fooled at least one other (if not every single other) person involved. Looking up the permit number on the county's building permitting site provides more information, and informs me that it was actually just for a main structure roof reshingle. The moment I saw this is the moment I knew I really had a problem.  The seller I bought from did not build this addition. She purchased the home as-is from a foreclosure, so I know the bank wasn't required to disclose this to her. She's required to disclose it to me (if she knew about it), and I have a signature on 'disclosures' documents that all improvements were permitted. But I'm guessing it hinges heavily on if she actually knew about it, and if she needed to defend herself she could easily make the case that she didn't.  Now I'm trying to determine the best way to spend the funds I have carefully to solve this huge problem, since I can't ever sell the house now knowing there's a code violation it MUST be fixed some way or another. I'm working on some estimates with some contractors to get an accurate estimate and the only thing I know for sure if that I need more than I have (I do have good credit, and equity due to the market increasing so I have loan options).  Do I have any legal recourse here against the seller or appraisers, or is it really just the buyer's responsibility to verify what the seller says and that's the end of it? They can almost say whatever they want?  One piece of information I don't have, but that I'd like to get, is the square footage history of the home with each sale from the county (if they have it). For example, if she bought it from foreclosure listed as a certain square footage and then turned around and sold it for more maybe I'd have a case that she should've known something was off? Since I don't have this information yet, I'd appreciate advice without making an assumption on this part, though.  Thank you for any advice!	No
386	"I have been looking at places to move to ASAP for a couple weeks. I just started a new job so will be paid Friday.  I haven't had to pay rent for the whole time I lived here until this month. 200 was the new verbal agreement. Landlord had agreed to accept late payment due to my circumstances.  The roommates (one landlord's daughter ""C"" and the other guy ""M"") have been very aggressive, blaming things on me and such. I have been trying to keep to myself and focus on leaving.   M threatened me last night when I refused to abandon my room before I move. He wanted me to move my stuff out and live on the couch. I refused respectfully, he proceeded to cuss me out and threaten me.   I left for work early and came back to find my bedding on the couch, my books hastily stacked in a box and my bed flipped on its side. I want to go buy a lock but an waiting on Metro PD to respond and hopefully tell me my options.  I decided to call Metro PD when I couldn't reach the landlord. My roommates aren't home that I can tell.  I think legally I am still allowed to be here. I have received no notice from my landlord of any changes since past telling her I would be paying for July late."	No
387	"The car that hit the plaintiff has a 2 channel dashcam, so it records the front and the back. You can see that the victim was not hit nor did I feel a hit, but ""if anything"" might have been clipped - it would have been grocery bags she was carrying, making her superficially wider for the narrow ramp. Currently working with the insurance company at the moment, sent videos (in HD) and letter, but I'm curious to know what I should be prepared for? The videos show no hit. The after moments show the plaintiff making a ""mean face"" at the rear of the car, then adjusting their grocery bags from one side to another, and finally walking up the ramp showing no signs of injury. It all seems to be in my favor, but if not - how should I prepare? Secondly, if it comes out that this was a false claim, are there steps I should take against the plaintiffs?"	No
388	"I don't know if this is the best thread to post in but it's the closest thing I have because I don't have anywhere else to look.    Hypothetically, one my of friends is an international student from an Asian country living here as a student. He has no green card but he does have a working permit. He had previous situations with his host family that made him homeless for a while. He found a new family (I'm not sure if they're his legal guardians, but they are on his school papers and in order to continue school, they are required)    Now this is when the situation gets fucky because recently the new family has been arguing about him and essentially lost the ""trust"" in him and now is forcing him to pay back his ""debts"". Debts which include food, water, room, air, etc. All of this is done while his life savings is held under pressure. They apparently have proof that he was living under their roof for free. Along with this they are forcing him to find a job (basically means he is not allowed in the house) He is afraid that he is going to be deported if he tries anything legal and I can see why. He has had many close encounters with being deported back whether it was due to financial issues or family issues. I want to help him (tried talking to my manager about getting him a job) but I don't know how to legally help so I'm going to this subreddit for help. If possible, I would like to know if I could potentially become his host family so I would be on his school papers instead of the other people.    If this is the wrong request in the wrong subreddit, I apologize and ask that you refer me to a subreddit in which people will know I want to do. Many thanks in advance."	No
389	I'm asking for my friend since we're not sure.   On July 1st, she spoke with the manager and got the okay to extend the rent until July 14th. Yesterday she received a eviction notice to pay or quit, but it didn't include late fees like it did the last time (8 months ago, under different management).    And also, the rent amount is wrong. It's supposed to be 1028.46 but the manager put 1024.86 cents. She's fine with paying the correct amount, but there isn't a late fee included. Thanks in advance :)   Her lease does include late fees, but not sure if eviction notice walls under that or if it has to be precise on wording.	No
390	In Upstate NY, my parents own 15 acres adjacent to a conservation group tasked with preserving and enhancing wetlands.   For the last 20 years, each summer, the water proceeds to flood further into their property destroying the woods, trails, landscaping and have even flooded their basement several times. What legal recourse could they take against a federally funded conservation group?   Its obvious that their property value has drastically decreased as a result of this and similar neighbors in the area have also expressed the same issue.   Most of the federal officials tasked with addressing complaints are near impossible to get ahold of and have little interest in hearing the complaints.   Unfortunately, they do not have a lot of money to be able to finance prolonged legal action.	No
391	I am going to summarize this the best I can, I apologize ahead of time I am terrible at explaining.   I work for a Managed Service IT Provider. I work out of a satellite office 53 miles from the main office, my office is in a Office Shares building and the rent is $500 a month. My company has decided that the office isn't work the cost anymore. Which I am totally fine with, a few complications like not having a ton of work-space at my house for computer/server setup. I normally get paid Mileage to travel from my office to a clients office because of using my personal vehicle.  Here is the issue I am running into. My boss would like me to go on-site to a client's location and be there for half the day. The issue is my mileage from my home to the client's office isn't going to be considered an expense mileage I can get reimbursed for. He would like me to work from the main office once a week as well - not mileage.   This means driving 106 miles to the main office and back isn't considered mileage anymore. I have an issue with this, as I use the mileage I claim for wear and tear on my vehicle. Currently after adding up all the extra mileage my boss now wants me to drive it is almost 6 times what I would be driving to and from work. This doesn't include if I have to go to another client's office for an issue as this mileage isn't   My question to everyone here, is this illegal? What can I show my boss proving this?  Thanks ahead of time.	No
392	I'm a 2L student currently, and my friend is having all sorts of issues with his previous landlord. Basic facts:  * Signed lease for the apartment (never got his copy of it though), landlord only owns 2 units * Broke the lease 3 months early and moved to Kentucky, agreed on a subletter with the landlord * Assessed damages (all legit, he kinda wrecked the apartment) for the entirety of the deposit when he moved out and subletter moved in * Now the lease has officially expired (yesterday) and the landlord sent him a bill (via text message) for another $430 beyond the security deposit he has already kept. New charges are for additional damages cause by my friend that 'weren't assessed' when he moved out, plus a couple cleaning charges.  My questions: how much time can my friend negotiate for to pay back the $430 in additional damages? What kind of things should he be asking to see from the landlord?  Thanks!	No
393	My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	No
394	So the title says my STBX and I are getting divorced. There was a domestic incident tonight and I'm filing for a restraining order in the morning. I've read the documents online but I'm still confused on whether or not I need to file for temporary custody of our son separately or if that will be granted with the OFP?  I'm in MN.	No
395	Not sure what to do. He was supposed to drop off the keys to me yesterday, and instead texted me that he would be returning my deposit because his partners had decided to sell the house and they are now in escrow. I mentioned legal action, which I cannot afford, and he didn't care and told me not to threaten him. On Tuesday I will now be homeless with an entire apartment worth of stuff with no plave to go. What is my best option here?	No
396	I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical. When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas. A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call  b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her.  Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request. I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper). *Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty.  *She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.” *Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them. *I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored. *I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.) *I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy. *My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic. *My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call. When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy. Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.	No
397	I'm an FLSA exempt employees in California.  Last weekend, my employer had a major emergency and needed me to remedy it.  After working my 40 hour week, I was kept in the office until obscene hours and asked to return each day of the weekend.  When the problem was fully solved, I had spent nearly 40 extra hours working between the hours of 6pm friday and midnight Sunday. I slept very little each day. When I asked if I could take Monday off to fix my sleep schedule, I was told no. I have yet to receive any extra compensation and am being asked to work every Saturday for a month, on top of my Monday-Friday work week. By EOD this Saturday, I believe I will have seen a 90+ hour work week with no extra compensation.  Enough of the sob story. I just wanted to give context around the magnitude of the situation.  I've read many posts on FLSA exempt employees and how they can be required to work extra without a compensation change. I consider that a given.  My question is, what's the upper boundary of extra required hours? Surely there are laws to protect these workers from situations that are a danger to their health?	No
398	My wife and I are filing for divorce, and we're keeping the debts that are in our name after the marriage. I'm currently filling out the forms and it's asking for us to list all our debts, before and during the marriage.   Can we just keep this blank or should we fill it out? Does this become public information? I know you can get things sealed, but I'm doing all of this online and I'm not sure the online application has the option of requesting this. I'd rather not pay any lawyer fees as otherwise this really is a peaceful separation. Thanks!	No
399	Hi all. I work part time at a shitty job that I really don't enjoy. I keep track of my hours and I have gotten paid for all of them except for two.  I worked for four days on the week of June 26th and last Friday on July 7th.  I'm supposed to get paid weekly. So let's say I work the week of June 26th; I get paid for that week the that Friday, June 30th.  So I go in June 30th for my pay for the week of June 26th, and my boss says he is busy and because I did not call to let him know I would be picking up my paycheck, he will pay me next time I come in. Okay, fair.  I come in July 2nd and my boss tells me he may as well consolidate the check for the week of July 26th and my pay for whatever other days I work on the week of July 3rd.  So I come in Friday the 7th of July to work, and while I am working my boss tells me checks didn't come in this week, they should be in by Wednesday, July 12th.  Isn't this in violation of the FLSA? He hasn't paid me for the close of a pay period (Week of June 26th and the Friday of June 7th, which he told me he would consolidate).  What should I do? Can/should I take legal action before tomorrow? If tomorrow rolls around and he doesn't pay me, what do I do?  I do not know any personal information about my boss. No contact info, anything. I know his first and last name. The only way to reach him is at my place of work, if he's there, and if he feels like coming to the phone because 50% of the time he's busy. I also overheard him talking to a coworker where the coworker told him he recalled once when he hadn't paid him for months- because my boss needed his social security. Is what my boss is doing illegal? He's not paying us adequately, and he is hiring people without their social security. He also handles tons of raw food without gloves and forces us to do the same. Asking to use gloves while handling results in a simple answer from him: a firm 'no'. Can someone help? I feel like this place is very shady.	No
400	I am living abroad of US but in an American company. My question is, if a female security guard in an American company wants to have a child just for herself and she chooses a coworker male security guard as donor for giving birth to child, does it effect according to US HR regulation their employment in American company? If the donor has a wife and children.	No
401	So I have a roommate who wants to leave the lease before it starts. (The 1st of september) We have already submitted our paper work for our lease renewal. Any idea what i can do? I live in maryland if that helps at all. I thought it was a binding contract and if he wants removed from the lease everyone on it has to agree.( three of us on the the lease) Please any information with a source is extremely valued.	No
402	My son is currently in an inpatient psych unit. He may be discharged within the next couple of days because his insurance doesn't think he needs that level of care. His psychiatrist disagrees, but insurance has the final word. It has been mentioned to me that his father and I could say we aren't taking him home because we couldn't provide the care he needs and then the state would step in. This is called a 51A I'm told.   I have no desire to do this and will only do this if we feel he will hurt himself or others once he is home. This is one of the reasons he is inpatient at the moment. He is absolutely no better today then when he went in there 2 weeks ago.   Anyone have information on what happens if we do this? How do we get control back of our son? Who would make his medical decisions? Would we be able to see him?	No
403	So I submitted my K1 visa petition back near end of May.  It went to California which shows 3.5 month processing time (should get word in September).  The next steps are confusing.  Some say you fill out support information and gather civil documents and pay a fee for consulate interview and should be a fast process.  When I look at NVC website, they are saying copies of documents mentioned above go to NVC for processing before the consulate interview and can take up to 11 weeks to process now!  What is the correct process and is it really 11 weeks to process at NVC before an interview can be arranged (which takes 3 weeks to get that set up)?  If anyone can help me understand the process and timeline, I would appreciate it!	No
404	I have filled out a template that an attorney created in order to get my grandfather's birth certificate from New York state, I'm just not certain that in tailoring it to my specific case that I have maintained its accuracy. I need his birth cert. because I am applying for dual Italian citizenship and a court order is the only way to get it. I live in Oregon and will be doing everything remotely. Basically, I know nothing about court proceedings, filing, the process, etc. If I make a mistake in my documents, will I be given the chance to fix it, or will my filing fee be wasted and my filing ignored? Also, the template was created on the assumption that I would be going in person to file, and therefore includes blank spaces for dates and times of scheduled appearances. Do I remove those items entirely, or leave in (and leave blank) because my documents will eventually get before a judge at a certain time on a certain date? Thank you!	No
405	I rented a room in a house in Texas, sharing with two other tenants, who also have rooms to themselves. However, shortly after I moved in, **my landlord flew over one day from his home in another state and started living and sleeping in the common room, which is in the middle of the house. He works at the dining table all day and sleeps on a sofa in the living room, which is right in front of the front door.**  ---  **This means that the living room is always occupied by my landlord, and that I walk by him every time I have to go to the bathroom or the kitchen. When he is here, none of my friends are willing to visit**, because he's in the common area with us. He can also hear anything we say or do in my room, and if he's sleeping we can't even turn on the lights in the common room.  My roommates and I all feel very invaded by his presence and I wouldn't have agreed to move here if I had known he would be living in shared spaces for weeks at a time. **Wendell stays for 2 to 3 weeks each time he visits, and he never announces when he'll be coming.** It's just one day he's here. He visits every 2 months or so. Also, he tries to get us to drive him back to the airport when he leaves, without any notice. One time he knocked on our doors at 2 AM and asked us to drive him to the airport without any prior notice, a 25 minute drive each way. I didn't answer the door when he knocked, but my roommate did, and my landlord became angry when my roommate refused.  He also doesn't respect the standards of cleanliness my roommates and I agreed upon. (Unrelated, but he also refuses to fix the broken outlet in the bathroom, the missing knob on the oven so we don't know what temperature it's set to, or my roommate's door, which doesn't close. He doesn't let us use the mailbox, so I got a PO box)  He uses my bathroom when he's here, which I already share with one of my roommates. He blocked it off one day to redo the grouting, but didn't warn us ahead of time and we couldn't shower when we got home that day. Luckily my gym has showers. If he came home occasionally for a few days at a time, I would be fine with that as long as he announces it beforehand and he has a reason to be here, like renovations. But I'm pretty sure he just uses it as he pleases. He usually is not here to do renovations, let alone 3-week-long renovations.  A few months ago he bumped up my monthly rent by $50. He also just recently tried to make me responsible for mowing his lawn.  **I feel deceived that he didn't tell me before I moved in that he'd live with us (there's also nothing about it in the contract). I think it's unreasonable to have to be okay with your landlord living with you unannounced in your common areas for weeks at a time.** I want to move out ASAP but I've been jobless since May and I want to find a job before trying to move. As soon as I find a new job, I am finding a new home.  I don't even know if I still have the power to get rid of him, since I've allowed it for so long at this point.  But for the past two days I have been stewing about it and can't take it much longer.  ---  In the mean time, one of the roommates has just moved out and a new one is coming here on Wednesday for six months. The third roommate is on a lease that ends in November this year.  Mine is monthly and I'm trying to get out ASAP.  What recourse do I have, and can you offer my roommates and me any advice for what we should say or do for this situation? He is in the living room now, and has been here for almost two weeks this time around.  We're in Austin, Texas. Here are the only relevant parts of the contract: http://imgur.com/a/QtAH7	No
406	Simply put my husband wants to name our daughter something gross. I don't know if he is serious or not. But I am not ok with the name. Can I name her without his consent? OR will she just have to be named Baby A until we can agree on something? I dont want her to grow up thinking we hate her.  The name for the curious: Marc-Geraldine. Yuck.	No
407	"I live in the state of Alabama, and we noticed yesterday around 3pm that there was a steady stream of water running down the parking lot. I immediately called the water company who was out within 30mins and he assisted me in determining that the break was on the Apartments side not the water company. So around 4pm I called the apartments emergency maintenance number and stated the issue on a voicemail machine. The ""head"" maintenance man came over around 4:40pm and said along the lines ""that it is Friday and he can't do the work by himself and everyone was gone that it would have to wait till first thing Monday morning"". The issue is we have no toilets, water for bathing, or can't even cook. My daughter has Celiac disease so all our cooking has to be done at home. We have used all our cook ware being 3 meals into the issue already, I have access to JAG but does no good being the weekend. My neighbors have already stated that if I make to many waves that I would be evicted for the smallest infraction they could find, so please if anyone has any sort of advice please help!"	No
408	Hi everyone! I'm in a apartment building in Massachusetts and hoping to be able to break our lease.   My main question is this - technically the CURRENT lease ends Aug 31, however our unit makes us resign our lease in April (3 months ago) for the following year if we plan on staying. Is it possible that since the active lease ends Aug 31 we have a chance of cancelling the lease we signed that doesn't start until Sep 1st?  Thank you for all of your help!!!	No
409	Please help.  I am a young woman undergoing a divorce for a very short term marriage. Here's the deets:  1. Married for 6 months - Separated for 8 months. I left, he filed.  2. No children 3. Annulments/dissolutions out of question - Can't agree on retrieving my belongings 4. He has wedding jewelry and engagement ring, wedding money, and all my premarital belongings (lived together 5 years).  I left with only the clothes on my back. 5. He has only let me retrieve anything I could list with the aid of a magistrates order. (i.e. he kept anything I didn't specifically list - things like college diplomas/tax return documents/mail/family heirlooms etc)  I have not been allowed on the property since January 2017. I want a walk through to pack because it's impossible to list everything I owned. 6. Got my clothes back after 3 months - clothes damaged 7. Got some family furniture back after 7 months - damages 8. He is asking for my 401K (he has worked for 7 years, I have worked for 1 - I have stopped contributing once I found out he wanted it, but don't know what judge would rule in his favor)  9. Attempted court ordered mediation, but could not agree on time to meet with mediator (his choice of course)  My lawyer is very...relaxed.  Tells me I don't need to prepare anything for our defense for our pretrial that's upcoming.  Any advice?    1. Should I be working to build a defense?  I have photos of damages, harassment, texts proving he still has my jewelry, proof he deposited all the wedding money into his own account, credit card statements proving I purchased a bulk of premarital items that he wont let me retrieve, etc. But my lawyer says I don't need any of that.  2. Does he have a shot at my 401k? Does he have a shot at the money saved between marriage date and now? Or between marriage date and date which I left the martial residence?  3. What happens after the pretrial?  Wishing I was more educated on my rights. Please help. Thank you Reddit fam.	No
410	She also needs to get checked up at the hospital, but her mom isn't paying for any type of insurance for her even though she has the money, and shes not taking her to the hospital. My girlfriend has social security checks because of a family members death that she has been recieving since she was 12, but she can't use them because she's only 17 and they go directly to her mother's account which she spends on jewelry and food for herself instead of things like insurance etc... Theres also occasions where my girlfriend literally cannot eat because her mom won't buy her food, and her mom always tells her to get a job but won't take her anywhere to get the things required for a job. (Shes been accepted after an interview 3 times but things keep shitting up) CPS has been called multiple times but her mom fixes the issues before they get there since they apparently need a day in advance and they see that everything is okay. Is there anything we can do about this?  (We're both 17)	No
411	"So I recently moved into a new place, but my old landlord keeps dodging me. He keeps saying that he's sending my security deposit back from my old place, which I left absolutely spotless, but it's been two months and I'm still missing my entire deposit. I thought of recording him on the phone where I request either the bill for the damages or the deposit back, but don't know if this is the best idea. For the record his real estate ""company"" no longer exists and the only address is a PO box he gave me. Is this an issue of I should've been smarter to begin with or is there anyway I can still get my somewhat large deposit back? Thanks for all your help"	No
412	Our toilet has been not flushing, stuff floating up the pipes, bad flow since start of April when we moved in. The maintenance has been around 7 times , and last month they finally brought in a plumber to diagnose and he cleared some wax bloackage. Still wasn't working so on their 8th visit, it was replaced with a new toilet today. Is there anything we can do to claim for all the extra water used for flushing 2-4 times just to get toilet paper down, and not having a basic feature work properly? Or are we compensated with the replacement?	No
413	"Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.  Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.  Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an ""online debit card"" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this ""online debit card"" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.  Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like ""what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc"" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.  Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.  It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.  It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.    I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...  I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn."	No
414	"Was at walmart last night and was walking up the frozen food isle to start heading to check out. Right as I reached the end of the isle I slipped smacked the side of my face along my jaw against the freezer door, landed on my butt and hit my left elbow, ankle and tailbone. Along with catching my toe on one of those end racks. Thankfully a friend was with me and helped me up. The back of my pants were soaked. Sure enough I slipped in a puddle of water. Now it had been raining, so I grabbed the first employee I saw and let them know I was injured and there was water on the floor. He spoke no English and didnt understand I needed a manager. I had to almost drag him to where I fell to even get him to pay attention. He still didn't call a manager. Went to customer service and they were gonna make me wait. So we went to jewelry where someone finally called a manager. Waited 10 min before they came up. She handed me an incident report and asked where it occurred. I told her the location and her reply was ""we have busted pipes up there that leak and need to be fixed"" and I was not the first injury. So they know there's a leak, and have neglected to fix it or put up a sign. I currently have no insurance but my jawline to my temple is killing me, my elbow hurts and it feels like I tore something in my left shoulder. What happens if I go to a doctor seeing as I don't have insurance? would walmart need to pay my medical bills. Could I sue for negligence? Or what can I do. Thank you for any and all advice in advance. I'm in Dallas Texas."	No
415	My ex-and I have had a horrible divorce (like the majority of them).  He has caused many issues in my new relationship.  The strain has caused my new husband to leave a few times because he could handle the verbal abuse of my ex.  Me and my new husband have come to terms with our situation and decided to face that is our life and we are moving forward.  We are not going to separate anymore.  My ex is not happy that me and my new husband are staying together.  Has threatened to get a Guardian ad Litem for my 11 year old.  There is no abuse in our home and my son is loved.  Can my ex (who is living with his girlfriend an no legal place of his own) get custody of my child because of my new husband leaving before?	No
416	Hello. I am a renter currently living in Pinellas County Florida. I would like to break my lease.  I have payed rent on time for the first 6 months of my 12 month lease. There is one other person on the lease who I share my apartment with. We currently with to find a new place to live as the duplex we are renting is too costly to be considered practical.   From light research I have discovered that, from what I can tell, If I am to break my lease early I will still be responsible for the remainder of the rent due for the next six months(Bad!). There are two ways that I can see in which I may be able to circumvent this and would like to know the validity of these approaches.(Good!)  First off, I believe that I was rented the property under #FALSE #PRETENSE. Upon viewing the property before renting I asked several questions about the property, the most important in this case is in regards to the back patio of the duplex. When asking the property manager (at the time) if the back patio was a shared space, or if it belonged to a particular tenant, the property manager indicated that the entirety of the back patio was included in the rental and that it in no way was shared with the other portion of the duplex. The back patio stretches from our back door, across one of our bedroom windows, and continues underneath a bedroom window of the other tenet. In addition, the power/water meters for both portions of the duplex(I am not very knowledgeable on this topic) are located about halfway across the patio, between the two windows. Lastly, on the far side of the patio from my back door is a water hookup that belongs to the other duplex. Upon moving in the couple that resides in the other duplex insisted everything up to the power meter belonged to them, and as a result the back patio has become a point of contention. The other couple has even restored to storing some of their things on my back patio as some strange show of territorial dominance. This is a hostile environment that I have no desire to be a part of and as a result I have stopped bringing it up with the other couple and stopped using the back patio entirely.   It is of note that over the course of the first three months of us staying at this property that the property management company switched two times and we had to sign a total of three leases.   Secondly as of around two months ago we began to see evidence of termites. Just some damage to the woodwork in the kitchen, VERY minor. We called the company, and they said they would take care of it. A couple days later the pest company calls us and we miss the call. WE call back and leave a message and they never got back to us. Two days ago the towel rack fell off the wall, and in the hole it left were termite wings. We suspect that the issue is getting worse.   What can we do in this situation.	No
417	My aunt died of cancer a year ago in August. She left behind my niece with her father. He immediately threw everything that belonged to her mother out and quit his job a month later. We are not sure if my aunt had an insurance policy or if they are receiving death benefits, but he hasn't not worked yet, but the cars and mortgage are still being paid.  He never got my niece counseling, and doesn't take her anywhere; she takes the bus to school. He doesn't buy groceries and is in the garage drinking all day, or at his families drinking and he leaves her alone. He doesn't have insurance on her, not even Medicaid. My mom can't get her healthcare because she doesn't have any documentation, and my niece doesn't have access to her documentation like her SSN and birth certificate.  My mother went to visit with my BIL and my niece told her she had no food. My mother and BIL both checked and there was nothing but a bit of frozen chicken. When my mom confronted my cousin (he is my cousin on my Dad's side, who married my mom's sister) he said there was food and freaked out. He was cursing her out. My mother ended up buying groceries and hiding them in my niece's room.   My niece was raised at my mothers house until she was like 6 or 7 as her parents were staying with my mom. What can my mother do to gain custody of her sister's child? My mother is very financially comfortable and has more than enough room for her. My mom normally takes care of her for the summer and she is here now. I know my cousin will put up a fight, and my niece is counting the years left until she is 18 and is very lonely and depressed.

418	So I bought a condo, Massachusetts, back in 2012 (worst decision I’ve made to date).  Only 2 units were built, one building townhouse style.  The second unit sold shortly after.  The developer still has not built anymore units (leaving it about 95% unfinished) and gets in trouble with the city every time he tries (ignoring wetland issues and cease and desist orders).  He periodically lists the development for sale but no one has bought it.  I, with the other unit owner, take care of plowing and general maintenance.  The developer no longer collects dues from us and just leaves us be.  I haven’t heard from him in about a year now.  Not sure what lead me to check out title of the property but it looks like a mess. There are all these quitclaim deeds to Nevada corporations this guy has set up, sometimes for $1 and sometimes for more.  Back and forth and now a deed clarification of some other corporation saying that they have the valid title.  This new corporation, while previously created by our developer, doesn’t look like it is owned by him anymore.  From what I can tell, the property has been passed around for shares in these corporations.  I spent half a day in google digging up all sorts of stuff I didn’t want to know and didn't really understand.  So not even sure if our developer is even our developer anymore.  What kind of mess is this and how do I protect myself?  I eventually want to be able to sell, but my gut says that won’t be possible.  And I feel bad about unloading this on to some other clueless buyer.  Besides not being able to sell, is there any other way this could come bite me?  Can he, the developer, even pass around the land like this?  Could my mortgage be called due?  Doesn’t he, the developer, need to let the unit owners know about these things?  I’m so in the dark.   I feel like I need a lawyer to look at all the facts and look out for my best interests … but it’s such a muck I don’t even know what kind of lawyer to look for or what needs protecting.	No
419	TL;DR My uncle stole ~$1000 from my father after his final social security direct deposit and we have proof. We want to force payment since we don't think he will cooperate, but we don't want to put his ass in jail. Can someone comment on whether we could seek a judgment to garnish his wages in a civil suit and not a criminal suit?  Long version: My father died at the beginning of July and my uncle helped himself to his final social security deposit afterwards, we believe by way of forging checks.  We wish to recoup this money and apply it to funeral expenses. On principle I'd rather not let him get away with this. But my brother and I agree that we don't really wanna put the fool behind bars for this and we're not sure if this would be criminal or civil if it came to court. My brother is in the process of getting executorship because I am overseas and it's easier for him.  My question is, could we press charges and keep him from being incarcerated? We both had the thought that since it's related to social security and that's federal, this could blow up in a way we don't want.   We're of course trying to settle this out of court first and foremost, but my uncle stays unbelievably intoxicated between alcohol and prescription pills he gets from the VA. He is almost never in a sober state of mind and therefore next to impossible to reason with. In some stupid way he was actually trying to dupe us into believing the bank was at fault for the money he withdrew and that is the reason he actually mailed the bank statement proving his guilt to us.  Thanks in advance.	No
420	I posted on here a year ago with the full situation but forgot my username. So I am back again. Location: Georgia  The Incident: Got an email saying to remove things from common areas in the apartment listed as, balcony, living room, kitchen so they could clean part of college moving out system where they put a single coat of paint on the walls for new people. So I put everything I could in my room what wouldn't fit I put in the bathroom.  Got a call at work in the morning saying they needed my stuff moved to clean the bathroom. I told them I don't give permission to move any items and I could move them when I got home (they had over a week left to clean before people moved in as per the email).   Finished work got home late found some stuff from the bathroom out side the door on the patio with the locked, can only be locked from outside with card since I was the only one living there at the time. So already pissed that they moved stuff and left outside for anyone on campus to take, go inside and everything else was gone. Looked for it in the dumpsters and nothing of mine was there so went to the police station and filed a police report.   Now fast forward a few months in January got told they wanted to settle by the detective I agreed considering I needed the money as a college student and if they just payed what the stuff was worth I would leave it be.   A few months later no one has contacted me got the information of who talked to the detective tried for 6 months to get in touch with them never answered emails, calls, me showing up they weren't there.  Took a day off and spent 6 hrs getting the run around from place to place to finally get to talk to someone today and really not happy with how they are acting.  So I thought I would ask for some advice here.   The Items stolen add up to a bit over $1700. The most epensive items are over 100 dollars and I have receits the other stuff is under 15 usually around 5 dollars or less. What makes it so much is I had my drafting supply bag in the bathroom with drafting pencils, erasers, eraser shields, circle templates, triangles, scales and what not. I had multiple of these as you just collect them in college. I just don't have receipts of these but I can get professors to write a statement that I had these items in their classes, and from my roommates and people I know that I had them.   Unfortunately no renters insurance no one ever advised me to get it as I am the first in my family to go to college.    During the meeting I mentioned the price and the person I met with acted like I was not going to get anywhere near close to that amount. Which is just not right in my opinion as I have had to personally hound them, take off work, be put in financial stress, and emotional stress just to get this far and survive while paying bills and taking classes.   What do you guys think would be better settling for less or taking this to small claims court if it is much less?  TL;DR : College stole/thrown away $1700 worth of items illegaly, wants to try and settle but probably way less than that amount. Help this broke college student please !	No
421	I'm trying to get out of a lease with our wireless carrier. I noticed today they have my name as the 'lessee' but my SO as the signature. Probably a long shot but is it possible this makes the contract void?	No
422	"I'm not sure if I even need any legal advice, but the potential is there if I don't get this issue cleared up with them by the 9th as that's when I'll get an eviction notice or it'll go my apartment's management company's lawyers.  I'll try to explain this as brief as possible. I paid June's rent via check, but apparently I only wrote the correct amount in the numerical representation on the check and not in the wording of the amount. So about a month and a half later I get a letter in the mail, stating that my check was not honored and was returned and a reverse payment issued. (The management company has their control numbers for the reversal of payment and the receipt for this reversal for records.)  I went to the office and showed them that the incorrect amount was deducted from my account, which they say should not have happened if it was not honored and payment was reversed. So I showed them a copy of the deduction and paid the amount that was left and because the check had the actual amount written in the numerical representation, would waive the return check fee. I didn't know at the time payment had been reversed as I just thought I owe the remainder. If I knew, we could've figured this out earlier.  At the end of June, I give them my check for July's rent, as I was going to be out of town and wouldn't be back until after the late date. But it turns out, they used ""July's rent"" to cover the cost of the reversal of June's rent. August, there's no issue.  The thing is though, I have not received any reversal of payment. I have received no refund, no return for any amount whatsoever. My bank statements show nothing being credited to my account in either the apartment complex's name or the management company. If I received the amount that was reversed, fine, sure, I'll pay what I owe, but that has not happened. There is no evidence that I have received the payment reversal. I am not paying an extra 95% of my rent to the company when there's still money unaccounted for.  Also to note, the reversal of payment amount, does not match the amount that was deducted from my account. So there's essentially about one months rent floating in the air somewhere."	No
423	"I live in Texas and I am renting an apartment. I noticed mold on the edges of the vent right around the time where I developed a weird cough. I also allergies, thought they were seasonal but it could be that it was the mold. Anyway around a month ago I told the apartment people that I saw the mold on the edge of the vent. They sent a guy to clean it but he said it was just condensation and that it wasn't harmful. He changed the filter and left. I then decided the clean the ""condensation"" and took out the vent where the ac air comes out from, and saw it was incredibly moldy. The vent was covered in mold, the wall had mold and inside the vent area there was more mold. It was disgusting. I also noticed mold on the vents to my living room and restroom. Since they ignored the mold the first time is there anything I can do? How do I approach the apartment staff? And do I have to continue to live here with this mold problem? I don't think it is healthy to stay in this apartment."	No

425	So I am here asking on the behalf of my Grandmother for some advice. The situation is this, a small property was bought in 2009 by my grandmother in Portland OR while she resided in Washington State, she then sold the property in 2012 to a man in a private sale, with her acting as the mortgage collecting bank. The man recently missed a payment, then immediately after declared Personal Bankruptcy. The collections agencies for his now null and void $500,000 debt are attempting to seize his house and sell it to pay some of the debt off, while my Grandmother wants to foreclose on the property herself so that she can re-sell it as the property's value has increased by about 30% during the last 5 years.   My question is, how would my grandmother go about foreclosing on his house before the collection agency(/or IRS, she isn't sure) does so themselves. It is written into the contract that the sale may be declared null and void if a payment is missed by more than 9 days, it has since been about 20, and about 15 since he filed for bankruptcy.  Thanks for any help, my grandmother is 81 so this is all extremely confusing for her.	No
426	So I moved out of my last apartment July first even though my lease says that I have it until July 31st. Rent is all paid up so pretty much I was renting two apartments for the month of July. Today I stopped by my old apartment to check if there was any mail that was not forwarded and new tenants have already moved in. Normally I wouldn't care but this land lord has given me a hard time for the past year. Is there anything that I can do regarding this since technically he is in breach of the lease?	No
427	I've been living in my current apartment in Chicago since 8/1/2016, and I use People's Gas as my natural gas provider. My monthly gas bill has typically been between $40-50, with a slight increase during the winter months. In mid-June, I received my bill, which came out to an absurd $240, nearly 6x my typical bill. I called the company immediately, and was told that my bill was inaccurate and would be sent to the billing department for revision.   After the first call, I proceeded to call two more times over the next two weeks in hopes of hearing an update, only to be told the bill was still being revised. I never received an update, and so I called again the day before my bill was due. I was told by the customer service rep that 1) I would not have to make a payment for my June bill - my charges would be revised, and would just be added to my bill for July (so I'd essentially be paying for two-months worth of gas use in July), and 2) I would not be penalized for not making a payment in June.  Well, I just received my bill, and not only do I still owe the full $240 from June, but I was penalized with a late payment as well. I just called (for the fifth time), and am now being told that apparently there was an error with my gas meter for the first 10 months at my apartment, it had been adjusted in June and I am now being back-billed for all of the gas usage that the meter did not pick up over that 10-month period.   Does People's Gas have a right to do this? I understand that I was essentially paying for less than what I should have, but that was a direct result of their own error, and I don't see why I should now be financially responsible for the malfunctioning of their meter-reader.   For the record, my gas charges for July came out to $45, which makes this all the more absurd considering the meter is now functioning correctly yet is still spitting out the same readings that I had been getting billed for during the previous 10 months (when it was supposedly malfunctioning).	No
428	"Hello reddit!   So basically my friend needed to find out some regulations regarding a certain immigration topic in Belgium. She sent an email to a  belgian lawyer asking for help and she wrote ""please let me know how much your help would cost"".   After they exchanged 2-3 more emails(the lawyer completely ignored the request for a fee). In the latest email he just wrote saying he'd like 275 euros for the information his given so far.  So my question is can a lawyer ask for payment over this? With no written contract or agreement to pay? My friend is willing to pay but she feels that the lawyer was shady over his fee discussion and does not want to pay 275 but since this is a lawyer she is afraid of maybe some loophole she might be caught in Belgium laws."	No
429	I currently live in NYC and started renting my apartment in October of 2016. The building that I live in was previously an old boarding house that had rooms and shared bathrooms on each floor. When the building was renovated, the rooms were made into studio apartments. All of the apartments have a living space, small kitchenette area and bathroom fully contained except for mine. Apparently due to some type of structural issue they were unable to tear down a portion of the wall to join my apartment and the bathroom, so the landlord rents it as is with a detached private bathroom and the lease specifically designates it as private. The setup is definitely unconventional, but it is NYC and was surprisingly affordable so I took it. The bathroom door is right next to my apartment door so all I really have to do is briefly step out into the hall. The bathroom is always locked and before a few days ago, I was the only one with a key.   There are four other apartments on my floor, with two on each side of the building. Over the weekend, the opposite side of the building began having plumbing issues. My side of the building was unaffected. The landlord is apparently having a difficult time with repairs and the bathrooms are unusable. On Saturday evening I came home to find that the landlord had given the other two tenants keys to my bathroom without even telling me!!! I called him immediately and he made some excuse about it only being temporary, but it’s now Wednesday and nothing has been rectified. I’ve called him daily since then and he has since stopped returning my calls. I don’t know my neighbors very well and one of them along with her boyfriend has seriously questionable hygiene.  There are already cleanliness issues and I don’t feel like I should have to deal with that. I’ve also gone to use the restroom to find it occupied a few times. I absolutely don’t want to share my bathroom. I would have never signed a lease that didn’t offer me a private bathroom. The bathroom also has a small closet that I was using for storage so I also had personal belongings in there other than your typical bathroom needs. I don’t know what to do. I guess I have lots of questions.  What rights do I have in this situation? Is what the landlord did illegal? Can I break my lease if the bathroom isn’t designated private again soon? Does the landlord owe me some type of compensation for this? Can I tell the other tenants that I don’t want them in the bathroom so maybe they’ll start complaining to the landlord to get the repairs done faster?  TL:DR  I rent a studio apartment in NYC with a detached private bathroom. One side of the building is having plumbing issues so the landlord gave the other tenants keys to my bathroom without asking or notifying me. I absolutely do not want to share my bathroom. What rights do I have in this situation?	No
430	Throwaway, first time posting here. I'm really paranoid right now because my sister (13) first of all, got caught shoplifting a couple months ago along with my other sibling. They have to do community service and stuff, and go to these appointments with their case worker. At their last appointment my sis made a suicidal joke and admitted to self harming. She was admitted to the hospital, the psychiatric ward I think, again. She had already been to a psychiatric ward about a year ago after she admitted to having suicidal thoughts at a doctor's check up. My mom grabbed some clothes from home to bring her, and in the pocket of one of my sister's jackets there was weed. She hasn't smoked for a couple months now as far as I know, but I guess she still had it laying around. The staff said they will ask my sister about it tomorrow.    I'm just really worried that since this will be her second offence, and idk how much weed there was, she might go to juvy or something. I have no idea what usually happens in this case, is there a possibility she (my mom I guess) will just be fined and my sis gets slapped with more community service? We really can't afford a fine anyway but it'd be better than juvy. I hope just having at least an idea of what might happen will ease my mind. Thanks in advance.	No
431	"Our apartment has had A/C issues off and on for the past year. We've submitted dozens of maintenance requests, usually with a short term solution within a couple of days.  This time the A/C stopped working completely. They supplied 1 bedroom with a portable A/C unit (still a huge pain, really in the way in the room), the other doesn't have one. It got up to 85 degrees in the apartment today.  Now I know that air conditioning isn't required in a rental property in GA. However, if the apartment was leased with an A/C unit, the landlord must repair within a **""reasonable time""**. [Source](https://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/repairs-to-rented-property-answers-to-common)  1. Question 1: Is there legal precedent/agreed upon definition for what defines a ""reasonable time"" when it comes to apartment repairs, specifically air conditining?  Follow up to that, our lease agreement says the apartment complex has to act with ""customary diligence"" to make repairs if the A/C is broken.  2. Question 2: Is there legal precedent/agreed upon definition for ""customary diligence"" for apartment repairs?  Somewhat doubtful we have any recourse in this situation, which is really unsettling given how unbearable living in an 85 degree apartment is. But if anyone has any info so that we can at least attempt to put more pressure onto the building management I would appreciate that."	No
432	Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I need help in a big way. It's a complicated story between me and my wife and children, but, I'm trying my hardest to remain in the relationship and I got us into counseling because I want to save the marriage. But I am not sure if I can deal with the abuse (pretty severe emotional abuse I believe is from a depression from past experiences) and so therefore I want to ask this question as a means of protecting myself should the worst happen. I put that out there as the background but don't want to get too into personal details about it and detract from the real question, which is how to sell a home I recently inherited but keep it separate from our joint marital assets in NYC.  I became 25% owner of a two family house, within an LLC, about 10 years ago in NYS, and became full owner after my mother died in 2017. I am now sole owner of the LLC and there is nothing else within the LLC outside of this 2 family home. I am interested in selling this this home within the next few months because it is a lot of work to maintain it, I have zero experience in home ownership and the place needs repairs, and each month it costs money which we don't have. I could manage to hold onto it and rent out both units, but really my wife wants to move into a better school zone for our children. Given all this, we are both interested in selling in the next 6 months. it's taken too much time and money from us.  My wife and I are going through hard times and I am not sure if we will stay together. I hope we do but I want to protect myself. As I understand it, since the property and LLC came to me through inheritance, it is not part of the marital assets that gets divided with my wife should we divorce. However, if I do sell it I believe it can become co-mingled and become part of the martial assets that can be divided with my wife. I don't want it to be co-mingled and I would like to figure out what to do to keep this separated from our joint martial assets. Are people here familiar with this at all? What is the best way to structure the sale so that it remains with me and separate from the martial assets should we divorce? I heard that if I sell it I can keep the money from the sale in a separate bank account, not co-mingled in a joint account, as a way of keeping it separate, but I am not sure if this is true. Someone mentioned something about a trust to me but I had no idea what that meant and if they were accurate. I want to see what other options there may be. thank you very much for any help.	No
433	I went no contact with my mother about 6 months ago after years of dealing with her violent alcoholism, her undermining my choices as a parent, her blatant favoritism and targeting of my children, and the straw that broke the camel's back, her running a background check on my SO in an attempt to persuade me to break up with him. I just received a certified letter from her asking me to contact her to set up visitation for her and my children. It didn't explicitly say anything about her taking further steps, but it seems like that's the direction she's trying to move. If she does take me to court for visitation what sort of information would be pertinent to document? Are her chances of winning high? (We live in Nevada) I can get several character witnesses on my side if I need to. I'm just not sure if I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thanks in advance for any advice. ETA- should I respond to her letter and reiterate my stance on her visiting the children?	No
434	I'm a 17 year old who is home schooled by my mom in Missouri for most of the time. I get to see my dad every 6 weeks, sometimes here in Missouri and sometimes at his home in Florida. We both want to spend a lot more time together. Do I have the right to spend more time with my dad than my mom wants me to?	No
435	"I'll try to make this as short and factual as possible.   July 2016- Bankruptcy was declared and granted last year. In that, we lost personal liability in the home. We turned off all water, utilities, and contacted the mortgage company to advice them we were leaving state and leaving the home. We advised them we wanted to give it back and could no longer afford it. We have not made a payment since two months prior before the move. Not to escrow, taxes, nothing. I called and cancelled the homeowners insurance. I received paperwork stating it was cancelled and that money was refunded to the escrow.  July this year- The mortgage company turned the mortgage over to a new company that has sent us a deed in lieu of sale packet we need to sign to give them the home.  While checking our banking online (our bank also had our mortgage) I discovered a claim on the house. In it, it states there was a burglary/theft that occurred in October 2016. There is also an estimate for the bathrooms for repair and that appears to be the claim of damage. **I never received a call, I never consented to anything, and I cancelled the homeowners insurance.**  To further complicate things, I don't believe the home was broken into. Two of the three bathrooms had hidden water damage when we bought the house and moved in. A piece of ceiling fell in one right after we bought it, and we discovered black mold. We ripped down all drywall and treated the underlying wood. We had not replaced it yet because my husband lost his job, shit hit the fan, bankruptcy, etc, etc. The second bathroom had hidden damage in the sink and when we turned the water back on when we moved in, it became apparent so the vanity was ripped out (and fell apart when it was removed). We purchased all new items for that bathroom and as far as we know are still sitting in the garage of the house. We left that with the home because it belonged to it, just wasn't installed. When questioned on the phone with the current company about the state of the home, we told them this.   We are supposed to sign and mail the deed in leiu of sale package today or the house is supposed to go forward with the forclosure.   I can't afford a lawyer to ask about this, so I just want to know if anyone knows what the process will be in all of this. I have never been contacted once about the ""burglary"" claim and I can't tell for sure if it was a real break in or not. I'm across the continent now and I have no way of getting to the home. It's under the care of the mortgage company now and has been since we left in July 2016.  Is it better to allow it to go to forclosure, since I have no personal responsibility in the home and all claims will go against the property and not me? Do I continue and sign? Do I call? What do I ask? The mortgage and insurance company are the same ones still technically. The mortgage was originally USAA and now it's Nationstar, which is owned by USAA.   Any help that doesn't just say ""lawyer now"" is appreciated. I know that a lawyer is best. I know I need one. I can't get one, period."	No
436	Allow me to explain the situation: I met and became friends with a trans woman online. She's caring, kind and is very motherly, a bit overweight and in her mid 30's. As I talked with her and got to know her, I began to learn more about her personal life and came to discover she's had quite a sad lot in life. She's married to trans man who is at best neglectful and unloving, at worst physically and mentally abusive, mentioning to me having to cover up bruises from pinches and slaps. Apparently about 5 years ago, they had an agreement to have an open relationship, but only with members of the same sex (this was pre transition for both of them). He(she at the time) broke this agreement and had an affair with someone of the opposite sex and when confronted about it, they blamed her(him at the time) for it. Apparently ever since he's made her the scapegoat for all their personal and relationship problems. This has had a considerable tole on her, becoming extremely depressed and attempting suicide by over overdose at least once. She's mentioned multiple times that she see herself making it through the next few years. She's also in a very bad place financially, unable to afford a divorce or even the $700 fee to change her name and gender on her driver's license. Despite my urges to seek help with a therapist or psychiatrist or even just staying with her parents for a bit while she sorts things out, she always brushes them aside, apparently viewing herself as a lost cause or saying the didn't help in the past. Here's where my end of the problems come in. I'm a 19 y/o male who is currently unemployed and I live on the east coast of America, while she lives somewhere in Northern California (she told me the exact name of her town once, but I forgot it now. Something like Sherryville or Cherryville if anyone is more familiar with the California area). I'm also not sure she'll even take any advice or contact anyone or anything that I ask her too. I want desperately to help her somehow and it breaks my heart to even have to write this and recall some of the things she's been through. Please, please, I just need some advice.	No
437	Lived in a furnished house. Upon leaving everything was up to spec.  2 months later I see he has done a lot of work to the outside like putting up a new fence and driveway and all of a sudden I am served with a small claims of 2400.  The damages he's seeking is replacing every dish ware, cleaning, new blankets, new couch, new pillows, pretty much he needs to everything new again. I'm assuming it's part of his remodel budget.   Assumptions aside, I have video of a final walk though on my end that shows clearly all the furnishings in good condition besides normal wear. He's asking brand new price and all the items intiallly were second hand.  How do I counter?	No
438	"Hey folks.  My family just moved into a new apartment and today it will be exactly a week.  Before move in we noticed the light in the fan wasn't working in two different rooms but the lady showing us the place told us not to worry they would be fixed before move in.  Move in comes along and they're still not fixed but we figure it's not a big deal we don't need them and they'll be by to fix them at some point.  Then we go to do laundry and discover the brand new dryer in the apartment isn't working so I take a peek behind it.  It probably is new because they never bothered to hook it up to anything hence why it's not working.  We called and informed the leasing agent immediately of these problems then handed in the move in paperwork that you fill out any damages/problems at move in and included both issues.  We have called every day since then and every day we've been assured that maintenance is coming that day to fix these problems, and every day they have not.  Now we honestly don't want to rock the boat here because it's hard to find an affordable apartment complex here that you aren't likely to get shot by.  But I was wondering if it's reasonable to ask for prorated rent based on the value of a working washer/dryer.  I was digging through our lease and found this about repairs, *""We'll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections. Rent will not abate in whole or in part.""*  Now obviously this states that they won't prorate rent at all, but I figured it can't hurt to ask if there's a legal definition or whatever for customary diligence and if over a week without the working appliance would be considered breaching customary diligence.  At the end of that day we're not going to fight this if it's not a black and white yeah you can ask for that and see what they say kind of thing.  As like I said, we don't want to rock the boat."	No
439	Today my SO recieved an email from our previous appartment company stating that we owe $1000 for stains on the carpet. We moved out before May 1st and did not recieve this invoice till today. It said we have till August 30 to pay or it will be going to collections.  Over the past year or so my health and my SO had been failing. After many docters visits we still could not figure out what was wrong with us. So in march we had a mould test done and it tested possitive for an elevated levels of mould in the appartement. We informed our property managers about this and they came in and cut up the walls looking for mould. They were unable to identity were it was coming from. We requested to move out asap. They told us that was not enough notice but since health was an issue they would allow us to move out before may 1st and they would use our last months rent for april. We moved out the weekend before the first. When I returned the keys there was no mention of a move out inspection and they had previously told us not to worry about steam cleaning the carpets since there were several holes in wall (made by them looking for mould) and they would need to be drywalled. The carpets were not stained beyond the normal wear and tear and after getting some quotes from steaming companies the average cost to have a 2 bedroom apartment cleaned in my area is between $200-350.   $1000 seems insane to me and this feels like extortion. Is there anyway to fight this?   Both my SO and my health have improved since moving out of the appartment.	No
440	(KS) I have moved out to an apartment. We have been fairly amicable to this point. She has decided that she wants to go ahead and file for divorce now. She lives with her parents. She pays no rent. I have a fairly new job after going to school for two years and I am still getting my financial stability under me. Her answer to the budget stated in the DRA is a hypothetical budget of what she'd spend IF/WHEN she moves into a new situation. The state of Kansas utilizes third party child support and the sooner we file, the sooner I get a massive payment that will be tough to handle as of now. Any suggestions to what I can do to postpone filing or payments? I can try and clarify with any questions. We have been married eight years and have one child. Thank you for your time.	No
441	I was contacted today by xcel energy to pay an over due bill of $166 but I moved in with my girlfriend on June 1st and the account is under her name. I talked to a representative and he said it was for an address that I lived in over two years ago and that it's been coming out from my account. He's sending me a print out showing I've been paying for both. Upon moving into each of my apartments (all in Wisconsin) I've filled out a transfer of service form as part of the lease signing. Am I completely screwed out of this money or is there hope I could get reimbursed from one of the landlord companies or xcel themselves? Thanks For any an all advice on where to go from here!	No
442	Hi Reddit, after 2 years of living in a shitty 3-1/2 apartment in Kingston, Ontario, my girlfriend and I finally moved out and we now live in Québec about 9 hours away.   The day before moving out, the moving company started packing boxes in the apartment for us. Unfortunately, we didn't notice that they packed all of our 4 keys in a box (Apt key, building key, laundry room key and the mailbox key). So when we left, we told the landlord that we'd mail her the keys as soon as we unpacked at our new location.  Today, while I was at work, my girlfriend received a call from the landlord claiming that we owed her 100$ for the keys (25$ per key), because the envelope got ripped in the mail and the content was lost.  Also, a while back when I was still a tenant there, I lost the mailbox key and the landlord charged me 25$ to get a new key/lock because they didn't have a copy of the key. A month later, my girlfriend found the key and SURPRISE, the old and new keys are identical and the lock was never changed. I paid 25$ for a key double...  Imo, 100$ is way over the line to get 4 keys replaced since I'm about 95% certain that she has the originals and could easily make doubles at Home Hardware. We've been out of the province for over a month now and my girlfriend and I just want to move on from this thing.  My questions are:  1. Do I owe her anything since I did my part and mailed the keys? She blames me for not using a fancy bubble wrap package instead of a regular envelope.  2. If I do owe her money, how much? 100$ is unreasonable for 4x key doubles. Right now, we plan to ask her to make doubles and send us a copy of the bill.  3. If I end up flipping her off and stop answering her calls, is there a change this could legally bite me in the ass in the long run? I don't want to go to court for a bunch of keys. It pisses me off because we've been exemplary tenants for over 2 years and the landlord is still trying to rip us off even after we've moved out. I don't have the time because of work   in the military and I can't afford it.  Sorry for the wall of text, but this has got my girlfriend really stressed out and we're not sure what our options are here. Thank you in advance for your answers.  tl;dr: After we moved out, 4 keys were lost in the mail and landlord wants to charge us 100$ to get them replaced, when she can easily make doubles at Home Hardware for 3$ per key.	No
443	I just got a call today from my storage unit stating I have used their on site dumpster when I shouldnt have. I threw away some empty packing boxes. They told me the dumpster is not for customers. I apologized and said it wont happen again and that I was unaware I was not allowed to use the dumpster on the property where I rent a unit.  Then they told me that there is a $200 penalty for using it. I said I dont remember that listed in the lease contract I signed that I wouldnt use their dumpster or any mention of a fee/penalty for doing so.  I checked the contract and there is no mention of use of the dumpster or a fee for using it.  They called again in the afternoon which I let go to voice mail. They said they have me on their surveillance cameras using the dumpster and to call back.  Do they have grounds to charge me for use of the on property dumpster where I rent a unit?	No
444	"Currently renting at an apartment community in GA. I've been here for a couple years and every year they send out a renewal offer each year. Well, i've been trying to get them to send the lease over so I can lock in my renewal rate for another year (we lucked out and pay MUCH less than any of our neighbors). The staff in the office has changed a lot over the years and I'm worried someone new will come in and really jack up our rent. We received a written renewal offer on the company letterhead stating our renewal rate for 2017-2018 with absolutely no expiration date or stipulations (i.e. offer is void if presented with future offers). Would they have to honor this since it's in writing? We've been calling and going into the office in person and keep getting the old ""we'll get to it"". Starting to get very nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!"	No

446	I haven't posted on reddit before so forgive me if I am in the wrong sub or not adhering to protocol.  My young son and daughter are currently in Japan with their grandparents and myself and my wife are currently in the US. My wife has hinted before that she might take the kids to Japan and never come back, but so far hasn't acted on it. However, she made the threat again during an argument last night and has demonstrated behavior today that suggests she plans to go through with it since the children are already in Japan.  We have not filed for divorce or separation and she isn't currently scheduled to fly to Japan for another week, but it's possible she might be changing her flight now. My understanding is that I will have little to no recourse to get access to my children once she decides to follow through on her threats and I'm wondering what my options are to either prepare for the long legal battles ahead or to try and stop this from happening in the first place.  I have sought local legal counsel, but haven't heard back from them yet. She is not a reasonable individual at the moment, but I am hoping to appeal to her for a more rational solution than taking this kind of drastic action. That said however, how can I prepare for the worst case scenario? Thank you for your time.	No
447	This past week we have noticed people selling one of our t-shirt designs through some online print on demand platforms. These companies are the sort where anyone can submit artwork and get it printed. I believe these companies are in the US. One company we contacted and they have removed the listing, and the other we are contacting right now. Between both listings, these people have earned a few thousand dollars from my design. Since it's relatively a low amount I understand that it might not be worth dragging lawyers into the situation...but it annoys me that there are US companies that are aiding these a$$holes and profiting from stealing my design.   I can post more specific information if it would be helpful.	No
448	Quebec, Canada. I am the victim along with my younger sister, my father is the abuser. I frankly have no idea where to start legally - I have a few questions I hope someone can help me with. Frankly, I am terrified, this has been kept hushed in my extended family for over 20 years.   The abuse lasted from when I was in diapers to the age of 18. I remember recurring specific instances of abuse clearly, without the memory of specific dates because I was so young. Abuse included numerous and repetitive molestation and forcing me to manually stimulate him.   At the age of 5 years old, my mother was suspicious of abuse but never witnessed anything herself. My mother filed for divorce. An Aunt on my father's side called her one day saying she had witnessed him molesting me while giving me a bath during a family visit at my grandparent's house. However, this aunt was not willing to testify. At the age of 5, I was considered too young to testify in court. Without a witness, all my mother had to go on legally was suspicions. Though she fought tooth and nail, the legal system was not on her side since she had no witnesses willing to testify and no evidence except the memories of a child. The legal system failed me and my mother horrendously. She had no job, no family support and no money, and the appointed lawyer could do little for us. She was advised to try for supervised visitation, and not to try to prosecute as the case would most likely fall through, and the courts might take pity on him if he was not convicted and grant equal custody. My father ended up with supervised visits one Saturday a week. Despite this, the abuse continued. Any time someone's back was turned for one second, he would molest me - this continued at least until the age of 8 where I became more self confident to protect myself and avoided his advances, but subtle abuse and psychological abuse still remained. He remained in contact with me until the age of 18, when I became an adult and felt I had the courage to cut off all contact with him and move away without fear of him tracking me down to hurt me.  Now, 20 years later, I feel I am ready to finally face the ghosts of my past. No-one in my family would talk to me about the abuse as a child or a teenager. Which, in a way, is a good thing as it solidifies the fact that all of the memories I have are from my own experience, not from people telling me that I was abused.   I plan on getting in contact with the Aunt who witnessed the abuse, although I highly doubt she will be willing to testify if she was unwilling to do so when I was a defenseless toddler. I have several recurring, specific memories, that correlate with memories of my younger sister, who suffered the same type of abuse as myself. My older half sister, who was a teenager at the time but lived in the same house, has memories of abuse including him trying to climb into her bed and molest her at night, and showing her hardcore pornography while she was a minor. However, she lives in Malaysia currently and I am not sure she would be willing to testify.  I know it is a very long shot, as the abuse was many years ago and the memories of a young child from that long ago do not hold up well in court. But I know that if I do not do this now, I will regret it for the rest of my life. I want to get in contact with child abuse help, but I have no idea who to contact, and I know nothing about the legal system or how the case would be handled since it was such a very long time ago.   I am considering buying a hidden audio recording device, and interviewing the aunt, as well as my father, for evidence. It is legal in canada to record a conversation between two people without one party's consent, as long as the recording party is aware of it. Is there anything else I can do for evidence or to prepare for this? I want to be as prepared as I possibly can before I present the case.   This monster has molested me and my sisters, probably more family members or neighbors children that I don't even know of, and is walking free hurting more children no doubt. He is unbelievably bold and manipulative, charming, and continued the abuse under the direct supervision of my mother and case workers without anyone knowing. This will be a long, hard fight. Any advice would be welcome.	No
449	After moving to an open work space, my focus and attention struggles has really been exasperated and with a family history of mental health struggles I started accepting I might be no longer overcoming my own outside of professional help. I started seeking out help on my own accord knowing I needed to improve. In a meeting with my boss about my unsatisfactory performance, I disclosed to them I had just met with my physician to begin the process of getting help.   I also reached out to HR that day seeking resources for help, if there were any. HR scheduled a meeting with me and my boss to understand my situation and during this meeting I had informed them that I was meeting with a therapist through EAP.   Now, my position is being terminated and I was informed of this the day before my therapist appointment. Though I am bring offered a generous severance and the papers explicitly state this was a decision being made before I sought help from them, it's with an obvious condition that I have no legal options.   I don't want to continue in my position, however I think this is a very questionable time line of events and I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Unfortunately I have not been officially diagnosed with anything - the earliest I could see an actual doctor in my area for this was going to be months in advance. Clearly I have no time to go do so before I have to make a decision to sign.	No
450	My husband and I are getting a dissolution.  He has a lawyer and I don't.  We have two kids.  His will stay in the house and maintain primary residence.  I will get he kids 2 Monday and Thursday 5-8 and every other weekend.  My question is about child support payments.  The dissolution paperwork stipulates that I will be obligated to pay $645.94 and half of the daycare ($1300) costs plus half of any extracurricular fees and medical fees not covered by his insurance.  Just the child support and daycare would be just shy of almost half of my monthly income.  My ex makes roughly $20,000 more a year than me.  Is this typical in terms of payment or is he trying to screw me?	No
451	"Okay, so my roommates and I live in a college town and all the management agencies are notorious for screwing over college students. Go figure. Recently we moved out of our duplex and have been waiting to hear back about our refundable security deposit. Originally, our deposit was $1600. After moving out we were informed that our deposit refund is a whopping $200. I checked the ledger and it accounts for cleaning fees and maintenance, which we expected. However, there was a steep ""invoice fee"" of $700. This just seems asinine to my roommates and me. Is there any way we can fight this? We are all fulfilling the odyssey of broke college students and could really use some help here. As a side note, we put up with a multitude of issues as tenants. For example, we had our garage flood due to blocked sewage drains and a clogged grate in front of our garage door. We lost many items that were stored in our garage and invested our money in sandbags and a shop vacuum to clean up the mess. Only after the second flood and a multitude of phone calls did our management agency respond to the flooding. Additionally, only after a slew of emails and phone calls did we get reimbursed a measly $60 for our out of pocket expenses of nearly $160 trying to fix the flooding. Also upon moving in, the unit was uncleaned, the water heater was broken, the ceiling had depressions from water leaking, our kitchen sink was leaking, and were told by the maintenance crew we would receive new room doors eventually (which never happened). Only a few of the aforementioned issues were addressed during our lease. I don't want to threaten our management company with this. Although, maybe this can be used as leverage? Does anyone out there have any suggestions or are we SOL?  Thanks a ton. This is in Washington by the way."	No
452	(This is in Indiana)     So, my dad passed last April, and he was in talks for disability. After he passed I received mail from the Social Security office that I was able to receive his back benefits because he had been accepted prior to his death.     Now, I've filled out all manner of legal documentation, medical records, release forms, you name it, all addressed to me, courtesy of or on behalf of my father. Court is next week and the SSA is saying they need proof of kinship. I do not have the slightest idea where to look, as he's not on my birth certificate, and my (his) lawyer isn't exactly giving me great ideas. He had no will, nor any paperwork bequeathing anything to me, but after he passed I signed his estate over to my uncle because he's way smarter than I am and didn't, and still don't, have any idea how to deal with that.    What would work as proof of kinship?	No
453	Hi, I am in VA and wanted to know the legality of this situation.  I talk to men on tinder and then direct them to my kik, where i sext and send nudes in return for money, usually $100 per session.  I have the money sent via e gift cards to my email.  Is this legal?	No
454	I was in a car accident a few weeks ago after buying a gram from a dealer.  The cops showed up to help despite both of the cars begin drivable, none of the airbags deployed, and only my car sustained damage.  The accident was my fault, just to be completely transparent. I was also not under the influence of any drugs.  One of the officers said he smelled marijuana in my car and told me he wouldn't bust me if I gave it to him.  I told him I didn't have any but gave in and gave him the gram of weed.  They then asked me to help him bust the dealer who sold me it so that they wouldn't charge me with a misdemeanor which I did, however, I was under the impression it would be a one time thing. He said I wouldn't want a misdemeanor so I should help him bust the dealer. I did that once and was just called back to do it again although I was told it would only be once.  This occurred in my old home town which is an hour or two away. I'm starting school soon and don't have much money so I can't afford to get up there with gas and tolls. I was wondering if I am obligated to do this again or what my rights are within this situation.	No
455	"Hi, I have an apartment with the lease in my name. I also have a roommate who is not paying rent and I want them to leave. She will not communicate with me, so I ca't even ask her to leave. She only comes back to the apartment when she knows I'm at work. She won't answer my calls or texts.  At this point, I don't care about the back pay in rent; I just want her gone. I'm scared that she will hurt my cat or steal my stuff.  What I want to do is have the locks changed and put a note on the door that says, ""Call me and I will let you pack up your stuff to leave"". Since she is not on the lease, the main office won't be able to let her in or give her a key. I'm worried that this is illegal though? I'm not trying to keep her stuff; I just want her to talk to me.  Could anyone give me some insight as to what to do?"	No
456	I have a roommate that is not on the lease and has caused damage in the room. I walked into his room the yesterday to take photos because he should be vacating by the 31st of July. I found a large hole in the bathroom and some other minor damage. I took photos and sent them to him asking if he can pay for the damages before leaving. He said he called the cops because my photo proves I was breaking and entering and he will have me arrested if I press for him to pay for damages. He also claims the cops told him he has the right to arrest me and have filed a report if he chooses to press charges.   There is no written agreement that he is part of the lease, and the apartment is solely in my name. I only went in to take photographs. My career is in serious risk if I am arrested for breaking and entering, and I need to know if he is bluffing or serious.  I have agreed to back off since he is essentially blackmailing me because he knows I have a lot to lose if I am arrested.   Thank you for your time and consideration.	No
457	I was arrested for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, but I was caught with both plant matter and concentrate (dismeanor amounts), along with 3 pieces of paraphernalia (3 packs of rolling papers). As a result, I had multiple charges for these different items. Is it likely that the judge will drop the redundant charges or will I face harsher consequences for these different illegal items?	No
458	Hey everyone.  There is a great internship opportunity for me in San Francisco that I'm applying for. It's only for the spring and it's a paid internship. I live around 2 hours from it but I want to somehow get a place to stay for the duration of the job. Is this legal at all? And if so, how would I go about doing this?  Also, my grandparents live about 20 minutes from SF, so I can live with them if this doesn't work out, but I would rather not inconvenience them if I don't have to.  Thanks!	No
459	Hello Reddit. I wanted to see if someone could give me some steps to follow to begin work on expunging my felony record in Wyoming? I was charged with delivering a schedule 3 substance and also conspiracy about 15 years ago. I received 2 yrs probation (completed with no issue) for the charges and have not even had a speeding ticket since! I am a totally different person now with a great paying job and a family of 4 that I support. I want to put this behind me for good and would like to be able to vote or have a gun to protect my family if needed. I looked it up and it seems that in Wyoming I would not be disqualified from expungement with my charges but I do not know the first step in getting started. Of course I could start calling lawyers but I thought I would check here first to see if there is anything I can do on my own to save that expense. I am now living in a different state (thank god!) that is far away from there so I can’t just stroll into the local courthouse for help. Thanks in advance for any tips!	No
460	I'm planning to ask my HOA for permission to install solar panels. The Declaration doesn't to mention solar panels. Can the HOA use its general power to disallow solar panels when the Declaration doesn't to mention solar panels on the back side of my roof? My house is on the edge of the neighborhood.  It is two stories high so no one will even be able to see the roof when standing in the neighborhood. I've heard the HOA has previously rejected proposals to install solar panels. But I can't think of a reason they could conjure up to reject me because they won't be visible. It seems such a decision would be arbitrary and capricious. Do it's decisions have to have a rational basis?	No
461	"My wife and I have been threatened multiple times by the same woman in our apartment complex. She banged on our door and bedroom window at 7am, she banged on our door and screamed curse words at 10pm, threatened my wife that was telling her son to not make barking noises and intimidate our dog, and finally threatened to kill my dogs, my wife and I, if our dogs ever touched her son.  My wife is scared and worried that she might do something. We talked with the leasing office, they stated that they are in the process of making sure this does not happen again and ""unfortunately"" my wife and I will be an example to current residents and future residents. The office told me that for our safety, the only thing we can do is file a police report and work from there. Is it true that all we can do is file a police report and live in fear?  What confuses me is, this crazy woman is threatening us and making us feel unsafe, yet, she gets to do whatever she wants and live comfortably in her apartment while I take my wife to my parents' house and stay there on my days off. My rent is not cheap. I pay $2000+ for a one bedroom apartment...and it infuriates me that we cannot live comfortably and that we will be spending basically half the month at my parents' house due to this woman WHILE paying $2000+ for an apartment that cannot even be called home.  TL;DR - Threatened multiple times by a resident. We do not feel safe at our apartment. What can we do?"	No
462	"I am working in New York at a college and I recently enlisted in the Army National Guard. I am being sent for basic training a few months from now and because of basic and AIT combined I will be gone for upwards of 6 months. Now everyone including my boss has been in the loop about this since before I even went to MEPS and no issues or objections to it. I have given them the notice of my ship date which again is a few months from now and I know under USERRA notice has to be 30+ days before shipping or asap which I have done. Now I feel as if the closer my ship date comes I am experiencing hostility from co-workers/boss saying things like ""really? you have to go in the fall when the school year is extremely busy? it kind of screws us while your gone 6 months is a long time"" and stuff like that. I am a hard worker and I love my job but my biggest fear is them replacing me while im gone (which I know they cant do under USERRA) and just saying some other reason to fire me when deep down its cause me being gone is that bad. So does USERRA protect against unemployment AND reprimand? Because it seems kinda ridiculous I have to deal with this every day when Im making a huge life choice/sacrifice."	No
463	I am living in a trailer home along with my mother. My mother owns the home but we rent the lot and both of our names are on the rental paperwork. I've found some info on obligations that a landlord has to their tenant but I wasn't sure how they applied to our specific situation.  They haven't responded to any complaints thus far and I was wondering if there was any potential legal backing that we could use to bolster our argument for some things to be changed.  My main issues are: Not maintaining/mowing the empty lots, common areas, and storage area. Not just unkempt but we've got some houses falling apart and grass growing waist high.   The water to the whole park being turned off multiple times a month, usually for a day or so.	No
464	I gave my Landlord everything I had, applied to a new apartment  (got the call today that I got it) but now the Landlord is beating down my door, and I'm sure he threatened me through it a few times with coming in and ditching my stuff on the side of the road.  The pay rent or quit notice I was given is invalid, and they have not served me a Court Eviction paper, so I know what they're doing is illegal. I have reached out to a local firm to get legal back up in the situation but with the threatening and feeling terrified of leaving the apartment I am wondering if I should contact the police.	No
465	Hi All, first of all I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but here goes.   My parents live in Virginia, they have VERY little in assets. (Rent home, few posessions, old car, small life insurance policy, small pension my dad receives, dad is on disability, both are receiving social security).   My mom recently broke her hip and had to go to the hospital. the recovery will take months and my mom will not be able to take care of my dad. (thankfully we have my sister stepping in to take care of him for now, she lives close by). We would like to see if we could get my dad to qualify for medicaid so that he can receive long term care that is paid for. No one in my family can afford paying for the type of care that he needs.   I understand that the limitations for medicaid are very strict. A family friend has told us that we need to transfer all assets to my sister or I (I would prefer it be my sister) in some sort of trust so that the government does not recognize any assets under their name and they can qualify for medicaid.   Basically I think we need to start talking to a lawyer to facilitate this. But I need a list of items to go into the meeting with the lawyer with to make sure that we can get this accomplished. Any advice or assistance in navigating this would be helpful. Thanks!	No
466	"I apologize if this is in the wrong sub, but I'm having a hard time locating one more appropriate on mobile at work.  A note about the situation: my roommate currently is not on the lease. I am. This is in Nevada. My girlfriend is also not on the lease but lives there with my verbal agreement. My son is visiting from out of town. The roommate in question is an extremely heavy drinker, felon, and has tendencies toward anger and manipulation.  So this has been a long couple of weeks. For the past few months my roommate has been moving from disrespectful to rude to harassing to threatening. My schedule recently shifted from late nights to early mornings and I asked him to respect that. Since then I've averaged about 4-6 hours of sleep per night, damaging my work and personal relationships. He contributes to that in a large way by slamming doors throughout the house, harassing me, making noise in communal areas right next to my room (which I can't close the door to because the air conditioner doesn't blow to my room), and making phone calls on speaker right outside my door.  Essentially I broke recently when he was standing in my doorway calling me names while my son was sleeping on an air mattress at the foot of my bed because we're uncomfortable with him being around my roommate lately.   I asked him to leave the next day via text and he responded with ""I get mail there."" I sent him a text that said ""consider this your 30 days notice."" Then he said he would stay the duration of the lease, dropping it down to September at the absolute earliest. His sudden change of gears had me thinking something was up.  He came home that night and said he never received any notice asking him to leave and he absolutely refuses to leave under any circumstance and he has been researching his legal rights as a tenant. He also said he never harassed me as I had no proof or recorded evidence as it never happened (except non-emergency police confirmed the next day my suspicions that my live-in girlfriend who witnessed this harassment could constitute legal evidence and sign a statement saying otherwise). He said try to make him leave and I was living in a fantasy world where nothing I say is real. I took screen shots of everything he said that night and my polite terms of his exit from the apartment.  Later that night I got a text that said essentially he was sorry for being such a jerk and he appreciates the 30 days and he would be out as soon as he could.  After more research, it looked like my notice wouldn't hold legal weight if I left it at a text message. Everyone I talked to said he probably realized I had no legal leg to stand on and in 30 days when I asked him to leave as per his agreement he could change his mind and I'd be stuck for another 30 days. So I looked up what was required and got essentially a form letter off the internet giving him date of service, date of exit, reason for eviction, and a witness signature. I saw on the website that it wasn't necessary to get it notarized if there was a witness. I had my dad (only person in town who he didn't know personally that I could grab on short notice) serve it to him at work (the only place I could track him down as he spent only late evening hours at home when I had to be asleep for work). I understand this was probably uncomfortable for him but at the same time, I'm at the point where I nearly broke my lease because He's impossible to live with.  Last night his sister (my good friend who introduced us as we both needed a place and it was convenient) called me to inform me that my service was unlawful and he could escalate it if he desired and ""hopefully he won't."" That he had apologized before the moment of service and there was no reason to serve him, let alone a non-notarized notice to evict which he could sue me for fraud by serving that to him. I really want to call her and tell her that was unfair but now I'm not sure what good that would do. I also have about $250-300 worth of stuff at her house that I want to get back if I'm going to not be able to go over there anymore but don't want to worsen the situation.  I feel broken and tired and can't think straight anymore and I'm exhausted physically and mentally. I just need some advice if anyone has any. I know it probably doesn't sound like much of a big deal to everyone else but I've spent the last 6+ months spending 95% of my time in my room avoiding this guy and his rules and yelling and insults and I don't feel safe in the apartment.  Sorry if this is disjointed, I just woke up and started spewing out as much as I could think to put down. I would appreciate any advice on how to proceed.  TL;DR: My roommate refused to leave when I asked, then changed his mind, then I served him with a 30-days notice his sister called and claimed I could be sued for fraud with."	No
467	"I'll try to make this short.  About a year ago, I, a minor, signed an NDA with an online tech startup based out of California. I cosigned with my parent(s) to do so. I signed my NDA under the presumption that I would be doing work, and getting paid for said work; where the latter was false. It worked out swell for a few months, but my boss started to miss paychecks -- skipping entire months of pay saying that I didn't deserve it because I was ""useless"" and so on. Just a few days ago, a direct competitor offered me a job with them and I decided that I was done with the B.S. that my boss was throwing at me, so I put in my two weeks notice saying that I was going to explore my options at other companies. Instead of working my two weeks, my access was fully removed across all platforms and he told me that in no uncertain terms, he would be suing me if I were to join a competitor. As for what, specifically, he has eluded to the doctrine of ""inevitable disclosure"". Now, I've done my fair share of homework, and there are no clauses in my NDA that prevent me from leaving him and joining a competitor. There are clauses that refer to him being able to apply for an injunction to stop me from revealing his CI in whole or in part, but that's only under the presumption that I have revealed his CI or have threatened to reveal it (which I have done neither).  I've been talking to my parents, and they think that he, for lack of a better way to say it, can't do anything. I'm not joining the competitor to reveal his CI, I'm joining the competitor because they treat me better and pay me more. I never signed a working agreement or contract with him, and it's safe to say that the entirety of the pay that I earned with him was under-the-table. Whenever I alluded to me being his employee (prior this entire ordeal), he'd be very quick to remind me that I am in fact only an 'independent contractor', and not his employee. I don't know if that's relevant to this question, but I thought it may be.  So my question, to you, is the following: What are my options? I have several offers from competitors, offers that I very much want to take, but he's saying if I take any of them w/out his prior written approval (exemption in writing), he'll file suit. Keep in mind, I am a minor from Canada, and he is an adult from California. I am afraid that if I take an offer from a competitor, he will file suit and I'll have to deal with that accordingly. He does have my address, so he can serve me papers (excuse my naivety for the legal process, I'm by no means an expert). My parents think that I am fine, and I can take an offer from the competitor. They've also said (paraphrasing): ""what is he going to do? Extradite you?"", in response to my fears of being sued. They think that if he files suit, I can simply ignore it and let it drift in the water, because what can he do? I'm a minor from Canada, and I haven't even broken his agreement.  Sorry if this post got a little long. I hope I included all relevant details. If you have any questions that I can clarify/expound upon please don't hesitate to ask."	No
468	Ex is self-employed. Ex has zero parenting time (his choice). The last time the amount was changed was over 9 years ago.  I requested a modification, and when he received the notice, he threatened to kidnap the kids away from me.   I am disabled, have zero income (other than the child support), and we are living in extreme poverty (3 people).   Since he said that I called up and cancelled the modification. I have no way to prove that he makes oodles of money; I know he fudged the numbers last time. He lives alone in a high-rent district; He travels frequently out-of-state and internationally; he lives in a very-high-income place;   I guess I'm afraid of him going in front of the judge and saying that since he has so much more money than i do that he is better able to provide for the kids and therefore they should be with him all the time.  Also One more question: Department of Revenue refuses to send the support to me when he sends it to them: I get the money as a lump sum, never in a consistent manner.   I know he sends the same amount, on a consistent basis, as i have witnessed this, and also multiple times when he went out of state he left the money orders with me to mail in for him once a week.   Can i get them to pass the money to me on a consistent basis? Because of their inconsistency I got a warning when I turned my rent in a few days late.	No

470	My mom has been figured from her 20 year job because they say she no called no-showed.  For the last 3 years the company has been under new management.  It's been said amongst coworkers that there has been firing among anyone not young, fresh and modern to represents the companies new image. Out of everyone that worked there before management took over, now only a handful remain. Seasoned in their fields, they are all scared.  Should she seek a lawyer? Can they reject her of anything she has earned, such as Retirement, 401, etc? We're worried all of her commitments will be degraded.  By bullying I mean she has been harassed with text messages, people demanding her to come in on days she has scheduled PTO. Demanding her not to enjoy her days off and cover shifts.. just all around pressuring her to feel stressed and she feels bullied. Please advice   The company is a healthcare facility in NV. Please and thank you for sharing anything we should be aware of moving forward.	No
471	I'm renting a house. The husband and wife landlords have been nice, though pretty hands-off and ... well I'd hesitate to use the word incompetent, but maybe lazy is a good word for it. I've had no real complaints aside from them taking forever to fix certain things (they want to get the best deal first), and it's time to renew my lease.  Technically my lease expired on July 1, but I don't think my landlords know that. All rent has always been paid on time and they like me as a tenant. I was wondering how to go about getting some amendments made to the lease.   What I want in new lease:  * Fixed chimney (power went out this winter and we couldn't stay warm since the chimney has never been cleaned and is likely a fire hazard; landlords said they'd fix in winter, still haven't done it)  * Pet amendment (we're interested in getting a small cat, maybe a medium sized dog like a golden retriever)  The advice I was given was to print off the current lease I have, staple on a page saying I'll cover a deposit for a pet to cover cleaning fees should something bad happen as well as some kind of page that details that the landlords should fix the chimney by a certain date. I'm pretty confident if I were to sign that and sent in to them they wouldn't think twice about just filing it away and never thinking about it.  Is this a reasonable course of action? Do I need anything notarized to make it official or is this seen as some kind of nefarious, subversive behavior that might be frowned upon?	No
472	"I moved into a 2-person apartment by taking over someone's lease (with the landlords approval) and I bought that person out of his security deposit. Now the lease is expiring this month, and I am moving out, but my roommate is staying and is going to find a new roommate.  I talked to my landlord about how the security deposit would be returned and he told me the security deposit stays with apartment until it is vacant, not with the people in it. I told him I don't know anything about whoever is going to be moving in and questioned how he expected me to get money from someone I likely will never meet. He told me that is just how the law works. I asked him to show me this law and am awaiting his reply.  I looked at the lease and it does say the security deposit must be returned within 21 days after the ""RESIDENT"" has vacated the premise. Earlier in the lease it states the term ""RESIDENT"" applies to ""tenant(s)/lessee(s).""  So if either my soon-to-be former roommate and whoever moves in next refuse to buy me out of the security deposit am I just stuck holding the bag until there is a complete move out of BOTH tenants at some point in the future? At that point, my lease would have been expired for at least a year and I don't understand how any of the money would find its way back to me.  Of course I can make sure nobody moves into my room until I leave, but on the 31st I'm legally required to leave and my security deposit will be used for whatever potential damages the new tenant or future tenants incur.  Am I missing something here? This seems like a huge legal protection oversight.  Thanks for any advice."	No
473	I moved out of a one bedroom apartment and into a two bedroom apartment within the same apartment complex at the end of May. I paid the landlord the security deposit and first month rent for the new apartment before moving in. It is now 17 days into the month and I have not received the security deposit for the old apartment despite asking for it multiple times. I have an email from around the end of June asking when I shouldn't expect it and the landlord said 6/30. 6/30 came around and I received nothing. Waited a few days and still didn't receive anything, called him after the July 4th holiday and he said it should be here Monday or Tuesday (7/10-7/11) Still nothing. Called again and he told me to check the old apartment. I did and there was nothing there, which I told him the next day. Then he said he had to call some woman and ask her about it tomorrow or the next day, whenever she was in the office. Didn't hear from him, sent and email asking about it, no response, called him the next day (late last week) and he said we should receive it today or tomorrow. We got our mail today and have still not received it. Perhaps we will receive it tomorrow.  I have a few questions. If we do not receive it tomorrow, is it required that I send a demand letter requesting the deposit before taking him to court? My second question is, even if we do receive it tomorrow, can I still take him to court for being 2+ weeks late in returning it? And finally, after looking up some reviews I found someone that dealt with this landlord and apartment complex to have the same issue I am having and when they finally got their secuirty deposit back, they only received their secuirty deposit but none of the interest it accumulated so she took him to court and got the interest, plus some additional money for getting the security deposit back late. If that happens to me, what would be my course of action in getting that? Thanks for the help.	No
474	Late Saturday night my downstairs neighbors called the police on my husband and I for arguing (the walls are thin here), we did not answer the door because the neighbors call the cops constantly over the most minor things like doing dishes, watching tv, walking around at night and so on, every time we HAVE answered the door in the past the officers simply tell us they got an anonymous complaint for noise, and that they couldn't hear anything, then they leave.  We stopped answering the door quite a while ago, because it's just an annoyance.  However when the police officers arrived Saturday night they MIGHT have heard my husband raising his voice, but we weren't in need of any sort of police assistance, it was just an argument, so we did not answer the door.  Anyway, today (Monday) I got a knock on my door in the morning while I was still in bed, then again at 6:00 PM, both times an officer not in uniform, but with a badge, had a clipboard with paperwork. The 2nd time I did try to answer the door but the officer was already leaving.  My question is this, what could they possibly want?  Could this be related to blatantly not answering the door on Saturday night over a noise complaint?  Or is this possibly a subpoena they are trying to serve on an unrelated case (last year someone attacked me and destroyed some of my property and he's still going through pre-trials)  Either way, I haven't gotten anything in the mail.  I'm just wondering what could be going on.  It's too late for me to call the district attorney's office to ask if this is about the court case I'm a victim in, and I'm scared it might not be about that and might be about that stupid argument my husband and I got into Saturday night....  Anxiety is eating me up about this.	No
475	I recently purchased a property and there is a community driveway for the  houses next to my property and the neighbors told me that my backyard was also once apart another  community driveway for the other three plots. It is no longer a community driveway because the owner next to the entrance of my community driveway blocked access for my next door neighbor and me. Is there any way I can verify that there was a community driveway there before and bring legal action to rebuild the community driveway? Thank you for your time.	No
476	I work for a public college in Georgia and the state garnishes like half my wages because I accidentally got behind on child support so I don't even make minimum wage. I have a family to take care of and kids and can barely afford to survive. I also have health issues and I don't get decent coverage from the college and I can't get good treatment at the VA. I can't continue to live like this please help it seems like they want me out on the street  Thank you and God Bless	No
477	As stated, My roomates and I each have signed our names to a lease for an apartment. Together we make the required 3x monthly income. However he recently bought a car that makes him unable to move, but is willingly to keep his name on the lease. We can make the payments for the apartment, without his aide.  However, would we be penalized for having his name on it.  If he doesn't live with us? The lease is signed with five people, but only four will be living there.	No
478	I've been looking for a new apartment and got a look at one of my background checks by Global Verification Network.  In my report, there was a creditor, BANKAMERICA (I'm assuming Bank of America), that I never signed up for and it says that I have almost $5000 in balance.  What's more is that it says that I signed up for it in 2005, when I was like 16, which is impossible because I had no credit then and I distinctly remember only Discover Card accepting me when I was 18.  Should I look into what this is or could Global Verification Network be wrong?  If it is real, what do I do to close it without paying for this $5000 I never spent?  Currently, I have never heard anything about this from Bank of America.	No
479	Im in a really bad situation right now, i was caught at my school with possession of marijuana, and the court date is coming up. My family is stressed and they think they are going to be deported because we arent citizens. They think they will be arrested when we arrive at the court, and this was my first offense (im 14) please help, do i just get probation and community service or are we getting kicked out of usa	No
480	I own in a really strict HOA and the renters nextdoor have it in their head that I am somehow connected to some fines they got (I am not connected in any way). They have signed me up for PornHub, put my phone number and email on Craigslist in an explicit ad, and stared down visitors to my home who later mentioned it to me (I never told visitors of the issues.)  The landlord and property management company are non-responsive. The HOA is monitoring the situation.  I have made police reports and reports to the HOA where it made sense.  Is there something else I should do? Can I take another approach, like civil court?	No
481	I live in a dorm and we have a full kitchen/living area that 2 rooms share, and one of the guys that lives in the other room is absolutely disgusting. He made food over two weeks ago and hasn't cleaned anything up and it has started to grow mold in our kitchen because of him. I have tried numerous times to get him to clean it up, and his excuse is that he will clean it when he needs to use them again. I have taken pictures and documented every time I have talked to him about it.   Can I throw away his pots/pans because they are becoming a legitimate health hazard? Or should I try to go through the University to force him to clean his stuff up?	No
482	So I am moving out next week and my parents are becoming increasingly bitter over it. They told me I have to take literally everything that's mine with me when I leave (which I will not be able to do, I have a small car and also the house I'll be renting at has no space for anything and is already furnished anyways).   I'm wondering from a legal perspective if I have to do this? 90% of the things that would be considered mine, there would be no way to prove that it's actually mine (bed, nightstand, tv, etc).   I have a week to get rid of all this shit and I'm kind of freaking out. Most of it is unimportant to me and I wasn't planning on taking it. Do I legally have to?  I am 20 years old if that matters.	No
483	"I've been taking medication since I was 10, ones to help my depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I also got on a birth control pill when I was 17. My mother always kept my medicine in a lockbox and only set out a weeks worth of pills af a time which sucked because she's HORRIBLE at remembering to give me more at the end of the week and she procrastinates on it even when I remind her. Once I turned 18 I told her to stop keeping it locked, but she refused even though I'm medically independent. When I miss my meds I get horrible withdrawals that include vomiting and migraines. The birth control is locked away too, and the last thing I need to to become sexually active and miss a day and get pregnant because the pill isn't accessible. My mom justifies herself by saying she doesn't ""want me to kill myself"" via pill. The very pills I need to stop me from wanting to hurt myself. Is this legal for her to do?"	No
484	I work for a Fortune 500 company in California.  I accepted an offer in the fall of 2016.  The offer did not explicitly list my PTO days, but it had a link to the current benefits site.  The current benefits site detailed that PTO days for employees in my range would be X, and a footnote that said the schedule would change on 1 Jan 2017.  My hiring was delayed by the company until 2017, and now I make X-16 hours of PTO, according to the new schedule.    I believe this has happened to numerous other employees as well, since my hiring class was around 100, and all had offers accepted in 2016.  Do I have any recourse for the company changing the terms of employment?	No
485	Hi. I am from Northern New Jersey. I am in need of some advice and was wondering if the helpful people of this subreddit can provide some. Throwaway being used for anonymity. A couple of days ago, I received a check from the Federal Trade Commission because they settled with DeVry in a 100 million dollar settlement. After doing hours of research and spending hours on the phone with government student loan help lines I am lost. I want to know a few things. Does cashing this check stop me from filing a lawsuit against DeVry? Also, I still owe around $60,000 in Student Loans, with this settlement anyone with Private Student loans are being refunded but people like me who took out Federal Student Loans are left to seek out other means of refund. One suggestion from the FTC was filing for the  Department of Education's Borrower Defense to Repayment program. Should I do this before seeing an attorney? I am afraid that if Betsy DeVos gets her way she will get rid of this program before it can help me out. Any advice? Please and thank you.	No
486	The lease has no provision covering the possibility of the property being sold.  Would any buyer be bound by the terms of my existing lease?  I've found conflicting opinions when I searched Google. Some say the lease is tied to the property, and the buyer is buying the lease as part of the property. Others say the buyer has a right to execute a new lease or evict us if they so choose.  The lease doesn't start until 9/1, and the property is currently on the market. I'm just trying to figure out if I should expect to get kicked out of this place.	No
487	Ok, I'm 18 and was being dropped off at my truck yesterday but got caught in heavy rain. Since my friend was dropping me off we decided to smoke a bowl while we waited for the rain to die down. So after about 5 minutes, the rain still hasn't let up and were literally just talking in his car. A cop with flashlight knocks on his window, and says he smells weed. At first we said I was just getting out and about to be on my way, but he cut us off and said give me all the weed in the car or I arrest you both. We both complied and gave it to him (maybe a gram between us).We told them he had all of the bud, but there's other things like grinders and bong. So we get out and stand in the rain while they search the car and go d nothing else. He pats us down and says look out for something in the mail. I asked if it was a fine or a court date or what and he said it's a fine. My question is, will it be like a citation where I can just go pay it and that be the end of it, or will it be court date for a charge, with the fine as punishment for that charge? I'm just trying to gauge how big of a deal this is	No
488	So here’s the deal. For the last four years I’ve had my name on my apt lease in Queens. Decided to move in with my bf to Brooklyn this month. His name is on his lease in Brooklyn. Question is - should I immediately add my name to his existing lease when I move in this week or can I wait until his lease is up for renewal in January to then add my name to his lease? Are there any cons related to credit score or taxes etc if I end my lease now and wait until January to add my name to my boyfriend’s lease? Any tips? Maybe I’m overthinking it but would love your legal advice!	No
489	I've been carrying this on my shoulders since Nov. 2015. The therapists know the entire situation, in depth, and even though I feel iffy about what to do, they still encourage me. It is not such a black and white/cookie cutter situation, it's also very twisted, and gross, and sick... So I'll spare you the details and make this brief.   I don't have money to hire a lawyer, but my current therapist told me to at least seek a free consultation with one. How do I do this? If the crime happened in another county, what do I need to do. What will happen if/when I finally press charges? What should I expect? I need to know so much, but I don't know what all to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	No
490	"My roommates are trying to get me to move out because they are all quiet people who feel ""tension"" because my girlfriend comes over once or twice a week and we talk and hangout at normal conversational level. There's no lease, I've lived there for 6 months and been a model roommate otherwise. Disregarding that insanity, I have two questions:  1. Am I allowed to put a lock on my door? I feel like one of them might throw my stuff out while I'm not home.  2. They keep telling me they want their other friend to move into my room and I need to leave because of the ""tension."" One of the roommates gives all our check to the landlord whom I have no contact with. What do I do if they decide to just ignore my check and give the landlord a check from their friend and try to make a case around that?  Thank you!"	No
491	Please let me know of any errors and things that I can improve upon. Sorry in advance.   I can't take this anymore. I want to leave this house and be my own person. I am tired of being threatened to leave by my parents. I do so much for them and they hate me.  I am 20 years old, unemployed, and have no car or drivers license. I was adopted unofficially and have no legal paperwork and have no idea if I even have a SSN or any means to get legal help in my situation. For all my life I have been treated as a glorified slave and nanny. I have pretty much raised all 3 of my younger siblings because my parents always had to work (which I understand) but it's way past the normal help here and there. I watched them as babies and fed and bathed them, I took them to school and all of that since I was 8 or so. For 20 years I have been the backbone of my family.  Although I didn't provide financial help I did do pretty much every thing else even cooking and cleaning after my siblings parents and grandparents. They don't even seem to realize how unhappy I am. I asked my parents for my information so I could get a job and they don't have it, they  flat out refused for 20 years to help me change that. Since  I graduated HS in 2015 they've been telling me to leave the house and to get a job but I simply can't because they all ask for my ID and what not and I don't have it. I hate not having my own identity to prove who I am to future employers. I want a change and I am totally helpless and powerless. I have no control over my life and it's already taken a toll on my mental health. I need an escape badly.   I've attempted suicide more than 5 times from 13-20 years of age and I always change my mind because these people are not worth my life. Yes they did raise me but it feels like they only did so, so they could keep me as free labor. I'm basically just a tool to them they don't even let me stay over family members houses or go out simply because they want me to watch the kids so THEY can go out or sleep or whatever. It's so maddening and I do it only because I love my siblings they need me and I need them especially the youngest one, she loves me more than our parents or anyone combined and I can't bare to leave her with them.    I'm so conflicted because they do this to me but on the other hand when we go out together and do family things I feel loved. But the good is only about 10% while the other 90% makes it not worth it in the long run.  Please if anyone knows what I can do to get myself as far away from here as possible, let me know. I'm going to die if I keep living like this. I will gladly give any information I can if you need it. Just please I need advice asap.	No
492	We will probably write up a contract and require them to sign it regardless. I'm mainly curious if this is legal/legally enforceable.	No
493	I received a letter in the mail yesterday with my address but someone else's name on it requesting to pay for a property tax ownership change fee and I have not sold my property. I called the city about it and they said they had an ownership change on record about two weeks ago. The person said to ignore the bill and she'd look into what happened, so waiting to hear back right now. Should I be contacting a lawyer or something about this (not that I can afford one right now) or am I paranoid?	No
494	"So, let me first off say that I have taken responsibility for being too trustworthy with my money and have made peace with the fact that I will probably never see it again. However, at the insistence of a friend, I will post the situation here anyway.  My former roommate was a good friend of mine who was short about 4K on the diwnpayment needed for his home purchase. We made a verbal agreement on what amount I would pay in rent if I moved into this home with him, and if I gifted him the down payment money, we would use my gift as a ""credit"" on monthly rent money and 50% of all bills until that ran out. I sign a ""gift letter"" for his bank saying I gave him this money he needed with no expectation of reimbursement.  Fast forward to a few months in, I want to adopt a small dog and talk to him about it. He tells me he does not want another dog in his home (he already has a small dog of his own). I adopt the dog, move out a few weeks later, and we agree that if he takes on a roommate at any point during the duration of my ""credit"" (about 2500 left that should have lasted me until June). June comes and goes, and he never took on a roommate (after 5 or 6 months of being roommate free).  He has posted online for a roommate now, and to my knowledge this is the first time he has made any digital solicitation for one.  I feel cheated, but ultimately took it as a $2500 in mixing friends and money, but again, at the insistence of a friend, I'm asking here if there is any opportunity to reclaim that ""leftover"" money.  FWIW, we tracked the money owed on a spreadsheet that I still have."	No
495	"My OP here: https://np.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6mtunq/recruiter_pressuring_me_and_sending_red_flags/  (Tenn.) I have no official offer letter, start date, salary, nor do I have that I accepted the job anywhere in writing. I have an email from the recruiter saying she accepted the job for me, but I never responded to it. After I sent an email explaining why I wanted to renege and cancel my contract with the recruitment firm (per my reasons in the original post) and take myself out of the running for the job the recruiter sent me an email stating: ""You signed a waiver that stated that if you accept the offer and don’t show up for the first day of work , accept a counter offer or don’t stay for a minimum of 90 days in that position– that you are financially responsible for the repayment of the placement fee ($9000). I have all the documentation that supports your acceptance and where you state you would tender your resignation and would like to start on the 7th of August""  I said I would LIKE to start on that date, but again, never said I accepted in writing nor was I given a start date or official offer. I spoke to the company who would be hiring me and they are baffled by all of this from the recruiters.   I have a copy of my contract saying: 1. If the Candidate fails to report to work on her/his first day of employment with said employer for no reason or any reason other than major substantiated intervening acts beyond the control of the Candidate (e.g. severe weather, hospitalization, etc.), the Candidate agrees to pay The [recruiters] a fee for the placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate. 2. If the Candidate voluntarily terminates said employment for any reason or is terminated for cause by said employer within the first ninety (90) business days of employment, the Candidate agrees to pay [recruiters] a fee for [recruiters] placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate.   Does this have any ground to stand on?? Can they actually force me to take the job or pay them that fee with nothing in writing?"	No

497	"My parents were in the process of renovating an expensive historic home when they divorced, ten years ago.   The mortgage has been paid one way or another since then, but nobody has liven in it, but both are still on the mortgage.  Parent A would like to get the home to rentable condition, and start making income. A has already invested money in restoring the home.  Parent B would like nothing to do with Parent A, hence why this issue has not been addressed for so long.   Parent A is concerned about Parent B coming after A's rental income or the value of the property, and wants B to sign a ""quit claim deed"", eliminating A's interest in the property.   I advised B not to sign anything, after some googleing suggested that this would not eliminate the responsibility to pay the mortgage.   Would it be possible to informally draft a contract that covers these concepts? Or is an attorney strongly advised in this situation?  - While A pays the mortgage, B won't make any claims or interfere. - If A pays off the mortgage (or refinances), B will sign the quit claim deed.  Both have a large amount of illiquid assets.   Any other advice?"	No
498	"I've been a long-time lurker but never felt the need to post on Reddit until now. I'm desperate for some sort of help.  I live in a large apartment building. I'd estimate that we have about 300+ units. In April 2017, I was notified that a building-wide renovation was to take place, and that all of the North side of the building (which is where my unit looks out to) will have their windows replaced, so that the building looks like a tall glass tower. It would improve the building's appearance.  They told the tenants to keep things a few feet away from the window, as the windows will be removed. I had a bunch of books stacked against the window as well as some furniture, so I removed my books and stacked them on the floor and my furniture was off the window by maybe a foot (I live in &lt;400 sqft studio, so there wasn't room to move all of them and go about my normal life. I figured that the workers will eventually move them as they see fit.)  May rolls around, and every day at 7am, Mon-Sat, I am woken up with the sound of jackhammer drilling into the concrete (I don't know much about construction, all I can say is that I'm a heavy sleeper but I can't ignore this noise; I have slept through numerous block parties, however). The local bylaw says that quiet hours are over at 7am, and they start pretty much on the nose (or sometimes even 6:45am).  According to the timeline given, my floor should be under renovation between May 1 and June 15. So every day, I force myself to go to bed early (I'm a night owl, and I'm the most productive at night), because I don't want to be caught sleeping by these workers, or worse yet, maybe one day they'll remove my window and just basically enter my unit that way while I'm sleeping. There wasn't a single day where I felt comfortable falling asleep, because I really hated the idea of waking up with some stranger in the unit.  End of June rolls around, and my window hasn't been replaced yet. I am physically fatigued from not being able to sleep well, and I start to wonder if the one piece of notice telling me that ""they need intermittent access to my unit"" is still valid. Can a landlord even claim access to my unit for that long a period of time? I have no idea.  At the beginning of July, I get another notice saying that from July 5, they will begin the renovation of my floor. WTF? I've been anticipating their entry into my unit every day for the past two months. They tell me that it'll take another 5-10 business days.  I'm annoyed, but I had a business trip scheduled, scheduled to return on July 10. So I think, this will shave off a few days from having to wake up early and be stressed. From my previous experience with construction work though, I know that not everyone is super respectful of my space. So I think through the possible problems that might occur to my space while I'm away.  I post a note telling them that while they're welcome to use AC, to please shut them off when they leave. I likely have slight asthma (my sibling is a doctor and that's what I've been told, although it's mild enough that I never got officially diagnosed) so I never use AC, as AC actually makes me breathe not as well.  I worry that the dust will be everywhere, so I take out every bedsheet and cover all of my furniture.  When I came back a week later, at about 9pm, the AC was on. It was possibly on for a week straight, I have no idea. The workers had piled furniture onto my bed (like seriously, who even thinks that this is an option?) and they had grabbed my garbage can to use in their construction work. Likely they had also used other stuff (I just replaced my roll of kitchen towel before leaving, but there wasn't much left, although I can't prove it). My blinds were gone. Considering that the north wall of my unit is entirely glass (and there were construction platforms just outside my window), I feel that I can't go to sleep like this, as I have zero privacy. Also, there's a huge gap between where my old windows used to be and where there are the new windows now. I guess the space used to be filled with insulation, but now all of that is gone. With the insulation gone, my room is not soundproofed at all, and I can hear my neighbours' utensils clicking against their bowls/plates as they eat dinner, not to mention other everyday noises. They must have thrown old insulation of fibreglass on my bed at some point too, because my entire body itches Tuesday morning, and I pluck some light fibres off my body where it hurts the most.  I am livid, and I call the supervisor. She eventually picks up, and tells me that while she can install a ""zip wall,"" I'll have to deal with it for tonight as she doesn't want to drive in for an hour. She'll pay for the garbage can (this was 5 days ago, no news from her yet) and the electricity bill (the difference between last year's July and this year's July).   So now, the situation is slightly better as the zip wall has been installed, although it makes my already small room very small. My furniture is also all piled up, so it makes normal life almost impossible. My couch is up against my piano so I can't use either, my table is right next to my bed so I have to eat on my bed. Although their promised 10 business days are almost up, no one has been in my unit since Monday (other than to install the zip wall) to finish the construction, even though I hear very loud noise every day.  With the lack of the soundproof system, I've set up an air mattress in my walk-in closet and I sleep there now, because I can't continue to go to bed at 3am and be woken up at 7am by loud noises. I've slept in my closet for four days now, and today, I realized how pathetic this is.  I'm just a renter, not a unit-owner. My life has been disrupted for two months, and I don't feel like I have my own space anymore, although I pay the (relatively high) rent of $1100/month. I also hate that the construction company (and hence the landlord) can just give me a notice for blocks of times and expect to enter my unit at any given time. I'm cranky and depressed because I can't sleep well, and I'm not really sure what options I have, because the construction company technically isn't doing anything illegal, as far as I know.  I'm not sure if my whining is just me being entitled, or if there is actually some legal recourse that I can pursue. I'm desperate for any advice. Thank you so much for reading this rant."	No

So I rent a room in an apartment, my landlord has been... difficult to say the least, in the time I've been here he's:  -changed the locks on me without prior notice (I ended up jacking a key because the bottom locks were unlocked, and I have pictures of the old locks on the table) -I've come home to the electricity being off (which was blamed on me)  -There was an issue with bedbugs he refused to address (even though I had proof they were in the building and he was alerted by the Supervisor of the building) which I had to spend my own money getting foggers and cimexa to take care of (I have pictures of bedbugs) -He's entered my room without my permission or prior notification and 'cleaned' it, for I don't know what reason.  -He has refused repeatedly to give me rental receipts, I've asked for months, he refuses to give them to me. Which is why I fell behind on rent in the first place, because I lost my food stamps when I wasn't able to provide evidence of how much i was paying for rent and was denied state insurance. I have proof that my files were complete except for the rental proof.   Now here's the tricky part, which I don't know if it's worth mentioning or not. So my landlord's behavior has been a bit... odd. When I moved in originally, he mentioned that he ""didn't want me bringing boys over"" and that he was in a legal battle with his niece who lived there who for all intents and purposes was generally really nice to me. He had her removed. I'm not sure what happened there... though he claimed that she tried to poison him.   After, he got really clingy to me, like I figured whatever, possibly just a lonely old man. I kind of put him off and tried to... ease my way out of conversations with him. And then a few weeks later he asked me if I would go out with him for his birthday (note: he's like in his 60s+ and I'm a 22 year old female) and I politely declined.   After that I had the bedbugs issue which he turned the conversation to how ""I didn't communicate enough"" and how he felt personally insulted that I,""didn't say hello in the morning or at night"" and wasn't,""communicating enough"" and how we're supposed to be,""like family""   Honestly.... it kind of seems like a lot of his behavior stems from the fact that he feels insulted that I won't act as his pseudo girlfriend or whatever, I'm not sure if it's worth bringing up though.   Anyways thanks guys."	No
501	My wife recently filed charges on me and dropped them today after she realized they were felony charges. We are going through a divorce and she is now threatening to bring the charges back up if I don't agree to her terms of divorce. Can they be brought back up?	No
502	My mother is a 66 year old disabled manic depressant who survives on welfare. She currently lives in a trailer on a trailer park which she pays rent. She's been here for about 15 years and the landlord has refused to fix things in the park for years. However, this newest refusal I consider to be out of line. My mom recently fainted and broke her foot (about 5 days ago) and this has basically immobilized her. A few days prior to her accident she called me telling me that the toilet and bathtub were broken. Basically when she flushes the toilet it backs up somewhere and in the piping and what she flushed begins to come out of the bathtubs drain. The bathtub itself doesn't want to properly drain. Her and her neighbor discovered a piece of land outside of her home that seemed to be leaking and spewing up sewer waste. They both called the landlord on multiple occasions leaving voicemails that he never returned. She finally got through to the landlord yesterday and told him what was happening. He told her that he'll get to it and she described her injury. Once she told him this he replied by telling her to go to the bathrooms at supermarkets. She replied by telling him again about her broken foot, how she's been using a portable toilet in her living room, and that there was nowhere for her to dispose of the waste. His follow up to her response was to take the portable toilet outside and throw the waste into the vacant lot next to her trailer. My mother hasn't been able to use her toilet in over a week and has resorted to going to the bathroom in bags/pots. She hasn't taken a proper shower or bath in over a week.  She is currently refusing to drink water and eat too much food because it makes her have to go to the bathroom. Is there anything that can be done here?	No
503	"After a bit of digging I found out my lawyer did not have a license to practice in Texas, only in Kansas also found out some of the money orders that my parents gave him weren't even cashed in yet so I was able to retrieve half of the money they had spent! There were a few others involved in this case out of the many he screwed over as well.   I followed some of the advice some of y'all gave me and am really glad the letters and calls I gave helped out on this case in the end.  Here's what the final letter they sent to me said.  ""This letter is to advise you that Uchechi. N was disbarred by the Kansas Supreme Court on July 7,2017. I am enclosing a copy of the order disbarring Mr.N  The discipline of disbarment imposed by the Court was effective on the date of the Courts order pursuant of Rule 212(g) of the Supreme Court  Thank you for your support and cooperation in this matter.""   Again I can't thank you guys enough for this, couldn't have done it without y'all!"	No
504	I know somebody who lost parental rights to both of her children in 2009. Her boyfriend had beaten one of the children while high on methamphetamine. She also tested positive for methamphetamine and was arrested for paraphernalia during that incident.  She had a baby with somebody else in 2012. They separated in 2014. The father is now fighting for sole custody after receiving calls that the mother was using drugs again.  How much of an impact will the past terminations have on the mother's custody going forward?	No
505	I recently quit a debt collection company.  When I was hired roughly 6 months ago they made me sign an employment contract for 1 year with the term that if my employment ceased before the terms of the contract that i would owe the company an amount of money that would diminish over the course of the contract. I just got my final paycheck and it has a letter saying that I still owe them an amount to buy-out my contract and gives the remaining amount due.   The letter also says that authorized per the employment agreement and allowed by federal and state laws, that they reduced my pay for the final 2 paychecks to minimum wage and applied to the amount I owed (they sent both of my final pay periods on once check for some reason or another)  I was wondering what I should do next and if this contract itself has any legal weight. I asked when signing the contract and upon leaving if I could see or get a copy of the contract and I was denied.  So as to the specifics of the contract I'm not really sure what it says. I also know that employers can garnish your wages but I though they had to notify you and go through the legal process first.  I live in the state of Nebraska  (This is my first post so please be gentle)	No
506	"**Yes, I know you're about to tell me to just hire a lawyer.**  My husband and I are expecting our first baby and we're working to get our finances and directives in order.  We have a relatively simple situation, the only ""big"" things being that we own a condo and we will soon have a dependent.  Given our situation, we feel pretty comfortable doing (and have been recommended by multiple sources to do) our documents DIY with an online service.  That being said, it's easy to find plenty of reviews saying ""it was easy and fast to use and the customer service was great!"" but I feel like the true test is in the actual execution of these documents.  You don't know if it was done right until it actually needs to be used.    So, has anybody out there executed a will and/or POA from an online service? Was it just fine or was it a disaster? We are particularly looking at LegalZoom and Willing. LegalZoom seems pretty solid but Willing is much newer so I'm curious to hear your anecdotes! Thank you!"	No
507	"I recently purchased insurance for a year long trip that I'm taking. It was a little unexpected, so I asked my doctor for some prescriptions I have for a pre existing condition and he decided that he would tweak them a bit. This counted as a ""change in medication"" so now I am not covered for my pre existing condition. I'm not too worried, but if I remain stable for sixty days I saw some policies would cover me. I don't want to go without any insurance, so I have purchased emergency medical. But if I want to change companies partway through to get the pre-existing condition covered (about sixty days after I arrive-I know world nomad begins policies when you're already away) can I do that? I know I won't get my money back after the ten day review period, but will they cancel the policy so I can go with another company?"	No
508	This is kind of a long one, so stick with me. I don't feel like I'm getting a straight answer from an attorney. I'm in New York.  My wife and I are getting a divorce. We've been living separately for about 14 months now and are very amicable. We've decided to go with an unconstested, no fault divorce. We have no kids, more debt than assets, and we simply want the divorce to be over as quickly as possible.  We agree as to how all of the assets and debt will be split up. I'm dispassionate about any of the 'things' (furniture, electronics, etc.) that we acquired together, so I'm letting her have whatever she wants of that. I'm keeping all of the cash assets, house, cars and the significant debt other than student loans. I'm taking on the debt because she has almost no means of servicing high levels of debt and it's less of a burden to me than it would be for her to do so. Additionally, she has no interest in our cash, house, cars or my very modest retirement assets. She sees them as mine because she did not work during our marriage, and she is aware that she has a right to all assets acquired during the marriage. I'm not looking for an analysis on this, we 100% agree on this piece.  So, I've researched all over the internet and can't find the answer to this: given that we are in complete agreement about how everything will be split up, do we NEED a document that outlines how the assets will be split? If so, how detailed does it need to be?  I went through New York State's DIY online divorce tool and it simply asked me if we were in agreement about the division of assets. I said yes, and it let me continue and print out the paperwork--there was nothing in there beyond that question on the walk-through about the division of assets. I spoke with an attorney and he is telling me that I need to have a separation agreement, but I don't think that's right if we 100% agree on who is taking what. I understand that it's best to have one, and that it would be appropriate in 99% of divorce cases where the spouses are adversarial, but that's just not how things are in this instance. I don't feel a need to have an attorney involved if it isn't necessary.  Does anyone have any insight on this? Essentially, what's the bare minimum paperwork that I need to get an uncontested, no-fault divorce in New York?  Thank you for your time.	No
509	I'm looking to file a Small Claims Filing for an accident caused by a bicyclist who was in my lane going down a hill around a blind corner. What I'm looking to recouperate is the amount of the deductible from my insurance claim for the damage she caused. I've tried contacting her 4 times over the last 2 weeks to no avail. She has no auto insurance because she lives in the city, so it was as if I had an accident with a pedestrian. There were no injuries from the accident, as the bicyclist was treated at the scene and refused further care.   I've emailed the office of the Ombudsman for Hudson County, NJ, and told me that I'm to file a small claims filing for a Motor Vehicle Accident. I was provided the following forms:   * http://www.njcourts.gov/forms/10148_sc_motorveh.pdf * http://www.njcourts.gov/forms/10290_small_claims.pdf  What I'm hoping to find out from you guys is A) If I'm able to also put on the claim the $42 I was required to pay to file the complaint in addition to the $500 deductible, and B) If I'm able to place a somewhat arbitrary amount of dollars for the burden of having to take off of work to take the car to the shop, come to court and do the filing due to her negligence in the first place, and if so, what is a reasonable amount for this (I am a salaried employee so I had/will have to take PTO to do so but don't have lost wages due to this)?  If you have any other recommendations I'd love to hear it!	No
510	"This seems like complicated scenario to me, and I'm not sure how to go about it.  The first few paragraphs help explain the situation. I have a written sublet through my roommate, who in turn rent from out landlord. Currently they are in the middle of battle issues involving eviction, assault, property damaged and intrusion. My roommate has a lawyer for the assault case who's also helping with the eviction situation with the Landlord.        Currently I sublet one of the rooms in my roommates apartment. I've lived there for nearly 2 years now. My roommate(RM for short)  is somewhat messy. Our landlord(LL for short) is pretty lazy and eviction happy with his duties, but so long as we're not disturbing his precious driveway, he stays out of our hair. These is also a 3rd roommate now, his boyfriend he has on the down low. As far as Im aware of or seen, he is not officially on any agreement nor does he pay rent.       Due to events I only have vague information on LL and RM have gotten increasing agitated to the point of property damage. From what I gather, LL has used unofficial channels to attempt an eviction which has sent my roommate into an anxious frenzy.  This includes broken security cameras on both sides, unlawful intrusions into our apartment , and culminating in an assault charge brought against my roommate that resulted in a night of jail.  All of these events happen when I am away since Im out most of the day until late evening.         During this time, my roommate verbally informed me rent was $0 until further notice. This was also written on a dry erase board in the kitchen,but sadly I do not have a clear picture or any other recording of this offer i took him up on. This plays into the conversation we had following my request to clean up.        Also during this time, RM decided to switch the layout of the bottom floor and got even worse with dish duty.  The larger living room/side room combo was to become his new bedroom/living area the old room would now be the entertainment room.  After setting up his, he has since abandoned the old room in a state of storage and clutter.   Over the course of several weeks, RM has been acquiring a large number of items from amazon. Anything he uses for his room is unpacked and used, anything unused or empty boxes are thrown into the old room.It now barely has more than enough space to walk in a few feet, a room large enough for 2 queen sized beds. Dishes are left haphazardly in the kitchen with all manor of food waste. The worst one day being 3 day old meat tortellini fermenting in the water it was boiled in. Simple meals, like milk and cereal, were left out as well as cooked full course meals. Dishes get piled in the sink even after a complete wash. What was supposed to be a shared entertainment room was now a scene from hoarders. What was a livable kitchen feels like an unsanitary trash pit.  These I both have videos and pictures of at various stages. Including several over the course of my tenancy.           This brings me to the following:  At some point in the last 2 weeks his dog had taken a wet crap on the small viable floor space in the new ""Entertainment room""  He informed me of his intentions to let it dry to make for easier clean up.  After a few days he tossed a small dog bed on the mess.  Sometime early this week his dog, yet again, took a much more solid and larger crap over the same area. The dog is actually well trained. After seeing if anything would be done about it, as well as the the increasing pile of dirty dishes and entertainment room, I sent him a text informing him that if he would like my help maintaining the apartment, he needs to clean up the weeks old dog shit and finish a room we are supposed to share to livable standards. Otherwise we'd keep passing trash around as I keep my areas clean.       His response was an immediate eviction with 30 days notice for failure to pay rent.  This was followed up by a request to pay my rent and send him an apology where we ""forget this conversation ever happened"".  After that was a stream of texts. First was the refusal to clean due to stress. The next was to go stay at my mothers if I don't like how it is in the apartment.  Then an ultimatum: I stay out of the apartment for 3 days without returning or else he would evict me. Non contact with him whatsoever until Monday. Or move out. He even offered to pay for a shitty motel for the time(I would need to bring my cat).  If i would try to respond, he would immediately send (paraphrasing) ""don't send that text or you really are evicted and ill hate you"" .The entire stream of texts made me realize my continued tenancy would be dictated by RM's mood. Immediately after this text I got the OK from my parents to move in that day. Work was sympathetic and let me leave that morning to start moving out.  By the end of the night, nearly everything of mine is back at home. There was no response from RM other than a snapchat of his face with he caption ""thanx"" later.  This was not the first time he treated me with evictions or the ultimatum of moving home when I confront his bad living habits either.   Currently my plan is to official move out/break my lease this Monday. But I'm unsure what rights I have and what is expected of me to avoid legal trouble/cover my bases.  My plan is to write and official letter to my roommate and landlord stating my intention to move out and return the keys.Asking for at least RM to sign a copy. But i am unsure about the following:  -I would rather not pay the rent that I now ""owe"" for a month I was told was free since this seems like retaliation for my requests of a clean apartment. Especially given the living conditions I had to endure and the additional person now living with him.  - Would it be wise to record any further interactions with my roommate? These would likely take place in the common areas of the apartment. - Would the assault and issues between RM and LL affect anything regarding my sublease or moving out?"	No
511	Please no hotline numbers or any bullshit like that.  I want to make a will that will ensure that when I die that there is a DNR, my organs can be used for whatever purpose, that there is no funeral/wake/religious ceremony, that my body is donated to science, and that my body is cremated afterwards and flushed down a toilet for all I care.  https://www.slideshare.net/tomwinfrey/sample-last-will-and-testament    Is that link that has a sample a good way to start it out?  I'm 30, not married, never married, no children, etc.  Should I start it out like that?  I think the Personal Representative is an Executor, right?  Being brutally honest when I say I don't have a dollar to my name, so I can't get an attorney.  I also don't have any friends or anything similar.  Can I leave it to my mother to being the executor, even though she will be a witness to the will (hopefully...)?  The payment of debts is tricky for me because I am heavily indebted with credit card debt, school debt, and a Personal Guarantee for a failed business lease contract.   So its around 150k.  Unfortunately my mom is on the lease contract for the failed business, so she will be stuck with that (yeah, I know its shitty of me, but I give up).  Can someone chime in on this here?  The only thing under my name is a car.  Should I try to get that into my dad's name?  He is disabled, so I'm not sure if that is possible.  They would REALLY need to sell the car in order to make ends meet.  Is there anything else that I am missing?	No
512	This is for a new apartment complex in Francisville: https://www.zillow.com/b/1522-W-Girard-Ave-Philadelphia-PA/39.97145,-75.162227_ll/  One of their towers was supposed to be ready for move-in by 7/1, but on 7/1 they said PECO (electricity) delays are preventing them from finishing their work. Construction manager said that all the remaining appliances will be installed on 7/3 and that we can move our furniture in and just wait for electricity to work out.  Today (7/8), some of the appliances like AC, gas range, and washer/dryer aren't there and one of the workers said it won't be ready next Saturday (7/15) either.  Is there anything that I can do? They even promised a free month rent with 12-month lease, and that's supposed to be the month of July (we're not getting a month value). We paid the security deposit at the contract signing ($1350).  Can I get out of this contract and get the deposit back since they breached the contract (move-in date)? They were firm on having the free month as July, regardless of actual move-in date. Garage and other towers seem far away from being done and I just want to move already and settle at a place.  Thank you!	No
513	"I had an employee give a verbal two week notice on Saturday. She cited that she wasn't happy and the office wasn't a good fit, and specifically mentioned it was not because of me. This morning, she said she was leaving early Wednesday for an appointment and I said that would not be possible as we didn't have coverage for her. She snapped, went on a rant about how I (the office manager) am actually the reason she's leaving, and that she is ""done."" Gathered her things and left.  I am left wondering what sort of legal protection the office has if she tries to file for unemployment. She has already secured a new job, and unfortunately, I was not able to get a resignation in writing, so I have no documentation beyond a statement I wrote out this morning regarding the situation. What should I do? Or just wait it out and see if an unemployment request comes through?"	No
514	So I am in need of an Occupational Drivers License because my license got suspended until March 2018. So I'm torn between getting a lawyer and paying around $300 so they can get that for me or just going through the process myself! I've been looking up different lawyers and they all basically state it's fast and simple with them and that if i were to go about it on my own, it would cost more. Is that true? Any advice would help. Thank you!  P.S I am in San Antonio, Texas. I don't have any outstanding tickets, warrants or surcharges on my driving record and I have already gotten a notarized SR-22 applied to my current vehicle.	No
515	So, my sister met someone online who had a shit life, so she invited her to come live with us. It was alright for awhile, but she slowly started showing more and more of the fact that she's an awful person, until it finally blew up and my dad kicked her out, and told her to never come here again. My sister has been talking with her, offering to give her her things somewhere not on the property, but she's refusing to, saying she has legal squatter's rights to come get her things, since she lived there for over 6 months and has proof, and that she can't be evicted without a full months notice. However, she never lived here and paid rent, it was always as though she were another family member. Does she actually have these rights?   I did some Google-fu, and it said that when evicting squatters they need a month's advanced notice like any other tenant, but is she even a squatter since she was living with us in our house?   Thanks for your help.	No
516	"Our new scumbag landlord withheld $120 of our security deposit for a professional cleaning crew on our move-out. I let her know that we spent hours cleaning and making the apartment spotless, and we have pictures to show it. However, she says that they always hire a professional cleaning crew, even if it's been cleaned by the tenants and won't refund the money.  Furthermore, there are some scratches and wear on the hardwood floor. Long story short, prior to our move in the old landlord tore up the carpet to replace it, and found the hardwood floor that was previously there. When we moved in, this wood floor already had scratches all over and a big scuff in one place. However since the old landlord let us know about it, we didn't think to take pictures and document it. Then came a new landlord who is handling our move out and is charging us $300 for ""repairs to the scratches.""  There was also peeling paint on two doors when we moved in. We told the maintenance person, but never actually had written correspondence with anyone so she's saying there's no record of it, and she's trying to charge us $100 to repaint the doors.  I'm guessing it's going to come down to filing a claim in small claims court, but except for the pictures we took after cleaning the apartment, we don't really have any proof. I asked the new landlord for the receipts for the repairs and she says she'll try to find them.  If we do file a claim, do we do it in the court where she's located? Or can we do it in the new city we moved to?  Thanks for any advice and suggestions!"	No
517	About a year ago, our townhouse complex implemented this Poo Prints DNA testing for dog poop so that they could test poop found on the premises and fine the owners for it. As responsible dog owners, we happily agreed and took our dog to the front office so they could get a DNA swab from his mouth.  Fast forward to today and I've just received a notice that we are getting a $100 fine from a sample collected June 12th. I am beyond BAFFLED by this because we are so diligent about picking up after him, especially after the Poo Prints program started! We picked up his poop beforehand anyway, but you can bet that the idea of a fine has kept us on our toes.  I would have been the one walking him given the day/time the sample was collected, and they even state WHERE it was collected, and I do not know how in my right mind I would have left a big pile of poop right behind the clubhouse where management is?!?!? I don't remember the walk exactly because we walk him 3x a day (it's a lot of poop to pick up, but we do it because we should and because we also don't want a fine!) I just can't BELIEVE that I would have left his poop there. Unless it was soft poop that was difficult to clean up or diarrhea, I have no idea (and I can't remember if he was having digestive issues a month ago). He is a large dog- maybe it was soft poop that I didn't grab all the way?  In any case, it's incredibly frustrating because we do what we're supposed to and WE are being punished. I see piles of dog crap laying around quite often and am always surprised.  Is there anything we can do to fight/contest this? We have no other pet violations. I've done some brief poking around on the internet and it seems to me like fecal matter isn't great for DNA testing but I'm just really not sure what to do.	No
518	"Hi everyone!!! I have no idea if this is the right place and I'll gladly delete if not!!  Short story my husband and I married at 18 about 6 months after I got sick. I was still able to work part time and did so until he asked me to quit for the wedding and then we were stationed in Japan for 3 years. I didn't  work while there because we didn't need the money enough/it didn't seem worth it with my health. My husband has hated me from day one because I'm sick and I tried my damned hardest for 5 years to be good enough despite it all but I failed. We moved back to the states and I had a part time job for a couple of months and then quit while he was in school so I could go back home with family while he was away. About a year and a half ago I came to visit family and just take a moment to try and figure out why i was so unhappy and how to be better for him. (After he continued to be mentally and emotionally abusive for 5 years and refused to seek help with me) Well when I got back home we started counseling online and i became insanly sick in January less than a month after being back. I was vomiting constantly, in severe pain, couldn't eat (I lost 70 pounds in 5 months) as well as a few other issues. I wasn't able to travel but we continued counseling online. Well my husband decided he didn't want me to come home. I found out a few months later he was cheating on me and he had moved from our home and in with her without telling me. I've been to countless doctors where i live and I'm currently waiting on an appointment with a group of doctors at a major hospital because no one can figure out why im so sick. My husband's continued to support me financially (he pays my car payments and cell phone bill as well as a little money for food/groceries).   Well his ""fiance"" gave me a call letting me know I should be expecting divorce papers shortly and he's done with me completely. I have noooooo idea what to do. I don't want to screw my husband over because despite how god awful he was to me I just hate the idea of making his life more difficult etc. HOWEVER I'm freaking out about the fact that I'm going to have no money no possibility of working even part time and from what i understand if I even qualify for disability without a formal diagnosis it's going to take a while.  Do I have any options here?? Can i be ""rewarded"" some sort of alimony or spousal support or something until I'm able to work?? We're living in different states at the moment so do I see a lawyer here or call somewhere from the last state we lived in?? How the f can I even afford a lawyer?!?! 😓 please please please any tips or advice would be very welcome!!!  I'm ""living"" in ohio right now. I've been staying with family but i haven't done any formal address change. Hes currently living in North Carolina."	No
519	Okay so here's the deal. Around march of this year I quit a job that provided a company vehicle. I found a used Volkswagen on Craigslist for $3,000. The money for the vehicle came out of my exs bank account. I never had a ton in my savings but she did because of a large settlement she received from a car accident. The car is registered in both of our names and it is clearly stated on the title.   Anyways about 6 weeks after we get the car she broke up with me. Now she either wants $3,000 or the car back. I'd be okay with giving her the money but since we are in the process of moving out then should I not be asking for the things I bought her during the relationship? Obviously the car is expensive compared to the other things I'm thinking of but I just don't see the difference. When we got the car I needed it to get to work so I could make money for our bills.   So should I just pay her for the car to end this headache? I offered her half of the money, would that be a decent option? Or was the car a gift and I don't owe her anything?   Sorry if I sound selfish or rude. She's done and said a lot of things to me the last few weeks that have affected me a lot mentally.	No
520	I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this	No
521	"I am trying to divorce my abusive spouse. We've been married 12 years and have a six year old daughter. He has been physically violent for years and has continued to stalk me pretty aggressively throughout our separation. I moved out in Nov. 2016 and officially filed with the courts in Feb. 2017 pro se. He counter petitioned and as I did not have an attorney I was bullied into giving majority custody to him of our daughter. This has proved to be a bad decision as he does not care for her emotional well being and she is now seeing a therapist. He also continues to break the morality clause in our custody orders. I have gone to authorities to attempt to get a Protective Order against him, once with a bruise from him on my body, and they stated that as we are still married and have a child together they thought it best to deny. I have had to fight to get a criminal trespass warning for my home. Since I decided to leave I have been seeing someone else. My boyfriend has been hit multiple times and charges were pressed but they never went anywhere. The local police told him he should just stop seeing me and that I'm getting what I deserve bc I shouldn't be seeing someone while I'm still technically married. On top of physical stalking, he works in IT security and cyber stalks me constantly. He hacks into ALL of my online accounts, wipes or locks out my phone (which he is not on the account or any of my accounts), gets into my bank accounts, paypal etc, and has begun hacking into the network where I work and messing with my payroll stuff as well as posting inappropriate pictures for all of my coworkers to see. Meanwhile, no one will listen to me or acknowledge whats going on no matter what I report. He even reads all my text messages, etc, tracks my whereabouts constantly, and does petty things like driving by my house and setting of my car alarm in the middle of the night. He has recently been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder after a suicide attempt and I feel he is unfit to parent our child. However, I cant afford a retainer for an attorney. I now pay approximately 45% of my income to him for child support, insurance for our daughter, daycare for her while shes with him, and other medical fees each month. My check is already small so this has left me on the brink of homelessness even though I work full time and clean houses on the side. He tells our child awful things like I don't love her and I'm a quote ""fucking whore"" etc constantly which has been very detrimental to her. At this point I'm at my wits end. I feel like no one is listening and I have no where to turn. I would love to free myself and my daughter from this abuse and unsustainable situation, but I don't know what to do. Could anyone tell me how long he can ride this out without signing divorce papers since he counter petitioned? What can I do to lower the amount I pay to him as I am in such dire straits and he makes a few thousand a month more than I do already? Without everything coming out I currently bring home less than a minimum wage employee and cant find an attorney willing to help"	No
522	In the U.K. If a minor runs away from home (due to bad parenting) can they face any kind of charges (so long as no laws are broken) and also, if they stop at a friends house and the friend doesn't tell the authorities can they face charges too?	No
523	"I signed a lease with a complex for a 4 Bedroom cottage, the complex has assigned me to move into a 3 bedroom apartment but did not notify me of this.   In the lease it says that the Owner can reassign a resident to a different Unit at any time. The lease does not define ""Unit"" and the complex has cottages (2 story houses), townhouses (3 stories), and apartments (one story).  If they cannot assign me to a cottage by move in will the lease be voided? I'd think not but they also don't define what a unit is and the internet is not helping. I have a signed copy of my lease that I can post with information redacted."	No
524	My wife and i have just signed a lease for a house rental that went into effect on the first. We havent moved our furniture over yet, but ive been over every day doing little things like changing the bulbs and putting up flower baskets. Anyway today i was in the living room when i smelled something acrid which led me to a dimmer switch. After turning off the power i found some burned wires, and what i suspect might be aluminum tied into copper. I took a picture which ill post soon and the cable is pretty clearly black from overheating.  We are leasing through a property management company, and i submitted a ticket for repair (and another one for the two broken smoke detectors), but what can i expect going forward? I've also installed a CO detector, which has stayed quiet.  My question is, given that we are in texas, what can i expect if the landlord attempts to just replace the switch without addressing the broader safety issues of the wiring itself? What are the best and worse case scenarios and how do i plan for them?	No
525	"A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him.   I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers.   The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on.   Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon.   A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design.   Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success.   We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.   We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either).   Would love some advice! Thank you in advance."	No
526	"Hi Reddit!  Thanks in advance for the help.  I am attempting to move out of an apartment that I currently live in in San Mateo, California.  I alerted the landlord that I will be leaving yesterday, and he responded that I should have given 30 days notice as per the contract.  The 30 days notice before leaving (with a yearlong lease with a set end date) clause was not in the original contract.  However, the landlord sent a notice 31 days ago which reads,  *""Dear Valued residents, Thank you for your concerned residency.  Your rental agreement is about to expire and we would like to extend the offer for you to sign a new lease.  Because of management changes, it is necessary for you to sign a new contract with us, even if you will be remaining on a month to month agreement.  Below you will find your best available option to renew, as well as the rate for choosing a month to month agreement.  New rental rates begin August 1, 2017.  Option I: 12 MO $2400  OPTION II : Month to month $2880  *If you do not respond to this notice by July 30, 2017, your rent will change per the month to month amount listed above.  It is necessary for you to sign a new contract even if you are deciding to go month to month.  If you are intending to move, please remember a written 30 day notice to vacate is required.  So don't wait and renew today.  Turn in the bottom portion of this letter to the LEasing Office and we will email your new lease paperwork to you. "" *   So I will alert them today that I will NOT be moving to a month to month lease.  However, i am forced to break the 30-day notice rule.  There is no penalty for this on either this document or the original contract so it seems that it should be ok.    Is there anything I should know or do?"	No
527	"Hi,  Due to us not knowing exactly when to move out, we resulted in making a 16-day notice to move out to our landlord today.  Of course the landlord was not pleased, using phrases like ""serious liability"", causing me to expect some serious fines.  1. What should I expect?  2. What is legally allowed by the landlord in this case? (ie. fair civil resolution)?    Thanks. We just could not state a 30 or 60 day notice because our relatives desperately needed a place to stay out of the blue from Korea, (unforeseen circumstances), and after dealing with some private matters that unfolded in our family we ended up in this unfortunate pickle.  Thanks. Would appreciate any input."	No
528	"Hello guys. My friend just came over to my house almost in hysterics - about to cry. 300'pound guy who doesn't shotput for NCAA...not exactly somebody who gets like this very often. I asked him what was wrong, and he explained the situation, which I will detail below.  He said that he was on Seeking Arrangement, which is a type of dating site. He was using a picture of and pretending to be a female that we both know - we went to HS with her. While he was doing this, he struck up a conversation with a guy and they exchanged numbers, he texted him for ""shits and giggles"" supposedly. Well, that guy eventually found out that it wasn't actually the girl and instead it was him. my buddy said that he didn't admit to it or anything over text, despite the guy urging him to admit what he did. What are the repercussions for this? I'm sure it's illegal to some point, but what action could this guy take against him? Thank you everyone. I very much appreciate any help offered here and I'm sure as hell that he will too...lol. You can save the ""what is he, gay?"" Comments, I've already given them to him twenty times over. Here are the messages that the guy sent to my friend:  ""Can we FaceTime? If that's okay"" ""Are you hiding something?"" ""Okay, I'll ask you the last time before I take action against you"" You have fifteen minutes to confess what you've done"" ""Bro, why. Like you know you would've been caught.""  My buddy didn't reply to any of these and has declined calls from this man, which I believe is the right move but I could be wrong. Thanks again for any help."	No
529	I was working at a stadium tonight, and at the end of the night it turns out the till was down. After this the security guard searched me, he searched my pockets (no issues so far), then after nothing was found he asked me to remove my bra and lift it up and shake it (with my top still on of course), I felt weird doing this but was tired and wanted to go home so I did it and after I did it the guard seemed seemed really awkward. This took place behind a fridge behind the bar so no customers could see, but the person behind the other bar would be able to see if he looked over. This feels pretty weird to me and I've never experienced this before, I'm not looking to sue or anything but is searching like this (especially by a member of the opposite sex) allowed? If not I'll bring it up to my supervisor tomorrow.	No
530	Located in California.  I'm renting a house from someone, and subleasing out the other two bedrooms in the house.  The terms on the leases I write go through the end of August, because it's a university town, and that's when the majority of the leases are up in the town.   Today one of the people I live with texted me to find out if he had to pay August's rent if we found someone to take over the lease before then.  I told him no, but only if we found someone by Monday (I'm flying out on vacation on Tuesday, and won't be back before the end of the month).    He asked why by then, doesn't he have the whole month, and I pointed out that I'll still be living here, I'd like to be comfortable with whoever is in the other room (ideally, the other person in the third room would need to be comfortable with them as well).    He said he'd be subletting his room either way.  I'm not comfortable with him deciding who'd be living in the room without me or the other tenant also meeting and feeling okay with the individual, and because I'll be gone until the end of the month, possibly early August, I don't know how he'd find someone to sublet the room to while I'm gone, letting them move in on the first, if I don't even know I'll be back by then.  I'd like to tell him that because the lease doesn't explicitly give him permission to sublet the room, he isn't allowed to, but I don't know that that's the case.    If it says nothing about it one way or the other in the lease, is he allowed to sublet the room?   [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pEuobY1ERrHUMPA1qr3sH2vbduyqJPBHe9rtqOZLF10/edit?usp=sharing) is a copy of the lease we signed.	No
531	This is in Canada. A friend of mine recently got through a relationship with an abusive boyfriend who emotionally abused her, threatened her, and leaked her nude photos after they broke up. There's strong evidence of him being a pathological liar and generally a sociopath.  He recently got a new girlfriend (a few months ago) and proposed to her. She broke up with him (told us about it and was okay with it because she already was getting the suspicion he was a sociopath), and two days later she committed suicide. She suffers from depression, but it seems really unlikely that she'd commit suicide out of the blue unless her ex was threatening or abusing her.   My friend doesn't want to go to the police about her own experience with emotional abuse from him because she was a minor at the time when she was dating him (she's not a minor currently), and believes that the police will be forced to notify her parents.  So my question is twofold - first, will the police search through the recently deceased girl's phone, facebook, and other messages to determine the reason for her death if not prompted? And if not, is it possible for my friend to tell the police about her own situation without the police informing her family?  tl;dr: Very likely that abusive boyfriend made his recent ex kill herself. Will the police investigate without being prompted? Can someone give information to the police without parents ever being notified (they live at home)?	No
532	"Now that we have just applied for my wife’s 10-year green card I suspect she may file for divorce. The ~3 marriage has struggled, due largely to factors stemming from unemployment (at times *both* of us have been unemployed). Finally and thankfully, we both have good jobs now, though they are in different states (I am in CA, where we married, she is in NY) so it’s now a long-distance marriage. I love her but I think she has checked out and I have to agree that with our new jobs if there were ever a time for a ""fresh start,"" now is it. If she files, I anticipate a ""peaceful"" separation. There's no rancor between us and not much to divide up--no kids, few assets, just a few thousand $ in the bank. If she took everything in the bank it would just be an inconvenience, really.    However, if there is one thing I have learned from this sub it’s that relying on the goodwill of an ex-spouse is asking for a disaster, and I wonder if I should be on-guard for something? For instance, could she somehow come after my future wages? Also, during one particularly difficult stretch, my parents gave us some financial support, can she go after them somehow? I think it impossible she would ever attempt such a thing even if she had recourse, but really sad things are reported on this sub every day.    One last thing: If I've accepted the inevitability of divorce, why don't I just file for it myself and get it over with? One is that I do hope this marriage might rebound and her family is emphatically behind me. Another is that I want to put all my energy into my new job and don’t anticipate acquiring much in savings or significant assets this year, I personally would prefer to defer the divorce until it has to happen.    Thanks and blessings.    TL/DR. I feel divorce is inevitable. Can I just wait for it to happen or is it urgent that I pre-emotively lawyer-up?"	No
533	"This is quite a long one.  Please excuse poor grammar. So 5 years ago I started custody on my son.  At the time he was 8.  While this started his mother refused to go to any court dates till she was handed with a contempt of court months later.  So during the next 2 years there were over 100 days of missed parenting time.  Our judge had enough of us constantly being in front of him.  None of this was due to me.  I had always done everything that was asked of me.  During this time his mother was charged with 7 drug felonies. She was allowed to use a 7411. Which means if she successfully completed her terms. That she would be charged with possession of non-narcotic.  During this time she had moved 90 miles away. And we had to meet half way which she despised doing.  Ok so now this is where the story picks up.  So on a Tuesday before my weekend I get a call from CPS.  I tell them that I will inform my lawyer and we will meet.  I work nights so mother goes to pick my son up.  The next day I ask my son what CPS was in regards to. And he says ""none of your business"".  Me and my son were really close prior to me starting custody.   We spent time together when she wanted a babysitter.  So we go to my parents house.  I tell him that he can go sot at his desk. For being disrespectful to his grandmother the weekend prior and me just then.  He wanted to get up so I tell him that he could write a report that his school was offering for extra credit.  He chose not to so I told him to continue to sit.  He was allowed to get up but I told him no TV.  He ends up watching TV with my father.  I tell him to sit back down he says no and what are you going to do about it.  I get up and I pit my hand on his ear and he walks in front of me and sits down.  Say an hour passes and I tell him he is done being punished.  We watch some soccer and go about our day.  Next day we all go to see Ghostbusters.  He has a younger brother and my ex's son who I raised since he was 1.  After we go to my house and they all play and go to the park.  We drop him off later that day.  So on the following Thursday I get a call from a detective and am told I am being accused of breaking my sons arm.  So when he was age 6 &amp; 7.  He had broke his arm in the same spot.  Now that January he had broke it for 3rd time throwing a dodgeball at school.  I call my lawyer.  And he says normally I would say not to talk to them but in your case we should.  We go and meet with him and tells me the allegations. The story was that  got mad at him and dragged him from one room to the other and threw him into the wall rebreaking his arm.  There are no accessible walls in the room.  Running a pornographic household.   For having a sex talk with a 13 &amp;12 year old.  Showing a Playboy and having a serious talk with them.  Both mother's had agreed and known about prior to use sitting down.  And then of course my wet preserved specimens were brought up.  Oh and I did this when CPS already had a investigation from her call the week prior. So during all this my children have been interviewed multiple time prior.  I have never hit my children.  I dont even yell at them.  So I go to court and I end up losing custody of my son.  If more back story is need on why I will provide.  But basically my court appointed lawyer set it for a bench trial.  And I was deemed unfit.  I did switch to my regular lawyer but the deck was already stacked. So during this time about 3 months later.  I find out I am being criminally prosecuted.   I get depressed about everything and stop going to work and make some overall bad choices.  One was having sex and getting a woman pregnant.   My youngest son was 9 and I had no plans on having any other children.   Well this woman is an addict.  While pregnant she was taking pills.  She goes to jail and then rehab then to methadone clinic then back to jail. All in her 1st 6 months.  So the baby is born. He maconian comes back positive for opiates.  CPS is involved. They find no reason to continue since she had a prescription for her last pregnancy.   Which was like 5 years prior.  Oh yea she signed rights away to her first son to her mother.  And gave her 2nd son up for adoption.  So CPS tells her that if she lives with me that they will be involved and want them out of my home.  So I still see my daughter when the mother would come over.  Till I ask for some things she took from the home.  I had bought everything for our daughter but was for the home.  The mother was essentially couch bouncing with our daughter. We stop having physical contact after this fight as she wasnt welcome in my home.  Over the course of her firat 16 months CPS had been involved 4 times.  One alleged incident involved her boyfriend shaking the baby.  These were always dismissed regardless of my concerns.   When we go for custody.   She received sole legal custody and I was denied parenting time.  I was also denied parenting time for my son. The reason was alleged abuse.  Even though the criminal charges were dismissed against me.  So last week CPS gets ahold of me and tells me the new case.  That the house she lives at is selling drugs.  Unknown number of people living there.  She smoked weed at 630 and at 1030 was in a single car rollover. 300ft of skid mark.  She was taken to jail for dui, driving suspended and child endangerment.  So today when I called they told me that our daughter was placed with her mother.  They are petitioning to remove custody from her and place her with the grandmother.  I have fought for my children endlessly. And continue to be disregarded.  Do I have any options?"	No
534	My grandfather has dementia and my mom and him set up my mom to be his financial and medical POA. Located in Illinois.  It's been 4 years and my mom has slacked completely. She hasn't done his taxes, some bills have gone unpaid, and last but not least his debit card bounced because she didn't transfer money to it (really confused him and was a bad day).  I'm not sure my mom wants to give up this title but it's at a really bad point. It won't be an easy conversation but something needs to be done.  What are my best / worst case scenarios?  Thanks.	No
535	I went to look at an apartment recently and decided I liked it. I filled out the application and paid the $45 fee, and gave them a check for the deposit, $400. They approved me and scheduled me to come in and sign the lease next week. I later decided I would rather buy a condo or townhome instead after talking to my parents and friends, and called to cancel the appointment. They told me that because I had been scheduled to sign the lease, if I didn't sign, it would be forefit.   When I get home tonight I am going to call my bank and put a hold on my check, does anyone know if this is legal or what recourse I have?	No
536	"My problem isn't with the realtor, but with the background check company they use. This is in Minnesota and the company is called Rental History Reports. If you look them up online, it returns a lot of similar stories about false information or unfinished reports being delivered to potential landlords.   Myself and two others were attempting to rent a house for $1400. The minimum required income is $4200.  They got literally all of our incomes wrong. One person makes $2560 per month, they claimed $2200. Another makes $1400 per month and they only agreed with $500 of that being ""verifiable.""   What's worse is they told my potential landlord that I make $0 per month and have $0 to my name. Yet, they had no problem verifying my 780 credit score *shrug*  They initially wanted me to provide pay stubs, but I'm self-employed and don't have pay stubs. I gave them screenshots of my bank accounts showing a bank balance over $4,000 and 30 days of deposits and cash receipts showing $2100 of income over a 30 day period. One of their employees told me this would be ""more than sufficient.""   They never informed me that they were having issues confirming my income. They just seemingly gave up and thought it would be cool to tell my potential landlord that I make $0.  This income is new, within the past few months, so it is not verifiable via tax returns. I do not deposit my cash payments into my bank account, though I do keep record of them and provide receipts to all of my clients.  Short of having them call up all of my clients over the last month to personally verify every dollar they paid me, I can't imagine what else I can do.  The only other thing I can think of is that I did not report other sources of income that could substitute, I suppose. But I don't know how to account for it exactly: I have a trust account with approx $1 million and am allowed to draw literally any amount per month (I rarely draw anything from it). My parents can verify the account. Any way to report this in a way that would satisfy their ""3x monthly income"" requirement?  I'd just have my parents co-sign, but the landlord doesn't allow it.  What else can I do? Is there no legal recourse against a company basically telling my potential landlord that I'm a supposed degenerate making literally $0?! I am just mind blown that they would think a $0 income is accurate. Just, wow....   The landlord says he will give me one week to debate with the background check company and get them to approve my income."	No
537	The housing market in the city I go to school in is very competitive this time of year and landlords tend to accept multiple applications for a single rental before determining who they're going to rent to. I have good rental history, but every year I still need to put in several applications on 'available' rentals in order to find a place because of this. I understand taking 2 or 3 applications because students might not have the best credit/rental history and you want to make sure you find someone, but I've heard of the property management company I just tried renting from taking 40+ applications for a single apartment. This seems like kind of a racket to me because that's $1600 in just applications. I had another experience recently where I paid the $80 (2 people) background check/application fee with a property management company for a rental and when I did I was told by their office lady that I was sure to get it but that it would take a few days to do the background check. After a week I called them back for an update and they said the address I put in the application for had just been rented to someone else, and I'm pretty sure they didn't even do a 'background check' on me because the references/landlord I put on the application never heard from them. They didn't even seem to remember who I was. If it's legal to accept multiple applications and deny people without reason what's stopping someone from just 'renting' a house for the application fees with no intention of actually renting the property to anyone.	No
538	"I live in a small apartment complex west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin with only six units, so there's only one washer and one dryer in the basement (coin operated). The dryer broke in early spring, so I had to drag my laundry and bedding to a local laundromat, which is not an easy task since I have to park my car in a municipal ramp a block and a half away.  I have emailed my landlord four times: 6/9, 6/30, 7/12, and today (7/19). The first response I got was ""...that dryer doesn't belong to us and we have to call the responsible party to pick it up. New dryers should be installed in the near future."" The second response I got was ""we apologize for your inconvenience and will follow up with the vending company as to when the new machines will be installed."" I never got a response from my third email; I just sent the fourth one about 15 minutes ago.  Although the washer and dryer are not explicitly noted in my lease, there is a part that says ""pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 704.07, Landlord shall keep the structure of the building in which the Premises are located and those portions of the building and equipment under Landlord's control in a reasonable state of repair.""  **TL;DR:** Landlord will not replace the lone dryer on site and has only responded to two of my four emails. Help!"	No
539	I got divorced in 2003 and I was on permanent disability. Since I first started getting disability, my wife was in control of the money due to my brain injury/mental disability. To this day, she still has full control over it. I am asking for advice on how to get it out of her name and either back into my name or another family member.  I don't know the exact amount I should be receiving, but i know that she keeps about half of the total amount. The only other source of income I have is 600$ that I receive from the insurance settlement that caused by brain injury.  She says I would probably lose the disability entirely if the disability was taken out of her name or if the bank account it's deposited into changes.   Location: Florida, Hillsborough County	No
540	In the lease for my prospective new apartment there is a clause that allows me to terminate my lease, after 30 days notice. The clause states that I must pay liquidated damages equal to two months rent ($3160).   I do not mind agreeing to liquidated damages in the event of an early termination. Considering I must give 30 days notice and the typical turn around time for apartments like this is 60 days, I feel one months rent as damages should suffice.   How do I go about negotiating this aspect of my lease?	No
541	Within the past month (sometime between July 7th and now), the cost of housing in my dorm listed on the ASU website was increased by $69 a semester. The amount listed, before and after the change, was explicitly listed as the cost for the 2017-2018 school year. This change in price was well after a late cancellation fee of $500 was in effect (the fee slowly ramped up, reaching the full $500 on June 20th).  At the end of the previous school year, to sign up for housing, we had to agree to [this](https://housing.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2017-2018_license_agreement_-_ftf-ret-upp.pdf) housing agreement. Part of this agreement does say  &gt; The Arizona Board of Regents, ASU, and/or designated facility management companies reserve the right to change room rates and other charges and fees if circumstances require adjustments.  Is it legal for ASU to change the amount they charge for housing after a cancellation fee is in effect?	No
542	How do I get proper legal advice on this? do I approach a tax attorney or an accountant? I used TurboTax to file taxes for the past two years.  Is getting proper legal advice going to be more expensive (or close) to paying this debt directly?  If I can get advice on this directly that would be great, but I am almost more afraid and need advice on getting the proper legal advice itself.	No
543	"For the 2 years I've lived here, we've gotten along reasonably well.  However, his last tantrum was the last straw.  I'm outta here.  When I moved in, I paid $1,200- first and last month's rent.  As far as I'm concerned, my financial obligations to him are satisfied.  His response note claims that I should pay:  * Half the cost for a housekeeper to come in and deep clean the place  * Half the cost of professional carpet cleaning for the entire house  * The entire cost of a new queen sized mattress because it's the ""right thing to do""   Since we never discussed getting a housekeeper (and I was the only one to ever vacuum, anyway), he's entitled to zero.  I will, however, be a stand up guy and run the vacuum one more time before I leave.  We DID talk about renting a carpet cleaning machine.  I agreed.  I did NOT agree to have a service company come in to do the work.  It looks like my share of  a 2-day machine rental + a large bottle of solution comes to around $35.  Replace the bed?  Not a fucking chance.   None of his end-game stipulations were written into our initial rental contract.    Is there any law compelling me to meet any of his demands?  I want to be fair about this, but will not allow myself to be taken advantage of.  What are your thoughts?"	No
544	My parents and I were recently involved into an armed robbery (two young thugs followed us from the casino after they saw my dad winning some money. They did not shoot us, but one of them threatened us with an actual handgun) and got a notification from the county detective that they got arrested few days ago. I am glad that these stupid thugs, as they committed armed robbery few more times before they got arrested, are caught and will serve their sentences. However, I am concerned whether my family would be able to get the money back or not. They stole approximately 4,000-5,000 dollars in total and threw away all of our wallets and my mom's backpack right after they robbed us.   PS. How much jail time would they have to serve if they were arrested for multiple cases of an armed robbery? I have been hearing a lot of different stories, from 5 years to even 20 years. I am pretty sure they cannot afford to have a lawyer.	No
545	USA - Colorado  I'll try and keep it short and to the point. I'll try not to rant, but I can't make any promises lol.  He doesn't follow a single rule that I told him when he first moved in. He's stealing my beer and is only 20. He got fired from his job because he refused to do his job on a daily basis. He violates my personal space all the time and I can't take it. He gets angry very easily and treats me like a doormat even though I pay most the rent. I've given him so many chances to redeem himself, but he simply refuses.  I told him I wanted him out in 30 days. Right now it's only been 12, but his behavior is getting extremely worse and I'm tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. **He's not on the lease** and I wanted to know if it's possible to get him out sooner. I was told by numerous people I legally have to give him 30 days, but I need to know if I can get him out sooner before things get worse.  Is it legally required to give him 30 days to move out in Colorado? He's not on the lease and didn't even pay rent this month.	No
546	Hello  I live with my bf and i had a pet (dog/cat, rather not say which) for 2 years before we moved in together. Once we moved in he expressed hatred for my pet. He was willing to deal with it, it seemed. But we got into multiple fights daily because of the pet's behavior. I mentioned once in passing that I feel I might have to give the pet away (this was in no way shape or form permission for him to give away my pet, just a passing thought because of our fighting). But he said, no don't do that.   One day I go to work and I come home to no pet. He decided to give it to a coworker without my permission or knowledge. Once I expressed to him how upset this made me, he promised to get it back. Well the coworker gave the pet to someone else as a gift, but was willing to work with us. He approached the person he gave the gift to.  Gift receiver said no initially. So we offered money. Person later felt bad when they found out the pet was not a random animal but in fact had a previous owner and was given away without permission(they had no idea the pet was not a stray when they received it as a gift). But would only return animal if money was offered to recoup for expenses ($200). We paid money happily.   Gift receiver starts giving us the runaround at this point. Keeps promising to return pet if we met at their house, but refused to meet anywhere else. The whole thing was shady and weird but I was desperate. When we arrived at the residence the new owner said hang tight while I find the pet. Never came back to the door. After almost an hour we knock again and they tell bf to come inside. I'm not sure what happened at this point but there was some sort of altercation and pet was never returned. We left. Situation was sketchy and we were worried about our safety.   My question is, what can we do at this point? This person has agreed to return the pet, with no problem, but now it has been a few months since we initially started going back and forth with these people. I understand the pet was given away but the pet did not belong to the person who gave them away in the first place. And what's more, we paid this person money and now we feel left high and dry. Aside from the situation i have to deal with inside of my relationship because my significant other thought it was okay to give away my beloved pet, what else can i do to deal with new owner?  TL; DR:  Boyfriend gave my pet away without my permission. Person in turn gave pet to someone else as a gift. New owner thought gift was a stray, was not aware it had a previous owner. We offered money in exchange for pet. New owner insisted we meet at their house to pick it up (this was weeks after we paid $200 to them). Upon arrival at new owners house we were met with confrontation and never received my pet. What else can I do?	No
547	So I had a home loan that was sold to Nationstar mortgage (about to be Mr. Cooper &lt;&lt;weird name).  Escrow was paid and had no trouble the first year.  So I get a notice in the mail today stating they'll provide insurance because my coverage lapsed.  After talking with Esurance and them both stating one or the other did not notify each other, my premium is up $400 a year due to the lapse.  Is there any legal protection for me as this rate increase is all on the mortgage company's fault I believe.	No
548	I rent my apartment. I talked to my landlord about installing a smart thermostat. He said it was fine but I had to leave it which is fine. Fast forward two months when I found out I can get a rebate from my gas company for buying and installing said smart device as long as it was in 2017, which it was. I applied for this through my gas company. I got a rebate for it and it got delivered just a few days ago. I haven't cashed it yet. My landlord also had some work done on the apartments to have the windows and doors redone to energy efficient ones. He just messaged me saying the rebate I got was his and I needed to write him a check for the same amount. The paperwork says it is specifically for the smart thermostat which I paid for and installed as well as have the receipt for purchase of it. What should I do?	No
549	Was married a bit over 4.5 years, separated in Dec 2014. I filed in June 2016 for dissolution. We have no kids, she had a BA from UCLA before we married, didn't work during our marriage,  got her MA while we were separated, and got everything she asked the court for. I supported her for 13 months while we were separated. In that 13 months, she got $42,000.00 worth of support. I am active duty military, we don't get paid that much, so this amount of money is pretty big to me. Before we got married, she was arrested for assaulting me inn my barracks room. She took a plea for disturbing the peace. The judge still ordered I pay half of a college bill, which I never benefited from since she never worked, and pay her $1,800.00 a month for the next 14 months. I literally can not afford that. I provided my bank statements, for the last 3 years, as evidence, but I don't think the judge even looked at them. They had cover sheets with everything already calculated as to who got what, and highlighted. It would have been very easy to look through and see what I had paid her already. How can I be ordered to support someone so much when they were arrested, and convicted? How can I appeal, our file a motion for reconsideration, when I literally can't afford any of the options? How am I going to support my current wife and two step sons? Please, help me!	No
550	Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	No
551	"Every day at 4:00pm my college campus posts available on-campus housing contracts for sale at an online webpage. There is a huge shortage of contracts for students (and nearby off-campus housing is expensive) so the demand is huge and getting one of these contracts is like winning the lottery. I attend a private university.  I wrote a internet bot that refreshes the housing page 30+ times per second and reserves a contract the instant it appears. I successfully used it on myself to get a housing contract. I feel like if I released my bot as a service there would be a big demand for it. Something like ""Pay $50 to guarantee a contract"".  What things should I consider from a legal perspective before launching this type of service? I would need to collect their login information, log in on behalf of the student, and use my bot to put the contract on hold. I wouldn't need to actually pay for or sign any sort of lease agreement for the student. They would finalize the contract after later logging into their account.  In other words, could this be illegal? How should I know if this could get me in trouble with my college? Is it a bad idea to talk to the college directly? Are there other business models that could minimize my risk to legal repercussions?"	No
552	Got busted by some small town cops for simple possession and paraphernalia of marijuana. Have to go down to jail and book myself, but it looks like the university I'm attending runs on a self reporting arrest policy. If I report I'll likely get 1 semester of suspension, if I don't report they will have to run some background checks on me out of the blue for me to be caught, but if I'm caught I get expelled I believe. Is it smart to not report this incident?	No
553	I just got home today, and there was a letter wedged in my screen door that had a bunch of information on it describing our termination of tenancy. The thing is, my house isn't rented, we bought the house, and the name that the letter was directed to wasn't ours, although it was our address. Is this a scam? Should i just ignore it?	No
554	There was no eviction, I had given a 30 day notice on a month to month lease.  I was cleaning up small details and clock hit midnight on the 30th day and landlord stormed in and caused a scene. Called the cops and demanded I leave. I didn't and cops said this was a civil matter. I ended up wrapping up the cleaning and leaving thirty minutes after midnight.    what are my options, if any?	No
555	"My house has been in foreclosure. Knowing that we would be forced to move out at some point, my family and I moved in with relatives a few blocks away.    Knowing that we would have to be notified and given some time before we were evicted, we kept a lot of stuff at the house. Some of it was large stuff like furniture that we didn't have room for and didn't want to pay storage for, and some of it was antiques, books, or other stuff that I had accumulated that I would sell from time-to-time.   I go to the house once a week to collect the mail and occasionally go inside to grab some stuff. I showed up today and there was a dumpster filled with my stuff and a crew working inside. The locks had been changed.    I was definitely not served with any notice to vacate or anything like that. I called the police to file a report. They came to the house and told me there was nothing they could do, that I should have known this would happen since I knew I was in foreclosure, that it was my word against theirs (though there was no one claiming that they were right to evict me, and I showed them mail with my name and the address of the house in question), and that I should call an attorney or the Sheriff's office.   The construction crew put me in touch with the ""new owner"" (quotations because I only have his word, as I haven't been served with anything), who said that he thought the property had been vacated because he had been inside a bunch of times and hadn't seen beds, though it was full of other stuff, and because I wasn't taking good care of the lawn and the inside needed a bunch of repairs. He admitted that he hadn't made any attempt to reach me, by phone or mail, even though the neighbors on either side and across the street all know me, have my number, and know where I'm living. He definitely didn't use the sheriff's office.  This all happened in the last few hours. I haven't had any luck getting an attorney yet. I took some pictures of the full dumpster, but I have no way of making a full inventory. Is there something else I should be doing? Is it true that I shouldn't be filing a police report?   Thank you for any help."	No
