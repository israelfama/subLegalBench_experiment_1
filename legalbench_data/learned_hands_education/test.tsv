0	I received and email from my schools financial aid office notifying me that my low GPA from last semester could possibly put my financial aid in jeopardy. This email was sent with a open mailing list of every other student who received poor enough grades to have their financial aid threatened. From my understanding my grades are supposed to be private from other students and this may be a violation of something called FERPA. Should I or can I pursue legal action?	Yes
1	The situation is my sister was enrolled in a dual enrollment high school program at a local university where she went and lived on campus to take classes. My parents were not involved in any of the application or enrollment process and neither saw nor signed any paperwork. For context, She is not on good terms with my parents and has a long history of behavioral issues. They weren't really told anything about this program.  My sister told my parents when asked about how she would pay that she had money saved from working at Starbucks and had taken a student loan.  My parents later found out that there was in fact no loan or money and that the huge tuition bill was due. My sister is 17 (18 in two months) and is still technically a minor.  The university is making lots of threats to my parents if they don't pay. However, they never knew about any of this or signed any paperwork to make them liable for a $10,000+ bill.   Legally, can the school come after my parents for this?	Yes
2	For the 2016-2017 school year I was a freshman at a top university in New York. Second semester I withdrew because I realized I could no longer afford it, and moved back home to California. Because I withdrew in time, they refunded me half of my tuition for the semester, which was about $12-$13k. Almost as soon as I got the money, I sent it to my loan company as a payment (this was in March).  A few days ago I received a letter in the mail stating that I owe the school $31,000 (~$30,000 for tuition and ~$950 in interest) for the semester. I brushed it off for a few days until today, thinking that it was just a bill for next semester that was accidentally sent to me. So I called and the lady speaking to me told me that the bill was actually for the past semester, and that they had canceled the loan they had received from the government (I was never informed of this). She tells me I owe the $30,000, plus it accrues a 1% interest rate monthly, which is why I also owe around $950.  I can't afford $31,000 out of nowhere, hence why I even took the loans out in the first place.  My question is, was it even legal that they didn't disclose that they declined the loan money? Where do I go from here?	Yes
3	"I'll try to be as brief as possible.  It's my senior year. My school is trying to make me get on a mandatory meal plan. They changed to a new provider with a new requirement that all students purchase it (it makes the school money). I already lived off campus so I could cook my food and because of my mental health am not always able to go to a huge dining hall with hundreds of other people every single time I want to eat. I would just eat at home but I can't both pay for the plan and buy food.   I have anxiety and depression as diagnosed by a medical professional. The school knows this and has known it for three years because they give me accommodations.  When I spoke with a woman in the accessibility office (who has not answered any of my questions in a timely or complete manner), she told me there is no longer a medical meal plan option and that students who used to have one would have to work with the dining company in the first week of school to work out a good solution. I know for a fact that since my refusal is rooted in a health issue this could be breaking HIPAA among other things (please let me know). It smells really illegal and discriminatory.   Does the Americans with disabilities act make it illegal to force me to go to the dining hall? Title 9? What legal language should I use? Interested in any and all suggestions.  One girl said the school wouldn't help her until she used the words ""eating disorder"" so I'm thinking about trying that. But I still have a diagnosed mental illness and can get a medical professional to request accommodations accordingly, so it still feels like they should not be able to sweep me under the rug legally even though my illness' connection to food might fall in a grey area according to some people.   Please help me fight my school that only cares about my money and not my health. I'm mad."	Yes
4	I am 17. I live in California. I often wear a large butt plug to school because it feels good. A teacher found out I do this, gave me detention, and threatened to call my parents. I did nothing wrong. What do I do?	Yes
5	TLDR is, degree, terrible job, want to change my life in any way I can. It's incredibly depressing, and I want to know what are my options. I heard conflicting things:  * it's easy/hard to get tuition paid on unemployment  * you have to be a minority they recognize  * you actually have to be on unemployment for &gt;24wks before they even consider helping you, which seems incredibly counter-productive  * even if you get it, you're not getting essentials covered by UI, just tuition  Help me /r/legaladvice you're my only hope. As I'm too broke to do much else. Thanks for reading	Yes
6	"Hey everyone!  I'm a Canadian, wanting to attend a professional degree program in the US. I have some questions about US Education Law and would like to find a lawyer, but I'm currently in Canada where I'm assuming most Education Lawyers will be experts in law that is specific to Canada. Is it possible to ""meet"" with a lawyer remotely and where would be a good starting place to find such a lawyer?  Thank you."	Yes
7	During one of my semesters at college I had to have nerve surgery on my arm and was not given accommodations despite bringing evidence to the accommodation office of having surgery. Upon my return with my arm in my sling I still was given no option to reschedule a test. I told my teacher that I had doctors orders to stay in bed and he outright refused to accomadate me. Do I have a claim?	Yes
8	My local high school is out of control and I am OUT an additional $1000 because of their arbitrary decisions.    I got two kids in high school, sophomore and junior. It seems like I can expect to pay $400-900 per year per student and swallowed an additional sunk cost of $1000 of two iPads I purchased that they do not allow to bring anymore, forcing you to rent.   Is there a public government department to file complaints to avoid litigation?  The fees are  Registration - $160 Technology - $185 Advanced Placement - $92 per class Drivers ed - $300 Sports/Parking additional Students have to purchase ALL books each year, not school supplied.   I do not make much money,  but too much for assistance (50k). I was also unemployed for half a year last year because of the shakey economy.   This is getting out of control. I have to stress and dip into college savings to pay for high school. Personal safety net was depleted a while ago.   While I can agree with most the fees, the only thing that angers me is that they told me I could buy my own iPad, and now after a year thy discontinue it and tell me to rent there's.   --  Here was my reasoning. By bringing your own they knocked $100 off the technology fee per year.  The schools iPads are 4 years old and  in poor condition.   With the savings of $400 over the high school period I bought an iPad Pro for slightly more. Not only do I get to keep it after four years instead of returning it, it was more up to date and supports a stylus.   Now they pulled support. So in addition to my $2000 yearly expenditure, I lost a $1000 more due to policy.   Is there a public avenue for filing complaints. This is out of control.	Yes
9	"[Original Thread Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/6l543s/im_being_accused_of_academic_dishonesty_violation/).   In two weeks I'll have a hearing scheduled to determine whether I cheated on 2 final exams. These are being held as 2 separate cases, so if I am found guilty of both, the university has the right to expel me. I studied for these exams without the aid of others.  **Relevant details:**  * On first final exam: I got 11/80 questions wrong. Three other people had the same 11/80 wrong and put the same thing for their wrong answers. I'm wondering if they sat behind me and were able to see my answers? Apparently another, who took the exam early, had similar answers but not exact. There is no allegations of a ""leaked"" answer key, only a similar pattern of answers between students. Still, the accusers assume that the exam was leaked during this final as well, due to the similarity of answers between students and the student(s) who took the exam early.  * On second final exam: 5 of my answers were wrong and match up with an alleged ""leaked"" answer key. These are the only 5 questions I got wrong on the whole exam, and I put what I thought was the best answer at the time. The department has a copy of my final exam, which clearly shows my work on most questions, and my reasoning (process of elimination, marking off certain answers in order to narrow down choices to the correct answer). I also did 8-10% better on the final exam than the others being accused of cheating.  The accusers thinks that in both cases, answers to the exams were leaked by student(s) who took the exam early because a number of students had similar answer patterns on both finals. The board has narrowed it down to students they think committed cheating on both exams, by looking at patterns of answers on both exams, and I was grouped in with the alleged cheaters.   The first thing I did was email my lab professor, who I had for both of these classes in which I was accused. She works DIRECTLY with the people accusing me, and is a full-time Ph.D instructor of both of the classes. So she seemed like the best person I could go to. I asked her to write me an email vouching for my integrity as a student, and this is what she said:  &gt; What is baffling is why this issue is being brought out now long after your semester is over.  &gt; I think that my comments about your integrity would be of more help if it is written to the board/committee instead of directly to you. Wouldn't this make more sense? I think that would surely help your case. I can definitely do this part because when it is called for because I have known you for two semesters ([Class 1] and [Class 2]) and you were indeed one of the best students of the class. I am confident about your integrity. I am surprised a sincere student as you has to face this unfortunate situation. Could it be that this has occurred due to some miscommunication or rather due to some strange coincidence?  &gt; Either way, I am sure you would be able to convincingly explain to the committee to absolve yourself. I can do my part at that stage if it is required. So, keep me updated of the developments if my support/help is needed.  &gt; I am positive that you would get over this issue unscathed.  I immediately printed this email out and gave it to the person advising my case. She looked impressed that I was able to get a letter from someone who instructed me in both of the classes in which I was accused of cheating, so I hope that's a good sign.  Looking through the documents, it appears that the professor, after discovering potential cheating, originally considered voiding the final and basing the students grades on lab performance. Ultimately this was not done. But If that were the case, I would have received very good grades, as my lab grades were excellent. Should I bring this up to the board?  Also, I looked at the stats for the 5 questions I got wrong that matched the alleged ""leaked"" answer key and at least 45 other students had the same wrong answer as I did. Another thing that baffles me is that if student(s) did take the exam early, surely they were being supervised?  I have 200 credits and am on the cusp of 2 degrees, and have attended this university for 6 years. Now this situation happens to me, a month before I graduate. I cannot afford to re-take classes, and I certainly cannot afford to pay back my loans if I am falsely accused of cheating.  The frustrating part is that final decisions are made by a board of students. This seems unfair, as students probably tend to side with professors (the accusers), not the students (accused).  I cannot sleep at night thinking about this. I don't even know how to write an opening or closing statement. Any advice on what I can do to resolve this situation would make a world of difference.  Thank you for reading."	Yes
10	I was falsely moved to special ed in third grade. My disabilities do not affect my intelligence (dyslexia, dysgraphia and ADHD) I know people you have the the same / similar at my school and are not in Special Ed. And I would like to know if I could pursue legal action.	Yes
11	This happened several years ago, when I was about 13 years old.   I verbally threatened to kill a classmate. I was just a dumb 13 year old, and no reasonable person should have taken me seriously.  My school principal told me that I would get an 80 day suspension, but yet she never contacted my parents. And I never told my parents because I didnt want them to know.  Then, for the next 2 weeks, monday to Friday I was instructed to sit in an uncomfortable wooden chair and do nothing at all for the whole day every day. This is 9 am to 3 pm, sitting in a chair doing nothing but staring at a wall for 10 days. (2 weeks). Nobody to talk to and nothing to do but look at the wall.  This is 60 hours of isolation. I felt like a prisoner in those isolation things.   Then abruptly, she told me that my punishment is done. I never received any paperwork or documentation of anything at all. I found her reaction incredibly harsh.  Was I morally abused?  Is there any legal action that should have been taken at the time? Is there any legal action that can be taken now, year later?	Yes
12	Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	Yes
13	So... When I was 17 I decided it was a good idea to begin taking out school loans (10,000-12,000 per year for 5 years) to go to a private Christian college. Dumbest decision of my life. This is my ONLY regret in life so far. I can't believe NO ONE told me it WASN'T a good idea to be taking out this much money in loans. I didn't even enjoy my time in college. It was terrible and the school was going through financial difficulties and it impacted the students negatively (so I feel that I didn't even get a quality education). Now it's been 3 years since graduation and I'm still regretting all of this. Almost every day I wish there was a way to retract my debt (even if it means retracting my BA). I'm sure I'm just screwed, but legally is there anything I could do to get out of this debt? Like suing the school or something? I'm sure there's not but it's on my mind pretty much all day everyday so I figured I'd at least ask. Thanks in advance!	Yes
14	So I received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/spDd1) in the mail today along with a settlement check in the mail today.  This is the very first I've heard of a law suit against DeVry for fraudulent advertising.  I attended DeVry from 2010-12 and incurred significant student loans but never graduated.  The loan in question is actually in default and it would be absolutely amazing for my life if I could get out of paying it back.  That probably makes me sound like a horrible human being but I'll live with it if I can get out from underneath that mountain of debt.  I went to [the mentioned website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) but I really don't understand if I qualify or not.  If anyone could advise I'd greatly appreciate it.	Yes
15	I took out a student loan in 2013 to attend trade school with a company called TFG and we paid those off in full. Now - 4 years later - NELNET is calling me saying that I have a student loan that is delinquent and will need to pay or it will start affecting my credit.   I know for a fact that we never took out federal student loans. What do I do?	Yes
16	I'm trying to enroll my child in kindergarten. I attended pre-reg in April and provided my lease and copy of utilities. All utilities are in my name. On lease my name is listed under occupants, but my step mother is the primary lease holder. (She signed for me 2 years ago when I first got back to the US because of the employment gap.)    Received letter stating that I am required to appear with the primary lease holder in person on a specific date/hours next week for her to sign an affidavit saying I live there. Apparently this is a new county wide requirement put in place specifically to [irrelevant opinion.] She cannot be here for it. She can't leave work and she lives out of state. They said she can't have it signed and notarized not in person. (She has never lived in the apartment and signed online. Basically my guarantor or whatever.)  I called the school board and they said a wordier version of too bad and that she has to come. Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated. I'm assuming I have to miss work and show up alone, but do I have any leg to stand on to get her enrolled?  Don't they have to enroll even homeless kids?	Yes
17	"I (EU citizen) moved to another EU country a while back and been learning their language for some years now. I changed the language school recently (end 2016) to be closer to my home and they informed me I can get B2 diplom before summer holiday which is great for me because I wanted to go to univercity here.  However due to (what I believe is their) mistake I am not able to do the exams in time and now I got to wait a whole year before I can apply for univercity.   Where did the mistake come from? Well when I switched to this new school I'll addmit my speaking was not the greatest however I had gotten a paper from the other school that I can be in a class where people learn to become B2 level, but they simply made me take their school test and marked me as level A2. For 2 months I was in a group where I felt I was not growing at all. I had 2 other classmates that were aiming to have B2 level and were about same level as me. Rest were complete beginners.  Here comes my biggest problem. Basically the teacher felt I was ready for the B2 books but the 2 other students were almost done with their B1 books so I needed to wait for them.   Second problem was that I was promised classic lessons (teacher teaches everyone) but instead we were divided into THREE groups and teacher jumped between all of them. To us tho, the least. Because to become B2 you need to work a lot on your own aperently. But what am I paying for? To speak with people that are just as bad in the language as me and there is no one to correct us? I can also work alone at home and not come to school at all.   It took 2 months to sort this situation to better but not ideal. I got a different teacher but the group situation remaind. Now instead of having 3 different groups we have 2. There is a lot more classical lessons but I still feel the tempo for us who wants to become B2 is slowed down due to the people who are aimimg to become B1.  After not bein fully satisfied I wrote a complaint e-mail to them and got no answer for a month and I sent a reminder but still got no answer for over half a year.   The reason I sent a second reminder is because I realised I needed to extend my contract for 2 extra month to be ready for exams... 2 months that I lost in the beginning.  They responded with that they do not understand what I am complaining about because they sorted the problem (havin 2 different language level groups in one group instead of 3) and therefor do not undernstand what I want.  After mentioning the money wasted for the 2 months they now want to schedule a meeting with the teacher I had for 2 months. Yes i gave the times I'm available but I feel like they are completely dodging the fault they made not the teacher. Yes it was wrong of my teacher to say I need to work on my own for most of the time. BUT it is NOT the teachers fault of having so many students of so many different language levels.  I am afraid of getting an ""enemy"" that is not suppose to be my enemy. The teacher made mistakes but the biggest problems came from the school itself and every email I've gotten from them is so passive and not acknowledging anything and just blaming it on someone else.  What should I do in the meeting? What should I be prepared for? I will definetly make preperations of all problems I have with them (this isn't the only one) but my biggest fear is that I can not stand my ground because I have to do it in THEIR language. I was wondering of asking to record the conversation but I can understand if the teacher that is dragged into this doesn't want to be recorded. What should I do then?  My apologies if this isn't the correct subreddit. Just point me to the right direction and I'll post it there instead.  Tl;dr: language school made me waste 2 months. Missed applying to univercity because I couldn't do language exams on time due to wrong class placement. School makes me have meeting with them and the teacher. Teacher very little at fault. What should I do during the meeting?"	Yes
18	I was set to graduate from college within the prescribed 4 years. The final classes I needed to graduate were not offered at my university (small liberal arts college). I missed out on registering for the classes at another school so my time in school was to be extended by a semester. The financial aid office and business offices at my school are terrible. They took forever to get back to me and since I was over 21 they requested dependent verification paperwork. This all took place halfway through the final semester. I had filled out all requirements on my part to receive my financial aid. The only thing I needed to submit was my mother’s tax return forms. Well since I had not graduated on time my mother was upset and kicked me out of her house. So there I was in school, homeless and broke so I stopped attending classes.   Now I am 10,000 in debt outside of student loans with the school. My concern is how is this possible if I never approved my financial aid (loans). The fault lies in the bad timing on the school’s part. It takes them far too long to communicate with students. Is there anything I can do? I am in too much debit to ignore this and not get a degree. Especially considering the quality of education at the school is a joke and everybody cheats.   I don’t want to come off as vindictive but my attempts at speaking to the administration have not yielded any results. What can I do to make them listen? Will contacting the accreditation bureau help? I want to include legal action but so far that is a hollow threat with the condition of my finances. Should I get legal representation or find another way to handle this?	Yes
19	This happened before states began to outlaw student teacher relationships even if the student was over the age of consent.  Essentially, when I was going through a rough time emotionally, I began receiving a lot of extra attention from a teacher. It started innocently and then progressed to emails, followed my phone calls, then texts, then flirting, some sexting and sending him pictures of me in skimpy negligees. When I graduated high school (he was still my teacher for a summer session) we began to go out on dates. He then came to my college to take control of the department I was majoring in and remained my teacher throughout college (we maintained a relationship during this time).   Now with all of the new legislation and scandals being unearthed (like the choate one) I'm wondering if I have an obligation to report this to someone (the school, his current employer which still has him around students all the time etc). I don't want to get him in trouble because I do still care about him and as far as I'm aware he didn't break any laws (except possession of child porn when I sent the negligee pics (if they count) but they are long gone from all of my electronic devices (this was before the cloud etc).   See the thing is, I don't know if what he did was wrong/ illegal. My therapist (when I was 17 and involved with him) told me to cut ties but never reported him. My guidance counselor at school knew because the man in question didn't have a drivers license so I drove him one on one to the practice he had at another school after ours was over and I once told my guidance counselor I may be late because of driving him and she said it was inappropriate but never followed up. I don't like thinking I was groomed or a victim (though he was emotionally abusive once he had me in the relationship).   I also have proof/know he did this with at least four other students.  So, if it happens in the future and I don't report it am I liable for what happens to any further students he becomes involved with?   Do I have a legal obligation to report it to the schools he works for?  I need to know if there's anything I need (or should) do from a legal standpoint.   I don't want to press charges (I can't he did nothing illegal with me) and I don't want to get him in trouble but I also don't want any other students to go through what I did and I what I know others did because of his narcissism (he's diagnosed) and emotional abuse.  Yes, I am in therapy for this and working through it and I know it's messed up that I care for him but I do. I just need to know what my legal obligations are.	Yes
20	I began my mPharm course in 2015. This was the university's first year with pharmacy students. The regulations to pass, were extremely strict, and because i failed 1 low weighted assignment in the each of the 2 seperate modules, the year after I had to retake one of these modules, costing me £9000 in tuition and a frther £5k debt in student loans. As students we werent informed of these strict rules before or during the first year of the course. This year the school of pharmacy completely changed the pass regulations, it is now much more reasonable and easy to pass. Under these regulations my grades would have easily have been good enough.  to clarify my marks for both modules were &gt;60%. However the original rules dictated I could not get less than 40% in anything, without resit oppurtunity. As a result I had to resit the module next year at a cost of £9k. The rules were changed a year later, to allow my original pass, and also with the oppurtunity to resit the components, without being capped.   Is there any potential for me to be reimbursed for this tuition fee, due to this sudden rule change, being implied.	Yes
21	I'm an international student at a Dutch university. In the academic year 2016-2017 I was unable to obtain 30ECs and hence my Residence permit will most likley be revoked. However if I transfer to a different university in the Netherlands to start a new course from Sept 2017 will I be able to stay in the Netherlands? I couldn't contact IND so I'm asking here. I hope someone here knows about this. And the MoMi states that you have to gain 30ECs ie half of the Total 1st year credit points at the University where you're enrolled to continue your studies and stay in the Netherlands.	Yes
22	When i started, and was attending university, my father never let me see any of the paper work, i was there on grants, which covered my tuition (and according to my father, my housing as well) i was never given any information regarding my finances regarding my time there, all of it was sent to his email, this went on for four years, i asked pretty regularly to see the paper work (student emails saying forms were due when i asked generally FAFSA and what have you) during my last semester i received an email saying i needed to take an online loan repayment course (this came from the school to my student email) so i went to the studentloan.gov site only to find i had an account byt could not sign in, upon further investigation i found my father had made the account and the emails from the sites routed to his email. I asked him about this many times and he delflected the question and blame. Later that year my older sister who had graduated was informed she had students loans taken out during her time (mind younshe was on the same set of grants as i) so i decided to dig around in my student information from my school, low and behold over 35k in student loans i never knew about. Or signed for.    Is there legal action i can take to help this at all? I the only reason i went to college to begin with was because I was told my grants/scholarship paid for everything.  Important note, my father has also commited various amounts of identity theft on myself, my mother and my sisters. Going so far as to take all the equity out of the house i grew up in and lose the house.  Tldr version: My father signed papers with my name agreeing to accept government loans to pay for housing in college and kept me in the dark about it.  Please help, im not a savant on this kind of thing and need advice.	Yes
23	Hello!  I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.  This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.  When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?  Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.  Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.  I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.  I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.  At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.  I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)  It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.  **tl:dr University won't accept payment via an AmeriCorps award, won't release transcript, how do I negotiate with them?**	Yes
24	I know this is going to sound petty and make me look like an entitled petty teenager but given that all adults in my life seem to be ignoring me, the internet could probably give me better advice.  I took my Exams back in November and my results were as expected all A* with one surprising exception, my English literature grade was a c. My parents were of-course slightly disappointed but in light of my success in the rest of the course, they weren't too bothered. I investigated and asked class-mates about their grade and the results consistently showed that on average everyone scored two points below their expectations  It seemed like my teacher had devoted far too much time to advancing a fringe interpretation of the text based on modern philosophy that wouldn't apply to texts such as those we studied which was responsible for our low-grade.  I'm wondering if my English class could collectively sue the teacher for failing to teach appropriately?	Yes
25	"I live in Arizona, but the university is in Virginia.  I was guided here from r/personalfinance   I graduated in 2015 from this university and now attend dental school in a completely different state. I was randomly checking my university email which I never do and I saw that apparently ""I"" had registered for two in-person classes for the summer and now have about $2700 to owe. These classes are still in session and I also have emails from the professors that I am failing these classes, etc. I am not sure where the mix up is but how can I prove that I never registered for these classes and that I have no motive to take these classes. I am not sure if someone logged into my account and registered for them or if there was some IT error. This is really worrisome as I definitely don't have the money to pay for it nor in my mind should I. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
26	"I am writing this post on behalf of a friend who I know very well and has found himself in a frustrating predicament and is in need of some advice. Background Story: My friend obtained a grant to carry out and complete a Master's dissertation in Chemistry which he has to finish by September or else risk having to pay the grant himself, which he cannot afford.  What Happened: My friend was assigned to a completely new tutor/supervisor, lets call her Dr. Smith for simplicity's sake. This is Dr. Smith's first year working at University and is thus supervising her first two students who she is being abusive against. The problem first started when my friend cordially disagreed with Dr. Smith on how a particular calculation should be worked out - a classical example of a student not agreeing with his teacher and the teacher taking it completely the wrong way (the displacement defense mechanism).  The latter is just the tip of the iceberg, on several occasions she has called my friend 'stupid' to his face (and even his colleague) in an aggressive tone. Her personality is what I would describe as toxic and straight out abusive. It got to a point where my friend had to be careful of everything that he does, says or asks because of a possible tantrum by Dr. Smith. This took a toll on my friend so he approached Dr. Smith and told her that she was being too aggressive and was intimidating him. Once again Dr. Smith took it completely wrong, not only was she completely oblivious to how abusive she has been but she accused my friend of being aggressive, not working hard enough and at times, intimidating her. Now I know my friend really well and if I had to describe him I would say that he's extremely passive, smart and hardworking so her accusations genuinely dumbfounded me. My friend realized that his chat clearly got him nowhere and made things a lot worse. Knowing that he needs Dr. Smith to complete his Master's degree, my friend decided to take the higher road and ""suck up"" to his supervisor so he sent her an apology email, hoping that if he would be the first to reach out and make a compromise to settle their differences Dr. Smith would TRY to do the same. WRONG, she did not even read his email and they got to a point where Dr. Smith kicked him out of the lab and told him that she is not going to work with him anymore. At this point, my friend is not completely screwed as she won't let him complete his dissertation so he setup a meeting with the faculty Dean to explain things to him which was unfruitful as she ended up 'hijacking' his meeting and turn it into a scolding session against him.  With no options left he decided to setup a meeting with the disciplinary board and he explained his case quite well in privacy this time and was quite convincing. Dr. Smith also had a meeting with the board and used my friend's apology email as leverage to falsely prove her point. It seems like the disciplinary board is more inclined to believe Dr. Smith because the apology email demonstrated my friend’s guilt (from their point of view) rather than the fact that he was willing to take the higher road as he is in need off of his tutor (however crazy she is).  My question now is, if the disciplinary board decided to side with Dr. Smith, what else can my friend do or who else should he turn to? The situation that he's in is not only unjust because he's going to be robbed of a Master's degree which he's so close to finishing but also because he will have to pay for the grant that he worked so hard to obtain, all because of a person who has personality issues and is good at hiding it/lie about it during disciplinary meetings. Should he find a legal advisor or attorney considering that he’s broke? Does he stand a chance in tribunal or court? Is taking legal action even worth it?  I apologize for posting such a long post, I did not realize that it was going to be this long and I am sincerely very grateful for any advice whatsoever as none of his friends seem to be able to think of a way to help him, hence why I am here."	Yes
27	"Clarksville TN, CHS.  I sold and printed about a hundred shirts with the message ""Sex Is Okay"" and a illustration of a bee. They are innocent in appearance, as was my intention.  The reason I did this was to promote a more open culture in regard to sexuality among people of my generation. I live in the southern US where sex negativity is at the root of massive STD rates, teen pregnancies, and foolish legal jurisdictions. I knew the school wouldn't be HAPPY about this, but since I saw them as being a part of the problem, I figured that was unavoidable.  What I did not expect was for the school to bar me and my fellow supporters from wearing the shirts all together.  I understand that the school DOES have the right to bar freedom of speech if it is ""vulgar"" as defined by the Bethel VS. Fraser case, and if it poses a ""material and substantial disruption"" as defined by the Des Moines VS Tinker supreme court trial, but I can see no argument by which the word ""sex"" is vulgar, as there is no more politically correct replacement. Besides, the word is included in non-literary educational material.  Am I missing something important here? Is the school perfectly within their right?  ------------------------------------ TLDR: Printed and sold shirts reading ""Sex Is Okay' for a movement I've been working on. High School banned them. Is my freedom of expression being trodden upon?"	Yes
28	"I live in Oklahoma. Roughly a year ago, while still married, my sex life was in a rut in my marriage, and I went on The Pirate Bay, clicked on recent porn uploads, and downloaded about 15 of the most recent files. My wife found these files and went through them, she confronted me and told me she thought some of them were underage. They were mostly amateur porn, and while I didn't see anything that indicated under 18 (appeared to be in dorm-rooms, indicating college age), I deleted the files out of concern for violating the law and because my wife didn't want me to have them.    For roughly a year now, she has brought up the photos during conflicts (roughly half a dozen times). She apparently saved them to her computer right away, and has been using them to settle arguments by threatening to go to the police. In May I decided to leave the marriage, and these photos have come up several times since then to get me to back down from demands regarding material possessions and keep me from arguing.    It seems like blackmail, I don't have the best documentation though, just a few text messages (most was over the phone or in person)    6/10/17 ""I look forward to all of the underage porn of yours that I get to show in court""    5/24/17 ""I have...so much underage porn that came from your laptop!""    And then one talking about how we would discuss the porn in marriage counseling, can't quote it without butchering it to avoid sharing personal info.    I've avoided doing anything about this out of fear that I would get in trouble for potentially downloading illegal pornography. This evening she has been threatening to share it with my boss and with the police, and I'm not sure what to do. Do I contact the police? Do I lawyer up? Is this blackmail if there weren't recorded demands, only threats?"	No
29	Newbie here looking for advice on my current legal situation. I'm a lesbian mom with a 4 year old child from a previous relationship. My wife has been in the picture since my daughter was 10 months. Majority of time is spent with us, bio father lives two hours away and sees her about once a month. All medical, school, etc.. is handled by my wife and I. When we enrolled her in pre-k last year, they required birth certificate and wouldn't let me put my wife as other parent. She is only listed as emergency contact. We have been legally married for almost 2 years. Question is, how do I go out about making my wife her legal parent/ guardian, without stripping any rights from bio dad? I know it bothers her that she doesn't have the same legal rights as him even tho she is a provider.. note that she is listed as other parent on all medical forms, never had issue until school. Daughter had surgery at 2 years old.. she was able to be there and sign all forms with no issues. Frustrated, just want her have the legal rights she deserves. Please help and sorry for the ramble.. thanks!	No
30	So a guy almost hit me with his car while I crossed the street.  As he pulled around he yelled obscenities at me, I yelled obscenities back, and then he yelled that he was going to beat the shit out of me and started pulling his car over.  I told him to hold on while I wrote down his plates.  He drove off.  I called the cops.  2 questions: Firstly, I don't really care anymore and was seriously freaked out by the situation and in hindsight honestly don't really care to press charges.  How much is this going to cost me in time and money?  Secondly, I yelled obscenities back at him (but no threats).  Does that totally screw me over?  Thank you in advance, legal gods.	No
31	Hello,  My father recently found out about trips his spouse has taken with another man. He received travel documents. I am wondering how asset division would work in the case he filed for divorce under adultery in Alberta.  They have been married for about 10 years. Previously, my Father owned a house with about 150,000 in mortgage equity. He has since refinanced his mortage twice and has a little under 100,000 in the house. This money was primarily used to pay off debt associated with businesses his wife started. This included planning, construction, etc, of said establishments.   How would the business assets and house be distributed in such a divorce? The equity in the house is less than before the marriage, does that mean the wife is not entitled to the house, and must give up some business assets?  He wishes to part amicably, I'd just like to know how this would go if it got dirty.	No
32	In order to fully understand the level of confidence I have in the opinion that my daughter is being abused psychologically would take a very long time. I will give the highlights.  My ex and I got divorced due to deployment related stress in 2010 when my daughter was 2. She moved back and forth between TN and NE during my deployments and eventually, after the divorce, she settled back in NE because of better schools and better standard of living (Omaha vs Memphis).  During the time that she lived in NE, I was unable to see my daughter frequently both due to a refusal to cooperate from my ex and my continuing deployments.  I got out of the military and hoped it would be a good opportunity for me to make up with lost time, but I was met with the same lack of cooperation as before so I really only saw my daughter a couple times a year (always only at her mom's house).  I filed for a custody hearing, my ex never responded to the notification so we had the sheriff's office serve her. The day after we got our receipt of service, she moved to TN.  Since the proceedings, the lack of cooperation because a full force of loathing and spitefulness from her. Her dad wanted to fight me in front of my daughter and told me I wasn't allowed on his property. My ex has sworn at me and called me things like an asshole in front of my daughter. My ex's mom has said, in front of my daughter, that I abandoned her.  After many proceedings and a trial-style hearing on the record I was able to secure some visitation times including the school vacations. I was so excited to get her for the very first extended period since she was 2 years old, now she's 8. That excitement and blissfulness of being with my daughter is now accompanied with total anxiety.  My ex got our daughter a phone, she said that she's supposed to have to have the phone on her at all times both in TN and in NE, but I have a lot of evidence suggesting that she doesn't get her phone in TN (i.e. a complete wipe of my text messages and phone calls from her phone when she showed up here this summer).  Through conversation it is fairly obvious that my daughter has been coached about a lot of this stuff with the phone (i.e. how to always keep location on, to call her mom every morning and every night, and not letting me or my wife see the phone as well as password protecting it).  All things considered, it was really easy to get access to my 8 year old daughter's phone and the things that have been going on this summer are startling.  My ex has interrogated her nightly about her situation and what me and my wife do, more so than asking about what all she's been doing and if she's having fun or not.  She has consistently thrown shade on me over and over, though that is to be expected I guess. I am the type that tells the truth to my daughter unless it could negatively impact their relationship, I'm not about that bullshit shade-throwing.  She told my daughter only to speak to her when she can be away from me and my wife and is always asking if either one of us have had access to her phone.  In the last few weeks my daughter has really warmed up to being here and has put her phone on the back-burner most of the time. She's fucking 8 years old and she doesn't give a shit about the phone, she just worries that she's going to be in trouble if she doesn't keep it on her (she's told me so).  During those few weeks she has been unresponsive at times that she's having a sleepover or she left her phone at home. On nights that she doesn't respond, my ex is very harsh.  During a vacation to Texas my daughter left her phone in the car overnight. The next morning, my ex had sent her a text before she went to work saying that she was up all night crying and didn't get any sleep because she didn't hear from her.  Tonight, she threatened to call the cops because she wasn't responding and had her FBI ex-boyfriend blowing up her phone as well.  1) I have all of these things from her phone backed up, but I don't own the phone. The communications are taking place in my house and concern my child. Is that information admissible in an informal hearing setting... I know that if I were able to subpoena the records from the phone company that would be admissible during a trial, I just want to know if I'm going to be breaching any privacy laws by having the information (hence the throwaway).  2)I'm legitimately freaked out about what my daughter is going through, what the fuck can I do to stop it?  Thanks for the help.	No
33	A legal adult I know is growing two marijuana plants for their own personal use in the house they are staying at. This grower does not own the home, nor are they in any tenancy relationship with the owner. The owner of this home is allowing them to live there as they know this person is not capable of being out on their own from lack of independence and some mental issues. The owner of the home is aware of the plants and is not fond of them, but is naive to the possible ramifications of allowing this to continue. I visited the home and could smell the marijuana upon approaching the door. I talked to the owners and they are not happy with the smell and liability, but feel helpless in this case for many reasons. It really is a messed up situation and I want to make sure the grower and home owners are aware of the possible legal ramifications if they are caught because they haven't researched it or been informed. I feel they, at the very least, need to understand what they are risking by continuing this behavior. I know that growing marijuana is not legal in Ohio for any reason, but I am having difficulty pinning down the possible charges that could occur and their penalties, could someone give me an idea of what they are looking at here?	No
34	Now I will go into more detail. Two days ago I noticed a mini-tractor outside of my house, and a bunch of men with shovels and tools. I approached them and asked what they were doing. They claimed the pipe to the water main connected to their house busted, and needed to be replaced, and that they would need to dig up an area to install the pipe. I showed them my property line and asked them to go around it, which they said they would. They did not, they tore up existing concrete and left holes and patches of concrete/rocks every where.   I live in the front of an easement that has more houses in the back, I own the areas they dug in. Which from what they said and I understood, they could have gone around without damaging my property...  First of all, they started doing this without trying to contact me in any way. Which is the real reason I am pissed off. They are new Neighbors and I haven't had much contact. They are Renting the home I believe, and I don't have contact with the home owner.  What are my options... Do I call the police? Do I have to fix it myself..? It's so frustrating...	No
35	I received a speeding ticket today driving 57 in a 35. I received the ticketed driving from Kentucky to Knoxville Tennessee. I was pulled over in Oneida Tennessee where the speed limit dropped from 55 to 35. The sign can not be seen until crossing over a hill, which gives you roughly 50 yards to slow down. Naturally, I did not see the sign and was pulled over immediately. I know that this was obviously a speed trap, characteristic of small towns on states borders, but I am extremely about this. Do I have any means of getting the case thrown out, and if so, what approach should I take?  I am 22, work a low paying job in a town 3 hours away.	No
36	When looking for car insurance recently I decided to see if using slightly different descriptions of my profession impacted the quotes the companies gave me online. It did, but I noticed that after getting a few quotes my quotes increased, even when the information I provided remained constant. This lead me to suspect that the companies I was recieving quotes from are using information from the cookies on my browser to increase their quotes for insurance... Is this even legal? I am in the EU if that helps...	No
37	"I purchased my home in May of 2017.  The seller was a real estate agent who had flipped the home.  He marketed the home as a ""remodel"" and that it had a ""new bathroom"" referring to the basement bathroom at issue.  I had the home inspected, and while many things came up which were addressed and negotiated, the basement bathroom plumbing was missed on the inspection and never came up.  After closing in May, I moved in the first week of July.  I immediately noticed a smell coming from my basement bathroom.  I assumed it was a dry p-trap and that some water just needed to be ran.  I did so.  Multiple times.  Days go by, smell does not go away.  I finally unscrew the drain cover and find that my PVC shower flange leads to a gap and then into a cast iron p-trap designed for a floor drain, not a shower.  Long story short, the contractor (seller/owner's business partner) added this shower on top of an existing floor drain and installed a ""fake"" shower drain which emptied directly into the old floor drain.  The old floor drain is now emitting sewer gas from a dislodged or rotten cleaning plug which can only be repaired by tearing up the shower and much of the bathroom floor tile and completely replumbed.  I've had it inspected by a licensed plumber and quoted at around $5,000.  Here's the kicker:  I signed a waiver under MN Law 513.60 which waives the sellers duty to disclose.  It does not prevent, however, fraud or ""negligent misrepresentation"" pursuant to 513.57 S3.  Do I have any hope against this flipper?  I've already been in contact with him through my buyer's RE agent and he basically denies liability.  Another question:  The plumber I had inspect the issue made clear that the work could not have been permitted because it didn't come close to meeting code (lacked a vent and other obvious problems).  Is there a government remedy for unpermitted work?  Especially by a non-resident owner looking to sell the home?  Does that give me leverage of any sort?  Finally, on the off chance my inspector has error and omission insurance, do I have a claim against him?  I did not sign a pre-inspection contract, and I paid $550 for the inspection.  The plumber I had inspect the issue said the lack of code meeting was absolutely obvious from the unfinished part of the basement where the bathroom wall is open from the rear.  Vented sink, vented toilet, no vent for the shower, and that should have thrown up red flags to the inspector.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I realize I may be stuck paying for another ""remodel.""  Just trying to see if I have any options.  Thanks in advance.  Quick note:  I am a personal injury attorney in Tennessee.  I know enough about property law to have passed the TN bar, and I know enough MN law to fit in a thimble.  TL;DR - Flipper sold me a house with unpermitted plumbing work that is now causing a major problem in the basement bathroom.  I waived the seller's disclosure requirement (somehow and stupidly), and now I'm wondering if I have a claim against the seller or the inspector who negligently missed the ""obvious"" code violations from the shower."	No
38	One of our neighbors busted a water pipe and it ended up seeping into our master bedroom, bathroom, and closet. We noticed the wood laminate in the bathroom starting to warp and when we lifted it up, it smelled terrible and looked like mold had been growing underneath it. I talked the property owner and he said he will not higher an inspector. He has agreed to replace the carpet and laminate, but Im concerned with how long that mold has been sitting there. We have less than two months left on our lease and Im trying to weigh my options. I told him we would be open to leaving, but he wasnt going for that. I want someone in there yesterday to tell me whether or not we're breathing in something toxic and Im not opposed to hiring my own inspector.	No
39	I've lived in my apartment 2 years and am getting ready to move. Lease says to give 2 months notice before vacating. I only communicated via email and text to my landlord previously. Exactly 2 months before I texted him and his wife that I'm moving - no answer from them.   8 days later I follow up and he says to send him a certified letter stating this. I feel like he's scheming and will try to make up some BS fee to hold my security deposit because I didn't send a certified letter on time.   Do I have any protection because I texted them with 2 months?	No
40	"Without getting bogged down in details, we are one month into a yearlong lease and would like to break it. We (likely) have no legal justification in doing so. The lease agreement gives a term of 12 months and asks that 30 days' notice be given in case of departure, but otherwise does not specify penalty fees for early termination.   - My understanding of CA law is that the landlord has to make a good-faith effort to re-rent the property and we are liable for any rents that she would miss out on. This particular landlord lives several states away and has a streak of vindictiveness. What would be the intelligent way to minimize our liability here? If we, say, found a craigslist tenant with an equivalent credit score willing to occupy the place but she rejects, would this be enough to protect us in small claims?   It's a bit of a fishing expedition, but I'm basically wondering what our options are.   - What is the bar for ""uninhabitable living conditions"" that would justify legally breaking the lease? Over the last year and a half we have had consistent, documented mold in the bathroom that the landlord has refused to address. It's a structural issue (no ventilation), but she claims it's from neglect or use. It hasn't made us sick, but it's still mold and I'm wondering if this could be leveraged.   Any other tips for how to go about this would be great. If we just lose our security deposit over this I think we'd be fine with it, but it could escalate."	No
41	He has an attorney.  There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her.  Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	No
42	"I live in California. My boyfriend signed a lease with a new landlady on July 13th and moved in on July 15th. He's renting a bedroom from a three-bedroom house. The second bedroom is occupied by the landlady, and the third bedroom is occupied by another tenant who's been living there for four years.  Today is July 21st. This afternoon I was over at his place and no one was home, so we had sex in his room. Afterward, I went to clean up in his shower and he stayed in his room to tidy up. While I was in the shower, his landlady came upstairs saying she heard noises and asked what was going on. His door was already a bit ajar, because I didn't shut it all the way on my way to the bathroom (I thought no one was home). She pushed the door open to see my naked boyfriend and started freaking out, asking him who was in the shower (she could hear that it was on), telling him it was not okay for him to have a guest over, especially if the guests use the utilities, and stormed downstairs after yelling all of this loudly enough for me to hear over the running shower. I ran back into his room, scared and confused and dripping wet (not one of my finest moments). He was putting his clothes on as I came back in, and went downstairs right away. They talked downstairs for about ten minutes while I hid in his room, and when he came back upstairs he told me he had a to find a new place to live. Apparently, she told him he was not allowed to have guests over (1. He didn't see that on the contract when he signed it, but he's going to get a copy of it to make sure; 2. The other tenant brings one of her friends over frequently). She told him he has a week to find a new place to live, and then she's going to kick him out because ""she can't trust him anymore."" She also said she's not going to give his security deposit back. Is she allowed to kick him out for this? He's been living here for less than a week, and he paid for an entire month of rent. Obviously he doesn't want to live here anymore regardless of the outcome, but it would be preferable if he could stay through his first month or if she could give him his money back. I especially don't understand how it's legal for her to keep his security deposit. I don't know the exact language on the contract regarding eviction, but she has to let him stay at least until the end of the month, right? Thanks for reading, and any help is appreciated."	No
43	I'll try to stick to details and ask for specific advice, forgive me if this is a bit scattered. I am planning to leave my husband of 4 years due to overwhelming debt and lies regarding our finances. My credit has taken the bulk of the hit due to the fact that he had no credit cards and I signed the lease on our first apartment, I am about 60K in debt and have been trying to get documents together for bankruptcy. In doing so, I discovered lies and deception were more involved than I had thought and I need some advice on moving forward.  Filing bankruptcy in PA- I forget what the term is, but we are both liable for the debts accrued during the marriage in PA. Can I file for bankruptcy after the divorce is finalized? Would they come after me for his debts accrued during the marriage later? Child support, house- I'm not asking for abuse and name calling, just advice. He tells me he won't pay me child support or help me in any way and I will be homeless. How exactly do they decide what he pays and how? How can I support myself inbetween the filing and official divorce? Is a homeless shelter my best option? I really would like to stay with my kids in a home and not put them through that situation, and I'm worried of what it would look like to the courts if I took them out of a physically safe home to a shelter. -As another question, can he kick me out of the family home? His parents own the residence and we rent from them. He says I'm not on the lease and have no right to be here.  Do lawyers ever make payment agreements in these types of circumstances? I can't afford to even begin this process and I'm unsure where to start.  Can he use mental illness against me in the proceedings? I had PPD with my first child and had trouble bonding with her, but I have attended counseling and parenting classes since that time. He says I am unstable and he will get full custody if I leave.  I appreciate any advice and thank you for taking the time to read.	No

45	Hi everybody, I'm in need of some advice/guidance. I'm about to release an app, which is basically based on seeing people in your area (through an interactive map) and then being able to message them and ultimately meet up. Unfortunately, that can obviously lead to somebody getting hurt or robbed. My question is, would I be considered liable or get into any kind of trouble if that did happen (seeing as how they used my app)? And, if so, is there any way I can protect myself from that? Sorry if that sounds unethical or something  I'm in Houston, TX, btw	No
46	Hey guys I was in a motorbike crash on the 2nd July, I was going down the motorway in the fast lane and it turned into a merge lane so I merged. About 10 seconds later all I see is brake lights come on so I tried to brake aswell, couldn't slow down fast enough so i had to swerve to the right and clipped the rear right side of the car in front, now comes to my problem. I have decided not to claim and just wanted to fix my bike up myself without getting insurance involved but I have just had a claim made against me by the other party involved. My insurance ran out on the 12th so I wanted to know if I would still be covered and how to handle the claim against me. Any advice would be helpful .	No

48	Hi there,  Few days ago, I received a letter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stating in that I had used the toll road twice in locations in Massachusetts in which that wasn't me. The requested payment was $2.60. Even though the amount was very little, I do not want to pay for the amount for something I didn't do.   So, I started googling on what I should do because I was afraid this was some sort of scam. I started reading articles about a lady who didn't know she was being charged and ended up owing $49,000 as a result. I started worrying about what I should do to resolve this matter so it doesn't come back to me again.  I apologize if this is not the right post for this subreddit. Could you please guide me to the correct one if that's the case? Thank you for taking your time to read my post. :)	No
49	The police emergency detained me because they believed I was suicidal. I was in my car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazards on as I was crying and couldn't drive with blurred vision. They took it upon themselves to assume I was suicidal even though I made no indication of it, have no history of mental illness or even a police record.  I was forced into the back of a police cruiser, taken to the ER against my will, and they tried to charge me $2400. I negotiated it down to ~$650 and left. The doctor cleared me after talking to me for 5 minutes because he knew I should not have been detained for anything. I did not even have to see a psychiatrist as the police earlier said.  I'm not sure if there is anything I can do, but I was hoping to find some advice.     TLDR: Police detained me wrongfully, forced me to go to ER, and I am stuck with the bill now.	No
50	"I'll start with the brief background.  My mom has been an alcoholic for just under a decade, and she dragged my dad into it for a while too. My sisters and I were emotionally abused and berated for the last 5 years or so. I was getting the most of it and would instigate to prevent it from getting to my sisters, but I was at University this last year and it got to them.  Finally, my mom got into rehab. Instead of getting better, she cheated on my dad with an alcoholic 25 years older than her in rehab and abandoned us for him after getting out. She's refusing to help with any bills, even though my dad can't cancel her off the phone plan without paying a $600+ fee. She won't help with any of my sisters' activities costs or my schooling.  I'm 19 now. I built my car up from scratch with my dad, and it was given to me for my birthday at 16. Stayed in parents' names for insurance purposes. I've got a job now and am paying my own things because my dad can't afford it all on his own, but my mom is refusing to sign anything over. She won't sign off on the title of my car to me, or even my sisters car to her. She changed our legal address on our accounts so all of our bills, which she isn't helping with at all, go to wherever she is and we can't access them.   She's literally holding everything in our life ransom because she got sober for a hot minute and ""fell in love"" with this guy and has gone completely loony on us. (Yet she keeps texting us kids how much she loves us.) As a result of this, in addition to paying my own things as I mentioned above, I'm having to send my dad hundreds of my earned money (which I desperately need because Michigan raised public university tuition prices almost 3% again this year) because he can't afford everything on his own.  She apparently wants to do an ""easier"" (I know it's never really easy) divorce that doesn't require court or anything, just filling out the documents and seeing a judge or something, I don't completely understand how it works. My dad is trying to fill out the divorce documents, but it's hard. He's been struggling massively with depression since all of this started happening. (To make it worse, my internship is 10 hours away in Minnesota, so I can't be physically there to help.)  I guess the question/advice I'm seeking, is what are our legal rights against my mom as the remainder of our family (Me, dad, sister 16, sister 14), and what are my legal rights against my mom in terms of my car, when I have my dad's backing? (The plates and everything expire this month and I don't know what to do.)  Title has MI in it, but for clarification, we live in Southwest Michigan. Even though I'm in Minnesota for the whole summer my legal address is still our home there.  Thanks everyone. I'm sorry if this was a bit too long; I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, never thought I would need to use it for something like this, though."	No
51	Three years ago I 'moved out' of my house. By this, I mean that my physical body and about five outfits and my cat moved out. All of my things are still there, and my mail has always gone there. The situation im in right now isn't optimal, and I'd like to live in the house I bought. It's in my name only, and the people who live there are under no formal lease. The bills are in my name. If I move in, do I have to go through any procedure? Do I have to give them more than just a polite heads up?	No
52	"I recently applied for a position in a VT branch of a major insurance provider. During my application, I had to agreement to private arbitration for any legal disputes before, during, and after any potential employment.   In addition to signing away any right to pursue a class action, disputes covered by the arbitration clause include things like sexual harassment, unpaid wages, discrimination against protected classes, overtime, and other issues clearly covered by both Vermont and federal labor law.  This is unlikely to ever be relevant for me, but I just want to understand, because this seems a little nuts to me. Basically, if this employer were to, say, refuse to pay me for wages I had earned, and I couldn't work it out through negotiation on my own, we would then go to a ""neutral"" third party selected by the employer. This neutral third party, while technically supposed to make a judgement based on actual law, could really do anything. They could just say, ""lol, you ain't gettin' paid"", and then I would get no money. I would not be able to appeal this decision... Is this correct?? I guess I don't understand the point of labor laws existing at all if employers can just have people, for practical purposes, sign away their rights. This can't be how it works, right?"	No
53	Hi I cross posted this with /advice I hope I'm doing this right because I've never really posted on Reddit...also sorry for formatting I'm on mobile and also incredibly stressed out.   So basically there were issues with our carpets when we moved out of our apartment. There was a bleach stain in the hallway caused by my roommate that we all witnessed her make (myself and other two housemates). She said before we moved out that she knew she would have to take responsibility for it. Turns out when it came time she tried to lie her way out of it by blaming me (because she hates me, she told the others girls exactly that). In the end she ended up taking responsibility.  We thought we moved on but fast forward to this week. My landlord send my security deposit to the girl I subletted from and I haven't been able to contact that girl to get my security deposit back (that's a whole thing in and of itself). The landlord said the carpet cleaning for the living room went well except one or two small stains that wouldn't come out but it wasn't a big deal. We all made stains on that carpet that we tried to clean. I personally had two tiny coffee stains because my dog stole an empty k-cup when I first moved in. However I spent a long time trying to get it out and it was almost unnoticeable by the time I moved out. Unlike tar my roommate has tracked into the living room after the beach one day.   Anyway today the landlord tells me that my roommate is upset about the living room floor and decided she wants it to be replaced which would cost all 4 of us $1000-1500. She also sent my housemate a picture of said stains and guess what, they're HUGE. They look FRESH. They were not there before. But now the others have turned on me saying now it's my turn to take responsibility. I feel like my roommate is being vindictive and wants revenge.   I'm also concerned on whether my landlord is allowed to try and charge us after the fact she already send my deposit with my itemized list of damages/deductions and it's been 21 days (this is the max limited allotted under CA law to send a security deposit back with deductions).   I am so stressed and confused and really need any help I can get, especially in terms of my legal rights. Thank you.   P.S. I am a sub letter so I know that technically any charges would actually go toward the master tenant but I am so confused on the legality of all this as we never filed paperwork with the landlord regarding my sublet (I filled it out but the master tenant never signed or sent it in)	No
54	"I live in a townhouse, rented from a private property owner acting as my landlord. Apparently, somewhere in the depths of the HOA paperwork provided to obtain a parking decal, is a statement that they are allowed to have a private towing company tow my vehicle if the tags are expired.   They expired last month, July. I was confused because I'm new to the state and was used to it being 1 year from date of taxes paid, but apparently in Florida they expire on your birthday. I never noticed the label. Life was in a bit of a flurry when I moved. Didn't receive a letter in the mail... which doesn't surprise me since my Florida title never made it to me either, another thing on my ""to do"" list. Yes the address on my license and on file at the DMV is accurate.  Contacted the DMV, and it's still 2 days before I'm considered ""late"" on the taxes. The tow company isn't even asking for proof that I've paid, they just want their $130 ransom so that I can get my vehicle back. Maybe in hopes that I'll be stupid enough to park it again without updating the plate so they can tow it again.  In a small twist, I forgot to turn in the signed copy of their parking rules, but they provided the sticker to me anyway and never noticed it was missing. It might give some leverage but I imagine life might get complicated if I go after them. Not sure if it's even worth it, other than for the principal.  Do I have any recourse here, or should I just pony up their extortion and accept that my HOA is run by sociopaths? ... Yes, I know, I'm being a bit loose with terms here, I'm a bit peeved.  Thanks in advance for any advice, friends."	No
55	"Hello, looking for some advice about the probate process for a small estate in the state of Arkansas. I've read up on what to do but I am still confused. Trying to understand if I need to go through probate court, or if this can just be solved through Arkansas's small estate process. I feel like this should be straightforward, so hopefully someone has some answers or recommendations.   My mother passed away last month. My father passed away 11 years ago, and I only have one (younger) brother.  I am named in her will as the executor of the will. My brother and I are listed in the will as beneficiaries, splitting any assets 50/50.   Her assets that are part of the estate are as follows: Checking account &amp; savings account, together totalling about $3K 11 year old van which she didn't owe money on, worth $1K at most  Assets that have my brother and I named as beneficiaries (so they shouldn't count towards in the probate process, right?): Life insurance policy for about $40K IRA account, about $30K 401K account, about $7K Another savings account, has about $200  Debts: Student loans, at least $20K Chase credit card, about $2K Not aware of others but will be running a credit report soon to confirm  From what I've read, her estate qualifies as a small estate in Arkansas, since it's worth less than $100K. So it should bypass probate court, and I simply need to file an affidavit of small estate. However, on the form for the affidavit of small estate, one of the stipulations for filing as a small estate is ""There are no unpaid claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate."" This is where I am confused. Chase wants to make a claim against the estate. If they make a claim, her assets are enough to cover the amount of their claim...so I assume I would need to pay them from the estate. However, I can't get the funds from her bank account to pay the claim without filing this affidavit. So how the heck am I supposed to pay them? Do I have to go through the probate court simply because there is a claim against her estate? I don't believe I should pay it out of my own pocket, it's not my debt. So it should come out of the estate. I'm just so confused about what to do next."	No
