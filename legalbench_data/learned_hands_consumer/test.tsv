0	Hi all, first time posting here. I ordered a dress at an Alfred Angelo store a couple of weeks ago, which went bankrupt and the location I went to closed its doors yesterday with no warning. I ordered it with my debit card. Legally, can I get my money back? Will my bank refund it back to me? Let me know if other details are needed about the store etc and I'll try to find them. Thanks in advance!	Yes
1	"Hello. I have never used reddit before so I'm sorry if I do anything wrong or I am in the wrong place, just let me know.    I am a current customer of Sprint. I set up my account with them on May 14,2017. This would make my billing due date the 14th of each month. I enrolled in the auto-pay to receive a discount on my bill as well, and was told that my bill would be $175.81 a month.   However, I noticed that this date would not work for me, it didn't coincidence with my pay dates from my employer. So I called to see about having my billing due date changed to make sure that each month I would have the funds in my checking account to accommodate the bill, at which point the person I talked to said ""Sure no problem"", never having mention that by doing this it would cause me to be doubled billed the next month.     When I looked at my account and found out about being double billed, I called to inquire about the double charges and was told that was policy whenever you request a change in the billing due date. They credited my account $20.00 for my inconvenience, whatever. I was pissed but ok, I accepted that.   Today, on July 15th, I received a text message from Sprint saying that they tried two times to retrieve my payment!  What the Hell! Its only the 15th why are they attempting to take the payment now? I didn't have the $231.36 in my account, so I called to tell them that each time they try to collect the payment (that isn't even due for four more days), they caused my account to be charged $25.00 in NSF fees, making it a total of $50.00 worth of NSF fees (so far).   I called to have them explain to me why they have done this and to request that they put back the $50.00, because my account is now overdrawn, only to be transferred to 10 different people, and was treated like I was dumb and told that there isn't anything they can do to help me. Two different people said that they would stay on top of this, that it would be back into my account by the end of the day today was told to hang on while they put in the final notes to assure me that it would be resolved, only to be transferred to another person who doesn't know what is going on. At this point I just want my money back, but all I got was ""Take a deep breath"" and ""calm down"" and ""we can not assist you"". What am I supposed to do now? I have bills that come out tomorrow and no money to pay them.   Were they even allowed to charge me before my bill was due?? Is there anything at all that I can do?"	Yes
2	[CT] Hello, My mom had a bill from her dentist which was sent to collections. The dentist told her she would have to pay both the bill and the collections fee. So my mom pay the fee through the collections, but has not received a bill for the fee the dentist hired for collections. Will she receive a notice about this or is everything set? She no longer goes to this dentist.	Yes
3	"On June 20, I sold an item for $350 on the online marketplace Grailed. I shipped the item on June 21 and the buyer in New York state received it on June 23. Now, the buyer has submitted a claim that it was an ""unauthorized transaction"". I have already submitted proof of shipping and delivery. Paypal claim aside, what are the legal grounds for this? If the transaction is indeed verified as unauthorized, am I just losing the item I sold?"	Yes
4	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	Yes
5	Hello everyone I'm in a bit of a bind. I called a doctor's office to set up an appointment in January. I made an appointment and they told me I needed a referral. I told them to cancel the appointment and call me when they received the referral. This was all in the same phone conversation.  Here it is 6 months later and after sending two referrals, they never called. I received this bill last week for $50 for a no show appointment. I cancelled that appointment and even if it was still an active appointment there was no reminder call/text/email which I opted for.  So, I call the office and get an answering service. She directs my call to the office manager who does not answer. Her answering machine clearly stated that of the call was for a no show bill to submit in writing. So these people send out these bills so often that she needed to put that on her message. I left her a message stating who I was, why I was calling, and asked for the address to send this letter to. No call back. I've called several more times and still nothing.  I've really had it with this office. I looked at their review on Google and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue. They have horrible reviews and some very similar to my experience.  So, what is your advice?   Thank you so much!	Yes
6	Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	Yes
7	Morning!  I know this would be more appropriate under a financial subreddit, but I'm worried there will be some legal implications so I thought to ask here first.  Last night I went to check my credit score for the first time (19, only have a joint student loan w/ my dad and a credit card in my name, which I got 6 months ago) so I went to CreditKarma.  Perfectly fine score, but it appeared there were two loans under my name.  One was a joint student loan from Sallie Mae, which I knew about and receive emails from etc.  The other was a student loan taken out individually before my 18th birthday.  My dad has never used this bank (Cornerstone) and never took out a loan in the amount listed.  After some research, it appears that loans can't be given to minors individually in the US anyway, so I'm not even entirely sure how a bank allowed this to happen.  I also know I never received a check for thousands of dollars I apparently took out.  I know I need to call someone and let them know what's going on.  Who is it exactly that I call?  I assume not CreditKarma- maybe the bank?  Or do I need to find a lawyer and contact the police for some stolen identity case?  Sorry for all the questions, this is my first financial issue as an adult and I want to make sure I handle it properly.  Thank you in advance!	Yes
8	-In buying a duplex, original agreement was to have tenant on one side out by June 16th. It was a month to month agreement so it was possible.  -Seller asked for extension to July 31st, granted by buyer. Meanwhile, buyer has been paying for appraisal, attorney, etc.  -If July 31st rolls around and they don't have that tenant out, buyer may want to walk, however, the closing costs remain. Can the buyer sue for those costs paid up to that point because seller is not able to comply with contract?	Yes

10	On last months wireless bill AT&amp;T did not include the amount for my installment plan, and it wasn't even mentioned on the bill. One this months bill, which I'm calling this months bill because the amount due for the billing period is due this month, they included both last months and this months installment payment. The amount per installment is $61.50. Times two, $122 on this months bill.  Now, these also are the final two payments of the the installment agreement. The device is payed off after this periods bill is payed.  I contacted AT&amp;T via chat, phone, and visiting a retail store(who politely informed me everything is done over phone and they don't know why I was sent there), and I asked them if I could have one of the two installments moved to next month.  They refused, and insisted that I pay the entire bill amount. I said I was open to other arrangements to lower this months bill and pay the rest later, and reminded them that it was AT&amp;T who made the mistake by not including it in my bill the previous month. One of the 7 or 8 people I spoke with said that it was a known issue that happened to several of their customers last month, and was resolved.  I don't think I should have to pay the $61.50 that AT&amp;T neglected to include in my bill and then added the next month without notice. However I am willing to pay it if they spread the 2 payments over 2 months as they should be. I did not ask AT&amp;T to forgive the installment, but I did tell them many times that I was willing to do it over two months, inline with what I originally agreed when I bought the device.  First, what organization(s) should I report AT&amp;T to, and how should I do it?  Second, how can I best get out of paying the $61.50 they did not charge me one month? What legal grounds do I have there?  Thank you for your help. I realize the dollar amount here is not that much, but AT&amp;T's absolute refusal to work with me on payment options makes me want to pursue legal options.	Yes
11	We arranged a payment play with David's Bridal owing ~$850 payments were supposed to come out of our account @ $50 /mo until October of this year and we would be done with the debt. This month we received a letter stating that our account was transferred to a collection agency and that we now owe $967 and they are demanding full payment. When we made the original payment arrangement we were trying to call to pay the balance in full but were talked into this arrangement which sounded good to us at the time because I had just been let go from a job we were just trying to get rid of the high monthly payment, but it sounded like a good plan to have the lower payment option and still only own the lesser amount.  Today is when I saw the letter and called David's Bridal and the lady said they couldn't really tell me much since they transferred the account to Midland credit. I called Midland after getting off the phone with David's Bridal and they said they are demanding payment in full of $967 and gave no reason why our account was transferred or further details.   Can they really do this? What can we do? I will fight not to pay more than we agreed to since we set our payment option.	Yes
12	I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52).  They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month.  Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month.  On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym).   I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months.  The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and  says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer.  Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes.   I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!	Yes
13	Hello, I'm an out-of-state student attending a UC campus. My father makes upwards of 500k annually as an entrepreneur and lobbyist, while I work a minimum wage retail job over summers. Naturally, I did not qualify for any need-based aid, so we had to take out a Parent Direct PLUS loan each year to cover the majority of expenses. I was under the impression that, since my father makes so much money, that he'd pay off all these loans, even moreso because the loans are entirely in his name and the FAFSA website says that the debt of these loans cannot be traditionally transferred to the child.  I just recently learned that he has been telling everyone, except me, that he was only going to provide 15k annually while I would pay off the loans myself. All my family believe his side of the story because that is all they were told. Is it possible that he could sue to somehow transfer the debt? Does him telling everyone that I'm paying for it help such a case? In general, what should I do here?	Yes
14	In the fall of 2015 I found myself in a situation where I needed to get a new car. The car that I had been driving needed so much work done to it, that for me it wasn’t worth fixing. At the time I was also taking care of medical bills that had piled up while I was out of work the previous year, and my credit wasn’t in the place it is now, so I couldn’t get approved for a loan myself. My girlfriend at the time offered to take a car loan out in her name that I would make the payments on. At the time there was no signed agreement between her and I made regarding me making the payments, and my name wasn’t on the car loan whatsoever. I was only an insured driver on her policy, something she did to make her own insurance less expensive, while also making it easier on me. I drove the car and made the payments on time every month for a year, until September of 2016.   Long story short, she was unhappy in the relationship and suggested I move out, which lead to us ultimately breaking up very shortly after I moved out. Of course, this resulted in me returning the car to her. She decided to sell the car at a loss very quickly so she didn’t have to deal with it, while making me feel as though I had to reimburse her for the money she lost on the sale. She drafted up an agreement at the time, saying the amount that I owed her, with a payment plan. Having been completely blindsided by her request to me move out, I wasn’t in a clear headspace and very depressed. I was out of the apartment that I had lived in for two years, she kept both of our cats that we had (one of which was MY LIFE), and I had no car.   For reasons I can’t explain now, I felt obligated to agree to and sign her agreement. I have begrudgingly sent her a check for $200 every month for the past 14 months, all the while thinking the agreement that we have is unfair. I’ve done some research on signed agreements, and feel as though hers has holes in it, but am not sure. The agreement doesn’t detail what the money is for. The agreement provides an address that I am to send the payment to, but that has changed since the agreement began. (One of the bullet points on the agreement state “Any modifications to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.”) I don’t feel like I’m legally obligated to pay her back for a car she sold that didn’t have my name anywhere on it, especially since there was no signed agreement in the beginning, when I originally got the car.    I have a copy of the agreement, and can retype (changing names) and send as a PM.	Yes
15	Hail damage earlier this year to my home and numerous others in my neighborhood. Company was doing estimate on my neighbor so wife and I let him inspect ours. I, unfortunately, signed a contract with him that says if the insurance company approves the claim, I am to hand the check to this roofer and they will do the work. No money out of my pocket.   Problem 1 - I signed the contract but the insurance check is in my wifes name and the house is in both of our names.   Problem 2 - contract is so vague with zero pricing. Everything is TBD with no description of the roofing system other than asphalt 3-tab shingles TBD and GAF.  Problem 3 - My deductible was nearly $7,000 which left me with only $5000 to do a $10,000 roof replacement - minus provided funds to fix some gutters, vents, and facia boards.   Problem 4 - When I did try to reach this guy for additional information, he is very elusive and provides very little information other than threatening me with a lawsuit if I cancel this contract and is trying to extort a cancellation fee of $1,000 or if he goes to his lawyer, he's going to sue me for 25% of the total cost my insurance company paid me for replacement. Ugh. And I've not done any work to the roof because I am poor with over $1M, yes, $1 MILLION DOLARS in medical debt. I requested quotes from 5 other vendors doing roofs in my neighborhood and this guy was last in price, professionalism, and just overall ability to make me feel like this $10,00 investment would be a sound installation I could live with.  I can go on and on about this guys professionalism and lack of customer experience but I'll be damned if I'm letting this company put a roof on my house at this point. It's only asking for trouble as I've had a previous home with roof issues after a replacement.   Anything I can do?	Yes
16	I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	Yes
17	Dear r/legaladvice,  I recently was driving long distance when my tire blew out on the highway.  I put in the spare and drove to the nearest rural town but everything was closed since I got there on a Sunday.  I stayed overnight and in the morning went to one of the local tire shops.  They said my tires were old and all needed to be replaced (which turned out to be true), but that they only had two tires that were the right size.  So I got the two front tires replaced on my car and drove to the next nearest town to another tire shop that replaced the other two.  After my long long road trip I finally made it to my destination.  The next day one of the new front tires was flat.  I had to put the spare on again and drive it to Pepboys, and the folks there said the two front tires were the wrong size and poorly installed, and that the damage to the flat one was irreparable since it was probably poorly installed.  So basically I had to replace two brand new tires to get the correct size.  I will never go back to the rural town hundreds of miles away so I can't return the poorly sized and improperly installed tires, so I left them at Pepboys.  Anyway this has all been extremely frustrating and costly and I am totally unsure what to do.  Should I call the rural tire shop that screwed up and yell at them and demand a refund, even though I have no way of returning the tires they put on car?  Should I call my credit card company and dispute the charge from them?	Yes
18	The second woman that hit me made it clear she would rather pay out of pocket than have a claim on her insurance.  I realize it may not be the most ethical thing to do, but would I be breaking any laws to accept a cash payment from her, and make a claim with the other rear-enders insurance?  I realize it's a bit shady, I just need to be clear on whether or not I would be breaking any laws.	Yes
19	I inherited an apartment from my grandfather in Hong Kong, and I receive $5000hkd from it monthly. I give this entire amount to my mother who lives in China. Do I have to pay taxes on this amount?	Yes
20	"I listed an item for sale on the app LetGo for $300. I received a full price offer and provided my PO Box for payment. Since then I've had several red flags.   * The buyer asked for my phone number for the check, and since we've been communicating via text. The buyer has used two different phone numbers.  * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment.   * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.  * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.  * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.  * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.  Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.  Aside from not cashing the check what is my legal obligation at this point?  I've googled the credit union in GA and am considering calling them tomorrow to alert them.  In addition should I take the check to the police? Right now all i have is the check, the LetGo user information, and the two phone numbers the scammer used."	Yes
21	"So pretty much I've been soliciting spells and rituals on apps like whisper. I have them pay me over paypal, and send them instructions for the ritual. I never promise health benefits or weight loss. I've sold two so far. A love spell and ""spiritual cleansing"". Both at 20 a spell. Can I be sued for selling a phony spell?  Is there anything I can add like a disclaimer or something to prevent someone from trying to sue me?"	Yes
22	"Hey /r/LA!  About 7 years ago I was the victim of severe identity theft by my mother. The damages included deposits on apartments/houses, various utilities, cell phones, and forged checkbooks. Over the past few years, I have managed to get everything removed except for two instances of legal judgements in which I was named.   One of because my checkbook was used to pay for a rental deposit, and the other was for an electric bill opened in my name.   Everywhere I look, I'm told to get a lawyer. My fiance and I are looking into buying a home and I want to go in with clean credit instead of waiting for this to get removed.   So, my question is this: how can I get this removed myself? If it will be much easier with a lawyer, what kind of lawyer should I be looking for? I have tried searching for ""identity theft"" specialized lawyers, but it takes me no where. I know it sounds dumb, but I don't know what area of law this falls under.   Any help/advice is much appreciated!!"	Yes
23	Who is responsible for paying for a lost title if it was lost in the mail? My brother in-law feels stuck because his registration is now expired due to the delay of the title (We're talking over 4 months since he bought the car). Dealer says it's not his fault it was lost in the mail, so BIL has to pay it.    My thought is that if mail is important you go ahead and pay for tracking etc. So yes, in my mind, it is the dealer's fault BIL doesn't have a title yet. Plus, when BIL bought the car outright, he bought the title. It wasn't part of the deal to  have to pay a lost-in-mail fee. Am I right?  BIL is driving there tomorrow morning to pay the fee, so any advice tonight would be useful. I was hoping the law might be on our side in this situation, but it might not be that simple.	Yes
24	I attended their PhD visiting week for which they said they would pay me back travel expenses up to a certain amount ($500), and they would pay for the hotel.  I get to the hotel, and I have to put my card on file.  After visiting week, I call and find out that the hotel charged me for one night (~150$). I email NYU's department and they said it was a mistake and they would pay me back for that.  This was in March. I've been in a back and forth up until a week ago (early July) trying to get my payment done. They claimed they had problems with the vendor system. I am owed ~435$ for travel (within $500 limit) + ~150$ for that night in the hotel room they didnt cover. They only paid me 500$.  They no longer answer their emails about the remaining $85 and have been pretty slow at answering email about the last $500 since March.  Is there any way I can get my $85 back?	Yes
25	"I signed up for a subscription service where you get online courses for a fix monthly price. On the sales page, the website owner states that subscribers will only be charged X, and that he is ""not able to charge more, and will only charge X""  It turned out that the price of the monthly subscription is X + VAT, and he only mentioned the monthly price without the VAT included, which is upsetting because this is in a country with the highest VAT rate in the world.  Now, on the checkout the price with VAT included was shown, but I didn't give it any thought because the seller said he will only charge X, and is not able to charge any more than X. X=price of subscription without VAT  Does this count as misleading people? Do I have a chance to make a chargeback through my bank? Purchased it on june 15th."	Yes
26	"I paid off one of my credit cards completely and then tried to charge about $7 on it at a hardware store and it declined. Concerned, I checked my recent transactions and discovered 3 charges that were around $50 made to Uber. The charges were not made on my Uber account, but by someone that Uber support identified as ""Josh"". They refuse to tell me where the charges were made. Do I have the right to know this because it was my credit card? The last place I used it was at a local craft store and there is a guy there who goes by that name. I'm not trying to get revenge or anything, I just want to know if I should stop shopping at that store or if it was an unrelated incident."	Yes
27	I'm a college student in Florida and hit a parked car in my neighborhood while I myself was parking. I've only been driving for around a year now but have always been a safe driver. I immediately parked, went up close to asses the damage and then left a note on the dented backseat passenger door telling the driver to call me. So later in the day she texts me and is very understanding and even asks if I rather not get insurance involved. We both call our parents and I'm ready to go get a quote on the damage but she doesn't text me for 2 and half months so I'm thinking she's forgotten about the whole thing or gotten it fixed herself or something.  Now she's texted me back asking if we can get her car fixed by the weekend. Just looking at the price estimates for fixing dented doors + chipped paint looks like it'll be at least a grand, I really only have a 300$ limit right now so i'm kind of screwed. What would be the consequences if we got insurance involved? (It's my dad's insurance as the car is still under my father's ownership)  Thanks in advanced for helping the nervous college kid out	Yes
28	relevant to australian law.  Long, exhausting series of events kept as short as possible.  My car was incorrectly repossessed. During the repossession the car was damaged (as per the marks in the road), I was belittled and insulted by the repo agent as well as the tow truck operator.  I was provided no documentation and no identification.  Upon calling the leasing company, they've said it was incorrectly repossessed. I've requested documentation regarding how and why this happened and they send me an email saying the vehicle can be picked up. 3 hours away in a different state.  I've called them again today and asked for a follow up - they've acknowledged they've received my email and I asked him to get me a response by the end of the day as it's now been a week i've been without transport.  He said hes not going to guarantee something he cant follow through on, as he's busy with other work.  I also asked for an update on the time taken to get the car back to me, they said i have to keep waiting or organise a truck myself.  So i call the company thats currently holding the vehicle, and they tell me they will call me back.   In between all of this, i've been in touch with varying states of legal aid, and compensation aid and i've had no help - i get told to call someone else, who tells me to call someone else, who loops me back to the first person.  I'm frustrated, defeated and still carless.   This has made a terrible impression at my new workplace and I'm fear of losing my job if im unable to keep asking friends and family for help getting to and from work.   I'm backed into a corner and dont know what to do next.   someone please help me.	Yes
29	Brought a perfectly fine Mazda CX-9 to Pep Boys for new tires. Now it constantly stalls out and they say it's because of a cracked intake manifold. I've called my insurance company and filed a claim, but does anyone else have any ideas how to best handle this situation?	Yes
30	"Asking for a good friend.  Had some custom work done to his truck: application of a ""ceramic nano coat"" to protect it while off-roading.  Was supposed to be the whole truck.    After a pretty intense weekend wheeling thru brush and what not, friend came back and washed truck and found the ceramic coating was only applied to hood, bumper, and sides up to wheel well.  Sides and bed of truck didn't get the treatment and are scratched to hell.  Cost of treatment was originally ~$6k.  Normally I know one should sue in small claims if the business fails to make it right.  However, while my friend was out wheeling the guy sold the business and permanently moved overseas.  Apparently he screwed a lot of people in the process, not just my friend, with incomplete or shoddy work on some pretty high-end vehicles.  Up until this the guy had a stellar reputation.  The new business bought the lease, name, and assets, but does that mean they also bought the past accounts, responsibility for the work done by previous owner, etc?    The new shop owner is upset at the previous owner but isn't cutting my friend any sort of deal on making him whole - is charging him to fix the paint and cost of the ceramic coating again.      On the one hand, my friend scratched the hell out his own truck by hitting the brush, but on the other hand he thought he had a complete ceramic coating.  Where the coating was installed it performed as expected - no damage.    Cost to repair the paint and finish applying the ceramic coat will be under $10k, the max small claims here in California, but from whom should my friend try and recoup?  Realistically, what are my friend's options here?"	Yes
31	Hi. I am from Northern New Jersey. I am in need of some advice and was wondering if the helpful people of this subreddit can provide some. Throwaway being used for anonymity. A couple of days ago, I received a check from the Federal Trade Commission because they settled with DeVry in a 100 million dollar settlement. After doing hours of research and spending hours on the phone with government student loan help lines I am lost. I want to know a few things. Does cashing this check stop me from filing a lawsuit against DeVry? Also, I still owe around $60,000 in Student Loans, with this settlement anyone with Private Student loans are being refunded but people like me who took out Federal Student Loans are left to seek out other means of refund. One suggestion from the FTC was filing for the  Department of Education's Borrower Defense to Repayment program. Should I do this before seeing an attorney? I am afraid that if Betsy DeVos gets her way she will get rid of this program before it can help me out. Any advice? Please and thank you.	Yes
32	"We had several improvements done to our front yard about one year ago (new walkway, new sprinkler system, planting, etc).  The general contractor we hired subcontracted out the concrete work.  After all the work was completed, we paid the contractor the final installment (50% was due before the job started, 50% due after).  Total job was ~$8,500.  Now, a year later, the subcontractor drives by my house on a Saturday and lets me know he hasn't been paid.  This is certainly news to me!  He has been stiffed by the general contractor and says he will try to come after me.  He then showed me the invoice for concrete work that was supposedly unpaid by the contractor (nearly $2000). He said he sent me a notice in the mail ""a month ago"" that he was going to file a mechanics lien and wanted to know if I got that notice.  I never received that notice.  At this point, my Saturday morning chores are pretty much the last thing on my mind and I am very concerned.  After 20 minutes of reading articles (from a google search), it seems like contractors and subcontractors have 90 days to file a mechanics lien.  It also says that they must file a notice to the property owner before filing the mechanics lien.  What do I do?  I have no evidence that the contractor didn't pay the subcontractor.  The contractor could very well have paid the subcontractor and I would never know!  Seems fishy, it almost seems like the subcontractor is trying to collect twice.  Since we are way beyond 90 days here, is this even something I should worry about?  What happens if I never got the notice he said he sent and he still filed a lien somehow?  Thanks in advance for your help.  I really appreciate it!"	Yes
33	"Bought a used car in Harris county, Houston, Texas, from a small car dealer at his residence.  Before purchasing the car, I did have a call out mechanic inspect the vehicle. After I had thoroughly inspected and driven the car.  Hours after purchasing the car, the IMA (Honda Civic Hybrid battery) and the catalytic converter are showing errors.  We have already paid $3,700 for the car cash in hand and owe him $400 for the cost of registration which was in the paperwork we signed. Also stating we would not sue and buying the vehicle in ""As is"" condition.  The seller states he can transfer the vehicle registration and that he does not need the vehicle for the vehicle inspection report.  I need a car as there is little public transport. What options do I have either for the mechanic or the seller to fix the problems with the car? Or is it possible to get my money back?"	Yes
34	My husband and I are a young couple barely starting to build a life. We bought a trailer home for $500 with the idea of repairing it slowly since it's a bit run down.   We needed somewhere to put it so we got a property which was $1000 of downpayment and would be $250 every month.   We paid someone close to $2000 to move the trailer home into the property. He did and its been there for about 2 weeks now.   Today my husband got a call from the lady who sold him the property saying that she wants to break contract and move our home elsewhere into another one of her available properties all because the man who lives right next to our property is complaining that our home is too ugly to be next to his or in his immediate vicinity. The lady is siding with him because this man turns out to be the city commissioner.   The other available properties are not the same as the one we have now. They are by a creek and they pretty much get flooded every time it rains. The lady did offer to pay for someone to move our home again and use the first downpayment for whichever other property we get so we wouldn't have to pay twice but we don't want to settle for less just because this man feels superior to us but we don't know what to do.   Please help us. Your advice will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
35	I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back. Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this. After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time. By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything. I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts. Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?	Yes
36	"I've been eating at a particular Carl's Jr restaurant. I am always greeted in the drive-thru with an immediate promotion, which I have to decline politely, before I get a chance to speak and order what I actually want. After my order is taken, the employee will always prompt me with an upsell, ""add a cookie for just a dollar?"" or something similar. However recently I noticed one employee was automatically increasing my combo to a medium, which costs more than the regular small size. At first I let it go. But today I decided to order inside at the counter. I recognized the employee as the same one that took my drive-thru order last time. As soon as I stated which combo I wanted, she automatically reached for the medium-sized soda cup and that's when I had enough. I pushed it back and told her that I didn't ask for medium, to please give me regular size.  I was very annoyed by this type of slimmy sales tactic--I wish I caught it on video (next time I visit, I will record with my mobile). Is this illegal? Can fast-food employees try to slip a fast one on me without first asking if I want the bigger size combo? I can only imagine how many people didn't notice and paid more without knowing, or guys like me who noticed it right away and now have to deal with this pushy sales trick all the time.  Is it worth writing an email to Carl's Jr. complaint department? Should I catch this on camera?"	Yes
37	I've run into a bit of an issue with my dishwasher and I would be interested in getting your opinions on how to resolve it.  The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.  After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.  After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options:  -Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher  -40% off a new Bosch replacement.  I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?  The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.  What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this?   A 40% discount would have seemed to be a fair, good faith resolution if it wasn't for the inflated pricing and all of the associated inconveniences.	Yes
38	"Hi, Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post, but here's my story.  My mom hears some flipping noise when driving, so she takes her car to firestone tires.(where she bought her tires)  1. Firestone- recognized that 2 tires were recalled, so they replaced 2 tires for free. Problem still persisted.  2. Mobil- So then she takes the car to the gas station the next day and the guy says the problem is the AXLE BOOT and STRUTS. Left side on the front was leaking. They said they would have to replace all 4 axles for total of $780. She says nope too much.  3. Valero- next my mom takes the car to the Valero gas station down the street and repeated everything that just happened, and he said that he will order the front STRUTS(not the entire axle) and get the problem fixed, and he won't do the back ones.  So at the end, he replaced the entire left axle(leaking)(which never told her he was gonna do) and front struts, total $480.   THEN AT THE END, HE SAYS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE BACK TIRE WAS THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. The other used tire in the back was ""feathering"", causing the noise. ($50 problem)  So he misdiagnosed, overcharged, and replaced parts that never needed replacing in the first place.  So tomorrow we are gonna get the original parts as evidence that they were not the problem nor they were damaged.  Also, the receipt invoice does not say anywhere the diagnosis of the problem. He never looked at the car, just did what he felt like basically.   So she wants a refund of her money. Any suggestions??"	Yes
39	Hey y'all,   So my S/O and I have been trying to buy a home for some time now, and have our hearts set on a property listed for ~150k. We have had some financial ups and downs in the last five years and can't qualify for a loan. A member of my S/O's family has offered to start transferring a small amount money every week into an account in S/O's name. We don't know where this money is coming from, and they don't want to claim it on their taxes. Is their a legal way to accept and claim this kind of money or does this just stink to high hell as I am inclined to believe?  Thanks in advance for you rational responses.	Yes
40	There’s a t-shirt company we order from frequently, and back over a year ago they accidentally shipped us 2500 worth of merch in packages with our company name. Products we did not order. We called them to tell them we received some merch in error, and they said they would send someone to pick it up.   Fast forward a few months and long story short, no one ever came to get it, after some fussing back and forth with them about why we weren’t going to be able to drop the merch off at their nearest location (30 mins away), we received an email that said they would send a carrier to get it, and that the carrier would provide their own labels so there was no need to print one off. Stuck them on the porch, came home the next day, they were gone. (We never have problems with things being stolen at that location).   Now six months later, they are saying they never received them back. The carrier never left any kind of notice of pick up on the porch of any kind of info, but they don’t usually do that’s anyways.  They are asking for the tracking info, but we were never provided that. They are saying if we can’t provide it or proof of delivery, then we will be charged for the products.   Remember, we didn’t order these. They were shipped to the wrong place, with our name on the boxes. We were never given any tracking info. I told her that whoever initiated the pick up should have the tracking information, but she said it didn’t work like that. It’s all just a bunch of bullshit, I really want to just say f it.    Is there any kind of legal precedence for saying businesses cant just send you shit and say you owe for it unless you can prove you sent it back?	Yes

42	Basically what happened was that my sister called to get internet for our new apt, and we were rejected by CenturyLink because the person who had lived there before had an outstanding bill of $200+. The representative even had the gall to ask my sister if she wanted to make the payment on behalf of the former resident, (why on earth would we do that for a complete stranger...? Honestly...) which obviously has ticked me a bit.    No, I don't know who the resident is, there are absolutely 0 ties between me, my family, and whoever used to live here. They rejected literally on the basis of the past resident having an outstanding balance, (my sister has a call recorder on her phone so she emailed me the audio,) yet, they require your SSN in order to make an account with them...    A friend of mine told me it's total BS and I could actually report them to the BBB for taking unnecessary sensitive information and rejecting us based on someone else's records. I've never heard of such a preposterous way to be rejected, and honestly I just want some decent internet for my home.     Also sorry in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. Idk where to post it...	Yes
43	In 2000 I took out a student loan through my state, for $8500.  I have been going to school off and on since then, and have had periods of deferral or and payment.  To this date I have paid over 9000 dollars, and owe over 9000 dollars due to interest.  Do I have any options to not be continually ass raped by this aside from taking out a different loan with lower interest?	Yes
44	Hey Reddit,  I am a Canadian from Ontario who has had their amazon account stolen from them just minutes ago. They managed to also change the email and password before I could react. This individual has made a purchase from my credit card from London UK and I need to resolve this now. The genius who did this changed their shipping address that has a first name attached, their email and the address that their purchase is going to. So I know some decent information about this person (but could all be fake). I already called amazon.ca support and they took down my information about the incident including my name, email, the order code that had been sent to my email and my number.   What else do I need to do?   Thanks in advanced,  ET	Yes
45	"I have a fairly high end computer (custom built) that was a few years old.   Recently I started having lots of issues with it and upon further troubleshooting/inspection noticed some of the modular connections on my power supply were melted.  Oddly enough the machine continued to limp along until I made this discovery.  The power supply is a ""high end"" 1000W and had a 5 year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. Was a fairly painless transaction.  My issues persisted even with the new power supply (instability, etc)   I tried my ram sticks one at a time and the issue continued with all four and so I figured my motherboard had been damaged (in hindsight i should have bought all new ram at the same time)  Being a high end X99 platform it made sense to just replace the motherboard as any kind of an upgrade would be very expensive and not much gain to me as I just use it for office/IT tech work and gaming.  The replacement motherboard did not fix the issue so I started to suspect my ram/processor.  I am awaiting a replacement processor from Intel and new ram from amazon.  I have been in contact with a seemingly helpful/friendly person from the PSU company and had originally shipped them my motherboard for further inspection. I have not yet heard back their diagnosis on the motherboard but regardless I will not be using it again.  I emailed them today and explained everything ive done and money it has cost me and i've asked what they can do for me.   If they don't offer a reasonable settlement to this matter is it a good idea to sue them in small claims court? I have spent many hours troubleshooting and dealing with this system including loss of productivity at work from having to use my laptop which is not ideal for IT work.   In hind sight I should have just bought all new components right away after the PSU failure and then tried to work out compensation with them but I opted to try to fix it one part at a time."	Yes
46	"I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.  He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.  The day of my flight to California I texted him to confirm that he could still host me, still wanted me to come, and could still afford everything. I even told him if money was an issue for him we could reschedule and I could meet him another time.  I got on my flight, and when I landed and called him he told me his check didn't go through, and that I was on my own. I have his address, his full name, as well as some of his family members added on Facebook.  I have incurred costs from a hotel, as well as a very expensive flight back home 2 days later. I had planned to stay 2 weeks, but since he would not even agree to meet out of embarrassment I decided to leave ASAP.  Could I legally take him to court because he agreed over text and email? I had asked him multiple times, as late as before I even boarded the plane to make sure he still wanted me to come and was able to host me during my stay.   I wouldn't have got on the plane if he had just told me he didn't have the money. I'm incredibly upset by the whole situation and at this point I just want the money back for the 2 nights at the hotel and the flight back home.   Would suing him in small claims be realistic or do verbal or text agreements not hold up in small claims court?   I have him plenty of oppurtunities to speak up and potentially mitigate and costs I would incur but he literally waited until he knew I was on my way. The last text I got before landing was ""are you ok the plane?"" To which I told him I was boarding. I honestly think the guy did it purposefully. Do I have a chance at winning a suit against him if I file? The total cost for the 2 nights and the flight was $976.40."	Yes
47	Purchased a car from a dealership about 4 months ago.  Upon driving it home after parking it, it was leaking fluid (Oil and Windshield fluid). I took pictures and asked them about it, they said it was fine and that ''it heats up and causes it to overflow sometimes''  Today I brought the car to a different dealership to get an oil change, they said that its also leaking powersteering fluid is leaking. Also upon parking it home, the electrical system is cutting out. Headleads / foglights / dashboard / radio+speaker system no longer turn on.   Not sure what to do in this case.	Yes
48	Situation: My mother and I hired a self-employed mechanic to replace the motor of my car '03 Impala back in May of this year ('17). He constantly delayed finishing the repair and then told us just last week that it was completed and we could come get it. When we arrived at the house we could  see visible damage to the front two fenders (dents in the middle over the tires). I also noticed that the driver side window no longer had window tint. I looked inside the cab of the vehicle to see that the radio plate ($299) was missing. I went to the other side of the car to see that the passenger side door appeared to be tampered with on the top of the frame. Then I checked the back seat and opened up the trunk (the car battery is dead) and see that the subwoofers and amplifier are both missing as well. We asked the mechanics son about it as he (the mechanic) is on his way home. Apparently the car was broken into before it got it the mechanics custody and they replaced the driver side window. They never notified us of it or let us know they filed a police report. We're waiting for updates on the issue from the mechanic but I'm wanting to know if there's anything we can do other than do a claim with our renters insurance.   Thanks for your time!	Yes

50	"I signed up for a gym in October 2015. It was a 1 year contract, that switched to month to month once the year was up. I paid throughout the whole year, and continued to pay until February of 2017. I had to suddenly move (long story) and in that same month got a new bank account, with new debit card.   In the hurry of the move, I forgot to cancel the gym membership or give them new card information. I didn't worry about it, because I wasn't under contract. Any other monthly service not under contract would cancel automatically once they stopped being paid.  This gym apparently is different. They made several attempts to call and inform me, but they were just random 1-800 numbers that I would never answer.   Just now, I got an email from them saying that if I didn't pay my entire balance within 5 days, they would be sending me to collections.  What can I do? It's several hundred dollars, because they've added some bullshit ""late fees"", so it isn't an insignificant amount of money. And in principle it frustrates me. Why should I pay for the membership when I wasn't under contract and I haven't been to that gym in over 6 months?"	Yes
51	I am recently divorced, I have to take him to court over the stupidest things to get him to do. I couldn't get my old tax returns without a long process from the IRS because he denied me access to the info I needed, so we went to court and judge ordered him to give it to me. We had agreed that since we were married all of last year and only separated in August, that we would still file jointly, and then do it separate after that. I am 99% sure he has already filed for last year, but I never saw it and I never signed it. He also hasn't given me my portion of the tax return. Is it fair that I am only supposed to get a third of that tax return? And what can i do to find out if he has already filed? The IRS is a NIGHTMARE to deal with. I can't talk to a person to save my life.	Yes
52	"My family renovated our house using a contractor and his employees and like most do ended up not finishing and wasting a lot of our money. He has broken the contract multiple times, he also did not pay for our very shitty living arrangement we had to pay it ourselves while paying for the work that the contractor was also ""doing"", and did not follow blueprint instructions. Thus we took him to court and the judge was clearly not on our side, the contractor had missed court dates, even his lawyer missed a court date and the judge was completely fine with it he just rescheduled the dates every time. My family did not miss any dates and I'm pretty sure we did not screw anything up. On Friday the judge dismissed our case, that has been going on for more than 2 years. This of course costed us a lot of money with no compensation. Is there any thing else we can do?"	Yes
53	Ok, I will try to keep this as short as possible. I was in Afghanistan after college for about 3 years working for the DOD (contractor). I came back on medical leave and racked up a ton of debt over the course of 3 years (also couldn't find a job, had anxiety etc).  I finally got back on my feet and got a couple good jobs, the whole time ignoring the constant calls because I had no means to make them right.  Today, I received a bunch of solicited information about attorneys in the mail offering to represent me in my case and looked the information up online to find that a complaint was filed in PBC courts on 7/3. Summons for 7/7.... I am starting to sweat. I moved somewhat recently and was never properly notified....  My wife and I both have degrees from the best school in the state and currently make around 75K each in SFla. We have high expenses but could make room to negotiate some type of settlement.   Are there attorneys who can do debt consolidation and handle this judgement or pending judgement? I would like to take care of each of the issues I have in one fell swoop if possible.   Please help me out, I am no dummy, but I could obviously have handled this better from the start. I had no means to repay, no job, and a nonfunctional back.... excuses. Please help!	Yes
54	I leased a car, and then moved states and registered my car in MD. I got a letter from Honda Financial that said by error I have received the original Certificate of Title for the vehicle and I should send it to Honda FInancial (they enclosed a pre-marked return envelope). Do I own the car now? If I don't send back the Title, and claim the car is mine now, will they just sue me for it or request an updated Certificate from the state?	Yes
55	Hey guys!  I live in Oklahoma, I purchased a car off eBay from a classified ad in New Hampshire. I used PayPal for the deposit $500, and a check for the rest of the $12,000.   The company filed chapter 11, then converted to a chapter 7. I have filed a creditor claim with the NH Bankruptcy court.   Car insurance won't help, not a theft. eBay doesn't protect classified ads. Bank can't help, it isn't considered check fraud. Any advice on getting my money back?	Yes
56	Hi,  My wife signed us up for Gerber Life Insurance a while back. We tried to cancel it because Life insurance for a one-year-old isn't a necessary expense.  But, Gerber Life insurance has saw fit to have their login server conveniently down(has been for a while), they tried to get her to stay by mentioning a bunch of dead children, and won't let her cancel the insurance unless we fill out a long form listing our complaints about the insurance and a set of signatures that are hers.  I'm starting to get more and more suspicious that Gerber is inefficient on purpose. Provided that I can prove it, is it legal for them to impede customers from canceling in this way?	Yes
57	"The branch was closed. I called them while I was still at the ATM to try to get the solution going. She told me 10 business days and I'll just see the money posted. I went into the bank first thing next morning and they told me that they have nothing to do with the ATMs outside and if I did it inside, they could help me. (COOL BECAUSE EVERY TIME I DO, SOMEONE SAYS ""Hey, you know you can just do this at an ATM, right?"")   One week later, I called on Monday. There was no history of my situation AT ALL recorded. The problem has not been researched, so I was told it would be escalated and that the latest I'll see it posted if Friday. Hi. Tuesday. Turns out the escalation team needed the info on which ATM and the requested it from me VIA MAIL. I told EVERYONE I'VE TALKED TO (3 different teams of an associate&amp;manager) it. But the person putting it in my costumer notes FORGOT A FUCKING LETTER. I was even told at one point my check was shredded and I need to get a new one.  I guess what I'm looking for is.. there can't be ANY way that this is okay. How can they just take my check, shred it, and spit out a small receipt that says sorry with a costumer service number on it and tell me that I just have to get a new one a week later.  How is this okay? Do I have any options here because they've basically been forcing me to live without my food money for over two weeks and I can't believe that they have no re precautions"	Yes
58	We live in North Dakota. My mother has been married for about two years. Shortly after marriage he starting showing his true personality. In any event, they've decided to get a divorce.   My mother doesn't make much money and definitely not enough to consult with an attorney. Since they've been married they bought a house (down payment from his retirement money), which he took out a second mortgage out on to pay off his credit card debt. My mother has about 10k in medical bills which they didn't touch. He now says he has someone coming buy to look at the house and try to sell it. She'd ideally like to keep the house.   He also helped buy her a car but they never transferred it into her name and he's threatening to take it away from her.   His exact finances aren't known as he won't share them.  What is the best course of action going forward?	Yes
59	I am currently on a study abroad trip with a US based provider ( supplied through my school ).  I was suppost to on a week long trip to Thailand with this company but they canceled it with two weeks notice.  They are giving me a refund for the program fee but I am now stranded in Thailand all alone for a week as I already have my flights and can't afford a flight home.  Is there anything I can do to get them to pay for part of my flight?  Unfortunately I signed no paperwork for anything.  I simply paid the extra fee on top of my study abroad fee	Yes
60	I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52). They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month. Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month. On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym). I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months. The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer. Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes. I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!	Yes
61	http://imgur.com/llAQJvp  This is notice they received, completely unaware what to do. Have no idea how to file an answer, they have no money for an attorney. Any advice would be greatly needed.  Story: Mom co-signed for brother on a big purchase. Brother claims it was paid, company seems to have sold the debt to a collection agency. My parents are resigned to do nothing, and be sad about this. I tried browsing the wiki and was unsure, so I made this post anyways.	Yes
62	Basically as title says. Got my son a contract with sprint, hes 16 so I pay for everything, got him a brand new LG V20 with a lease style contract under the condition that he worked for his uncle on the weekends.   Well 16 year olds will be 16 year olds and he skipped out on more than 7 days worth of work. So punishment was I returned the phone to sprint and got him a basic flip phone with no data.   I returned the phone to a corporate sprint store and paid a 35 restocking fee. I have a digital receipt from the store that shows the model and serial number of the phone returned.   Somehow sprint lost the phone between the time I was given a receipt and now.   They sent me a bill for 423.72.   100 of that is my monthly payment and the other part is the cost of the phone I returned.   I called last month when this happened and filed a dispute. Heard nothing back from them.   This month I receive a pay or disconnect notice for the outstanding balance of 320 for the price of the phone. So I called very mad  but kept my cool. Talked with a supervisor and she seemed very helpful until the end. She said she would start another claim and it would be a week for the resolution.   I asked her what happened with the first dispute and she said there was no resolution. I asked her what that means and she said she was unsure. She said she would place a hold on my account for the 320 to make sure it does not disconnect my service, but that hold would expire at the end of the claim.   Well that happened today. I called again and made sure to speak to the same lady. I even waited on hold for 45 minutes to make this happen. She tells me that the claim was denied. No reason for the claim being denied was given.  I asked her if she had the receipt. She said no. I sent her my digital copy of the receipt. She agreed that his was an official receipt and was able to verify it in the system. But that I still owe for the phone.   She has a receipt that she agrees is legit showing I returned the phone. So I did my part here. How can she claim I owe her money for a phone I followed procedure with? IS there any legal ground for her to say I owe for an expensive phone they lost?  Texas if that matters.	Yes
63	"As the title says, my roommates and I are being sued by a former landlord to the tune of roughly $7500 after a tenancy that stretched from 2014 until April of 2017. The bulk of the charges come from painting ($3000) and carpeting ($3200). In addition to these charges there are $600 in damages that they are attempting to charge us for that appear on the initial commencement checklist as being previously damaged, signed in 2014 at the outset of the lease. They are also suing us for their attorney's fees; one of my biggest questions regarding the issue is if they are allowed to do this and if so is there a limit to the amount we can be held liable for?  There are some damages we do not contest, such as wall dings, scratches, and a broken kitchen drawer, however, we assert that the ""damage"" to the paint and carpet was normal wear and tear over the course of a 3 year lease. Some of the paint in the home at lease origination was noted as ""freshly painted"", while other rooms were not. The carpets were dirty at the time of lease inception and one of the tenant's parents rented a carpet cleaner and cleaned them before they moved in, it is our belief that the carpets in the home may be original to the home (built 1997), but we do not know for sure.  After we moved out of the home the landlords fully re-painted and re-carpeted the entire house and have since sold it. It is our belief that they are attempting to leverage our security deposit and other alleged damages to offset the costs of their renovation of the property.   Ultimately, the main questions I have regarding our case are whether or not the life expectancy of the paint and carpeting was exceeded by the term of the lease and whether or not we are liable for their attorney fees should we choose to go to court. Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
64	"I am located in New York.  Long story short, about 9 years ago I ended up damaging someone's property (twice!) as a result of two farming equipment accidents. As a result of it, I agreed to pay them $15K to settle their civil cases against me. We signed and notarized the repayment agreement, in which I was supposed to pay a certain amount per month.  A variety of family problems were present and I really didn't have the money, so the person specifically put into the contract that they could grant me reprieves from the agreed upon payment schedule if necessary, but that they had the right to rescind those reprieves at any time for any reason and have me continue upon the normal payment schedule. Basically, if I didn't have money to pay them in August, they could say don't worry about it pay me in September or something like that. After signing the agreement, I had a variety of unforeseen things happen to me, and the person told me don't worry about paying it back right now. I basically never brought it up to them again, moved and hadn't heard about it since. About two months ago, I received a certified letter in the mail from an attorney stating that ""any abeyance in payment is hereby revoked"" and that payment would be expected the following month at the law firm's address, as well as a copy of the signed contract. Having consulted online resources, I determined that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and that the contract was well over its effective time and ignored the letter. I just got a second letter from him stating that I was now in default of the agreement and they were prepared to ""file an action"" against me in county court and that according to the agreement and that I was responsible for attorney's fees, etc. unless I immediately corrected the default. I still have not responded. Am I right that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and thus their agreement is worthless?"	Yes
65	"I live in Arizona, but the university is in Virginia.  I was guided here from r/personalfinance   I graduated in 2015 from this university and now attend dental school in a completely different state. I was randomly checking my university email which I never do and I saw that apparently ""I"" had registered for two in-person classes for the summer and now have about $2700 to owe. These classes are still in session and I also have emails from the professors that I am failing these classes, etc. I am not sure where the mix up is but how can I prove that I never registered for these classes and that I have no motive to take these classes. I am not sure if someone logged into my account and registered for them or if there was some IT error. This is really worrisome as I definitely don't have the money to pay for it nor in my mind should I. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
66	"Hello! So here is what happened:    Back in April I paid $250 to have a self-employed stylist (she goes to people houses to do hair) to give me a ""brazilian blow-out"". For those of you who dont know what that is, here is the definition:    Brazilian hair straightening (also called Breezilian straightening, Brazilian Keratin Treatment, BKT, Brazilian Blowout, Escova Progressiva, Keratin Cure) are a semi-permanent hair straightening method done by temporarily sealing a liquid keratin and a preservative solution into the hair with a hair iron.   Typically this is supposed to last 10-12 weeks.   Well I paid her for this service, and awoke the next morning to discover my hair was a giant frizzy poofy mess (my baseline). I have had these done before in the past at salon's so I knew what to expect (not this); this was the first time I had used this individual.   I contacted her via facebook, as that was how we were communicating, informing her that her treatment did not work whatsoever and that I either want a refund or a treatment that actually works.   She blocked me.   I attempted to contact her via telephone and got no response.   Seeing as I didn't want to pay $250 for someone to shampoo and straighten my hair for an evening and given that I attempted to get a refund from her, I contacted my bank to dispute the charge on the basis of not receiving services I should have. (Of note, there was no 'no refund' agreement with this individual)  The bank decided in my favor and returned the amount to my account.   She has now charged me $250 again, without my permission and without contacting me.   Where do I go from here? Thank you in advance!"	Yes
67	Hi. I run an ecommerce account. I sold someone an item to which I have a said return policy on it. Unfortunately they wanted to return the item. When they did, the item was defective and was not in the same shape or form it was in when I sent it to them which went against my return policy. I denied them a return and now they're threatening to sue. Is that possible?	Yes
68	"I received a certified letter yesterday concerning credit card debt from 2 years ago.  A suit has been filed against me and I'm required to respond within 28 days.  I guess the big question then is, what now?  How do I handle this going forward?  Through some googling and digging, I've figured out that the debt is from a credit card 2 years ago, which was sold to this Cavalry SPV, LLC, which was then sold (or they're just representing) to the law firm that the claim is coming from.  Creating and logging into an account on the Cavalry website simply directs me to call said lawyer, so, I start researching said law firm.  Well, their website looks more like a collection agency than a law firm, with an option make payments, and warnings about ""any communications from this site is an attempt to collect, blah blah.""  Even though BBB is usually a scam too, the reviews and complaints make this place sound like an even worse scam.  So what should I do?  There's an option to e-mail them to discuss things, even with an option to receive responses by mail (which reading threads here is recommended!)  Should I try to call them and negotiate?  How do I respond to the summons from my local court?"	Yes
69	Not long ago I purchased a vehicle from a local dealership.  I was lured in by the dealership's fancy lot and promises written on their website about inspecting every vehicle for safety and reliability.  When I drove off the lot every last airbag light illuminated, as well as the seat belt light.  Obviously, the lights were not on when I had test drove the vehicle earlier in the day.  To be clear, the SRS system in a my vehicle is a fairly simple machine.  It tests for any faults in the airbags and seat belts during those five-ten seconds where the airbag light is on when you first start up your car.  If it detects any faults it will store that fault in the SRS computer and the light will stay on and cannot be shut off without an SRS reset tool.  It is designed so that no amount of tomfoolery will shut off the light, including removing the battery and draining all of the power from the vehicle.  Basically, without actively shutting it off it will not shut off.  The dealership had closed as I was leaving so first thing in the morning I contacted the salesman and was basically told it was my problem now.  I proceeded to my local mechanic, had the codes run, and returned to the dealership to give them a chance to make it right and was told it would be “illegal for them to work on the car.”  When I spoke to the manager he said the same thing, except adding that my mechanic and I are both idiots.  I proceeded to do my own investigation at that point.  The local dealership that deals with my vehicle make ran a diagnostic and discovered a broken bypass installed that triggered the airbag light.  The service manager confirmed that it would have been impossible for the airbag light to have not been present when anyone had turned on the vehicle, as long as the SRS system was connected and that bypass was installed.  I traced the sale of the vehicle back to another dealership that took the vehicle in on trade-in and had confirmed the presence of the broken bypass in their own inspection.  That dealership sent it to auction with the light still on, which is where the dealership I purchased it from had obtained the vehicle.  When I spoke to the state investigators about the issue they seemed to disagree with me that it was fraud.  I had reported that I had been victim to criminal misrepresentation and possibly victim to the sale of nonfunctional airbags (§860.146) but they said that they would have to prove that the owner of the dealership was the one responsible for the act and it would be too difficult for them to do so.  It was my understanding that in a corporation criminal liability is aggregated among the employees of that corporation, not just the the owner.  Am I wrong in assuming that the corporation (or it's agents) should still be investigated even if the owner of the corporation had nothing to do with the misrepresentation?  I'm just baffled at the moment.	Yes
70	"So yesterday my father came home with a ""Brand new"" Samsung Galaxy Note 5 that he purchased at a local cellular and mobile phone service store.  While he was setting up his phone I noticed that the phone he had just bought did not come with the original Samsung box. Which seemed a bit strange to me since he claimed that the phone was brand new. I asked him if that was the box the phone came in with and why it was not the original samsung box. He was dumbfounded after I showed him that every brand new samsung phone comes in with a samsung box. (I showed him unboxing videos on youtube of the same phone) I then asked him how much he had paid for the phone and if he was given a receipt for his transaction.  He apparently paid $500 cash for the phone and was not even given a receipt.   At this point the entire thing seemed pretty shady to me. But my dad dismissed my concerns and gave the store owner benefit of doubt and went to work. I decided to visit the store where he had purchased this phone and asked them why my father was not given the receipt for the phone that he had just bought. After pressing the matter I was provided with the receipt which my father had apparently ""Left behind."" But upon asking them why a ""Brand new phone"" was missing its original box I was kindly met with ""Get the fuck out of my shop."" and all of my requests for a potential refund were denied except for in store credit. After looking at the receipt I found that it was missing any tax information and was showing an amount paid of $425 when my father paid $500 in cash.  When I got home I went through the contents of the box the phone came in with and found an amazon return slip. I believe that the store most likely bought a used phone on amazon and passed it off as brand new and sold it for $500 to my dad. I looked up  [Samsung Galaxy Note 5](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-N920A-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B013XB5L1A/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500305135&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=samsung+galaxy+note+5+unlocked) on amazon and a brand new one costs about $359 which I assume comes with the original box and it has free shipping.   I really don't know how to proceed at this point. Any help will be greatly appreciated.   p.s We live in Queens, NY.  TLDR; My father bought a brand new samsung phone for $500 which did not come with the original samsung box and the receipt provided by the store does not reflect the correct amount paid."	Yes
71	Its a long, complex and boring story so I'll just stick to the key parts.   I'm going to Cancun next week so I decided to purchase a LifeProof Nuud model.   The lady working at Target installed my case, which I thought was normal at the time, come to find out later she wasn't supposed to do that.   Anyways, I get home and then realize that the case wasn't properly tested for bubbles, or any sort of breech in the case. Also, I realize she installed the case incorrectly so that my Silence/Ringer slider was being crushed by the case.   So of course, I get sketched out, I go to Target the next day, the woman who 'helped' me the day before wasn't there but a group of employees decided to try to take the faulty case off.   Some how, they use too much to the point that my screen was cracked &amp; phone bent. Pretty much destroying it. (Didn't even get the case off.)  Now Target refuses to reimburse me for my iPhone, and I'm not sure what to do.   I'm not very rich at all, the phone was probably the most expensive thing I've owned in the past five years, so buying a new one isn't that simple.   Tl;dr: Target lady installed my new case improperly, other target people try to take and off and destroy it in the process. Target won't pay me for the phone.   P.S, sorry for horrible formatting/spelling. It's about 1 in the morning, and I've pretty exhausted from trying to deal with this.	Yes
72	I had a monthly parking service with Impark and I no longer needed to use their parking lot after April. I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.   I didn't deal with it right away because I had to go on vacation 1.5 months. Now that I'm back, I see that they have added on even more additional charges. On top of the $93.25, they also added on $50 (rejected payment charge) + $30 (late admin fee)+ $1.5 (tax) for the months of June and July. Now they say that I owe them $174.75 or my debt will be collected by a collection agency and will affect my credit.    I find it absurd that I have to pay $174.75 when I haven't parked in their parking lot since I cancelled at the end of April. Is there any way I can dispute this or will I have to pay them the money?	Yes
73	I run a computer repair business and sometime customers abandon their devices. We have them sign a form that says after 30 days it's forfeited. Sometime we've fixed them and they don't come back or call back for months. We have to recover or cost of parts and can't hold on to something forever. Is there anything we need to do to legal have ownership to sell it or get rid of it? We are in Kansas.	Yes
74	This is slightly personal, hence the throwaway, and this situation is based in South East Asia. So, I know that there will be a certain degree of difference but I just want to know what I can expect. Also note that I am not the embezzler  If a person has been embezzling money from the company and the company goes to the cops, will the tax records of the company be under scrutiny?   Also, if the some of the money embezzled has been used to buy houses listed under that person's kids names, will that money be recouped? Alternatively, is there any way to force the person to return the money without going to the police?	Yes
75	Hi, I'm here seeking for legal advice.   On 19/4 I was asked by my supplier via email to pay for a certain invoice amounting to $2500.  On 22/4 the supplier emailed me again, saying his bank is 'auditing' his bank account, and the bank advised him not to accept any payment from his customers. He asked me to bank in the money to another bank account.   Of course, up to this point, I believed everything he said.  Then on 29/6, my boss received a call from the supplier, saying they did not receive our payment.   I then sent them the email correspondence between us and the payment details to them. Their accounts guy then told me his email got hacked, and he did not ask me to pay to a second bank account.   Now, they're demanding that we pay them the amount we owe, even though we did what was instructed by their emails. They're threatening to go to court if we do not pay.	Yes
76	I'm a part of the alumni board of my old Fraternity.  Recently, we've had one of the kids break in a couple of interior doors after imbibing a little too much.  Regardless to say, he's being a little s*** about it, and we're having difficulty collecting money for the damages, even though we feel pretty good about the evidence we have against him.  We've gotten to the point where we've gave him one last opportunity to pay, and now the question is whether to take him to collections or to small claims court.  The first door he broke was when he was still a tenant at the house, and there are clauses in the lease regarding damaging property.  The second door was a couple months after he graduated, and after his lease was up.  One other issue is that the guy now lives out of state.  I forget the final cost of the repairs, but we're only asking for $600, which is less than the total.  While we still want the money, we're really at the point right now where we want to set a precedent, and we don't want him to get away with it.  With all this said, what's the best course of action: small claims court or collections?	Yes
77	"I own an SEO company and we do legit work.  We have been in this space since 2007 and have had 0 complaints and no chargebacks.  A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results.   2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.    After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.  Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.  He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..    My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.    We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.  We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.  Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.   TL;DR client hired us and did a chargeback which we won, now is threatening legal action in the form of criminal complaints if we do not refund him."	Yes
78	"Hi all,  supload.com is a site where you post images and get paid in bitcoin for every view. The guy has posted this site on /r/beermoney and other places a while ago and I ended up trying it out in March. Since then I have been contacting the owners via twitter/email etc and get absolutely no reply regarding why my ""earnings need to be finalised"". Now this happened in March and I completely forgot about it but my images are still earning money, I have 25$ worth of bitcoin to check out.

79	"Hi! I love in Ontario, Canada and I have an uber problem.   I took an uber Friday night from a vet clinic where I was picking up the cat I am fostering. He was in a a carrier that was a solid plastic base. I've had it for a few years and my sister had it forever before that and its always been a sturdy carrier.   Everything in the ride went fine, and the driver was even asking me about the cat, who was asleep as he had just been neutered. Today, I went to check my bank balance and noticed it was way lower than expected. And bam, there it  is was, a 150$ charge from uber. Separate fom the 17$ charge for the ride. Turns out they are claiming the cat peed in the car??   Now, my actual cat has peed in the car in this carrier before (he hates car rides) and it's never leaked. And I'm talking, he SOAKED this carrier. Flooded it. But this cat, who was sleeping, has a white tummy, and had just been spayed, came out of the carrier dry. No smell, nothing IN the carrier. There is no way he peed in there. The pictures (https://m.imgur.com/kvtg61X) they sent absolutely look like the guy flicked water on his seat. Uber's response is just ""We believe him so too bad!"" And they haven't responded to requests for any kind of cleaning bill.  Am I just out 150$ ?"	Yes
80	A buyer purchased a week of our time share via eBay back in July 2017 for travel this March 2018, and then couldn’t find cheap flights to get down there. She has been harassing us to get her money back since then when the posting had said no refunds.  She disputed through eBay, but their policy (rightfully so) doesn’t support “buyers remorse” or “inadequate research before making a purchase”. She then disputed through PayPal, saying that she didn’t receive her purchase at all - when we had all the confirmations as well as her emails and texts saying that she received the confirmation, but just couldn’t find flights and wanted her money back for that reason. PayPal ruled in our favor, but now she’s disputing with PayPal again through a chargeback with her credit card issuer.  What does this mean? What legal options do we have to ensure that she’s unable to receive her money back for the non-refundable purchase?	Yes
81	I'm writing this on behalf of my mom. We live In Ontario, Canada.  A few years ago my dad created a supplementary credit card under my moms name. He kept both cards and my mom never used the card. Than, a few years bag my parents separated and my dad took the card with him.  Only a while back we received a notice from the bank the card was created under, apparently my dad has been using this card, but it's registered to my mom, so we received a letter requesting that we pay back the debt. My mom called the bank and told them she has nothing to do with the card, she requested her name be removed from the card. The bank says that they cannot remove the name before the full amount is paid back. We talked it out with my dad, and he told me it was settled, the problem would be fixed.  It seems that was not the case. On July 13th, 2017, we received a letter from a legal firm. Apparently the bank has taken legal action on my mom, an they are requesting that she pay back the full amount spent. The problem is, my mom never used the card, that is not money she spent.  The letter was sent on June 29th, 2017, it stated that we must pay back a balance of $3,945.98 CAD. The amount is to gain interest annually at a rate of 19.8%. It also stated that if arrangements are not made within 10 days of the letter being sent, than legal action will be taken. It has been 14 days, we just received this letter.  I checked out the reviews for the Law Firm, it's technically a debt collector, and apparently their service is horrible. They are known to refuse to pick up calls so that interest is gained overtime, they seem to be all about money.  So now we have a problem. My Mom owes a bank money that she never used, it's quite possible that legal action will be taken by a potentially scummy company, and I doubt my dad will do anything to help.  So I've turned to my friend Reddit, I need your help, what can me and my mom do in this situation? How do we proceed?  Thank you for taking the time to read through this, I know it's quite long, but it means a lot to me.	Yes
82	I moved into an apartment in CT back in May 2016 which turned out to be horrible due to no wall insulation and an unstable downstairs neighbor who moaned when I had females over for fun then smoked cigarettes and denied it and made me ill from second hand smoke. I later found out from a next door neighbor that the prior tenant living in my apartment abruptly left after a few months due to similar reasons to mine. Calls to management made no difference and they denied any smoking or problems with neighbor. They even went as far as threatening eviction for stating I was causing him a disturbance, refusing my calls about the eviction threat then stating it was sent by mistake by their Jewish lawyer during their holiday. Despite all of this, I received a lease renewal request in March 2017 and was too busy with work (I work in a hospital) to look for apartments or sign the renewal. Finally got to a point where my neighbor continued to smoke and then harass me with total denial by him and management and I decided to get the hell out. I found a nice but more expensive place and signed the lease renewal letter on June 1 as intent to vacate by July 1 which was received by them on June 8, 2017. I also left the apartment spotless and in better condition then when I moved in by leaving expensive blinds and newly painted walls. I have all letters, payments and the apartment condition documented with pictures.   Now the management company is refusing to return any security because they are saying I did not supply 30 days notice. The apartment is spotless and they only commented on the timing of receiving the lease renewal notice. Does the timing of the renewal signing and 30 days notice have anything to do with receiving back my security? Can I take them to small claims court?	Yes
83	"So this is a long story but I'll try to condense it. The realtor I want to sell the house with recommended this ""contractor"" she found on Home Advisor. I presumed that she had worked with him before but she just saw his ratings and contacted him. (I needed a contractor because the previous tenants damaged the house significantly.)   Anyway he comes over and gives us an estimate of costs and I sign a contract indicating costs and a timeline for completion. Everything is going fine (I check up on his progress weekly) and he is repairing minor problems like repainting the walls and clearing debris until he contacts me telling me there was a problem with a pipe in the bathroom and water flooded the surrounding area. He insists that he never actually went into the bathroom and the flooding is a problem I never notified him about. I insist that he has been to the bathroom and inspected it before and he denies (even though my realtor confirms that the contractor inspected the bathroom multiple times before with the realtor present). He then storms out without issuing a refund for work he has not completed (paid in advance) and he has not returned the key I gave him.   Furthermore, he did a terrible paint job (didn't use primer so the walls are chipping apart or a cover sheet for the wooden floors so now the wood is stained with paint).   We have contacted Home Advisor but they insist because he has at least a 3 star rating they cannot remove him from their website.   What is the best way to pursue legal action?   TLDR; Contractor ruined house, got paid for work he did not do, and HomeAdvisor won't do anything to help."	Yes
84	"Original engine in my car died. I decided to replace the engine with a rebuild engine from a reputable company out of MD (I'm in KS) with great ratings. I also picked up their additional ""No Fault"" warranty because this engine is prone to troubles. Replacement went fine, but 2k miles into the rebuilt engine blows a rod out the bottom of the engine.  This time the rod does an additional ~6,000 worth of damage to other components. Company is willing to replace engine but says the rest of the damage is not on them. New engine is useless without the additional repairs. So basically I spent 4,700 dollars for a engine replacement plus 500 for the no fault warranty additional coverage, and now I need to spend 6,000 more to repair the damage their engine caused?  Seems illegal to me. Thanks in advance!"	Yes
85	Hi I live in GA and recently bought a car from a private seller. He hid the fact that the engine was bad by bumping up the RPMs. Is there anything i can do to get my money back or have him pay for the car?	Yes
86	Hello. My fiancé (30F) and I (37M) have been together around 4 years. We live together and have a 2 year old daughter. We have joint accounts including checking and credit cards. For the past 3 years I have been supporting her and our daughter exclusively. My fiancé was a full time student and recently graduated from college. I'm currently only making $30k annually. In the 3 years my fiancé had been going to school, I payed nearly 100% of all living expenses including rent, utilities, food, etc. After she graduated she was offered, and took, a teaching position making around $44k a year. She talked me into buying her a new car last month. The car is in both of our names as I am a co-signer. Our current credit card debt is around $25k. All credit card debt is in my name with the exception of one credit card, which she is an authorized user.   So a few days ago things got weird with her. She started going out partying and yesterday tells me she wants to split up because she's not happy in our relationship. This has devastated me because now I'm loosing everything. She's sticking all of our accumulated debt directly onto me while she will be also taking our daughter. She said she hasn't been happy for around 6 months and was contemplating on leaving, meanwhile here I am digging myself deeper and deeper into debt, living almost off of credit cards. She basically used me to get through college and now that she's accepted a job, she's going to leave.   I'm not sure this is relevant, but she's currently on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, of which lately she has been throwing away. She has become unstable.   So here I am. I'm asking for advice on what I can do legally to force her to pay for half our accumulated debt? Do I have any legal recourse? I know I should seek an attorney but I really really cannot afford it right now. Please, please don't berate me on my situation. I know I messed up. I made many mistakes financially. I can blame my fiancé for her continuous false promises of stability financially, but at the end of the day, it's all on me. You have to understand, I'm in a really really low end of my life right now. The bottom just suddenly fell out. In the past 72 hours we went from talking about buying a house next year and living comfortably financially to: my family being torn in half, my daughter being taken away and being on the hook for $25k in debt plus a new car loan on top. I'm asking for advice not asking to be belittle for being a dupe. I already feel like crap and cannot handle anything else. Thank you for what help you can provide.	Yes
87	"I live in Ohio and last year used a vacation rental site to book a few days at a house in Mexico. A few days before my trip, the property owner called to say there may be some work happening at the home I rented and that he'd need to put me up at a much larger home nearby. The house was larger but most of the amenities were non-existent or non-functional - including locks on the exterior doors.  When I arrived back, I spoke with the vacation rental site and they said to file a dispute through my credit card as I had been subject to a ""bait and switch"". I did so and the credit card company quickly refunded my money.  Today I was served with a summons to appear in a small claims court in San Francisco - apparently where the owner of the property lives. I've never been to San Francisco and the rental was in Mexico. The claim says that I falsified receipts with the credit card company in order to win my dispute.  A little bit of sleuthing leads me to believe that I can write a letter to the court explaining that because I don't live in the county (or the state for that matter) that they'll be able to just drop the case. **Should I write a letter explaining why the venue is wrong?**   I didn't provide any receipts at all to the credit card company. I simply explained what I experienced and they said I was right to dispute and that the merchant didn't respond to their inquiry with him so they took the money back. **Is there anything else I should be doing?**  Thanks!"	Yes
88	Just like the title says, I paid to have a background check and such done and the application fee said non refundable whether we were approved or declined. The owner may not be leaving as planned and the house won't be availiable to rent. they used a service called rentscreener.com. Thanks in advance	Yes
89	Backpack and it's contents aren't what I'm worried about. More worried about the check since it was a good amount of money.  Could I contact the company that did the survey to issue me another check or have them stop the check from going through?  Assuming it hasn't been cashed yet.  Would they be able to find out if it got cashed yet?	Yes
90	I will spare you the lengthy story of how my friend came about owing me $2,000. (Please spare me your opinions of how I shouldn't share my Paypal or the quality of the friendship)   He agrees that he unintentionally took this money from a shared Paypal account and I have records to prove the money is mine and went into his personal bank account. He has agreed to pay me back the money, however he is doing it very slowly. In the last 6 months I have received $400 in payments from him. His reasoning for infrequent payments is that his dad is battling cancer and all his income is going towards hospital bills.  I have kindly asked him to increase the frequency to $200/month and since then I have not received any money in over 1 month.   Should I take legal matters to the small claims court? If so, how do I approach that without being aggressive (How do I tell   him this before filing)?  I have all of our conversations and agreements documented through text messages so having it ruled in my favor will be easy.  I am in Sacramento, CA  Thank you in advance!	Yes
91	"I'm in Switzerland and I know the laws might be a bit different here compared to the US; I'm just looking for some general advice and for someone to tell me that I'm not crazy for being angry about this...  On the 29th of May I bought 3 tickets online for a medium sized festival (it's pretty well known but it's not a huge festival). When I still had not received the tickets after a month, I sent proof of payment and asked what was up. I never recieved a reply but a week later I received a ""payment confirmation"" in an envelope with a small rip in the side. I thought nothing of it and hoped the tickets would arrive soon. Last week, when they still hadn't arrived, I sent another email to which I received no reply. I sent another email at the beginning of this week. (There's no phone number on the website, only email.) Still no response. So I sent a message to the festival's Facebook page, and finally received a reply. They said that they had already sent me the ""bracelets"" around the time they sent the payment confirmation. They don't send tickets, just the wrist bands to enter the festival, with no way to identify them (no number, bar code, name or anything...just wrist bands with the festival name on them). I'm pretty sure that they were in the envelope with the payment confirmation and someone at the post office ripped open the letter and stole them. I've explained what I think happened and sent photos of my payment confirmation and the envelope with a rip in the side and they aren't replying. I paid over 400 francs for those three wrist bands. It's insane that they have no proper tickets and no way to identify the wtist bands; they're just asking to be stolen. Whoever has them is going to be able to get into the festival for free no questions asked. I'm so angry right now and so afraid they won't believe me and will refuse to send me more wrist bands. The festival is from the 3rd to the 5th of August. What should I do? File a complaint with the post office? Wait for the festival people to reply (when they've been super shitty about replying)?   Thanks for any advice you can give me  Tl;dr: festival sent me wrist bands which were stolen out of an envelope in the post. They have been slow to reply and I'm very worried they won't believe me"	Yes
92	"Hi, our business entered into a 3 year, $35/month bottleless water cooler contract with a local provider. Due to dissatisfaction with the service (the machine has needed service several times and not enough water is cooled at any given time), we would like to cancel.   The provider has offered to change the machine. Otherwise, the contract provides for a $150 removal fee in the event of cancellation. It also says, ""If provider terminates a rental term under this Agreement or any Add-on Schedule due to Customer’s default, including but not limited to, non-payment of any amount when due, improper care, usage or handling of the Equipment, or failure to perform any other obligation hereunder, Customer will be responsible for payment of all fees for the remaining term(s), as well as for all damages and removal and shipping charges incurred by provider.""  As a result, they are seeking $630 for the remaining 18 months of the contract (in addition to the removal fee). We understand a cancellation fee, but to what extent is it legal to charge the full duration of the contract? Thank you."	Yes
93	We've had DSL through a single T1 line through a local ISP that just recently went out of business.. The new company is a seemingly small mom and pop shop that bought the ISP promising to offer to run fiber cables in my area. They really got our hopes up when we seen them digging, but in the process they damaged a T1 cable and now our internet has been really bad ever since. I can no longer do the things I used to be able to do online, and they refuse to fix it, and it's been a year since they dug the ditches. I think that they're just collecting money rather than put any back into the company for maintenance..   Location; Arkansas, USA.     Thanks in advance!	Yes
94	First off, thank you for taking the time to read over my ordeal. Basically, I have a loose gravel driveway, and my wife and I are sick of tracking in dirt in the house. It’s seriously like a sandy beach in here. So I call around to a bunch of businesses, but I couldn’t find a concrete company to give me the time of day because everyone is slammed with business. Some companies were even sending me off with “I know a guy who knows a guy, his name is Jimmy, he might be able to help”. So I’m doing some more in depth Googling (Ha!), and I come across a website called Thumbtack. You type what it is that you need, and they send contractors your way. Too easy. I get a guy and he’s out at my house immediately that afternoon. He’s eager for the job, and quotes me $3975 for a new driveway. It’s 70 feet long, and 15 feet wide, with an additional slab on the side of our carport that is 20 feet long, and 4 feet wide. I couldn’t find a consistent number online that could give me a ball park price, so when Rudy comes out and gives me that price, I was pretty happy about it.    Rudy said he was brand new to Thumbtack, so that’s why he didn’t have any ratings, but that he was licensed, bonded, and insured (he insisted that he wouldn’t be able to operate without it). I was hesitant because Rudy comes off as a fast talker, but decided to give him my business because he is a fellow veteran, and he needs the work. No biggie, I’m happy to help someone in a tight spot. Rudy explained that the job would be easy as there is no tear up (of existing concrete), and he would “take care of [me]” by pouring it 6 inches thick, and giving me wire mesh which came with a 2 year warranty. He says he’ll get his Bobcat out here, and it’ll go by real quick. I agree, so he sends me a contract, and asks for $2050 up front for materials, along with some photos of work that he’s done. I know you know where this is going, hang tight.    I signed the contract and sent the money. Let’s go over the contract. What I linked is exactly what he sent. An MS Word, piece of hot garbage. They spelled my name wrong, spelled his name wrong, so I kicked it back and they fixed it, no biggie. Shortly after, he emailed me my receipt. He then calls me back and says that he needs $25 more to cover the credit card charges, fuck it, I’m excited to get a new driveway, so I agree (I know, just hush).     The next day (13JUL2017), Rudy and his crew are out at my house at 9 am sharp. There’s a cranky old guy who’s got something like 50 years in the business, and two Mexicans who speak like 3 words of English. Everyone was cool, the Mexican guys were like a slapstick duo, talking shit to one another, and the old guy constantly bitching about them under his breath. I eventually brought out coffee, ice water, and oranges because when I used to do construction (pool enclosures), it was nice to do work for a homeowner who cared. I quickly noticed there was a lack of aforementioned Bobcat, so no dirt was getting dug, and Hose A and Hose B (that’s how cranky old man introduced them) were filling up a cracked and warped Rubbermaid tub full of dirt and sliding it back and forth between the side of the house and filling in the driveway. Again, me being an understanding person, I assumed that Rudy had his Bobcat out at another project (which I was correct), so I allowed his crew to use all my tools and wheelbarrow to make things go faster. I didn’t mind because I knew forming wasn’t going to take all day, and they’d be done in a few hours.    About that time I notice cranky old guy laying down 2x4s. I walked up to him and asked him how thick the concrete was going to be. He said 4 inches. I said no, I signed a contract for 6 inches, and showed him. He said I’d have to talk to Rudy, because he wasn’t sure. So Rudy pulls up about 15 minutes later, and I ask him again about the thickness. He reassured me that the concrete would indeed be 6 inches thick, to not worry, because when it’s poured, it’ll “SINK DOWN”, and it’ll be 6 inches when he’s done. So I kept it in the back of my head, because it sounded like some cock and balls bullshit. Around 2 pm, the crew finishes forming up and Rudy walks up to me. He explains that, since the side of the house didn’t have any gravel like the front, it’s going to cost a little extra because he’s going to need more concrete, because it’s going to sink deeper into the soft ground back there. Ok, that one really threw up some red flags. That’s twice he’s asked for more money. I told him I would talk it over with the wife. What I really did was call around to about 5 different concrete companies. Each and every single one of them confirmed what I knew deep down inside: the guy is a scam artist, he’s taking me for my money, concrete sets at the thickness in which you pour it (i.e. it doesn’t sink), and that a contract is a contract, and I am not obligated to pay more than what I signed for.    So embarrassed and downright ashamed of myself, I go online to see what can be done legally with people like him. I click on an Angie’s List article dealing with concrete repair scams, and LOW AND FUCKING BEHOLD, there is the exact same picture headlining the article that he sent to me, which he claimed was a previous project of his. Now I’m really pissed. I look back over the photos and my receipts, and wouldn’t you know it, at the bottom of the receipt is where he forged my signature. It’s so blatantly obvious that it was forged, it’s down right insulting.    Here’s my conundrum: I’m no attorney, but I believe technically he hasn’t broken the contract yet because the concrete isn’t poured. It’s just 2x4s outlining the driveway. So I don’t think I have any ground to stand on by demanding my money back, do I? Either I want a complete refund, or I (reluctantly) want him to do the job that I paid him to do. I’m planning on calling him first thing tomorrow morning and recording the conversation. I called the bank, and they said they can open a dispute and refund me my money, but the ultimate decision would be left to the case manager as to whether or not I’m in the right (seeing as how I willingly agreed to give this person my money).  Before he left, Rudy asked if he could finish the job on Monday because he had to go to Miami for the weekend, and couldn’t coordinate the cement trucks until late Friday night. So I said yes, that’s not a problem. He also asked me to call him later that night to let him know about the extra charges, and what I wanted to do. So I called twice and no answer.   What are my options?    [The Contract] (http://imgur.com/a/FPP5O)	Yes
95	Back in March, T-Mobile had a promotion where you could add another line to your account completely for free. Naturally, I got on it along with my mom, to be added to my sister's account.   Before this, I had an iPhone 5S, and my mom had a flip phone from TracFone. When we switched to T-Mobile, I received an SE and gave my 5S to my mom. We also got new SIM cards. My mom's number changed back in almost minutes, but my number didn't change. It turned into days, weeks, and now months.   We've tried everything to get my original number back, but it seems that either TracFone or T-Mobile is just refusing. Is there any legal action I can take to demand they give me back my number?	Yes
96	I'm more curious than looking to aid in their dispute. The total of the reversed charges hits around $8,500. He's apparently claimed to two of them that his PayPal was hacked and someone stole over $100k from him, but went silent soon after that and has now deleted his Facebook account. PayPal seems to be working with my members, but they're claiming that even if they get their money back, they want to see charges filed. I can't say I disagree with them, someone like that should feel some kind of repercussions.	Yes
97	"Hi,   I attempted suicide last year (stemming from an abuse relationship) and had a lengthy hospital stay that was covered at around 90% by my insurance company (Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan). I have since gotten psychiatric help and I'm doing quite well.   I have been receiving ""subrogation"" forms in the mail from my insurance company and I haven't filled them out. Today I noticed they do say that they are mandatory. I'm wondering if I complete it honestly and say that my hospitalization was ""not due to an accident"" as the question asks, will I be responsible for any of the hospital bills that BCBS paid?  It would financially ruin me (even what I did pay affected me substantially) and so I'm very concerned about this. Any advice would be appreciated. I am located in Illinois (and all of this occurred in Illinois) but my insurance company is located in Michigan if that matters."	Yes
98	We are a business in Idaho and had a customer from Utah call to purchase a $2,000 computer system from us. We had to have the item shipped next day air via UPS to them and they made a payment via Visa credit card over the phone.   About 2 months later we received a call from a lady asking us why we  charged her card for $2,200 and we explained the situation. Today, about 2 weeks after the phone call from the lady, we noticed that Visa had pulled back the funds and when we called they explained that it was because the purchase was fraudulent.  Are we really on the hook, because either Visa, or that lady's secitlrity was bad? What do we do in this situation?	Yes
99	So I purchased a monitor in January and never opened it till this week since I was so busy with looking for a job, family members getting married and graduating. Online they advertised that the monitor is 60HZ but when i was calibrating my monitor it said that it was 50HZ.  Im not looking to sue. I just want a simple refund so i can buy another one.	Yes
100	Hi Reddit Law,  My dad is a contractor and recently finished tile work on a new house. The owner did not want to pay the balance and my father threatened to break the tiles throughout the house with a hammer. My gut is that this isn't legal but I'm not really sure, it is his tiles and setting materials after all and this guy hasn't paid.	Yes
101	I am looking for advice on how to proceed with my outstanding debts from the last decade or so, and have not found a good place to get advice so figured I would try here since Credit Counselors only want to run your credit report and clean that up for you...my questions go back further than that.  So, I have been on the run from my debts for about 10 years.  Most of my debt has fallen off of my credit report, but I have a lot of money (for me...I would guess about $15-20K) still owed on these accounts that are no longer on my credit report and sold to various collection agencies.  I have moved multiple times and avoided requesting credit unless absolutely necessary (utilities, etc) to try and fall off the collection radar.  I never intended on getting credit again or buying a house, was young, and needless to say lacking foresight.  Now, it's 10 years since I ran from my debt, I have been married a few years to a woman who had a mortgage already.  We applied for a credit card 3 years ago and got approved.  It makes me nervous to have credit, and we have already managed to get ourselves into 4k worth of debt in just a few years.  We collectively also owe about 3K to the IRS we are paying off in installments as a result of our witholding being wrong for a few years but not being able to afford to correct the error.  We are no longer being undertaxed so we should work out closer to 0 this year and not go further into debt to the IRS.  My wife would like to look at selling our house and moving closer to work, but we don't qualify for good interest rates unless my income is included, but I have dings on my credit report and I don't end up helping.  I am nervous because I feel once I get assets on paper, someone might get the idea to accumulate my debt and sue me for the full amount once I have something worth taking like a house.  As of now, the house is in my wife's name.  Bottom line, what is my recourse for these old debts?  How should I go about getting them taken care of?  Is bankruptcy an option, can I do it individually, or would I take my wife down with me?  Credit counseling only wants to talk about what's on my credit report and can't answer anything about these old debts, and I would like to find out how these old demons will affect my future.    Any advice anyone has for me would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
102	"I'll summarize what had happened:  I was driving up to an onramp, and traffic was moving up when the car in front of me slammed on their brakes and I slammed on mine but my car still hit their back bumper. The person behind me had a lot of distance from me, and his car was unaffected but I immediately notice him running to the car in front of me. They spoke a foreign language to one another for a while before I could get their information. When I asked the young driver what had happened, for their side of the incident and why they slammed on their brakes, they said I hit them and caused them to hit another car in front of them. Moments later, the ""witness"" turned out to be the front (car that my car hit)  drivers father. This was my first accident, and I drive on this street/onramp daily for work, it seemed extremely fishy to me that he waited until we parted to mention that was his daughter and he was following her. I sustained a neck injury, and leg injury from the accident, and the others said they're fine with no injuries. I was already on the phone with my insurance when I asked them if they had any injuries. Their insurance card stated it expired back in February.     Should I report this to my insurance or have them investigate?"	Yes
103	"I bought a gun online via an auction. The auction's title, picture and description were for the ""middle model"" of this particular gun style. I was shipped the baseline model, and accepted it at my gun store (called an FFL, you must go to one of these to pick up a gun). This store charges $30 to do all the paperwork so that I could receive the gun (such as a background check). This is great, and completely fair.   When I got home i noticed the gun was not the advertised model. There are very minor differences on the outside of the gun, you would have to break in down and look at the internals to notice the differences. It was like I ordered a V8 mistang, but was shipped a V6, and I had to pay $30 to drive it off the lot.   The shipping store is willing to pay for the gun to be returned, but is not paying the $30 transfer fee I paid to my local gun store. I asked they do pay for it, because it was their mistake they listed the wrong item. The owner confirmed it was their fault that the advertisement was wrong.   Im considering canceling the charge, and telling them to come pick up the gun whenever they want (it is a 2 hour drive for them). Unless they decide to pay back that $30 in addition to the price of the gun.  Basically, I lost money because of their mistake. And they expect me to go out of my way to ship a gun back to them, which I have not done and is probably a little tough to do.   They have also tied up ~$450 of my money due to this. Should I just cancel the charge because I didnt get what I ordered, and make them come get it?"	Yes
104	This is post ended up having quite a few questions but they're all  in regards to money.  I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ?   My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?  This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.  Please help me, I want to live my life on my own as soon as I can, I don't live with physical abuse or anything too bad but there is some problems and it's just one of those homes where you don't want to stick around past your due.  The day I turn 18 is going to be a great day and I want to get an idea of what I have to do.  I appreciate anything you can help me with even if it's only one thing, thank you in advance to/if anyone that can help.	Yes
105	Throw away account used as precautionary measure.  **Short version**  Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.  **Long version**  My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have.   Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.  When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.  There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.  The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.  The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.  This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.  I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.  Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.  Any thoughts are appreciated.	Yes
106	"Hi there, my friend recently purchased ""African Black Soap"" from Shea Butter. She followed the directions for using the soap and it caused her to have chemical burns. She has been treated by a doctor who indeed said they are chemical burns. The ingredients seem to be a lie as well. Is there a lawsuit here? If so what is it?"	Yes
107	Hello,  First time on this thread so please bear with me! First of all, thank you to everyone for taking the time to read my post.  I owe someone money (less than 9K) and signed a promissory note that I will pay the person $400 a month until the debt is paid. Recently, he told me that he was updating the addresses on the note and would like me to sign the note again with the updated addresses. This is fine, and I would read over it carefully to make sure nothing is amiss. What kind of irks me was that he wanted a photo copy of my ID, a billing statement/utility bill showing my address.  Am I legally obligated to hand over this information to this person? Thank you again for reading through this post!  **TL;DR: Person I owe money to wants a photocopy of my ID and billing statement/utility bill. Unsure if I'm obligated to give this information to him.**	Yes
108	My dad was supposed to pick up the car from long term airport parking because I couldn't find a ride. He was just gonna snag it from the lot the next day or later that very day. Through one reason or another he didn't, and it had been there accumulating 13 a day for 8 days. I went to get it when I came back from my trip, livid that I now have to charge money on my card that I don't have at this very moment. So how do I get it out? Well I rode the ass of the guy in front of me and I drove out with him. I can pay tomorrow but like idk if I'm gonna have like some sort of warrant out for me or something. I know this is such a small thing but i am 19 years old and do not want to have to deal with this as some sort of ticket or anything. Do I call the airport? What should I do?	Yes
109	"Hey, r/legaladvice. First time posting here, thanks in advance for responses and sorry in advance if I'm breaking rules.   My problem is outlined below. My question really boils down to, what can I do about this?  Begin  *****  A couple of my friends have birthdays around the same time and decided that, to celebrate, we should get a group together and go on a sweet looking 90s booze cruise. Tickets were ~$65 and about 15 of us bought ticket, likely in addition to others. I will call the event company that was putting on the cruise EC for short and anonymity. EC sold the tickets through a separate company I will call TC for ticket company. The cruise was scheduled for the night of May 19th, and we bought tickets at least a week in advance. I personally bought 2 tickets.  The day of May 19th comes. It is hours before the planned starting time of the cruise, and I receive the following e-mail from TC on behalf of EC:  &gt; San Diego, &gt; &gt;We are having to postpone tonight's event due to a cancellation of the artist we had planned for you all tonight. we are sorry for the inconvenience. The new date will be on Saturday, July 29. Everyone's tickets for todays event will give you entry to July's event. If you have any questions or concerns or want to inquire about a refund then please contact us at [e-mail address for EC] &gt; &gt;Thank You  I immediately requested a refund, as did many of my friends. On May 21st, I received the following message (again from TC on behalf of 90s EC):  &gt;San Diego, &gt; &gt;People who requested refunds we have received your emails and please allow 5-7 business days to see it back in your account. &gt; &gt;Cheers!  I never got the refund, and most of my friends did not (though one did, strangely). On June 15th I contacted TC support saying:  &gt;Hello, &gt; &gt;I purchased tickets to the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for Friday, May 19th 2017. The day of the event of the cruise an e-mail was sent out informing me and the other customers the cruise was cancelled due to an artist cancellation and will be rescheduled. I requested a refund and was told via a mass e-mail that all refunds would be credited with 5-7 business days. It has been much longer than this time and a refund has not been credited. Friends of mine corroborate this. &gt; &gt;Promptly refund all tickets. Personally, I purchased two and should see a refund in the amount of $131.66 &gt; &gt;[My Name]  TC responded saying:  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;Thanks for reaching out. &gt; &gt;Funds from ticket sales are held for 48 hours after the end of an event to allow time for buyers to dispute the charges. After 48 hours, the funds are paid out to the organizer and any refund requests must be processed by them outside of Universe. Although the organizers seem to have promised refunds, they did not issue those refunds at that time, nor did they reach out to us to issue them on their behalf. &gt; &gt;We have reached out to the organizers of this event to attempt to come to a reasonable solution to issue refunds on the event that was re-scheduled, however, they have not cooperated. Unfortunately as Universe no longer holds the funds for this event, all refund requests must be directed to the organizers of the event who can issue refunds at their discretion. They can be reached at [EC email address] &gt; &gt;We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. &gt; &gt;Cheers, &gt;[EC name] Support  I responded to Universe saying:  &gt;Thank you for the info. Can you please send more contact info for the event managers? Phone number, company name, persons involved, etc.?  I also forwarded my exchange with TC to the contact email for EC and said the following, which they did not respond to:  &gt;Hi [EC name], &gt; &gt;Please see the message below regarding the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for, and canceled, last May. (Insert exchange with TC here) &gt; &gt;I am wondering why refunds have not been credited as promised? Please refund the tickets. &gt; &gt;Thank you,  I then sent TC this email before receiving a reply from my previous e mail:  &gt;Additionally, your service rules make the following points that sellers cannot (taken verbatim from contract on TC website): &gt; &gt;(7) offer, as a Seller, any items that you do not yourself own or have permission to rent (without limiting the foregoing, you will not list items as a Seller if you are serving in the capacity of a broker, rental agent or listing agent for a third party); &gt; &gt;(10) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with any person or entity; &gt; &gt;(13) as a Seller, submit any Listing with a false or misleading price information, or submit any Listing with a price, service or activity that you do not intend to honor. &gt; &gt;These terms are in question of being violated based on the way 90s booze cruise handled the event. There is no evidence they had owned or had permission to rent the service they offered. The fact that they canceled the event hours before the time is highly suspicious and suggestive that they never intended to honor their service. If either of the above is true, it follows that they misrepresented themselves and their affiliation with artists and vendors. &gt; &gt;I trust there will be proper due diligence with regards to these potential breaches of contract and that appropriate legal action will be taken if necessary. &gt; &gt;Please inform me how you plan to proceed.  I received no reply to this as well.  I disputed my charge for the tickets through my credit card and was promptly refunded. While my desire for justice was left unserved, and some of my friends never got their money back, I got my mine back and decided to put the matter to rest. However, I was surprised to get the following e-mail from TC this morning (July 17):  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;We are writing regarding the dispute for $130.00 USD charge to your card ending in XXXX on Monday, July 17, 2017. &gt; &gt;The charge was for 2 tickets to the 90s Booze Cruise- San Diego event. &gt; &gt;The organizer of this event, EC, uses TC to sell their tickets. The event took place on Friday, May 19, 2017. We have attached your tickets and receipt here. &gt; &gt;Please call the number on the back of your card to let your bank know that you understand what this charge is for and reply to let us know when you have done so. &gt; &gt;Best Regards, &gt; &gt;TC Support  I responded with the following lengthy message. My response includes a consolidation of all the communication between myself and Universe, so I have not included that since it has already been posted above. My response:  &gt;Dear TC, &gt; &gt;You are mistaken. &gt; &gt;This event did **not** take place on May 19, 2017. This event was **planned** for that day, however, it was canceled only hours before it was **planned** to start. &gt; &gt;*(Here I copy and paste the messages from Universe regarding the event being cancelled and then the promise to refund tickets).* &gt; &gt;I never received the promised refund, so I followed up with TC support to obtain it as it was promised. This exchange between myself and Universe can be summarized as follows: &gt; &gt;*I asked TC for a refund due to the cancellation and unfulfilled promise for a refund; &gt;*I was told funds were released to 90sbooze cruise and I had to ask them directly; &gt;*I attempted to contact EC and received no reply; &gt;*I provided evidence to TC that EC breached their contract with Universe on multiple grounds and *requested legal action be taken to hold them accountable for what appears to be a scam. This final request received no response from Universe. &gt; &gt;**Here is the full exchange** *(copy/paste of full exchange between myself and TC here)* &gt; &gt;**(end exchange)** &gt; &gt;Now that I have cleared up the apparent lack of communication between departments in your company, I'm sure you understand why I disputed the charge and that I will not be calling my bank. I have already explained to them this situation and they readily agreed to reverse the charge, standard practice when a purchased service has been grossly misrepresented and not rendered.  &gt; &gt;So rather than *me* call *my* bank and explain what the charge is for (I know what the charge is for better than you do, apparently), I suggest *you* call 90s booze cruise and explain to them that the contract they signed with *you* has been violated and that they need to issue refunds to **everyone** who asked for one. If they don't, then *you* should contact your lawyer (or acquire one if you do not have one) since your contract has been broken.   As all evidence points to this ""event"" being a pre-conceived scam, taking the above actions will show that you are not a co-conspirator with 90s booze cruise in what amounts to false marketing and, quite frankly, stealing. Failing to take action (as you did on my last request) shows you are either woefully incompetent, unfortunately apathetic, or outright criminal.   Please take action as I've outlined above, **and reply to let us (us being myself and all other ticket purchases) when you have done so.**  **Best regards,** --  [My Name]  **P.S. Can you confirm that the event has been successfully rescheduled for Saturday, July 29th? If so, please send me all relevant event info.**  **P.P.S. To remedy the lack of communication between departments of your company, might I recommend slack messaging?**   *****  As of now I am awaiting a reply though I expect there will be none. Can anything be done about this? Part of the issue, I believe, is 90s booze cruise is shrouded in mystery. All I have is the e-mail address provided through Universe. I do not know where they are based (I think NY) or have any real contact information, nor, can I connect an actual human to the company. I suspect this is on purpose. It does appear they have advertised this event elsewhere. I am not sure if they followed through with it in these other locations or if it is a systematic scam in multiple locales.   *edit: concealed identifying information and formatting*"	Yes
110	Hi, I'm a person living in Washington state.  Yesterday, my friends and I went out to a club for my birthday, but the bouncer decided that the image on the I.D. did not look like me and confiscated it away from me (best birthday ever). They have refused to give it back until I call the cops, but I did not call the cops because I felt that this would be a larceny and that there would be more I could do about this situation.  Is it legal for clubs to confiscate a valid I.D.? and if not, what can I do about it?  Thank you so much for your help in advance.	Yes
111	We have a month to month lease and our landlord decided he wanted to go to student housing. So he notified us that we have till Aug 1st to leave (This was on July 2). Now we are moving out the 14th and have notified him via text that we are leaving. I also asked since we already paid rent for the whole month could we get back the money for the days we wont be living here plus security deposit (The place is in great shape no damage or anything).  He has not contacted me since I notified him of us moving out and asking for the money. My question is are we entitled to the money covering days we won't be living here? From my understanding from the day we leave till 30 days after, he has to give us a written review of the property and security deposit.   He has done this all though text also nothing written.	Yes
112	So here's the deal, I was dead set on going to an event in the UK at the end of July, now I can't go for several reasons, both economical as well as the fact that I'll be going to a marriage.   I haven't ordered a flight yet, but I did book and pay for a hotel months ago and it was non-refundable, I'm not sure whether or not I should reach out to the hotel and ask for a refund since it's still weeks left and last year, all hotels were pretty much booked full and they can probably still get it back, but in case of a policy against such things, am I doing anything legally wrong if I were to do a chargeback via the bank? The card I paid with isn't eligible any longer also.	Yes
113	"So this goes all the way back to December 2016.  I went through a Delaware toll, like so many others on my multiple trips up north.  My EZ-Pass transponder supposedly never paid Delaware DOT and they sent out two notices for a $4 toll.  I never got either of them.  Fast forward to August 2017 and I get a text from my ex-wife with a picture of a collections notice, to her and her alone, with her parents address and my last name.  The car was originally in her name first (mine second), but I had switched it after we separated in early 2015.    The notice says that I have 30 days to pay or dispute by mail, already 2 weeks into the deadline.  I go to my EZ-Pass account and I see that the date, time, and lane match up with what was claimed to be unpaid.  $4 was taken out to go to Delaware DOT.  I send in the collections paperwork with the EZ-Pass statement, as instructed.  I even circled and highlighted the transaction, to no avail.  They ""never got"" the paperwork and now it is past the time to dispute.  $4 is now $66.50.    I called both Delaware DOT and the collections agency (Professional Account Management, LLC) but no luck there either.  I can easily pay the fine, but I am a man of principal and hate giving into shitty behavior, especially from predatory companies like this.    TL;DR: I didn't ""dispute"" a non-existent debt, which now has a 1562.5% increase over the original ""debt"".  Can they legally collect on this?  How do I fight it to get it off my ex's credit so we can go back to not talking to each other?"	Yes
114	"Bought a car ""As is"" from dealer. Had a mechanic give it a quick inspection for $45. He did little more than give it a visual inspection. Paid cash $3,700. Agreed to pay another $400 for cost of registration and title transfer. Written in contract as ""Title Fee"". Seller still has title and spare key. Seller said it would be slightly cheaper if I took the car for a Vehicle Inspection. He said if he did it, it would be more expensive but he wouldn't need the car to acquire a Vehicle Inspection Report. A day after purchase: Car showed catalytic converter and hybrid battery problems. I am unsure of specific faults but I don't think it would pass an inspection: Specifically the emissions test. I am unsure of what to do, advice would be very welcome. The best course of action I think I have is to pay the dealer the remaining $400 for the registration. Either he would have to fix the car to pass the VIR, commit fraud by obtaining a fake VIR, or already have a VIR that is still valid (Within the last ninety days)."	Yes
115	"Hello,    We just received a certified letter from our rental company stating that our payment was ""dishonored by [my] financial institution."" They are now demanding an additional ~$150 in fees. When we called the number on the letter, we were prompted to leave a voicemail. I left my details along with the confirmation number we had received with the payment confirmation email. We then contacted the customer service for the rental company and the rep stated that it had been denied for ""insufficient funds"" while the website states it was denied for ""closed account.""     1) I have $800 in privilege pay, so if I hadn't had the funds (I did), my checking account would have gone negative to pay the rent.    2) The website deleted our saved account information so I cannot even verify the account number I used to make the transaction. All I have is the last 4 of my account number per the confirmation email, which I verified is correct.    3) The letter demands these fees be paid within 12 days or we will be taken to court. While we can pay these fees, this is not our error as we had the confirmation email stating the payment was made.     4) My checking account does NOT reflect that any attempt to retrieve the funds was made, however. I called to confirm this and the rental company didn't pull out any money. The funds are still sitting there.      5) No one called us to state there was an issue with the payment. We assumed all was well as we had the confirmation email and figured it would take the typical 3-4 business days. I reasoned that with the holiday last week, things would be delayed a bit.    6) We used my checking account for the first time instead of my fiancé's (his has never had any issue before). This is the only difference, but it still made us input the account number twice and routing number once when we entered the information initially.       Questions I have: Are we responsible for these fees? Does it seems suspicious to anyone else that both of our saved bank accounts were deleted from the system so we cannot even confirm the account number from which funds were supposed to be drawn out from? We have not been able to get in contact with the woman who issued the letter (from the collections department), and the customer service line was of no help."	Yes
116	Hi all,  Hoping someone with knowledge of Taiwanese finance can chime in.  I was born in Taiwan and when I was young my mother bought me some sort of fund - she told me recently that it has grown massively.  However, I moved here when I was very young and have since become a US citizen. I'll be returning to Taiwan next year for an internship and while I was there I wanted to move the money to the US so I could more easily access the funds.   The thing is, since I've turned 18, the my mother could no longer access the money, only I can. Since I've moved, I've changed my last name (technical adoption) and am not sure how to prove to them that I am in fact me.  How do I go about doing that? Will there be any taxes involved in liquidating about 200 K in assets? How do I transfer that money to the US? Should I have a lawyer assist me while I am there? I don't speak mandarin very well and cannot write even my name.  Thank you, Reddit!	Yes
117	Hello everyone! Recently, i have decided to take a trip to India to visit my friend and of course, i need a visa. That friend of mine sent me a link on phone but i got to the wrong site by mistake when i used my laptop; it is called etavisaonline.in Later, I had my friend paid the fee, which was €99 and waited for 3 days as it said. After the third day, i received no reply and the application id they gave me turned out to be invalid as i checked it on the site of the gov. I've realised my stupidity and applied on the right web this time, got my visa for nearly half of the price.  Now i'm scared that we have paid a fraudulent source and what frightens me more is the safety of my friend's information as he used a visa debit card. I'm sincerely asking for advice since i dont know what to do now. Pls help. Thank you guys so so much	Yes
118	My AC was running terribly, and had a repair guy come out and do a diagnostic. He said that it needs to be replaced as it is going on 15+ years and it keeps overheating and shutting off and then starting back up again, which is why it is not cooling enough. I called my warranty people and they said they will send out a tech within 24-48 hours. I call the place they referred a few hours later as they said they would contact me but never did and they were closed for the weekend.  After this I called the warranty company again and they found a tech that was 24/7. I got in contact with that guy and he told me he would be out in 1-2 hours. 3 hours later I called again and he is not answering his phone. It is now the next day and he is still not answering his phone. After calling the warranty company again they said there is nothing they can do.  Is this a complete breach of contract and can I just get my own replacement and bill the warranty company at this point?	Yes

120	I am planning to donate to the Salvation Army and the items amount to less than 5000 dollars in valuation . I am relocating to Asia and selling my apartment unit in California. Am I able to use these donations (goig to made this year) towards tax write offs from the money I recieve from selling my apartment? Does the money I make from the sale count as income tax? Thank you in advance	Yes
121	I bought a new car a couple of weeks ago and and finance guys says your scheduled maintenance will cost x amount if you pay out of pocket and this will save you money buy it now... turns out its not the great deal it was supposed to be and I went back to cancel, talked of a different person to cancel and she says oh we have a policy that we wont cancel in the first 3 months because we get charged back... now the paper work i have says i can cancel at anytime and in the first 30 days it is a 100% reimbursement and 30 to 60 days it is 100% less a 50 dollar fee. The lady kept says oh it our policy not to for 90 days and i said but i have a legal document that says i can right now. there was no mention of their policy when they were bought and i see no mention of their policy in the paperwork... I think they are just full of it and don't want me to cancel	Yes
122	Hello all,  A little back story, my grandfather purchased a car for me in his name... I made the payments, it was insured in my name ETC.  He died last November, and my mother never had took any of the paperwork down to the bank after he died.. Fast forward to last Wednesday i went and made my payment like normal, except later that evening there was a tow truck outside of my house towing my car...  The tow truck driver said that they had been looking for the car for months etc..   What should i do? I have been told that we are able to sue BB&amp;T because they shouldn't have been taking payment for the car once it was out for repo, I am only looking to be able to finish paying for the car as there is less than 2k owed on the car....   Thanks in advance!	Yes
123	"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	Yes
124	"So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit. So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help.."	Yes
125	So I recently purchased a mobile home. I confirmed with the owners of the park that it could stay there.  Well after paying the application fee (which is still pending) I was told I was denied and had two days to move the home or they'll tow it and charge me, unless I pay them $1500 (which so happens to be the previous owners past due amount)   They also went on to say I was denied due to the previous owner. I've never met the woman before buying the house.  Is this legal, what can I do?   I have a gut feeling they're going to tow the house away regardless if I pay them.   The lot manager even went on to say that I couldn't afford the $1500 and that even if I do pay it I'll most likely be evicted anyways	Yes
126	Hey everyone so I was at staples baught a laptop opened up their credit card and put it on there financed it for 6 months a month later i check my statement on that credit card and the laptop didnt show up on it, about 2 weeks later rep from staples calls me and said an error happened in the transaction and that they need me to come in the store with the credit card to charge me. My question is are they allowed to do that? am I legally obliged to go in and have them charge or cause they missed the transaction at the point of sale means i get the laptop for free because i think that if they cant charge it to me automatically then that means they are basically just taking a shot to see if i am gullible enough to come into the store and have them charge me cause they dont have the right to charge me now. also this is in Canada Ontario.	Yes

128	I joined a gym, which oddly didn't make me sign a contract. It has been month to month, with credit card on file getting charged automatically every 1st day of the month. I decided not to go to this gym anymore and cancelled the credit card they had on file. Now, two months after I stopped going to this gym, they are trying to get me to pay for the two missed months. They say that the rules are laid out on their website that you must cancel in writing by the 15th of the month for changes to the next month. Can they actually charge me based on something their website says even though I didn't sign anything?	Yes
129	Hi, I'm 17m working at a fast food chain in CT. My boss is taking hours from myself and the other workers. He's done this before, I had my hours written down and he told me that I changed them to give me more hours. Last time he did this, he shorted me by about 14 hours. Well now I have my printed receipts for the hours that I worked. He told one of my co workers that the hours I stayed late with her, because it was busy, I won't get paid for.(to clarify this is maybe an hour once or twice a week) I get paid on Tuesday.  My questions are, if my hours don't match up, what should I do to get them back? Can I sue him over this? What about my co workers, they don't have any evidence that they worked more than he has said, can they get any hours back?	Yes
130	"I should add that this isn't me, but there is debate about it in another subreddit.      Basically Nate and Smitty employees at a large company (company x) won a tournament in their company - sponsored by another company (company b). They got to play in the poker main event ($10,000 buy-in). The only contract that was between the two companies seems to be an e-mail which basically says, ""50 percent of the winnings go to company b, and 'they' get to keep the other 50 percent."" Apparently in the e-mail the 'they' is referred to as the people playing in the tournament for the duration of the e-mail.      The person playing the poker believes the 50 percent 'they' get to keep is his to personally keep, meanwhile company a believes they get to split the winnings amongst the company. Can anyone give any insight? Thanks!"	Yes
131	LOCATION: WEST VIRGINIA  So this contractor builds me a deck with a simple shed roof over part of it. This was completed in February. Everything looked fine. I paid him and we were happy.  Then the first big rain of the season comes and the roof leaked horribly. Multiple spots, dripping, pouring in other places.  I contacted him and he came back out, looked at it, and applied a fix to the roof. This was done at no cost to me (as I expected it to be).  During the next rain, the roof still leaked albeit less than it did before, but still, I had drips on both sides of the door leading to the deck and soaking spots in a few places.  I contacted him about that and I was told I should contact a roofer to get it repaired.  This is where the problems started. I told him that his company built the roof and I expect his company to take care of it. He told me he would get someone he knew from a local roofing company to come out and assess it.  I have no proof that this ever occurred only his word.  Another month passes.  I contact him almost every week to ask where we are on this.  Finally, he tells me the roofer has come out and looked at the roof and knows what to do to fix it.  Great! Then nothing.  Another month passes.  I contact him and now they are waiting for a cost of materials, etc. He says he hasn't forgotten about me and he was waiting for responses from a 3rd party roofer.  Another month passes.  I sent him a message last week. It goes unanswered. I sent him a message this morning and so far nothing.  I am considering taking him to court over this, but I don't know if that's the correct thing to do. I have all my texts to him, I have all the pictures I've taken of the leaks.  I just want a roof that doesn't leak and I feel it's his responsibility to fix it. I also feel like I shouldn't be charged for anything in this matter. And as far as the contract goes, he brought it up a few times saying this is out of scope of the contract and I disagree. I feel that a working roof is very much in scope of the contract and since this roof doesn't work then does that constitute a breach?   Am I screwed because we paid him in full when the work was done? If it didn't rains as much as it did, we wouldn't have even known there was a problem.  What I am seeking by taking him to court is either money so I can find someone else to fix his faulty roof or a court order telling him he has x amount of time to fix it and fix it right or he will also have to pay me money to get it fixed.  What are my options?	Yes
132	When i started, and was attending university, my father never let me see any of the paper work, i was there on grants, which covered my tuition (and according to my father, my housing as well) i was never given any information regarding my finances regarding my time there, all of it was sent to his email, this went on for four years, i asked pretty regularly to see the paper work (student emails saying forms were due when i asked generally FAFSA and what have you) during my last semester i received an email saying i needed to take an online loan repayment course (this came from the school to my student email) so i went to the studentloan.gov site only to find i had an account byt could not sign in, upon further investigation i found my father had made the account and the emails from the sites routed to his email. I asked him about this many times and he delflected the question and blame. Later that year my older sister who had graduated was informed she had students loans taken out during her time (mind younshe was on the same set of grants as i) so i decided to dig around in my student information from my school, low and behold over 35k in student loans i never knew about. Or signed for.    Is there legal action i can take to help this at all? I the only reason i went to college to begin with was because I was told my grants/scholarship paid for everything.  Important note, my father has also commited various amounts of identity theft on myself, my mother and my sisters. Going so far as to take all the equity out of the house i grew up in and lose the house.  Tldr version: My father signed papers with my name agreeing to accept government loans to pay for housing in college and kept me in the dark about it.  Please help, im not a savant on this kind of thing and need advice.	Yes
133	Hi so my mom has an interview with TD bank Wednesday regarding a $600 fee on her line of credit because it was increased without her knowing. I'm wondering what she should say for them to remove the fee from her account. I believe this happened a while ago and she has just noticed now. She states TD told her line of credit has been increased to $200000 and she has to pay $600 for having this. She said she never made the increase. Any help is obviously appreciated as we gave until Wednesday for clarification as TD isn't helping her worth shit. Hoping I can get something here :) thx	Yes
134	"Ok so I have been dealing with this for a week now, and things have gone nowhere. I took my car to get it air wrapped by a gentleman who had advertised on Facebook. I picked the color, dropped off the car, and waited to see how awesome my new look would be. Things started going wrong when he sent a picture and I noticed a slight discoloration. He didn't say anything about it, so I said something, and sure enough, he messed up. So thugs aren't great because we had agreed to pick up the car that Tuesday and now it is taking longer. So I pick out the new color (since he said the original was too hard) and he got to work. Well so I thought. He didn't change out the masking, and ended up ordering the wrong color without telling me (he later told me when I asked that he had tried it and it didn't work, then told me the truth that they just didn't have it in stock). So I didn't say anything other than asking why it was different. So I go to pick it up and I first see some errors. Nothing big, and stuff he said he could fix. He was in a rush, so I paid him contingent on him fixing it. Well when I get home and have a good hour to look at it, I start noticing how poorly it was done. He also had bent trim pieces, damaged the interior door handle, and got overspray all throughout the car. I approached him and asked him to explain. He said it was normal so I asked several installers who were out of state. I have over 4 people telling me it was not done right. He said he messed up on the phone, but couldn't give a refund. So I offered a payment plan. Well now he says he spoke with a lawyer and the lawyer said since the paper didn't say it was a contract it technically isn't one. I'll attach some pictures, but I'm curious if I have a case with this or if I should cut my losses.   Forgot to add, he also removed the first covering with a large ring on (posted a video after I got the car). And I'm worried I'll find scratches underneath. Would he be liable since it was negligent to have a ring so close to car paint? Thanks!'   Edit: added pictures with picture of ""paper"" I signed.   Edit two. Didn't post the cropped picture. Will reupload"	Yes
135	A few weeks ago I bought something online.  The seller hasn't shipped and refuses to refund.  It it extortion if I tell the seller I will call my bank and do a chargeback if they don't ship or refund by a specific date and time?	Yes
136	I'm 21 years old and I'm in the process of starting up a online retail company.  After searching online I found a website design and hosting company. Requested a call and the sales person I spoke to gave a good sales pitch and I was eager to go ahead.  I described the website I wanted at length and he said that this would not be an issue and stated that £4,500 would be sufficient and this is their 'silver design package'. After some deliberating and further discussion with him I went ahead and paid for the first of three installments. They sent me a design brief to fill in for them to be able to start designing the website. NOTE: I did not fill in this design brief, so no designs will have been carried out and nothing has been done by them apart from set up an account for me on their site.  I was struggling with the terminology of the form as relatively new to website design so called their support desk, and at first had to wait 7 days to talk to some. When they got around to phoning me there were several language barriers as English was not their first language. So I went away from, losing some confidence in the overall process.  I was then contacted by the salesman saying that after a further review of my website functionalities the design cost would actually be around £10,000.  Basically to summarise, I dealt with their technical team a few more times and each time left me feeling less and less confident in their abilities so I sent an email to the original salesman asking for a refund, but hinting that I would be back, but that I need the money for another venture and that the website would have to take a back seat, but when I did come back I would upgrade the package. Hoping that this would act as an incentive for them to refund me.  I received a reply stating that after speaking to the managers they would like me to comply with the terms and conditions and pay the additional £3,000. So initially this completely took me off guard, as I did tick the terms and conditions and I thought I would have to pay. After rereading the t&amp;cs, nowhere does it state that the full sum must be paid, only that if it is not paid, they are allowed to freeze the service. Also that no refund of the initial installment for the service will be given. They are also under french jurisdiction as I later found out. So after some research this is what I replied with:  Hi Zak,  I understand where you are coming from, but I would argue that the terms and conditions are void, based on the fact that in our correspondence prior to payment we discussed the entire website including the affiliate section and you proposed the silver design package, stating it would be sufficient. If there were concerns regarding the complexity of the website, these could have been expanded on before the finalised quote.  Regarding the actual design of the website and use of £1,500, no actual work has carried out as I have not submit the design brief. I appreciate that you may deduct some expenses from the £1,500 to cover your time, but aside from that very little has happened.  It would not be unreasonable for me to state that the item I purchased is not up to the ‘expected standard’ and therefore a refund within a 2-year period is required from French Consumer Legal Guarantees. From what I've stated above and based on the following:  The technical support team took 10 working days to transfer my domain to GODADDY. I raised 5 separate tickets asking them for an update on the process, with only 1 receiving a response. The ticket was eventually closed when they gave me the login to GANDI. Stating that I would have to carry out the domain transfer myself, but on your website it states that a domain transfer should take 72 hours.  The original support ticket did not request a domain transfer as I asked how it's possible to get a refund on a domain name. This was not answered and they instead sent me a link for a domain transfer. I know that for a ‘.co.uk’ site all that is required is the IPS tag change, so for it to take 10 working days for them to respond is completely unreasonable and leaves me with little faith in their response time.  I also experienced great difficulty in conveying my website idea to the designer I spoke with, albeit partly down to language barriers. It was my understanding that the website design had been fully understood before making payment, but your designer had very little knowledge of it.  I hope we can resolve this mater in a way that leaves us both satisfied.    I'm still waiting a response, but if anyone has any advice on how I should proceed with this and if I have any legal ground to stand on in court that would be much appreciated. Just as a young man looking to start up a business, I feel like they were almost trying a scare tactic just to get me to pay straight away and as they havent actually provided me a service, and there has only been 6 emails back and forth between us, it just feels like sharp practice.	Yes
137	I have two credit card debt default judgements against me from about 5 years ago.  Even though my credit is repaired now, I am concerned if those creditors can still use that default judgement to come after my brokerage account.  I have recently opened a brokerage account where I am attempting to do some stock trading and my concern is if those creditors from the past can use those judgements to try to seize and/or garnish my brokerage account and I end up losing all funds in it?  The judgements were issued in an NYC court.  Any input would be appreciated.	Yes
138	"My husband was in a situation in 2011 where he helped an old girlfriend buy a car and she stopped making payments on it after they separated. He also never made more payments on it and it was repossessed and has been a ""Derogatory"" item on his report ever since. It's for ~$13,000 and we are in Canada (Alberta but the debt was acquired in BC).   I've been trying to do some research and getting mixed recommendations on how to deal with it. We are in a position to be able to pay it all off in one payment, but should we see if it falls off the report next year (after 7 years)? Do we try to contact the creditor and get it all paid off? Would it even actually be removed from his credit report at that point? Should we do it all by mail as opposed to on the phone to keep a paper trail?    Thanks for any help you can give, we want to get it dealt with but I've seen many articles that say paying off the full debt could be actually detrimental and useless at this point."	Yes
139	I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.	Yes
140	"We had a nasty hail storm come through in May 2016, I made a claim for a full roof replacement and non-roof related repairs such as deck, broken window, fencing, etc.  I went through the claim and broke out the roof-related repairs costs line-by-line to come up with the total cost for the job, since the roofing company would NOT be performing any non-roof related repairs. This is what we agreed on for the cost, and what is reflected in the proposal from the roofer, not including supplements. I even sent them a copy of the claim so they could see for themselves. So, Cost – $500 deductible credit + supplements.  Nearly 6 months later, the roofing company tells me the amount they've successfully negotiated for the supplements, and I receive an additional check from the insurance company to cover them.  The roofing company invoiced me for remaining balance, exactly what was in the proposal, base negotiated cost + supplements (which we now had a figure for). I paid it promptly and in full.  I must have been wrong in thinking that the transaction was over, because the roofing company came back AGAIN and says that ""After auditing the final amount we saw that contractor O&amp;P was not included in the first final invoice we sent. For that I do apologize on that."" and ""as soon as it was discovered we made sure to send it out. This has never happened on any of my jobs and again I do apologize for this oversight.""  First of all, it seems wrong to me that they can come back AFTER the invoice has been paid and ask for more money. If I buy a donut and walk out, you can't chase me down the street and say you messed up and undercharged me. However, I'm not trying to wriggle through get anything for free.  Secondly, the proposal mentions nothing of an additional cost TBD later in addition to base cost + supplements. I called my adjuster and he said that the supplements (that had already been paid) included overhead &amp; profit, and in fact makes up the bulk of the supplement amount.  Thirdly, the insurance company is failing to show me the math of HOW they arrived at this NEW total, and instead is only threatening to put a lien on my house. They say that I MUST give them ALL money that I've received from the insurance company or else they will be in violation of the law for helping me benefit from a claim. Surely they understand that they are not entitled to any money for repairs they did not make, but the bigger question is even IF I received more money for the roof than what we had agreed upon, why would they be entitled to that money? We agreed on a price, and that's what I've paid. If there IS extra money, shouldn't it go back to the insurance company if anything?  I'm trying to get my adjuster to answer one simple question: of the money I've received, how much of it is for roof-related repairs? My policy covers depreciation for the dwelling, but not the detached garage, so looking at these numbers for Replacement Cost, Actual Cash Value, Depreciation.. it's all a bit overwhelming and confusing. It's been difficult getting a straight answer from my adjuster since he's still slammed and is hard to get ahold of. After looking at the claim again, I/we used the Actual Cash Value of the roof-related items to come up with the original cost, now that I have more understanding of how this works, should we have used the Replacement Cost? If so, the cost WOULD be higher, but as I mentioned, I sent them the claim, they looked it over, and we agreed on the price.  This is the first time I've made a claim of this nature and this process has been different than any auto claim I've made. Is there Colorado law that states I must hand over any money I receive regardless of what was agreed upon? If so, why even bother with a proposal? Or are they trying to take advantage of me?  I can supply any real figures if that helps. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks."	Yes
141	I needed some minor body work and paint done on my jeep. Took it a shop that is part of a large national chain and paid $700 down payment.  Since then there's been one issue after another and it's 2 weeks past when it was supposed to be done. After they stopped answering their phones I drove down and they went bankrupt with the jeep still inside, disassembled, and sanded.  I've called their corporate office who told me they will see about releasing the jeep to me so I can take it somewhere else.  Since the jeep isn't legal to drive as it is, I'll will probably have to pay for towing, putting it back together, ect.   What steps should i be taking now? Is there something I can do to get the 700 back if they refuse to refund It? I understand they already did some work, but towing the jeep in pieces 2 weeks later wasn't what I had in mind when I payed. What about compensation for a rental car? I'm in the middle of moving and I will have to rent a vehicle now.  TLDR dropped jeep off at shop and paid 700 down. Shop went under with the jeep disassembled and locked inside. What should I do?	Yes
142	"* Answered an ad on social media that offered paint correction on vehicles. The guy had ample pictures of his work(or so I thought lol) etc.  * Well he gets the car &amp; proceeds to paint it with what's looks to be a paint brush &amp; a roller. He lays the paint that looks to be house paint on so thick it never completely dried. Rendering all sorts of debris embedded, including I kid you not a butterfly stuck to the hood not unlike a hood ornament lol. There were gobs of paint on the glass, floor carpeting &amp; the chrome work.  * I contacted him several times afterwards only to get a run around &amp; he finally deleted all of his social media pages. He's also an active duty marine, so I don't know if they have a different/ faster venue other than small claims court.  * I had the car repaired &amp; the negligent work ended up costing me double what it would have prior to the botched work. I have an itemized invoice from the body shop detailing the flawed repair as well as ample pics.  * I'm seeking the money it cost me to rectify the damage caused by the improper repair. Should I file for ""Money Owed"" or ""Property Damage"".  * Thanks in advance"	Yes
143	I am from Canada so I am not terribly familiar with this situation under state laws. My friend has a sister who has been in the ICU for a couple weeks now and requires heart surgery. Without the surgery she will die, and even with it, it is highly likely she will die. They are a very poor family and already struggle to make ends meet. If the sister dies, are the parents responsible for outstanding debt?   I thought a hospital bill can only be charged to the patient, an insurance company or if someone had signed something. Just looking for some advice on how this sort of stuff works and where to go from here.	Yes
144	I bought a 2014 Ford fusion used about 6 months ago. A few days after having it I found out it has some issue where it goes into the limp home mode if you accelerate too quickly. This means power train service light and airbag light come on and the car refuses to accelerate normally until turned off and back on again. It's sometimes accompanied by a check engine light but not always. I bought it with a third party extended service warranty that covers almost everything and it still has the manufacturers power train warranty.   It was bought used at a non Ford dealership who initially tried to repair it under their warranty for me, but they were unable to diagnose it and they had me take it to a Ford dealership and they would pay for it.   Over the course of about 4 months and 5 visits, they replaced a mass airflow sensor, the battery, and the throttle body. None of that fixed the issue.   I took it to a different Ford dealership but they were unable to fix it under warranty (the third party warranty required it be fixed at the selling dealer if I was within 40 miles of it) and they wouldn't honor the power train warranty. I took it back to the welling dealer who said they couldn't diagnose it and they told me to go to Ford. I took it back to the Ford they sent me to previously and they said it would take them several days to diagnose it and asked me to come back later.   At this point I was in the process of moving across the state, so I moved and found a Ford dealer near me and took it there. They kept it for a week and replaced the accelerator pedal. The check engine light came back on with the same code so I took it back the next day. They turned the code off and test drove it for a while and it didn't come back so they stated it was fixed.   I picked it up again and the original limp home mode issue happened again so in immediate dropped it off again. That was yesterday, and at this point its been at the third ford garage for 2 weeks now. I've been to garages for the same issue about 7 times or so over the last 6 months.   At this point it seems unlikely to me it'll get fixed and this has been an extreme hassle dealing with. Do lemon laws apply to used cars? What are my options here?	Yes
145	"I happened to stumble upon an interesting situation the other day. Of course, we all know that a Representative working for a said company while speaking understand that any call they are on whether outbound on inbound is recorded and they agree to the recording through employment. While the customer understands and agrees to the recording as calling the Call Center with a message stating the recording.   Say that the customer gets the Representative; which we will place both the Call Center and the Customer within The state of Maryland. The customer then before the conversations starts he allows the representative to know that the call is being recorded for their personal use (Most likely just in case any wrong information is given, info about the account, and for their safety). Yet, the call center Representative states they do not authorize the recording from the customer and disconnects or will disconnect the call if he plans to keep recording the call ""because in the state of Maryland each person(s) has to agree to the recording for it to be valid'.  How are they able to deny a recording of a call or conversation when their job is literally always recording them and both parties agreed to the original knowledge of the call being recorded."	Yes
146	I need some help here. (All events/transactions occurred in CA where I am also living with a valid CA address.)  I purchased a new car on 5/27/17. My credit is poor but my income is high so I qualified for a loan with a high down payment and a trade in. After being approved, I worked a better deal with the dealership to simply put more money down and not use the trade in. We agreed, signed all the paperwork, I drove off the lot with a brand new car.  My first payment is due 7/11/17. I've been trying for the last few days to enroll online and pay my loan but had no luck. Kind of panicked, I emailed my dealership for some help and then called the financeer who tells me that I have two loan open - one that's expired and one that's declined.  I called the dealership immediately who tell me, 'We've been trying to get a hold of you, we need the car back immediately. The financeer sent back the contract when the trade-in was pulled from the table. Bring the car back today or tomorrow. By boss just told me about this this weekend and said we need to get the car back from you.'  I responded with, 'No one has attempted to contact me about this. I have emails from my salesperson asking me how my car is over the last few weeks but no emails, calls, texts, or postal mail regarding the contract or financing. I will not turn in the car until I speak with the Director of Finance.'  They told me the Director will be in in the morning and will call me first thing.  I'm not really sure what to do here. This happened to me last year when trying to purchase a new Mazda and that dealership had mailed certified letter rescinding the contract on the 10th day so I was obligated to return the car. Need some help.  tl;dr - Dealership could not find financing 30 days after signing the contract and is asking for the car to be returned. Do I have any rights?	Yes
147	Hi all, 18 year old from GA. I made a paypal when I was under 18, roughly in 2014 so about 15 years old when I made it. Lied about DOB, did NOT attach SSN to the paypal, and attached my debit card when I was maybe 17. My dad just sent me something saying that paypal can seize funds of accounts made by minors, but I have no money in my account, only on my debit card, and I never put my social into the paypal account. Could paypal take the money from my bank for being a minor at the time? Anyway my credit could be negatively affected? Should I make a new account? Not really wanting to make a new account, because then I would also have to make a new email and get a new debit card.	Yes
148	Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.  When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay.   My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!	Yes
149	If a couple is married, can one person file bankruptcy on their own? I'm married but have past premarital debt. My spouse doesn't have debt or bad credit. Would it be possible for me to file bankruptcy on my debt that occurred before our marriage without him having to file with me or be effected in any way? He has a security clearance to think of and his job depends on having good credit to keep his clearance. I need to protect my husband from my debt. I have a disabled child whom l stay home and care for, so me working to pay off the massive amount of medical bills and hospital stays my childs disability racked up with me being a single mom before I got remarried and got health insurance is impossible. My credit is shot. I'd really like to start new if could. My ex-husband doesnt contribute a dime for our son and never has. I've had hell trying to get the court to enforce support beyond the order, so all the bills are on me and hurt my credit. I can't afford to take the ex back to court again, not that he'd get a job and contribute anyway. What can I do?	Yes
150	Hi r/legaladvice,  I was helping my grandparents organize their finances and 1 item that stuck out was that my grandmother has a credit card exclusively in her name with a balance of about $5K. She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.  I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).  Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail? I haven't had an issue like this before and want to do things the right way here.  Thanks!	Yes
151	"Posted this in a thread over on r/finance, and several people suggested I ask the question here.   My gym has a habit of randomly increasing our monthly payment with a $20 ""Club Fee"" a couple times a year. This charge was not initiated until after I signed up, and had signed authorization for a set monthly rate. The agreement I signed included no wording of this fee, so I have not given them permission to charge me this extra amount. I also have received no type of notification of this fee prior to it being charged to my credit card on file.  This seems very illegal to me. Am I right? What course of action might I have to get this stopped?  Already planning on talking with the gym manager when I go in tomorrow morning."	Yes
152	dad uses a visa and we're not sure if we're allowed to cancel a credit card transaction.  Basically we bought tickets from expedia using a visa card.  I mispelled my dad's name and called them 8 hrs later.  They said they would fix it within 48 hours.  This was a month ago.  They still havent fixed the issue.  Would we be allowed to cancel a transaction in this case?	Yes
153	"I live in Omaha, Nebraska. My old apartment charged me rent for the month of July, but my last day of residency was June 30th 2017. Due to another semi-unexpected expense, this overdrafted my account by a fair amount and I have so far been charged 2 overdraft fees and will likely have an ""extended overdraft"" fee added on before I am paid and can be back in the black. Rent was set up to be paid automatically through their web portal, and I had not cancelled it, thinking it was unnecessary as I had signed all the paperwork to move out.   The property manager had called me July 3rd, telling me the automatic system had charged me, I went to my bank to try and stop payment, but it appears it was too late. I contacted my bank Friday to file a dispute, and then contacted the property owned Monday. They agreed to pay back the amount, but denied responsibility and so would not pay the overdraft fee, claiming it was my responsibility to cancel the payment. I wasn't happy with that, but $35 didn't seem worth the hassle and cancelled the dispute with my bank. Now that it is 2 fees, as a second bill came due before I was paid, and potentially a 3rd fee, I'm less inclined to accept that and considering my options, if I have any. I was wondering if I am indeed liable for not cancelling the autopay set up through their portal, and if I am not, if this would be worth pursuing in small claims or through my bank."	Yes
154	I signed a contract with a gym at the beginning of the year for a year long service, with the ability to cancel my membership at any time as long as I paid half of the remaining cost of whatever months I had left. Recently my job cut my hours and I wasn't able to afford the gym anymore so I cancelled, and made a payment plan for 50 dollars a month until I pay off the remainder of half of what was left in my contract. After signing the cancellation document at the beginning of the month (before my payment for the month was due, and with the 50 dollar payments starting after the 14th of this month) I was still charged the full amount before cancellation and it overdrafted my account. I've been trying to talk to the owner but he's tried to do anything but give me a refund. Is this legal for him to do? I have it in writing and signed I would only pay 50 a month starting this month for cancellation.	Yes
155	Hello, I will attempt to condense this to the core of the issue, but I'm seeking advice as this information just came to my attention yesterday.   I live in California, and I purchased a new vehicle in Texas in April.  The dealership  said they would handle registering for me in California, that they had done this before.  Fast forward 2 months, a week before my temp tags were going to expire and I contact them asking what the status was, as my tags were about to expire. This prompted a flurry of emails which quickly became apparent, that they had dropped the ball with my paperwork and only just got started.  They issued me a new set of tags for another two months.*(which I question the legality of the new tags, since they have a purchase date displayed that doesn't match my paperwork, I assume because temp tags can only have a 2 month limit... But I digress, I hope I wont get pulled over by police and need to explain)* They also requested that I get my vehicle VIN inspected, and a smog check completed.  Upon getting those two things done, the VIN inspector told me I would need to get it weighed as well since it was a truck, so I got that done as well, and the dealership then told me that was needed afterall...  Good thing I was told by the VIN guy.  All additional paper work was sent a couple of weeks ago, which I followed up on multiple times.  All was quiet until yesterday when I receive an email from the finance director, who this particular individual I have had zero contact with up to this point.    &gt;We have been notified by our titling agency that the State of California is requiring  &gt;more in taxes to register your vehicle.  The amount that was used was calculated on  &gt;the Base MSRP **as requested**, but California has calculated it using the Sale Price. &gt;If you have any questions regarding this amount feel free to contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx &gt; and I will do my best to assist you.  The above **as requested** line is the one I have an issue with, this sounds like they are trying to cover their butt, and it makes it sound as if I requested that they calculate the sales tax differently than they should have.  I did not make any such request, nor did I even know that they did that until yesterday.  April is a long time ago, and I thought all the financials were squared away.  The amount that I owe all of a sudden is not trivial, it is $1670.24.  That is a large mistake, one that I feel the dealership should take some responsibility for.  Do I have any recourse?  Should I expect the dealership to cover some or all of this?  What would be the proper approach to take in your opinion.  Many thanks.	Yes
156	"I apologize in advance for totally butchering this but I really don't know the lingo.  February 2016 I was in a car accident (we were rear-ended). I opted to get checked out when EMS came by, they drove me to a nearby hospital, no big deal just some prescribed painkillers for the neck/back pain and headache.  Turns out the car that hit us was a professional driving service, currently on the job driving a couple to some event. It also turned out that the father of the driver of the car I was in was a lawyer. He drove to meet us at the hospital.  He offers to represent us and sue the company. I say that sounds alright, so I signed something saying he would be representing me in that civil suit, and he would only charge a percent of whatever the outcome is. He starts badgering me over the next 2-3 months or so to get physical therapy and send him the bills. I know he's just looking to blow up the damages he's seeking in the suit, but I'm feeling okay enough and I really didn't have insurance or the money to drop on the therapy when I didn't know what would happen with the suit.  So debt collecting agencies start calling me from both the EMS that drove me to the hospital and the hospital charging me for the check up. This goes on for a few months before I say ""I have a lawyer working on this case seeking damages from the company that rear-ended us"" and they just ask for his info and that's it. Haven't heard from the agencies since January 2017.  So back to my lawyer, he's totally MIA. I have not heard a word from him about the case. Is it normal for this to take almost a year and a half? I signed a contract with the guy, but I don't have a copy. Is there any way I can demand something out of this? I really need some updates especially since I don't know what's up with the debt collectors and when they'll be back. Also, is it possible that it's just too late now to pursue a civil suit? The accident was in February 2016.  For more context, the accident happened in the Bethesda, Maryland area. I'm a college student in DC, but my permanent residence is in Florida. I gave the hospital and EMS my DC address, so that's where I've been receiving the letters from them but I'm moving next month. Also, I haven't checked my credit reports, but I use CapitalOne's CreditWise credit tracker and the debts haven't been reported, is this normal too?  TL;DR I signed a contract with a lawyer to pursue a case against a professional driving services company for rear-ending me. I haven't heard from the lawyer in months. Debt collectors hounded me until I told them I had a lawyer working on pursuing damages from the company. I want this case to move forward. What should I do?"	Yes
157	"Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, and also- throwaway because I'm paranoid.  I had an appointment with my regular podiatrist back in June. I've been a patient for years and have never missed an appointment. The doctor is very well-respected in our area and is booked out months in advance.   On Thursday, June 8th, I got an email at 4:45 PM stating I had an appointment on Monday, June 12th at 1:45 PM. There was not an option to cancel the appointment from the email, so I called the next day, June 9th to cancel my appointment. The time of my call was 1:52 PM. When I spoke with the woman on the phone, I told her I had to cancel my appointment for Monday. She went ahead and cancelled it.  A couple of weeks ago, I received a bill from the doctors office for $35 for a ""missed appointment fee"". I called the office to remind them that I did in fact call, and I would be happy to being in a copy of my phone records to show I spoke with someone. The lady said because I called at 1:52 and not 1:45, I was outside of the 24-hour business day window so I had to be assessed a fee.   There was absolutely nothing in writing saying that I had to cancel 24 hours in advance, Not only that, but the same woman who I've been speaking with on the phone didn't inform me on Friday (when I called to cancel) that I would have to pay a fee regardless because I was outside of that window. Why would by bill say missed appointment fee instead of late-cancellation fee? The only conclusion I could come up with is that she dropped the ball on her end and now I'm left   The office wont budge and I fear that this will end up in collections. It's a small amount, but it's twice what my copay would have been and I literally live paycheck to paycheck, on the penny. I don't know what else I can do from here. Is there a way to dispute it without going through the office?"	Yes
158	They are not answering their phones.  I have the title so it's still technically my car and if they won't pay for it, then would I be able to report to the police that they have stolen it?    Or would I get in trouble for that? I mean technically if you are supposed to pay for something but then u don't it is stealing.	Yes
159	"Background: Was doing an annual EOY budget review when I checked my chase ""emergency fund account"" and saw way less money than expected. Approx. 40 ACH transactions over 7 months time frame(Yes, I know). I call Chase and explain situation. They advise the fraud area is closed and call when they open and to close account at Branch. I do so.  The next day when I speak with Paypal, they confirm that it looks like a scammer / ID thief used my bank info to link to his Paypal account. They explain they don't have a way to send me the funds directly and that the bank just needs to do a ACH reversal and I will get funds back.  Chase stands behind the 60 day Reg E ruling that they say the customer is liable for any unauthorized funds after 60 days. However, they never contacted Paypal, nor will they listen to the situation. Look, I get that I am fortunate enough to have a emergency fund and that I haphazardly didn't review the account for 'a while' but shit I don't go and count my piggy bank every month either, I never use this account it is only a storage of funds. I wouldn't think that someone (with a completely odd name) can willy nillly start a bunch of ACH transactions to Chinese websites out of an quiet account without someone noticing at Chase.   TLDR- Had lots of money missing from Paypal ACH transactions. Bank don't care, and Paypal says they can't do shit."	Yes
160	Should I get a lawyer for this? Is it expensive?  Can I handle it on my own?  I have the letter they sent me with the offer, is that enough or do I need to ask them for a contract of some kind?  I heard the forgiven part of the debt counts as income for taxe purposes.  Is that true.  My debt is about 22k, they are offering a 10% settlement.  I looked at lawyers in the area but all the financial ones I found were bankruptcy  / credit card debt lawyers.  I didn't find anything about student loans.  Please help.  I have about a week to figure this out before I am out of town.	Yes
161	This is a lenghty read ... Spoiler, no TL;DR at the end  :(  Some context - the company that my husband works for is based in Ohio. They have offices in many different states as well as Canada. So my husband and I moved to Mississippi from Oklahoma in October due to this employer relocating him. He has worked for this same company since March of 2017. We both work in Tennessee, but we live in Mississippi. We have switched our licenses, car tags, we have a lease on our rental house, etc. We are permanent, legal residents of Mississippi, and no longer have any legal ties in Oklahoma.  So, the company - until November - was still taking out Oklahoma state witholding on the income tax on his paychecks. He called and asked them to change it to Mississippi- which I thought fixed it. No. From then until present they are taking out Tennessee State taxes. ??? We don't live in Tennessee so we will not file Tennessee State taxes - and Tennessee does not have state tax anyway.  Other than that, Mississippi has the stupid Employees Witholding Exemption Certificate that works as the state's W-4 (at least that's how my employer explained it). I had to fill one out for my job, and I told him to submit one for his when we first moved here. They refused it and said it is useless to them because they do not have an office in Mississippi.  So I did the only thing I could think of and submitted a new W-4 for his company where he withholds more on federal so we can make up the difference when tax time next year rolls around. However, when he submitted it, we noticed his paychecks are different but still more than they should be with the extra taxes taken out. They still are not taking out the extra witholding! He sent in an actual signed form that had our witholding amount on it, and the one they're showing on file is an electronically filled out one with no extra witholding form and it is e-signed. They also had him listed as a D.D.S. (yes, Doctor of Dental Surgery) on his paychecks. I can guarantee if he was a DDS, he wouldn't be working for this bass ackwards company!!  I'm beyond frustrated. I just don't know if I have any ground to stand on with getting an attorney/lawyer. If I do I'm more than willing to hire one. I know that this won't affect our taxes that we are about to file much, if at all, it's next year's that I'm worried about. With our extra witholding, do I even need to really be worried about it, or am I thinking way too much about this?? Thanks in advance for any and all advice!!	Yes
162	I'm trying to get out of a lease with our wireless carrier. I noticed today they have my name as the 'lessee' but my SO as the signature. Probably a long shot but is it possible this makes the contract void?	Yes
163	"Hi,  Thank you guys for taking the time to read this and help us out, we messed up! My girlfriend and I run a small business in BC, Canada. We needed scheduling software and she ended up going with a web platform she used to use at an old job, however, we really dont like it at all and we havent used it, but its costing us 100$ a month! The web service company is based out of New Jersey. Is there anything we can do to get out of this contract or break it by paying less than what they are asking?   I know Canada has some consumer protection laws, but I dont know if they are applicable in this situation. I've provided more details below:  She signed a 24 month contract and when we asked the company how to cancel they transferred us on the phone several times before saying they couldnt help us and then it took a few days before they finally emailed us the cancellation information. **To cancel the contract we would have to buy out our remaining term and pay them for all 24 months anyway**.   The communcation with the company has been awful, they emailed us completely incorrect information about our contract and how long it is then in the same email attached the actual contract she signed with the correct information. **In the email they say we signed the contract in 2014 when it was actually 2016 and the actual contract shows 2016 too . Here is the email:**  * ""After a review of your account, your company signed and committed to a one year monthly payment subscription agreement with WorkWave effective 9/4/2014.  Your signed agreement is attached for your convenience. Per the terms &amp; conditions of the agreement, cancellation will require a buyout of the nineteen remaining months of your contract. The contract balance at this time is $1,425.00 plus any applicable sales tax.""    **Here is the wording of the actual contract:**  Prices include the use of the software, hosting your company’s information, automatic software updates and data file backup. The monthly payment plan pricing is based on a 24 month subscription (with automatic renewal) as further set forth in this Purchase Order Agreement and the General Terms and Conditions referenced herein.

164	After filing two claims a month apart last fall for a tornado and then a fire, my parents' homeowners insurance threatened to drop them if they make another claim. This morning they awoke to two feet of standing water in the basement from a flash flood that affected half the neighborhood. They are distraught and believe they cannot file a claim for risk of being dropped. I know insurance companies pull this all the time, but is there any legal recourse here?   I'm encouraging them to at least speak to a lawyer. Right now they are so distraught over the thought of covering the expenses on their own or losing their coverage entirely that they're pretty much frozen. Hoping to get some information here to find out if it's even worth meeting with a lawyer or if the insurance company has them by the balls.	Yes
165	So my girlfriend is hosting a large caliber barrel race. The slot were sold for 1000 dollars each. We had to move the race because of a natural disaster in our area, and now some people are asking for refunds. The contract they signed at the beginning said no refunds. Do they have a legal Case because it changed dates? Were really worried as she is a sole proprietor and if anything comes of this, she would have to declare bankruptcy.	Yes
166	"Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.  Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.  Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an ""online debit card"" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this ""online debit card"" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.  Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like ""what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc"" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.  Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.  It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.  It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.    I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...  I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn."	Yes
167	He is my coworker. I have known him over five years and we have been close the entire time. I have always helped him out with money, food, rides, and everything. He says he does not have a bank account and I know he has been struggling. He said he would give me $30,000 of the money in return for all the years I helped him and for taking the money in my bank account. Am I going to be scammed? Can I be taxed for taking the money into my account? Does this seem legal?	Yes
168	"So yesterday my girlfriend called me all excited because she bought a new car from a used car salesman. She told me the contract and it is absolutely horrible. She's a young girl (21) and went in and told a salesman it was her first time buying a used car and he pulled the whole ""oh it's easy I'll walk you through it"" and took advantage of her.   Her contract is absolutely awful. They have her paying about $17.5k for a car worth maybe 7k. She has a 65 month contract with 9% APR. I told her that she got screwed over and to use californias 48hr used car cooldown period to void every contract she sign. Well she just sent me a picture of her signature on a contract opting out of purchasing a cancellation for her contract. She's got amazing credit score as well if  that helps anything.   Is there anything we can do to get her out of this contract and prevent her from buying this POs car for almost 3x it's worth?"	Yes
169	"**Backstory** My wife and I went to visit a friend in Roatan, Honduras in April.  I had to be taken to the emergency room for food poisoning.  While I was getting my stomach pumped, my wife was dealing with the paperwork.  They initially told her it would be $250.  After they saw that we had insurance it got bumped to a $500 ""deposit"",  and as we were ready to head out it turned into an $800 ""deposit"". At that point we were starting to get angry and told them to just charge us whatever the costs were.  We weren't just going to leave them money without seeing an invoice of the charges.  They refused to provide one.     The dude had copies on his desk of my Driver's License and Insurance card.  So I grabbed them while he went and talked to his ""manager"".  When he came back we told him that we didn't want to use insurance and just charge us whatever the costs were.  My wife, being the great fighter that she is, got the ""deposit"" down to $500, cuz they kept on saying that they didn't know how much.  So we paid the ""deposit"" and I left them a copy of my driver's license and my email address.    I don't want to scam these people, they might have saved my life, but I just wanted them to charge me for the services rendered.  **Now** Yesterday, almost 90 days out, I receive an email with the invoice of $5,000.  We spoke to our friend in Honduras and he says these charges are outrageous.  The invoice came from an American company.    My question for a lawyer would be, is there a ""statute of limitations"" on this sort of thing?  Is there anything they can do to me legally?  All they have is my driver's license with an out of date address.    Thanks in advance."	Yes
170	"The company is called inspire3 and is British. On their website they claim they do refunds if you are not satisfied with the product. We have emailed each other. They claim they've paid me back, that i should contact my bank and sent me a ""receipt"". The receipt doesnt have my account or card number on it so my bank doesnt accept this. The company claims this is their official receipt and for ""security seasons"" the account number and so on wont be displayed.   I suspect i have some leverage here because else they wouldn't bother with emailing me back."	Yes
171	I was riding down a street in the bike lane. There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while. My bike kept going and it got run over by their car being completely destroyed. The driver was immediately apologetic and claimed responsibility. They provided me with their contact and insurance information.   So my problem here is I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I'd prefer not to get lawyers involved because she was extremely nice and wanted to work with me on this. I do want her to pay for my hospital visit and a replacement to my bike. My bike I bought new and got it in a rare situation of the bike needing to be sold because it was a year old model and got it for about half the msrp with also haggling. I'm pretty sure I can't get a bike like that again for the price I paid for it.  My main questions: 1. I have not been in a situation like this before. Do I call her insurance right away and report the situation? 2. What do I tell them? (Might sound silly but I don't to say anything wrong that will prevent me from getting covered) 3. Can I provide them with the make and model of my bike to get the msrp value for it instead of receipt value?  Thanks in advance for any advice.	Yes
172	"Long story short, I made out checks to my ex (who lives in Maine) in the amount of $12,799 and a wire transfer of $3,000 when a check bounced because I forgot to transfer money from my savings to my checking account. Every check is clearly marked as a ""loan,"" and we have a previously signed contract for $10,000 of the $15,799.  I have a new contract reflecting the current amount that I plan to get notarized and sent to him immediately. He has been refusing to work with me on this and gets angry whenever I bring it up, so I imagine I am going to have problems with him signing the contract, let alone paying me on time.  If he continues to refuse, should I hire a lawyer or file on my own in small claims court? I don't know much about the process, and I don't want to screw this up."	Yes
173	Bottom Line:  I bought a used diesel truck from a Volkswagen dealer, and my local mechanic told me that it is fully deleted (catalytic converter, diesel particulate filter, and EGR have all been removed/bypassed).   When I was originally talking to this dealership I made it clear that I need a diesel truck to tow my 5th wheel, but it needs to pass a smog test. I asked the salesman if the truck had stock exhaust, and he said yes. At the time, I hardly knew anything about emissions or tuning modifications so I believed what the dealer told me. I settled on a Ram 3500, and drove it home.  Now, I find out the truck can't pass emissions. The state in which I am registering the truck does not have smog tests, so there won't be an issue getting the vehicle registered. However, I think it is a federal offense to not have a DPF or Catayltic Converter on the truck. Getting a misdemeanor or a felony charge, if I were to get pulled over, could jeapordize my career.  The parts alone are going to cost me over $4k to get the truck within EPA guidelines.  Basically I have two questions:  1. What can I do about the dealer? They told me it was OEM exhaust, but it's not. Now I'm expected to pay several thousand dollars for something that shouldn't have been an issue if the dealer told me the truth (I wouldn't have purchased this truck)  2. When I look up federal EPA guidelines, it talks about being a federal offense to modify or tamper with a vehicle's emission system. I did not tamper or modify them, it came this way from the dealer. Am I still liable in this scenario?	Yes
174	First off we three each paid a deposit to this apartment of $100. The front desk woman we gave these money orders to was just terminated by management. The new management says since they have no evidence of us paying through money order we must prove it through receipts. If I can't find the original receipt what can I do from there? Old management lost the deposits and now I'm in a confused place on this.	Yes
175	"My mom is looking at declaring bankruptcy.   However, 7 years ago she helped me with a car. I paid for everything but it was in her name. It has been paid off for 2 years and we did a ""gifting"" at the DPS and the car is in my name now on the title.   She started having financial troubles about 3 years ago so I paid off her truck so it wouldn't get repossessed. Again did the ""gifting"" and it's in my name. This has been for 1.5 years now.  So if she declares bankruptcy could I lose these vehicles? I paid the entire car loan and about half the truck loan."	Yes
176	"Hello,  I am absolutely infuriated by this situation and wanted to know if anyone had any advice on what to do. I personally live in Arizona, however this company is located in Southern California, Newport CA to be exact.   So I rented a home at the beginning of May for the fourth of July weekend for me and 4 of my friends. I am 22 years old and wanted a place for me and all of my friends who have recently graduated to rekindle and hangout for the 4th of july. My friends and I each paid an even amount for the rental and gave it to my friend Joe. I went ahead and made the reservation and paid for the reservation with Joe's card. The full amount (roughly $4,000) was charged to the card immediately after making the reservation. The company sent me a confirmation email stating that the reservation had been made and sent me a bunch of information, including and email stating that the realtor would send me the lock combination to get into the home closer to the date of our stay.  I want to make it clear that a lot of homes in newport require you to be roughly 30 or older to rent a home. That is why I searched for days and finally found a rental company that allowed you to make reservations as long as you were 21 years of age or older. Considering that I, along with everyone in my party, was over the age of 21, I found that home to be perfect for us.   Fast forward to the day that we are supposed to arrive. We had the place booked for July 2nd-6th. On July 1st, at 5pm in the afternoon, I recieved an email requesting a photo of myself, a photo of my driverse license and a picture of the card on file. Unfortunately since I was traveling, I did not see the email until the next morning. (July 1st was a sunday, I did not expect to recieve an email on a sunday from them) Anyways, the very next morning I was happy to send them all of my information, however I explained to the realtor that I did not have a copy of the card on file considering that it had been lost by my friend Joe a few weeks back and he had since replaced the card. The reservation had already been paid in full nearly two months prior. Immediately after stating this, she said she would have to speak with a supervisor and get back to me. This was on July 2nd around 10 am, when our entire friend group had already traveled to newport and we were essentially pulling up to the driveway of the home. She then calls me back and states that since we do not have the card, that she has to cancel the reservation. She proceeded to cancel the reservation and said she would refund the money. I kindly explained to the realtor that the card had been cancelled, and that we would HAPPILY give them another card to keep on file for security purposes. She told me that since it wasnt the card that we paid with, there was nothing she can do.   Since they sent me that email less than 24 hours prior to our check in time, I had no idea that they required that card from us. Or else I wouldve called and notified them prior. When I asked her ""how was I supposed to know"" she responded, ""its in the rental agreement"". I immediately read through the entire rental agreement from beginning to end and I found NOTHING that remotely mentions anything about us having to have the card. She then said that ""since the card doesnt match the name on file, that is a red flag, so we cancelled your reservation"". So at this point, I feel like I am being lied to because now shes changing stories as to why she cancelled the reservation. I called back and kindly spoke with a supervisor and asked them to show me where in the rental agreement it states that we need to provide a picture of the card on file, or where it states that the card used to make payment needs to match the reservation. She hostilly responded, ""Sir, this is not a negotiation. Your reservation has been cancelled. Goodbye."" and then hung up the phone.   We were left there, sitting in front of the house, after traveling several hours, essentially homeless. They said that the money was refunded, however, that takes on average 3-5 business days, so we couldnt even use the $4,000 to rent another home or hotel room. We ended up having to pay for a hotel room for the night and buy flights back the next morning/drive back home.   I am honestly at a loss for words about this situation. I could not believe that a company could do this to a client. I believe that when I sent her a picture of my driverse licsense, she saw that I was only 22 and figured that since it was the fourth of july, that they could rent the home to someone ""Better"" for more money. I eventually found out that they ended up renting the home to a husband and wife for the fourth of july.   I am very upset because I had paid for this reservation two months prior, and they held the money in their account for 2 months. They then proceed to send me check in instructions less than 24 hours prior to my check in, and then cancelled the reservation. I do not understand how they can get away with this. I wish they would atleast have contacted me with the check in instructions a few days prior to our reservation.  Does anyone know what kind of attorney I should speak with about this? Or does anyone have any advice who works in this industry? I would greatly appreciate all advice.  Sorry for the long post.  Thank you!"	Yes
177	So mom and I bought roundtrip tickets from Kansas City to Fuzhou, China on JustFly.com. Outgoing flights were KC to Seattle to Shanghai to Fuzhou. Return flights were Fuzhou to Beijing to Seattle to KC.    When we arrived in Shanghai, we had to hop on a different, domestic Chinese airline (Juneyao Air) to go to Fuzhou and get another boarding pass. The agent there did not give us any boarding pass since they said that whomever purchased the ticket (JustFly.com) had sent some kind of incorrect ticket/reservation confirmation number and it didn't match any of our passport or visa numbers. We were stuck in Shanghai and were told that the only way to get to Fuzhou was to buy our own separate ticket in China to go to Fuzhou. Which is what we did.   When we were coming back to the US, at the airport in Fuzhou they said that the rest of our reservation was cancelled since we did not take the last leg from Shanghai to Fuzhou. We had to then buy tickets that day to come back to the US...which cost us double what we paid for the entire roundtrip ticket.   Just called JustFly.com now to discuss any possibility of refund (we have receipts in China of flights we bought) and they flat out refused. They said that 1) any missed leg causes rest of the roundtrip to be cancelled....and 2) that if the confirmation # was wrong then we wouldn't have been able to even start our journey.    Any potential recourse? Dispute this with my CC company(Chase?) The roundtrip ticket itself was about $2600 and the way back out of China was over $3000 (about 20,000 Chinese RMB converting to USD currency). So total out 5-6k.  Not sure if it's even worthwhile to see if we can retain legal counsel to sort this out?   Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!	Yes
178	Hello,  I recently moved about 30 minutes to be closer to my office. I noticed that my 2010 Audi A4 had a rough idle and then a check engine light came on. Since my old shop was about an hour away, I decided to simply bring it to the autoshop right behind my apartment building to get the issue diagnosed. I want to note that this shop had almost all positive reviews online and belonged to a company with multiple locations although I dont think it is a national chain or anything.  I dropped the car off overnight, and they called me the next day saying my spark plugs needed to be replaced along with 4 coilpacks. They quoted me a price over double what my old shop would do it for so I told them to simply put everything back together so I could drive it over to that shop when I had time. I will also note that I just had the sparkplugs replaced by the previous shop only 3 months earlier as part of a general tune up, and have not had anything but an oil change done since.  When I get to my main shop, an Audi specific shop thats been in business for quite some time run by someone who is pretty well known in the local car scene, he pulls off the engine cover and the Volkswagen Auto Group electrical connectors leading to the coilpacks are completely damaged. As if whoever was removing them last didnt know the trick to opening VAG connectors.  I ended up needing more than just the recommended service, turns out after smoking the engine I had a failing rear main seal which I had a third shop fix under warranty.  I told my main shop to order new electrical connectors, and they say its going to be about 200 dollars out the door to replace. Im sure I could do it myself for almost nothing but I dont want to be wasting my time working on my car for someone elses mistake especially since its winter and I dont have a garage. Im in the process of writing a letter to their central office but Im not entirely sure what to say. Does anyone know what it takes to file a small claim in MN if they say no? Im very upset they would cause this damage and not tell me.  I have all recipients.	Yes
179	"I've been homeless on and off again (since 17, I'm 20 now), and have really been working on getting my life together this year. Since I got a little bit of a savings together, and the job market around me has been awful lately, I decided to spent most of it ($800) on a scooter because a local shop that does deliveries that I used to work at (Jimmy John's) was hiring again. I figured I could make the pay the driver's do, just without having to pay for insurance, as the scooter is a 50cc.    I looked around and found a dealership selling them unused at low prices. I was ensured a 30-day warranty, and recieved a sheet along with my title after purchase saying as much. However, after using my scooter for a few weeks, it began to have issues starting up, and stalled often. I was still within the warranty, which the owner of the shop said in the case of that sort of thing happening would cover issues.   My boyfriend and I brought the scooter in and the guy who ran the place was extremely short tempered. My boyfriend had also sat up with me and tried Youtube videos that instructed on ways to start it with a kickstart and whatnot (nothing that would void the warranty) and he refused to believe we were having the problems that we were. He even started getting very short and argumentative with me despite me simply asking questions. It got to a point that he refused to answer me when I spoke to him and instead talked to my boyfriend. I am legitimately afraid of what would have happened had he not been there because he was so upset that he had his hands in a shaking fist, as if to stop him from doing something to me. He claimed that he would keep it until the following Tuesday (maybe 5 days from then -- not within the warranty, but his mechanic wasn't in town until then, he said) to ""make me happy"" but that he assured his scooters didn't have issues starting up even though the two of us saw with our own eyes after an hour of attempting to start it that it wouldn't work.   So we get the scooter back on Tuesday and of course after a day of use it's back to the exact same problems. I saw that the company I bought it from had 4 of 5 stars but I hadn't checked what the reviews really said because it seemed legit since there were 33 of them, so I assumed there were more good than bad. One of the reviews mentioned a bout of suspected racism. It's important to note that I am black, and my boyfriend is white. Besides me being a woman and this guy  maybe having some traditional ""talk to the man during a sale, not the woman"" (He'd made crude remarks about my intelligence when we spoke to him before dropping the bike off), some of his rage could be from the fact that I'm black. With all that I know about this situation, I've come up with a plan of sorts, but I'm not 100% sure of the legalities involved.    I want to start all this by going outside and trying to start it again, but getting it on video and mentioning today's date, what's been wrong with it, etc. I want a few minutes of me starting it up. After that doesn't work, I want to call them and ask for a receipt from them ""fixing"" my bike so it's on record that that happened (They did it for free so they just had us take it back without any proof --  I know, I didn't think about it until we left). From there, I'll call him (the owner) myself and talk to him about the issues I'm STILL having with the scooter -- I've had my boyfriend call up until this point because I've legitimately been kind of scared of this guy blowing up at me (I have PTSD and a history of abuse) -- but this time, record him mentioning the dates of fixing it, and the fact that we brought it to him, that we were within warranty, etc. What I predict is him to actually speak his mind and blow up at me as well to make my point seem even more valid. From there, two options:   1.) My SO's mom is a paralegal who has contact with a host of lawyers willing to do immediate pro-bono work. I want to sue in small claims and get my money back. Until then, I'll get my scooter repaired at a local shop and keep the receipts from that. If all of this works out, I'd still like to go through with option two as well, but I'm not sure if the legalities of it:  2.) If she's unable to get someone to help us, then (and I know this seems kind of petty, but I honestly want other people to not buy from these monsters) I would like to have both my boyfriend and I leave a one-star review on their site along with a link to a YouTube video of the footage that I have edited in with an on-screen transcript of our call and the audio from the call. I know that Georgia has a one-party consent law, so I wouldn't need their permission to use the audio, but could I be sued at that point for posting that sort of thing? I'm assuming I'd have to use rhetoric that doesn't necessarily say ""Don't shop here"" but simply state the facts about the situation, facts being that I am having tons of trouble with them and that they are not fixing my bike."	Yes
180	I'm a flight student that was referred to an airplane owner to purchase a 10-hour block of flight time.  I was sent an invoice from the owner's LLC.  I wrote a check made out in his name and sent it to him.  In a short amount of time a few life things happened and I decided to stop flying.  I let him know that I was no longer going to use the flight time and requested a refund.  No contract was signed, and no policies were announced at the time of sale.  He is saying he will not give me a refund.  Can he keep the money forever whether I use the flight time or not?  I realize I did send the money and enter what I assume is a sort of contract by the fact that I sent a check in response to an invoice.  I'm curious if I can sue for my money back or if I'm just hosed.  I'm in Virginia.  Thanks a lot for any advice.	Yes
181	I broke a lease (I was never served a notice to vacate) with an apartment in Texas.  They charged me for the remaining months, and added all concessions from the previous months.  The balance is somewhere near $5,500 and is definitely on my credit report.  Next Summer, I'd like to buy/rent a house with my wife. By that time, it will be seven years after the first report of the debt.   Hunter Warfield owns the debt and I've never talked to anyone from the company.  They stopped calling me a long time ago.  I've considered calling and after specifying that I am not promising/making an offer to pay, nor acknowledging the validity of the debt, seeing what they'd want me to pay to satisfy the debt.    1. Does this debt act like other debt, in that it falls off after seven years, or will this be on there until I pay the collections company?  2. Am I correct that the statute of limitations for suing me for this debt has passed?  According to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code § 16.001 et seq., Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 2.725, the limit is four years.    3. Would contacting HW be a smart or stupid move?   4. Would contacting HW reset the seven-year clock?   5. Any tips for dealing with HW and not getting completely screwed? Certain verbiage or terms to use?  What's a good offer on a six-year old debt of this size?  If the answer to question 1 is that it in fact falls off, I have no interest in offering to work with HW and I don't need answers for 3, 4, &amp; 5.	Yes
182	A while back i had a leak in my slab floor that i had repaired by a plumber that went fairly well. submitted claims to my insurance and home warranty and everything was fine. soon after (2-3 weeks) the leak occurred again and i had the same plumber out to fix it. they never mentioned a bill and never gave me an estimate so i assumed it was part of the same repair. (the new leak was on the same pipe but further down , and within the area they drilled open in the slab) Unfortunately since i didn't know i was going to be charged for this like it was an entirely new problem i didnt let my home warranty company know so they claim it won't be covered.  I offered to pay the plumbers the bill minus what home warrenty would have covered but they didn't go for it. ($1500-$400 for $1100). they're threatening to sue for the bill plus legal fees. am i in the wrong here? Am i even required to pay whatever bill they give me if i'm never given an estimate or anything?  thanks for any advice you can give me.	Yes
183	"I am an Amazon Seller.  I sell various products, and I work hard to position them as high in the search results as possible.  I've been working on some products for months or years, and they slowly gain position in the search pages leading to more sales - but it takes time.  Lots of time.  Recently a competitor started selling a similar product.  (When I say ""similar"" I really mean ""exactly the same"", but with their label on it.  Which is fine, that happens all the time.)  The problem is that this seller generated dozens of completely fake five star reviews, getting his product in the top 10 search results within a week. That's right.  On exceptionally high-volume search results, he got to the top 10 in a week.   The reviews are obviously fake.  The people leaving the reviews have never reviewed any other product except for this guys.  They all left over-the-top, gushing reviews about how the freaking product ""changed their life.""  Each left pictures and videos.  Me and a friend traced back all of the accounts, and believe we mapped out a pretty decent network of sellers that work together creating fake accounts and leaving fake reviews.  The evidence is strong.  So we reported them to Amazon.  Two months ago.  Nothing has happened. Our sales have suffered.  This practice is in direct violation of Amazons terms, but they don't seem to have any interest in enforcing their own rules.  I've read that Amazon is going to bring a lawsuit against these types of buyers/sellers, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Is there any sort of legal action we legal sellers can take against the illegal sellers?  I believe that leaving fake reviews is in violation of some federal laws, is that correct?  Can we report them to a federal agency?  Can I have a lawyer write up some scary-sounding/threatening letter?  What are my options?  I am in the US.  Thanks you."	Yes
184	Hi I I'm located in BC, Canada and my mom recently passed away, she was in charge of cash fund that was disbursed to members of a group, every two weeks each member would place x amount of dollars into the pot and every two week someone from the group would claim the pot. Each member could claim the pot once during the duration but would have to continue contributing to it till each member has collected.  Luckily I have all the details of the pot and what goes funds go where and to who, what I want to do is protect myself and her estate in the event someone claims that payment was not made to them after I disburse the funds. Is there a document that I can use that would be legally binding, I plan to have witnesses with me when payments are made.  I really do appreciate any help and thanks for taking the time to read this, have a great day.	Yes
185	I got an e-mail from a website selling sneakers that I owe them a large amount of money because I had allegedly scam them out of that amount of money worth of merchandise. They don't have my IP address, and they don't have my name. All they have is a few drop locations in some area of my state. I will never go to those locations again. Is there truly anything they can do to me? They told me that they have hired a private investigator already and that they have records of me carding them and carding several other related websites (They correctly named a few of them) and that this will all go to the FBI if I don't send them some large amount of money.  Obviously, I don't want to send them that amount of money, but I don't want to get prosecuted for carding, so am I better off sending them that money to avoid lawyer fees if they report me to the feds?	Yes
186	I paid my roommate, let's call them Blake, the $173.96 owed for my share of our hotel room for a convention through Venmo.  I was told that they did not receive this payment and asked to pay them in cash.  I (accidentally mixing up the amount slightly) paid them $176.93 in cash in front of three of our four other roommates.  I ended up leaving the room after one out of four nights, due to another roommate's hygiene issues; this is unrelated.  After the night I left, I asked for part of the hotel fee I paid back, as I had not stayed the full duration; I received a long, angry text not only denying my request for a partial refund, but also claiming that I should be paying a cancellation fee to Blake and their partner because I had left without consulting them.  After the convention, I contacted Venmo trying to get my initial payment back; they responded telling me that Blake themselves would have to email Venmo, as the payment had gone through.  How do I go about getting back my initial $173.96?	Yes
187	Backstory is my girlfriend and I recently moved in together (in Colorado) in June but her lease for her last place doesn't end until August. To be able to move in with me she couldn't afford July's portion of rent which was $425 for her. Her and her ex roommate agreed both verbally and over text that she would pay June and July utilities but my girlfriend would only have to pay for June's rent.  Now July has come along and the ex roommate is demanding she pays or she will take her to court. My girlfriend talked to her old landlord and he does remember the situation but both my girlfriend and ex roommate have two different stories and he just wants to be paid. He said he has not been paid by ex roommate  yet and is willing to give an extension to my girlfriend if she needs. He just is confused by the situation and now not really sure what was agreed upon.   Does the ex roommate have a case against my GF? Does she have one if my GF does pay rent to landlord (even though wasn't decided previously) and still try and take her to court. What are the scenarios here? My GF cant afford this and is feeling screwed over but knows nothing was signed just verbal and text agreements. It is in Fort Collins CO. Any help would be appreciated	Yes
188	"I hired professional, highly recommended photographers for my wedding in January 2017. They gave me a CD with 1,331 photos. There are 3 of the bride (me) and the editing on the rest of the pictures is terrible (they also gave me photos of them drinking, the sky, and selfies with the staff, there are more photos of the sky than me, the bride, alone in my dress). The best photo these professionals took was from their iPhone. When I received the photos I told them right away that I wasn't pleased. The editing is terrible, they just applied filters to most of the photos. I asked them to removed the filters, look for more photos of me, and to find more photos like the cell phone photo they took (the cell phone picture is a stunning full body shot of the bride and groom with the lake and sunset in the background). The professional camera shots of the same image are from the shoulders up and very washed out due to filters. They said they would. A month goes by I hear nothing so I reach out to them and ask how its going. They say we have all the pictures done. I'm thrilled and I go and get them. It's a CD with 7 photos, I told them there was more they said they would fix, they asked for a detailed list. I spent 3 weeks making a ""This is what a professional would do to make these photos great list."" I covered everything from ""Please crop this photo, photoshop food out of bridesmaids teeth in group shots, remove filter etc."" They said that was too much work and they don't use photoshop (not mentioned before booking or anywhere in the contract). I told them to just give me the photos unedited and I would have someone else fix them. Months go by again and they give me 50 photos, they went though the list I gave them and gave me unedited images of things I wanted cropped. They did not remove filters. Then when I brought up that they mentioned they found more photos, the denied that they said that because they gave me all they had (I have the text message from them where they said they found more images). My question is: Is it worth it to take them to small claims for all the photos unedited (raw). I'm not wanting money, though I do have to pay an editor now. Just give me the SD cards from the wedding and let me be on my way. They already gave me a copyright release form stating the photos can be edited by an outside party. It's been months and I really want photos I can show people."	Yes
189	So we sub leased a room and the landlord was only aware that one of us was living there (my gf and i so 2) everyone moved out over the weekend without notice. We were gonna take over the lease then we got kicked out too. And the landlord Said she was given $800 (what we were told our deposit was) from the sub leaser but not told it was for our room.    How should I go about taking it to small claims court when I don't know where he moved to? We signed papers when we first moved in (don't have copies, stupid I know) and the paper said it would be refunded. Also I have a picture of our rent+deposit (cash) in an envelope with our names and date. We have texts from him saying to sign the contracts when we first moved. We just don't have the Craigslist ad that said $800 deposit otherwise we have it all in our favor.   What should we do next?	Yes
190	In May, I hired a moving company (Company A, located in FL) to move me from WI to NJ. Our contract stated that they would move me on the 19th or the 20th of May. I (stupidly) paid $520.00 as a partial payment.   On May 19th, I get a call from someone identifying himself as a dispatcher, saying they will be picking up my stuff on the 20th in the afternoon and will call me before they come. The 20th comes and goes with no call until 10:30pm at night saying they will be there in the morning of the 21st. At that point, I had already scrambled and hired other movers because 1) they never showed up and 2) I could only pay by cash or money order which was super sketchy to me.   I called Company A and told them what happened and that I wanted my $520 back. They told me they would call me back. Unsurprisingly, they never returned by call, my multiple messages, or my emails and even stoped answering my calls.    I disputed the charge with BOA a few days after the 20th of May. I was notified today that they are closing the claim and not returning my money. They said that Company A did not break our contract because they subcontracted the move to Company B, and it is Company B that did not pick up my stuff at the date range specified in the contract.    I feel like it's not a large enough amount of money to hire a lawyer, but it's not an insignificant amount and I'd like to get my money back from this shady moving company. I'm angry that Company A did not tell me they were subcontracting and that they refused to return any of my multiple communications. They've also never provided any contact information or even a name for Company B.    In terms of next steps, I'm planning on writing a letter to the claims department to get them to return the $520. Is there anything else I should do to get my money returned?	Yes
191	"Throwaway here.  About five months ago, we moved into a house that has five bedrooms with one bigger master bedroom/bath, and four other roughly equally sized rooms. Five people moved into this house initially, with myself and my SO living in the master bedroom.   After we signed the lease (with only four of us on it, myself, SO, and two others) we tried to come to an agreement on who would pay what on how the rent was divided, all done through a group message. Because the top two incomes on the lease weren't enough, we needed a cosigner on the lease, which my family member stepped in to be. What we eventually decided on, was that SO and I would pay 460 for the master, and each upstairs bedroom would be 410. I would also subsidize the cost of the upstairs bedroom that was going unoccupied by paying an additional 410 a month, with the explicitly defined understanding that if we ever filled that fifth bedroom with a sixth person, that person would be paying the 410 instead and no one that is staying in an upstairs bedroom for 410 has their rent changed at all.  Everyone in the group message, in writing, agreed to this. I have screenshots.   Now we've picked up a sixth roommate, and the roommates have begun talking about renegotiating the spread of the rent. I brought up the screenshotted conversation and agreement we made months earlier that everyone agreed to, and two of the roommates said that this was now ""unfair"" and we should renegotiate. The other roommate flat out rejected all of our negotiations for various reasons, and ultimately said if we couldn't come to an agreeable resolution, he would be moving out at the end of the month. In writing, I asked if he was going to move his stuff out, stop residing at the residence, and stop paying rent, even though his name was the one on the lease, and he said yes, so now I have written confirmation.  The other roommates are also unhappy with the fact that we want to stick with the original agreement we all agreed to, but they have not threatened to move out.  If he does end up moving out, I'm afraid the cosigner and I will be held responsible for paying for this guy's rent while he gets off scot free to live wherever else he chooses. If we don't pay it, then we get evicted within 3 days of the rent being due.   Currently looking, but there so far don't seem to be any prospects that are taking over his room.  What options do I have? Am I shit out of luck? If he moves out, violating the terms of the lease, can I pay his portion for the rest of the lease and go after him for it in small claims? I legitimately don't know, and it doesn't look like a compromise will be reached any time soon. Any help would be appreciated."	Yes
192	"I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...  tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.  Full story: I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail).   The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.  I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.  A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.  I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.  So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.  So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily."	Yes
193	"I ordered a product online about three weeks ago, with an estimated delivery date of 5 business days. That date came and went, but what was really weird is that the tracking information never updated past ""label created"". So I called the company and asked what was going on, and eventually had myself escalated. They tell me that an internal investigation, typically taking 2-3 business days, will be needed. Well, we're at 9 business days now, with no developments.  The specialist has been sending me an email every other day, but they've just been saying that there have been no updates or new developments. Since the product was never delivered, and I asked to cancel my order outright. They said that no cancellations or attempts at a second shipment can be made until this investigation is complete.  Now, I know that I'm not there yet, but I would like to know how long the company can continue to stall without delivering the product? I mean, there has to eventually be a line where it crosses into theft territory, as I have given them money for goods that have not been delivered.   If it's at all relevant, the product is a laptop, the value is $1600, and my biggest frustration is that I'm a student, without the funds to find a replacement for something that is beginning to impact my studies.   Any input is appreciated."	Yes
194	"I'm in another state, but he's in California.  We've been friends for decades, often doing business because I trade/sell memorabilia and he buys stuff for his collections.  So I've been getting stuff for him at his request, from various sources that I can't return it to: People on eBay, thrift stores, pawn shops.  Because he's always been honest, I never thought to get a written contract, so I guess you could say we had an oral contract.  (I know; normally I wouldn't be so naive, but as I said, he's been honest for decades.)  Last month, he says he won't be able to buy stuff ""for a while"", however long that would be.  He says he can't pay me because he had a large dental bill, but this is B.S.; his net worth is six figures, so this dental bill is like change he could find in his sofa.  All I was asking was $90 for the stuff he bought, and that included postage (one of the items was really heavy).  I called him to explain that this puts me in a heck of a bind, as I have bills to pay and my money is tied up in this stuff that I can't sell to anyone else.  He collects on these has-been celebrities, you see, so I'm stuck with this junk now.  He said he'd call me back the next day, but half an hour later I get a call from his crooked friend who helps him with his finances.    The friend says to me, ""He owes you nothing!""  I asked what business is it of his, and sarcastically asked if he has power of attorney over my friend; he lied and said yes, but my friend told me that nobody has power of attorney over him.  I hung up on this liar and tried to call my friend, but he won't take my calls anymore.  I do have a little evidence that we had an agreement for me to sell him stuff every month, such as emails and the USPS insurance/postage receipts.  I could kick myself for not getting this in writing, but I never dreamed this guy would do such a thing.  Do I have any legal recourse against him?  I'm unable to travel to California to take him to small-claims court, and thanks to his actions, I don't have cash to spare, as it's tied up in his junk that he won't pay me back for.  Any insights appreciated; if any of you have additional questions for me, I'll answer them as best I can.  Thanks."	Yes
195	"I live in Turkey, I have ordered around 1860$(with taxes and shipment) worth of computer parts from newegg.com/global/tr.  **TLDR;** At https://www.newegg.com/global/ page they say ""During the order checkout process, Newegg will calculate and display the order total amount along with cost of customs duties and applicable import and sales tax (VAT/GST). Should you elect to proceed with completing the purchase, all orders will be delivered with duty and tax fully paid for and included in your final checkout price."" and at https://kb.newegg.com/Article/Index/12/3?id=1400 page ""When Newegg products are shipped to eligible countries, an estimate of the estimated VAT/GST &amp; Duty will be levied on the items in your order for shipment to countries outside of the U.S. With your authorization, these funds are used by the carrier or another agent to pay the Import Fees on your behalf (or the recipient's behalf) to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The payment of import fees is the responsibility of the importer and is levied based on the laws of the country into which the products are being shipped."" on the same page it also says ""You won't be charged additional fees if the actual Import Fees exceed the VAT/GST &amp; Duty we estimated."" and Turkey is listed as one of the eligible countries, yet, they are refusing to cover the fee on my behalf.   I know some of my options here:  * I can pay the customs fee again get the items then keep chasing after the money I paid for tax &amp;/or duty using chat with us or charge back through bank; i can consider doing this because I have ordered some other parts from other places which I have received already, If I can't receive my order from newegg, I'm gonna have to return them too. But If I do this and the items I receive require some RMA than I will get screwed.  * I can forget about the items,  go for a full charge back through bank since newegg failed to deliver my items as they have promised me; the catch here is items are stuck at customs and they may claim they have done their part, and I can't even send the items back to them because FedEx Turkiye asking me more than 200$ to return the shipper. At that point paying the customs fee makes more sense.  Do I have any other options beside these and how should I proceed?   Back story;   At 07/03/2017 my package arrived at Turkey and delayed at customs and i have been reaching out to them through ""Chat With Us"" since. At my first contact with 2278378 chat session number, I have been told that I don't have to pay any fees by rep Cassie L. Later I got an e-mail from a customs broker regarding the necessary paperwork for customs and the amount of fees levied on my items. I have provided the paperwork and contacted newegg about the fees in chat session 2284660. Rep Joanne Z. asked me to forward the e-mail I got from the broker, which I did, and told me their shipping team will check it out.  After 24 hours from my last contact with them, my package was still delayed at customs so I contacted them to ask why is this taking this long, this was suppose to be an express shipping after all, I knew customs delays are not their fault but they were doing nothing to speed things up and I didn't wanna wait weekend out.   At chat session 2287615 things got a complete turn and I have been told by rep Nick W. that they will not cover my custom fees. I refused to pay that I have already paid and told him I will file a charge back through my bank because they have failed to deliver my items as they promised. Nick W. said a charge back will only cause more issues which I felt like a threat.   I ended that chat session but shortly after decided to give it another try by asking them to charge me back the amount as I paid to them to cover the customs duties, import and sales taxes on my behalf in chat session 2287646. Rep Olivia F. asked me to contact with FedEx(since they are the carrier company), I refused to do that by saying newegg is the one who has a deal with FedEx, they are the FedEx's customer not me but tried it anyway, fedex.com told me to contact FedEx Turkey, but FedEx Turkey never answered my e-mails.   In that chat session (2287646) Olivia F. also said that ""The tax amount shown during checkout is an estimate. If it is not enough, you need to pay for the left"" which is the exact opposite of what their webpage says. When I reminded her what it says on their website she also said ""It(custom fee) will not be charged by us, but we cannot guarantee the shipping carrier will charge the tax or not."" Again i'm not the customer of FedEx, they cannot charge me and I haven't been inform about this.  *reason for including chat session numbers and dates is I'm gonna cross post this to /r/newegg*"	Yes
196	Up until last year I was a graduate student with federal student loans (no private loans) at a public university in Virginia. I had to take a leave for medical reasons, but finished all my classes and only have my thesis defense left. My last class was in Spring 2016 and I have not been registered since, but due to lack of enrollment began paying on my student debts in December 2016 after a 6 month grace period.  A few days ago I received a letter from a debt collector saying a debt has been placed with their office for collections. It states the original creditor is the university for $148.94, and there are about $150 in additional fees listed from them. It's dated June 26, 2017 and says I have 30 days to dispute in writing and gives a PO box address and phone number.   I have no idea what the debt is from and there's been no attempt to collect before now. I did move 2 months ago but have a change of address filed. I logged on to my old university account to check if a fee was added later that I may have missed but it shows my history of payments and it's all balanced at $0. I'm totally willing to pay the $148.94 if it's a real debt I owe, but I have no idea what's it's for. I would rather not pay the extra $150 in collection fees and especially don't want a hit on my credit.   Is there a way to check if it's real, and if so, what it's charged for? My university financial aid office is notoriously terrible over the phone and I'm no longer in that city to stop by in person. I want to dispute it but I don't know how to prove I send a letter in to the debt collector by writing to their PO box. I'm assuming a phone call would not be enough proof of dispute in time.	Yes
197	So I'm looking into buying a new dirt bike that I'm going to convert into a street legal bike, it's in great shape and the guys selling it for really cheap. Everything is fine until I ask him about the legal documents included. He says he has the title for the motorcycle, but that it's not in his name, it's still in the previous owner's name and that guy is dead. I don't think it's a stolen bike because this guy is a medical technician, and rolled up with a nice truck... He's just a redneck kind of dude that cuts corners whenever possible to not give the man any of his money.  **So my question is:** If I'm somehow able to get that title transferred into my name (any help here is appreciated,) will I possibly face any problems in the future with this bike when trying to get it registered when its street legal or maybe that man's family might come and try to collect it from me since it was in his name or anything else?  Thanks in advance!	Yes
198	Someone owe me 32000 USD and now He refuses to pay me back. He lives in Ontario and I do not know about his address. I live in Alberta now. Is there any chance for me to sue him? Please advise! Thnanks	Yes
199	I am in the middle of FAFSA, and was about to sign the Master Promissory Note. I filed my FAFSA with my own permanent address. However, when about to sign the Master Promissory Note, I noticed that the pre-filled address is not mine. I have never seen this address in my life. I am assuming that fafsa.ed.gov and studentloans.gov would only have an address if it was given to them before, possibly for a loan? Am I being unnecessarily paranoid?  The Driver's License number is genuinely my own.  I am currently studying postgraduate in the UK and I am not at home in America.  And although this is not concrete, I guess it's worth mentioning that I have been having that intuitive gut feeling that my identity could be stolen. Random intrusive-like thoughts based on nothing.  What the fuck do I do? I don't even know where to begin.  http://imgur.com/VZWT61v	Yes
200	So I received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/spDd1) in the mail today along with a settlement check in the mail today.  This is the very first I've heard of a law suit against DeVry for fraudulent advertising.  I attended DeVry from 2010-12 and incurred significant student loans but never graduated.  The loan in question is actually in default and it would be absolutely amazing for my life if I could get out of paying it back.  That probably makes me sound like a horrible human being but I'll live with it if I can get out from underneath that mountain of debt.  I went to [the mentioned website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) but I really don't understand if I qualify or not.  If anyone could advise I'd greatly appreciate it.	Yes
201	About two months ago, my Facebook account got disabled without any reason and I still haven't received a single response after hundreds of appeals and requests.  I can't just give up on my account and start a new one. I used to manage many business pages over it which I had been working since many many years.   I don't want the time and efforts I've spent all these years go wasted. I've also literally tried every possible way to communicate with a human working at Facebook but haven't been successful. Their support is non existent.  So should I take them to court? Is it possible? How should I proceed?	Yes
202	This might be stupid but I'm just covering my bases.  A telemarketer called me on behalf of the Association of State Troopers of America or something like that asking for a donation. He was nice, and I figured why not help the police and said I would send 20 bucks. He got my mailing address to send the form.   I hang up and google the number, apparently they're a huge telemarketer known for scams, fake collections, selling insurance, etc. I'd rather just not donate now but since I agreed to, can I be held liable?	Yes
203	I've been looking for a new apartment and got a look at one of my background checks by Global Verification Network.  In my report, there was a creditor, BANKAMERICA (I'm assuming Bank of America), that I never signed up for and it says that I have almost $5000 in balance.  What's more is that it says that I signed up for it in 2005, when I was like 16, which is impossible because I had no credit then and I distinctly remember only Discover Card accepting me when I was 18.  Should I look into what this is or could Global Verification Network be wrong?  If it is real, what do I do to close it without paying for this $5000 I never spent?  Currently, I have never heard anything about this from Bank of America.	Yes
204	"This is a long one:   My boyfriend (of 5 years) &amp; I went down to Miami to vacation with my sister and her husband. Our last weekend night there we decided to have a good time. We went to a few dance clubs and met up with 2 friends we had met in our hotel. My sister &amp; her SO decide to leave, but the other 4 of us stay back. After the club closed the one girl calls a Lyft to get us back to our hotel. The lyft driver some how convinced us we needed one more drink and that we should check out this 24/7 strip joint. We're all quite drunk and we're on vacation so we say hell lets do it.   We get there and drinks / entrance everything is so expensive, but non-the-less we decide to stay. I go to the bathroom and when I come out my boyfriend is no where to be found. He's a stand up guy, a hard worker, and never would have gone to this joint had it not been for me (oops). Anyways, I'm frantically looking for him, but this place is HUGE with multiple stories and various rooms, I cannot find him for a good half hour. Finally I see a stripper walking him somewhere while holding his hand. I run up to them and say what in the world is going on. Anyways, I bolt out, he tried to run after me, but I leave the club. Not thinking clearly, I'm drunk, hes totally wasted, &amp;  also it is 7am. He runs after me but I'm already in my own Lyft going to the hotel.   I finally crash, but wake up around 10 am realizing he never came in. My heart drops, he could be anywhere or dead! I call and text yet get no reply (only to find out that the club had seen all my calls and put his phone on do not disturb!!). I try to call the club (which like I said was 24/7) yet all I could get was automated message saying ""all circuits are busy please try your call again later"". I decide to go back and look for him because the alcohol has faded away and I genuinely was worried for his safety. I get there around 1030/11 am and see him completely passed out face down on a couch, hes not even remotely conscious. He should have never even been served anymore alcohol! The manager and a worker try to give him water but hes just slumped over and cannot even open his eyes. The manager told me he spent 2k on a private room and that he signed off  on it. The poor guy couldn't even spell his name, let alone sign off on anything. He has absolutely zero recollection of what happened and we're an honest couple so he would tell me the truth. I take him back to the hotel room and he passes out until 7pm that evening.  Once he wakes up we try to piece together what happened and decide to enjoy our last evening since its our last night. 2k is a lot of money, but it wasn't the end up the world.  This all happened between 7am-1030am on Sunday morning. Flash forward to Wednesday, and we find that multiple cards have been charged for a total of  over 7k!!! Plus cash was taken out from his bank account. There are no receipts proving anything, and the manager himself had said it was only 2k he spent. We called our credit cards and filled them in so they're going to do an investigation, but we have no idea where to go from here. I called the club and they won't do anything until we sign off on a form, which we don't feel comfortable doing because they obviously are scammers. We've since found this place has reviews online that similar things have happened to many other people. Some people claim they may have even been drugged, which honestly he very well could have been. I've never in 5 years have seem him in the state he was in when I went to pick him up that morning. It was pretty terrifying.  It seems to us after talking things over, that he was absolutely taken advantage of, and quite frankly robbed. This club is well known, so they must have video footage. With me being a witness picking him up I feel we may have some grounds to stand on to get at least SOME money back. We're just nervous to move anything forward, because from what it sounds this club has done some very shady things in the past.  We're just looking for any and all legal advice anyone can give.  What are our rights and how should we handle this? Do we contact the police? Should we fill out this affidavit from the strip club? We really have no idea what the protocol is, and no matter what there is no way he signed off on this many charges. They would have needed his signature over 8 times! The manager told me he had only signed once. So how are there this many charges?  The club will not give us any answers, and we're considering going to a lawyer, so we would appreciate any help we could get! Thanks!  TLDR; went to miami, drunkenly go to 24/7 strip club, lose boyfriend (who is 27 &amp; has never went to a strip club before), come back to said club frantically worried at 1030am, find boyfriend passed out on couch totally drugged/intoxicated, manager tells me he spent 2k, yet he was not even coherent enough to tell me his name, come back from vacation and multiple charges have been made on multiple cards for over 7k. We definitely got majorly scammed &amp; taken advantage of. We want to know what we can legally do.   Thanks everyone!   I don't want any negative or rude comments, we already feel bad enough as it is. We never go to strip clubs, and after doing much research I've found this is a common scam, and we're just looking for any guidance."	Yes
205	Hello LA, My girlfriend has been really upset by this recent turn of events. Her sister has a criminal background and has been in prison before. Likely, to avoid showing up again for warrants, she used her sisters name (my GF) to avoid a Jay Walking Ticket. Afterwards, she has been placed back in prison for a burglery charge and is currently serving time.  The issue is my GF received the $551 ticket from the tax recovery service because penalties have been acruing since my GF hasn't been served notice of the ticket because the wrong address was used when the Jay Walking citation was issued. How can one get the charges and penalties be taken out of my GF's name and her credit ratings restored? Thank you for any help.	Yes
206	I turned in my phone to Sprint for the buy back program. They have lost it with no record of where it is.  I tried to escalate through customer service.  They said the store has taken responsibility for losing it and are working towards a solution.  This has been going on for four weeks.  If the store has taken responsibility for losing it, what action can I take to get the money I am owed?	Yes
207	I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit. But my parents are having issues with our builders. They paid £23,000 for 5ft kitchen extension (which sounds ridiculous) that's been going on for 3 months. This should've been completed within 1 month. There were delays because our builders are trying to 'toy' with us such as 'equipment/material not arriving', mistakes they made and sending in 1 worker instead or 3 or 4.   They're making us pay for problems that they caused. Mistakes that they've made! What's worse is that today, they abruptly came in today and demanded the 'extra' cost rudely.   I feel like this is so unfair. My parents have waited months and they feel like they got robbed badly. The thing is a mess &amp; they just things to just wrap up. The extension started in April. I feel like we should get our money back but I know for sure if we argue with them anymore, they'll stop working on our house. Our 'Building controller' has come in many occasions to inspect their work and even he says it's a disaster. Could anyone advice?	Yes
208	Short story: I was hired to fix several issues with a small company website. This included copywriting, minor code fixes via  Wix and fixing a major fubar with their domain. A predecessor had registered the domain in their personal name. Not the company. After lots of conversations with GoDaddy support, I was finally able to access the account, pay for the registration for the next two years and transfer the account to my name. I did it this way because the company would literally not give me any info on whom I should set it up under and I was under a deadline to get the domain transfered.   Question: Can I hold on to the domain as registered owner until if and when they pay me the low four figures they owe me? It's mostly to prove a point to them, not really profit. I ran a url valuation on the .com and it's worth less than $200, so I am almost tempted to just ask for that. Any NAL advice appreciated.  Location: California	Yes
209	"Long story short, an old room mate broke his leg, couldn't pay rent so he lived for free for a long time, and also managed to break my flatscreen. We notarized a contract stating he will pay x amount of money + 10$ ""each day each payment is not made."" With a total of four scheduled payments this equals out to 40$ a day. We signed this contract back in 2011 and he still has not paid me. Do I really have legal means to take this guy for tens of thousands of dollars? I didn't intend for this to really happen but I'm sick of his shit and I'm pretty sure any lawyer is gonna go for the throat here and I'm just wondering what I can expect. It was stated he was to keep proof of payments and he was to pay me in cash. I have a feeling he might just forge this proof?"	Yes
210	"So about half a year ago I noticed a $200 ish charge on my credit card that I had not made. Looked up the company in question and found many complaints about continued charges after cancelling the service this company provides (online dating). I then called my bank and got them to mark the charge as fraud and they sent me a new card. Yesterday I received a letter from a credit services company. The letter begins by saying this is a 72 hour demand. It goes on tell me it has been sent in accordance with provincial legislation and that the credit service has attempted to find a solution with me, though this is the first time I have heard anything from this company since a had to get a new credit card. Then it says the debt is past due and IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION may be the only way to resolve the matter. It tells me after obtaining a provincial court order they may garnish my wages, attach real estate or property I own, seize money in my accounts, seize and sell assets and have my finances examined in court. ""There is still time to deal with the matter"" it goes on to say but if no reply is received in 72 hours they will make a referral back to the client for IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION with no further notice to me. What should I do?"	Yes
211	The situation is my sister was enrolled in a dual enrollment high school program at a local university where she went and lived on campus to take classes. My parents were not involved in any of the application or enrollment process and neither saw nor signed any paperwork. For context, She is not on good terms with my parents and has a long history of behavioral issues. They weren't really told anything about this program.  My sister told my parents when asked about how she would pay that she had money saved from working at Starbucks and had taken a student loan.  My parents later found out that there was in fact no loan or money and that the huge tuition bill was due. My sister is 17 (18 in two months) and is still technically a minor.  The university is making lots of threats to my parents if they don't pay. However, they never knew about any of this or signed any paperwork to make them liable for a $10,000+ bill.   Legally, can the school come after my parents for this?	Yes
212	I don't know if this would be better suited for a different /r/ but this was the first place I thought of.  In western Virginia (VA) We are building a house in a neighborhood that has been established for over a decade.  Cox cable is the only provider of internet in the neighborhood as far as I can tell.  After over 3 months of trying to get an answer over the phone I go in person to the store and they tell me it will be $6,700 to run a cable to my house.  They say the neighborhood is at capacity, and they will need to build a new node.  They *might* subsidize some of the cost, but would probably still be $3,000-$4,000 my cost, and I won't know the exact amount until they install.  Does anyone know if cable providers have an obligation to provide service in areas, or are they actually allowed to charge people these high fees to install infrastructure.  The house is 400 feet from a pole that has RG6 cable on it.  Any suggestions of courses of action to take?  A place I could write, or contact?	Yes
213	I'm going to summarize a long story to ask this question; Over a year ago now I prepaid a firm to declare bankruptcy. Things seemed fine until I gave them the full amount in advance for the service. Then they disappeared for a month and when I finally did get a hold of them, they strung me along for another several months and refused to give my money back. Eventually after I reported them to the better business bureau, they agreed to pay 1/3 of the money back, but that was a month and a half ago and they still haven't sent the check... What can I do next to recover this money? This is in Ohio. Thank you!	Yes
214	Note: GeekChic may voluntarily refund or something, I don't know yet, but I'm trying to find out my worst-case-scenario options. I live in Oregon, GeekChic was located in Washington.  I placed an order for a custom coffee table through Geek Chic (a custom furniture manufacturer) in January. I paid for it in full ahead of time (as is required since they hand make every piece). They gave me an estimated delivery date of August-October, which is also typical.  However, they've now announced they're out of business and have stopped responding to calls, emails, etc. I don't believe my table is built (or finished), or in any way deliverable, and I've already paid for it in its entirety back in January ($4770).  GeekChic hasn't announced anything about customers money yet, but I'm trying to find out my options for what I could do if they don't (or can't) refund it. I paid for it with a Chase-branded Visa Signature card. Does anyone have any suggestions?

215	Just recently sold a car in California (where the law states a vehicle has to be sold smogged by the seller) that was not smogged. The purchaser signed a bill of sale noting the vehicle was not smogged and was sold as is (may make no difference).  The buyer did not know how to drive a stick and burnt up the clutch in the first 12 hours of driving the vehicle. He's aware that legally I was supposed to smog it. Not he's trying to sue me for the cost of the car plus tow bills and repairs. How far can get in small claims court past me just refunding him the money and me getting the broken car back. Do I have any leg to stand on? I was upfront with all issues the car had in the ad.	Yes
216	So I was working at my dad's perfume store yesterday so he can take a day off. And I don't have that much experience, I occasionally fill in whenever he needs to take a day off for something. So yesterday I thought it was my lucky day cause I had two groups of people come in and buy nearly 500$ worth of items each but with credit cards. Now once again I don't have that much experience with this type of work. I just sold them the stuff but the procedure was the same as with any other group of people buying multiple items. Show them multiple stuff, bargain, and eventually they buy the stuff. I entered the price on the machine, they put in the card, they put in the pin, they signed the receipt and it was the end of that. Turns out both groups used stolen cards. So I get a call from my brother today saying both cards were stolen and we might not get the money for the stuff. But I pretty much followed the procedure I was told to, its just I don't know why we wouldn't get the money back.	Yes
217	I am with T-mobile. I live in Texas.  I signed up with a promo with them in Feb. that I would get 2 lines plus a free line for $110/mo flat. This saved me a lot of money from my original plan, so I thought I would add my roommate (also with t-mobile) to our plan to share the savings. They told me that the free line was usually for new lines, but made an exception for us. (Otherwise, we would have to pay $20/mo additional for line forwarding).  It is now July and since they have been charging me $180/mo for services. I have been double charged in here as well. I have gotten this refunded twice from them. Today I called to get my third refund and was told that I never qualified (because roommate's previous line was with them) and that they would not honor it (by a second-tier manager).  I cannot afford other service providers, so switching is out. I really feel like this is terrible business practice and that T-mobile lied to me about my prices. If I didn't qualify I should have been told that before they switched my lines over. I don't think there is anything I can do legally(?), but any advice on how to get them to honor my original pricing?	Yes
218	So back in 2007 I moved out of the apartment I shared with my boyfriend at the time. He had thrashed a bunch of my belongings during a rough breakup and I had filed a police report, but eventually dropped the charges the police were planning on filing (domestic violence). He continued to live there, and I moved on. I NEVER signed the lease, but had agreed to be listed as an occupant - I don't recall if that involved giving them my social security number but they must have had it because when my ex left the apartment he did so a month early and didn't pay that rent. When I got the call from collections (now living in CA) I was super confused and asked if his name was also on the debt. They said no, it was just me.  Yes, I've waited a LONG ASS time to do anything, mostly because I have moved states a couple of times and have not been financially in a position to pursue him legally. I've asked him a couple of times to do the ethical thing and pay me the $700 but he is cheap and mean and will not.  At this point I get I may not have legal recourse, but just curious if this was even legal to do to a non-lease holder and would there be any way to remove the debt?	Yes
219	Backstory: My girlfriend and I just moved from CT to AZ for her work and my school. We agreed to use a moving company to transport our belongings to AZ. We contracted Radius Moving and Storage Corp for approximately $3200 based on assumed square footage of boxes. We agreed to the date of 6/25 at 0900-1100 arrival time for pick up of boxes that we packed. Radius did a no call no show. I attempted to reach out to them via a number on their website once they were late. Neither my girlfriend or I could reach someone until around 3 hours past their designated time slot. This individual informed us that they don't know what happened to the first truck so they were going to send another truck with an ETA of 1600-1800. 1800 comes and goes, once again we try to reach out to them and get the same no pick up or direct to voice mail treatment we were exposed to the first time around. Around 2000 we finally get ahold of someone. He said that the 2nd truck was involved in an accident. While unfortunate this still leaves us without a moving truck. After a lengthy back and forth conversation the individual said he would get us a truck for 0700-0900 time slot tomorrow (6/26). I get up around 0630 to ensure everything is lined up for their arrival. 0900 comes and goes no call no show. The next couple hours are filled with the same phone call avoidance and general neglect for our situation that we had become accustom to. Finally around 1300 a car and truck arrive to pack up our things. They left around 1630 with our things.   The overall treatment of company and the lack of professionalism in their response and customer service was deplorable. I was in the military for 9+ years and moved a bunch of times, i had never received this kind of treatment. Due to this and the fact that they were over 30 hrs late past our agreed time, my girlfriend and I believed we should get some money off of the final cost of the move (4300$). They said that 100$ should suffice, which is a slap in the face. Over the last couple weeks my girlfriend has been on the phone with them every day to try and track down our stuff which hasn't even left CT. Reading through their contract it says they can take up to 30 working days to deliver our things. Which is same time then it takes to get household good delivered from Hawaii to NY. After all this we asked for more money off. They told us that since we had written a negative review of them on the internet they would not give us any additional money off. We had not written anything yet which means we are not an isolated incident. As such they said they would give us 300$ off but we had to sign a contract prior to receiving the money.     The question: How is the below contract even legal? What can be done legally to this company? We are already planning on writing up a formal complaint with the BBB.    It feels like this is blackmail to ensure we don't write a scathing review of their practices.          RELEASE AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF CLAIM  Date:    07/11/2017                                                                                         Job#:XXXXXXXXX    Upon receipt by the undersigned of a check for consideration of the undersigned or his agent heirs, administrators, executors, successors, and assigns here and completely release and further discharge Radius Moving and Storage, it’s past, present or future officers, directors, stock holders, agents, representatives, employees, affiliates, partner(s) and successors from any and all past, present or future claims, demands, obligations, actions, rights, damage costs, expenses and compensation of any nature whatsoever, whether based on tort, contract or other theory of recovery, which undersigned or anyone entitled to any recovery, now has or which may hereafter accrue or otherwise be required on account of, or in anyway going out of the contract for services rendered and entered into between the parties named here within.

220	I have a buddy (yes, I am really asking for a friend) who is both physically and mentally disabled and was the victim of vehicle burglary resulting in about $10k of loss.  The insurance company requires a recorded statement but he is concerned about this as his condition requires a number of meds and his thought process is not what it used to be, pain meds, anti-depressants among others have clouded his brain.  Will providing this information at the beginning of the recording assist him in any way if there are any discrepancies found later between his statement and the physical facts of the loss?   He has Nothing to hide but is having anxiety resulting from the ins co. trying to find any small discrepancy to deny his claim.	Yes
221	So... When I was 17 I decided it was a good idea to begin taking out school loans (10,000-12,000 per year for 5 years) to go to a private Christian college. Dumbest decision of my life. This is my ONLY regret in life so far. I can't believe NO ONE told me it WASN'T a good idea to be taking out this much money in loans. I didn't even enjoy my time in college. It was terrible and the school was going through financial difficulties and it impacted the students negatively (so I feel that I didn't even get a quality education). Now it's been 3 years since graduation and I'm still regretting all of this. Almost every day I wish there was a way to retract my debt (even if it means retracting my BA). I'm sure I'm just screwed, but legally is there anything I could do to get out of this debt? Like suing the school or something? I'm sure there's not but it's on my mind pretty much all day everyday so I figured I'd at least ask. Thanks in advance!	Yes
222	I'm in Baltimore County, MD.  I just found out last night I am being sued by Amex for $14,959.50 - I had a CC with them with a limit of about 13,000 and at some point maxed out and was not able to make any more payments after December due to job loss and financial strain. My husband and I were also separated at the time.  I haven't been served yet but I know there is a filed suit against me because I got a letter from some credit company trying to get me to do debt consolidation.  I want to attempt to settle the debt but I don't know how to go about doing this with Amex. They're being represented by Zwicker Associates and I have read online they're a beast and don't like to settle. This isn't my only debt. I have others. One medical bill about $1500 and some other CC debt but I have been able to pay on all my other credit cards. What are the chances of them agreeing to a decreased amount on the principle over 5 years? I know I can't make a lump sum payment. How should I go about answering the summons when I am finally served?  I have 2 kids, my husband and I are barely scraping by as is. I am terrified. I own a home that we've had for 3 years and I don't want to lose it in a judgement or have a lien tacked onto it.	Yes
223	I bought a 2015 Jeep and I don't think it's all I wanted. All I've done so far is just put down a deposit and signed a few papers and then they let me drive off with it to come back tomorrow for finalization. I don't think I want the car anymore though - I just feel it was too hasty. Can I return it? Im fine without getting the deposit back.	Yes
224	"Hi all,  I'll try to keep this simple. My health plan(New York Medicaid) covers 20 visits of Physical therapy a year. I might or might not have gone over 20 visits when I started going to my current Physical Therapy Office. I went to PT for 3 visits and got billed $50 for each of the visits. Now in this point of my life, $150 is a boatload of money and can't afford to pay it off. Apparently my plan can't help me out as I went over the 20 plan limit and the PT office didn't confirm whether I was at my limit or not as well.  So I'm basically stuck with this bill and it will possibly be sent to collections. Now I have a ""plan"" perhaps on getting this resolved which may be a bit un-kosher. You see this same office billed my insurance company (NY Medicaid), for an EMG of the Neck and Lower Back and they were paid $3.5k for each part.  However when I asked the office for the report they tell me they only did and have a report for the EMG of the Neck not the lower back even though they billed my insurance for it and got paid $3.5k.  So I want to try to ask them to waive my physical therapy balance of $150, so that I look the other way and don't report them for billing fraud to my medicaid health plan. I'm not sure this will work but I am all out of options, and would like any and all advice."	Yes
225	So my fiancée went to Alfred Angelo for her dress, paid in full for dress and alterations. Receipts are all documented paper copies. The seamstress (outside contractor)  just called to tell us about that and now she is wanting payment for the alterations because Alfred Angelo never paid her. Called Alfred Angelo local store and they said they could do nothing. Customer service line is already shut off. It's only a matter of $279.00 USD but the point remains. What can we do?   Location: Pittsburgh PA  Edit: Cleared up who the seamstress works for	Yes
226	Hello,   I graduated High School this past summer, and bought my macbook from the school. The guarantee was that once the laptop was fully paid for, the school technology department would remove unnamed management software. I don't know if it is a keylogger, website monitoring software, or what additional restrictions exist. I know that I can not change my energy settings nor control my security and privacy options.  After I paid the school the full balance, the software was not removed. I emailed the technology department requesting removal and received a preliminary response days later stating the the lead for such matters had previously been on vacation, despite not having turned on any sort of automatic reply indicator.  I am currently overseas, and have limited wifi options. I requested that the technology department give me a timeslot that they needed me to connect to the internet within. I told them that I would make whatever time they gave work.  In response, I was told that they were unable to give me a time slot, but that it just had to be connected for a short period of time. I further emailed and explained that I was unable to just randomly have it on, as my time zone is multiple hours ahead and wifi is very limited in the city where I live, so I needed them to provide a time that worked for them, and I would cooperate with whatever time they set.  Since then, I have not received a single reply despite nearly 3 business days elapsing.  I understand that this issue may seem minor, but I bank off my computer, and am soon going to be hoping to use it for purposes of a more sensitive nature where I am legally unable to have outer management software installed on my device.   Thank you in advance for any information or advice.	Yes
227	Is there anything against selling an appliance or device that has roaches? A friend of mine bought a ps4 on Facebook group and it stopped working the next day and found out it was full of roaches. Previous Owner blocked us.	Yes
228	I was in a car accident while i was working. I get paid under the table. The vehicle was uninsured and unregistered, unbeknownst to me. When the police came right after the crash my boss took responsibility for owning the vehicle said i did not work for him. The court case with the city has been dealt with. Now insurance companies are sending me letters saying that they are suing me for 30000. I have no idea how to approach these insurance companies. Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you!	Yes
229	I have purchased digital currency, called Town Points, from a game called 'Town of Salem', owned by BlankMediaGames, and have never received it.   They have never replied to my emails — their only communication.   It's been a long time so I want to take legal action. Now their terms of service are pretty tricky and it basically makes me have no way of winning against them.   Here are their terms:   https://www.blankmediagames.com/terms/   https://www.blankmediagames.com/merch-store-terms-of-use-agreement/   A friend sent me these from their terms:  &gt; A. Negotiations. Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days.  They will not reply to the informal negotiations so I will wait until that is over — which is soon, then take legal action.  &gt;YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS BlankMediaGames FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND COSTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES)  &gt;BlankMediaGames RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON *OR NO REASON*, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU.  This means they can just destroy my account freely even after I win a legal battle and finally receive my digital currency. Correct?  &gt;IN NO EVENT SHALL BlankMediaGames BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ANY AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO BlankMediaGames FOR GAME-RELATED TRANSACTIONS  Does this mean they cannot be liable for more than what I've spent on them in the in-game store?  &gt;NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF Town Points  This includes purchasing — but says nothing about receiving.....  &gt;BlankMediaGames SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE *DESTRUCTION*, *DELETION*, *MODIFICATION*, IMPAIRMENT, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR *Town Points*  So they can say they added it — but then deleted it and not be liable? They can basically delete my Town Points at their will.  &gt;If there is a dispute regarding payment of fees to BlankMediaGames, your Account may be closed without warning or notice at the sole discretion of BlankMediaGames.  I can't refund nor dispute.  &gt;BlankMediaGames has the right, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you.   Does assets confine 'Town Points'?  &gt;As BlankMediaGames feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion BlankMediaGames may limit the total Town Points that may be held in your Account.  Can they say my limit is 0?  &gt;YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR Town Points THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR Town Points OR VIRTUAL ITEMS.   &gt;You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Town Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify BlankMediaGames immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Town Points balance. BlankMediaGames will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. BlankMediaGames will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.  So... they can legally say my claim is invalid, even if valid, because of their sole and absolute discretion.   I must take legal action, but I don't know where to start or what the laws confined in digital goods are. I've emailed them and it's been a while without a reply, and I cannot wait for their 'sole and absolute discretion' to determine anything malicious as a resolution — I want the law. I don't have a lawyer or know of an arbitrator, but I do have $25,000 ready for all the fees that this will bring.   What's my best course of action?	Yes
230	Hi all, I am not sure if this is the right forum, but I need some advice on how to resolve my situation. I apologize for the length here. I traded in my current 2014 Nissan Altima lease on January 28, 2017, two months before the lease was due for a 2017 Nissan Altima, which I was required to make a payment of $397 on the day of trade. I spent over 6 hours at the dealership, at which time they indicated they had the car I wanted, but it would have to be driven in from downtown Los Angeles, I live in South Bay California. The dealer indicated it would only take an hour and be done before I was done my finance paperwork. I met with the finance dealer, we signed all paperwork, I gave him copies of my registration and proof of car insurance for the 2014 Nissan Altima. After my meeting, I was told the car would be another hour or two, I asked since I signed the paperwork, could they come by my house since I live two miles away, the dealer nicely obliged. Around 7:00pm that night, the salesman showed up with my car, which we exchanged keys and gave me what appeared to be my paperwork. Fast forward a few weeks, I noticed I had two Nissan Finance accounts, one for my 2014 and one for my 2017. The 2014 had one payment remaining of $355 and I called Nissan Finance at which time I was told likely the “grounding paperwork” is still in process and not to worry. I immediately called the dealership and asked what is going on and was assured the paperwork is in process. Over the course of the next four months, I worked with the General Manager of the dealership and Nissan Finance (both refuse to work together) and the paperwork had not been filed to date. Last month I checked my credit, which had dropped from 815 to 750, then this month it dropped from 750 to 680 due to 150 day late payment on my 2014 Nissan Altima. Finally the dealership got paperwork together, backdated the contract and paperwork to January 28th (so they say) and paid off all fines, penalties, and payments related to the 2014 Nissan Altima. The kicker, Nissan Finance has refused to remove the late payments from my credit report as the Nissan dealership did not provide them any letter stating responsibility for the lateness of the payments as a fault of their own. The dealership refused to accept my calls or emails or my showing up on site. I have contacted an attorney and been told I should start arbitration, but I will need to figure out a monetary number for which my credit was impacted. I have also contacted the state of California Attorney General, Better Business Bureau and filed complaints on Yelp and Google. I have over 40 documented phone calls to the Nissan Dealer and multiple site visits. Nissan Consumer Affairs told me it is not their problem as well as Nissan Finance. I really do not know what to do here anymore, do I go ahead with arbitration? My friend was with me when I turned my car over to the salesman. Is there any help that I have emails with the dealership admitting fault for the incident and admitting it would be “taken care of”. Nissan Finance nor the dealership will give me proof payment was made except confirming on the phone I no longer owe anything on the 2014 Nissan Altima. I know this is unlikely to gain much traction, but worth a shot.	Yes
231	The contract is signed under California law. I've billed them on this card previously, but they sent me an email saying I'm not allowed to use that card any more. However, they haven't paid me and see to not want to pay me. Is it legal for me to charge them on that card, considering the previous authorization and how past due the invoice is?	Yes
232	So long story short, I was awarded this scholarship by a university to complete a Master's programme with them. However, I ended up not getting admitted to the course, and hence would have to forfeit my scholarship.   But the scholarship department transferred the money to my bank account (due to a lack of communication between departments) but is now asking for it back.  Aside from moral dubiousness, how legal would it be for me to just block the email and keep the money to pay for a Master's programme at another university? I never signed any legal document (I think) apart from the below acceptance form but I'm not sure if it's legally binding. I'm still wrestling with the moral dilemma but I'd still like to know whether or not it would be legal. Any help would be appreciated!   Picture of form: http://imgur.com/a/vOpo4	Yes
233	I'm in Oklahoma and I had stuff at a storage facility that a friend owned. He sold the facility and then the new owners sold my stuff. I never had a contract or signed anything the agreement I had originally was verbal. I found out they sold the stuff this past January. Do I have any kind of recourse here?	Yes
234	Hello,  A large US based retailer is not honoring the sale price for 2 suits that was advertised on their website. Just an fyi I am located in Canada and they operate here as well (online store and brick &amp; mortar stores).  I’ve spoken to three different reps before hand who assured me the price would be honored. They said I would get refunded the difference in about 1-2 weeks. It was close to 2 weeks after my purchase and I didn’t receive any refunds so I called back and they said they wouldn’t be able to honor the price anymore. I’ve complained countless times and management finally said they can honor both suits (They were very reluctant and made it difficult for me, they even closed my case without notice).   Again about a month has passed and I still didn’t receive my full refund balance. Now after reaching out to management, they are saying they can only honor the one suit even after providing screenshots of the product listing with the sale price.   Is this against the law? In Canada we have a law should cover this (http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00522.html#sale) and I believe this falls into this category. The sale price was still on the website 2 days after I made my purchase and they didn’t resolve the issue with me right away (I had to reach out to them to find out) and is still on going after more than 2 months.   Secondly, I was charged a large amount of taxes and duties on the original price I paid but since I’m paying the sale price, shouldn’t I get refunded the difference in the duties/taxes fees? Again they are refusing to reimburse me for those fees that were charged.  I’m not sure how much of a case I have but would love to hear your thoughts and if you have any suggestions. Much appreciated!	Yes
235	I’m currently in settlement negotiations with a creditor for approximately $3k.  It’s not a whole lot of money, so I am trying to negotiate that the creditor remove all information in my credit report before paying them.  The attorney representing the creditor said ‘no,’ but I can’t imagine the creditor willing to pay more for a lawsuit than what it actually owed.  Do I have any leverage here at all? Does the creditor even own the account anymore or did they account to the law firm? The creditor is a nationwide company.  Any info or advice about negotiations would be appreciated.  Please hold any holier-than-thou speeches of paying bills on time.  Thank you.	Yes
236	"However yesterday they called me and asked me for my account and transit number because ""They are not in the check that you gave us""   Now I assure you I gave a legit check in fact it was from the same stack that I gave to them the last new car I bought.  I think they lost my void check. What do I do in my situation? Is it safe to have a lost check out there? Does the dealership have any standing to make me replace void check?   What if I catch them in a lie and they verbally admit they lost my check and lied about the no account number stuff. (Canada is 1 party consent I double checked)   Should I just send in another check?"	Yes
237	Im renting a house with someone I thought was a friend and the lease started in July. I'm not currently living there over summer because I'm a student with a job back home but am still paying rent for the month. My roommate was supposed to mail in our rent check and said he did, but our landlord has not received it. We've all (about 3 of us) have been calling/texting/messaging him for 7 days now asking him to void the check (if he ever even sent it) and to send a new one. Our rent is now almost a week and a half late and I literally cannot do anything unless I get ahold of him. What are my options? The house and my (ex) roommate are in Oregon, by the way.	Yes
238	I need to file a small claims proceedings against a large national chain. The location I dealt with is now closed permanently (part of why I am suing). How do I determine who exactly I file the action against? The main corporate office (national)? A state or regional office if i can find that? How does that work?	Yes
239	"Location: Netherlands  I recently decided to make the jump onto the Oculus Rift + Touch bundle for €450 from Oculus directly, tried it for a few days, and decided it's not for me.  I set out to get a refund from Oculus, and noticed that  &gt; As per Section 4.4 of our Terms of Service, located [here](https://www.oculus.com/legal/terms-of-service/), we do not provide refunds for opened or used hardware products, so the Rift cannot be returned.  I decided to email them for a refund regardless, because as far as I know I have the rights to get a complete refund. That's when I got sent the above message.  When I told them the Oculus Touch box is still unopened, they replied  &gt; we can look further into what can be done about them.  I asked some friends for advice and we think we found the right law to call upon, and formatted an email for Oculus.  This is the template:  &gt; ""Pursuant to Chapter 3, Article 9 of Directive 2011/83/EU, I (full name) of (address) exercise my right to withdraw from the Contract from the sale of an Oculus Rift and Touch Controllers by (legal title of the seller).  &gt; &gt; Under this Directive I am entitled to a full refund upon notification of withdrawal within 14 days of delivery. A receipt of the sale of goods and delivery confirmation are attached. &gt; &gt; Please provide a return shipping label by COB (insert date) for return of the goods.  &gt; &gt; Thank you.""  Could you please enlighten me if what we've come up with is the correct procedure?  The facts:  - I live in The Netherlands - I bought the Oculus Rift + Touch Bundle from Oculus VR Ireland Limited through Paypal - I received the product 6 days ago, on July 11th - The Oculus Rift was used for a few days to test it - Oculus Touch is still unopened in box - As far as I know, there were no seals I have broken  Thank you!  P.S.: If I've done anything incorrectly or if you need more information, please let me know. I'm completely new to this sub!"	Yes
240	I moved into an apartment in Florida with a roommate and paid the entire deposit (chalking that one up to a life lesson). Now that we are moving out, I am moving to a separate state and she is simply moving to a smaller apartment in the same complex. Because she is staying, the complex is automatically moving our deposit from the current apartment into her new one, and not cutting any portion in a check.  Both of our names are on the current lease, only her name is on the new lease. Am I just out all this money or do I have any legal grounds to force her to send me half? Is there any way I can force the apartment to send a check instead of simply giving the entire deposit to her?	Yes
241	I live in Washington. I have bipolar disorder and I had a severe manic episode that started around the 20th of June. On June 28th, I bought a 2013 Subaru WRX STI. I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k.    Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership.   I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price). They took the other route and had their lawyer send an email basically just saying there's no 3 day grace period or anything like that in Washington.   I know I'm definitely knee-deep in shit for this, but does anyone have any suggestions? I'm debating just leaving it there and taking the credit hit from a default. I make pretty good money for my age but I don't want to be stuck with those ridiculous payments. Even just seeing the car gives me anxiety and reminds me of all the bad decisions I made during that manic episode.	Yes
242	"I'm a US citizen who lives as an expat in the Czech Republic and have a huge medical bill in Colorado that I cannot afford to pay, and now debt collectors keep sending my brother notices (I have my US mail sent to him).  Some background: I was visiting family after spending a year in Vietnam and got very sick two days before flying to Europe. I thought it might be a parasite (I previously had one in Vietnam) and was informed by a nurse hotline that only an ER can check for parasites on this short of notice.   So I went to the ER and they gave me an IV drip, did blood work and stool sample, and gave me some meds. They would not give me any sort of figure for how much all of this would cost, not even ballpark. They just said ""it varies"". They were pushing to do a stomach ultrasound and I refused because it sounded expensive. They were very unsympathetic to the fact that I had no US health insurance and that I'd be paying out of pocket.  Now I have a bill for over $5000 that I can't pay. I don't even have any assets worth that much money.  I don't live in the US anymore, although I visit about every two years. What's my best option here? What sort of legal action are they able to take? Do debt collectors do payment plans? Are they able to go after my brother?"	Yes
243	I'll preface this by pointing out that I have not yet spoken to a bankruptcy lawyer or an accountant about this, and am just looking for some direction about my next step before I commit to spending anything more.  I'll post a TL;DR at the end.  I am a carpenter with 15 years experience who decided 2.5 years ago to start up my own small contracting company.  The way I saw it, business in my area was really picking up and I had a solid small group of skilled guys willing to work with me to build something new.  I also had my father, himself a contractor since before I was born, giving me advice and even providing startup cash.  It seemed like a great idea at the time and I did make some food money for a while.  Fast forward to about 8 months ago.  My wife was pregnant with our first and after a couple of bad rental homes (one infested with bedbugs) I had an opportunity to buy a foreclosure at a ridiculously low price that needed some work.  At the time the company was between jobs, but I had about 35k in the bank for starting cash on my next contract due to start in January.  Now, I should add that I never took any accounting courses in college and that for the first year I had my father's office manager doing my books part time until things got so busy she couldn't anymore and I had to switch to quickbooks and manage it myself.  After getting nailed on taxes the year before for having made about 40k in pure profit over the year I decided on December 31st to take out the down payment for my house in the form of a bonus, the gross of which equalled about 30k.  What i did not realize, since I had never before run into any issue with cashflow, was that my payroll tax was not withdrawn until the end of the quarter, so I had not included it when I figured how much to withdraw.    Anyways, I ended up very short when it came time to pay the tax and I now owe the IRS about 17k.  To make matters worse, that contract ended up being a huge loser, and I can't even be sure I will be able to pay my suppliers and subcontractors when it is all said and done.  I project coming up about 2k short after getting the retainage at closeout, and then I still owe the IRS 17k.  So at 19k in debt (at best, it's probably more) and no cash and no future contracts (I stopped bidding when my crew of guys fell apart because of iniuries and other issues and it came down to me alone working to finish the job) I am wondering if I should talk to a bankruptcy lawyer or if there are other options that I should pursue.    At this point I just want to shut down the company and go back to working as a carpenter, since there is serious demand for carpenters and basically none available and I could land a solid job in a day.  I also want to pay my debts and leave the opening to use the LLC for small side projects and such, but I just don't know if that's possible at this point.  I really fucked up and have learned a lot about accounting since but it is too little too late.  I really want to avoid any serious problems with the IRS and am trying to set up a payment plan that I can afford. What should I do?  TL;DR: one stupid accounting mistake and a bad contract have landed my LLC at about $19k in debt with no cash and no future revenue, 17k of that owed to the IRS.  Do I talk to a bankruptcy lawyer?	Yes
244	The police emergency detained me because they believed I was suicidal. I was in my car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazards on as I was crying and couldn't drive with blurred vision. They took it upon themselves to assume I was suicidal even though I made no indication of it, have no history of mental illness or even a police record.  I was forced into the back of a police cruiser, taken to the ER against my will, and they tried to charge me $2400. I negotiated it down to ~$650 and left. The doctor cleared me after talking to me for 5 minutes because he knew I should not have been detained for anything. I did not even have to see a psychiatrist as the police earlier said.  I'm not sure if there is anything I can do, but I was hoping to find some advice.     TLDR: Police detained me wrongfully, forced me to go to ER, and I am stuck with the bill now.	Yes
245	Greetings /r/Legaladvice  Im located in Australia, and im chasing up some legal advice..well further legal advice.  a now former friend is demanding i pay back a small debt of 1400 AUD it used to be 1900 AUD, but its gotten to the point where i was sick of the abuse and stuff that ive blocked her from all comms between us.  Do i need to still pay the person back despite the debt being over 10+ years?  Heres what i know according to legal id Queensland &amp; Victoria (A me being in Queensland and her in Victoria)  Both Legal Aid QLD and Victoria both have stated that since its been 10+ years since the debt has been and that she never asked for it back originaly back in 04 sometime when she got me back home out of her own pocket for a flight via Qantas Australia, Both have stated that she really doesnt have a case in the courts as its over the time period and realisticly no judge or lawyer would want to touch the case as it would cost more in laywer fees then the case or money itself.  However, wanting to double check and recheck or basises and asses, Ive come to you guys asking.  Appreacte the time :)	Yes
246	"Alberta, Canada.  Back in September 2014, my mom got a call from this company that wanted to introduce an online tutoring service. My mom was interested so she invited them to our home. My parents spoke to the sales lady for about four hours and signed contracts with them that same day.  One month after using it, my siblings and I found the program really generic and unhelpful so we asked our parents to cancel it. A sales person came to our home again to ask us about our problems with their services. They only called back to say that there is no possible way to cancel it.  In the contract that my parents signed for the buyers right to cancel, it specifically says: ""If you do not receive the goods or services within 30 days of the date stated in the contract, you may cancel this contract within one year of the contract date. You lose that right if you accept the delivery after 30 days. There are other grounds for extended cancellation.""  The issue:  This part is important!!! In the contract to pay each monthly Loan payment of $183 for a term of 60 months it says: *""We are aware that other than the cancellation rights contained in the Notice of Buyers Right to Cancel, which are outlined on the Purchase Order, we cannot cancel the purchase and/or the Loan.* I also acknowledge and agree that no representative of __company name___ has promised or represented to us that we may cancel the Purchase and/or the Loan."" (they signed this the same day as the buyers right to cancel contract).   To be sure, does that mean my parents signed a contract making them unable to terminate the contract? It sounds like my parents are surely bound to this for two more years, but still, I want to ask because I want to be hopeful, is there any way to cancel this? In the end, it's going to be a financial loss of almost 11 thousand dollars...  According to BBB the company ceased operations but say customers are still receiving customer service from another company based in a different province. The customer service is a joke. That same company has received over a hundred bad reviews on google experiencing the same problem as us. I notice that the company seems to target low-income or immigrant families which make them easier to fool. It's really unfortunate.    Do my parents have ANY recourse in this situation? Thanks in advance for any guidance. Sorry if the format is really bad."	Yes
247	"One of the stones of an expensive necklace I purchased fell out and broke.  This stone is unique to the manufacturer (because of its cut, I don't think I'll find it anywhere else).  I found the necklace still for sale on the brand's company website.   Ideally, I would purchase a replacement stone from them at a fair price.  In communication with their customer service team, they said ""normally we offer a one year warranty, however since the purchase was made over a year ago, we can't replace it. Also, we are not able to make repairs.""  Also they claim not to have any replacement stones.  I'm just looking to purchase a replacement stone so I don't have to purchase a whole new necklace.  Are there any consumer protection laws applicable?  Company HQ is in TX, I am in GA."	Yes
248	"So, our contractor completely abandoned us on Saturday, and we don't know what to do. We hired these three guys who gave us an incredibly low price to remodel a condo that we purchased in May. They started work on our place on June 1 and were supposed to be done on June 30. He told us that he would remodel our place for a certain amount: $13,500. These same guys did renovation work for our neighbor in the same condo community, so we made a huge mistake and simply made everything verbal instead of writing it down. I asked him to write it down, but he never actually did even though he promised to do so.  So, the first week, the lead contractor bailed on us and went on vacation while the other two guys started sound demolition work. Everything was fine, until he came back a week later and started asking for more money to do other things. We thought, ""okay, we are asking him to move some walls around and some things are more expensive,"" so we just allowed it and paid extra. This became a common occurrence as things progressed; he started telling us that we had to pay for faucets, for light fixtures, for shower doors, etc., and we had no recourse because we didn't write anything down  Two weeks later, after there was not a ton of work done, the lead guy tells us that his wife's grandmother was in an accident in Mexico. He left the country for two weeks, and his other guys did work. He came back last Friday, and we didn't even know what to say to him because we are paying for rent in our old place while waiting for our new place to become livable. He didn't say too much to us either, and they left and took all of their tools on Friday.  They were supposed to come back on Saturday, but never showed up. I blew up this guy's phone, and he finally answered and said that he wasn't going to work for us anymore because we ""disrespected him by ignoring him.""  In total, we paid them around $12k, and there isn't a single room completely finished. If anyone has had a similar experience or knows some options, we are all ears. We have called our homeowner's insurance, and my wife thinks we may have some luck there, but otherwise we are nearly broke and can't afford to pay for another contractor on top of it.   Hoping there is someone out there who can help! Thanks in advance!"	Yes
249	I'm in Amarillo, TX. I paid my rent online an hour after midnight on the third. The deadline is the third, so I was technically late by an hour. The total fees are $100, and the letter I received on my door yesterday says I have to pay with a cashier's check or face further penalties, and my lock will be changed. My rent is $620. Is this fee excessive? I was given the notice Friday. Can they continue to charge penalties until I can pay the fee on Monday? Do I have any recourse? Thanks in advance for any help.	Yes
250	I have had many interactions with Home Depot's customer service over the 4th of July weekend. They tried to overcharge me two a half times over a $500 order. In the end I had to beg a friend's family member to make 6+ trips to the store that is serveral miles  away using  a 4 seater car, instead of the company's delivery truck that should have arrived 48 after the order was placed.   I contacted the home depot's customer  support after 96 hours of not hearing from them and I was told by them I had to come into the store, which was the only way for me to pick up even just half of the merchandise that I was overcharged for because they did not have enough in stock. They gave me a small discount in the store and I returned home less then 1/3 of my total order due to my noticing of  a large discrepancy on the pricing of the item in question when I was checking on it on my tablet on the website whilst in store.  The next morning I  re opened neutral negotiations with my growing antagonist and calmly asked for why there was such a discrepancy and why I was overcharged, not informed of a delay in shipping or even contacted at all. After 3 hours of contacting their support rep and getting nowhere I ended up ordering the same exact gardening supplies on my friends Amazon prime and informed Home Depot that I wanted a full refund on all the merchandise that I had not received. Although my original payment method at home depot's website was a credit card instead of refunding the money to my card, I just received a call this morning asking me to come into the store in person to receive the refund. Why would they do this rather then just refund my card?  All I am doing is a little legal (as of this year) gardening and I am not white and they were all Caucasian, so to me it seems a little bit sketchy. Any opinions ?	Yes
251	Hi r/legaladvice,  I have a question regarding the enforcement of a judge's ruling, and provincial jurisdictions in Canadian courts for small claims.    So to give some short background info, I want to file a case in Small Claims Court against an ex-girlfriend who I lent a lump sum of money to for a week. It's been years and she refuses to pay me back, so I want to go the legal route to get my money back from her.    The issue is that I live in Ontario (whereas she now lives in Alberta) and would like to file the case here, in an Ontario court. The incident also happened in Ontario, so the courts here will accept the case. The problem is that if a judge rules in my favour and she must pay me back, they can't enforce the ruling in Alberta where she lives now, because it's out of their jurisdiction.    So the person I spoke to for information in the Ontario Small Claims Court said I should find out if Alberta courts will enforce rulings made by Ontario courts? I did a lot of online research and couldn't find an answer, so would anyone here know if they would?	Yes
252	Not sure my state matters,  I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I need advice and feel stupid.   I received my first credit last week.  It's through Capital One. I activated it, set up my account, then used it at the grocery store for $7.  Today I went to pay my electric bill and it was declined.  When I check my online account I see they locked my card due to fraud.   I call Capital One and get directed to their fraud specialist.  Initially she tells me there is no fraud,  the card just isn't activated yet.  She puts me on hold to fix it.  Before this, she verified: My social Phone number Email address Credit card number and crv on the back  When she comes back she informs me she no longer thinks I am who I say am.  She tells me someone else called and asked for a new card to be sent out (somehow verified all the info down to my credit card number??)  So she tells me in order to prove I am who I say I am I need to email them a front and back photo of my drivers license, a front and back photo of my social security card and a photo of a utility bill in my name.   I understand they need to verify me,  but the whole explanation was very sketchy and I'm really nervous to email them all this info.   I could really use some advice please.   Thank you so much.	Yes
253	My family owes state taxes to the tune of about $700. (We owe more than that, but I don't recall what year this is about)   Yesterday, July 14th, we received a letter stating that a lien had been placed. Today, we received a letter stating that we had ten days to do something before they would begin garnishing our wages and selling our personal property.   We can not afford this. My wife lost her job this same week and we have close to $5000 in debt from a bed hold at the nursing home my mother-in-law lived at before her death last month. We were barely making ends meet to begin with and are tapped out as far as any other way to get money. Is there anything we can do?	Yes
254	Hi. I went to Miami with a girl, and had her sign an electronic contract that we were splitting all costs. Total came to $507 for the trip. This included festival tickets, rental car, gasoline, lodging, and parking fees. I paid for all pre-trip because I get good deals on things if I do. I have texts also backing up that we agreed to split them all.   She gave me $55 before we left for Miami. When we got back, she said she was moving to Tennessee (lie, found out where she works in our local mall) and would pay me gradually as she was settled. She's sent me $65 over the course of two months, and an $50 Amazon gift card.   She blocked my number and all my social media accounts, so I contacted her boyfriend. He said he would pay me back the $, but he wants to see my messages with her from Feb - July. I have all of the messages, I never deleted them. But we were actually friends and some of them are about her selling nudes online for $ and him cheating on her. I would rather do this a legal route through small claims court, but how much is it just to file a claim? How much stress is it?	Yes
255	I was working contract for an oilfield company and resigned from the position. My boss has since been bitter and threatened not to pay me. I quit because he was inconsistent and unreliable with paying me. The time limit for acquiring my checks are 21-28 days after the invoice is created. It's day 28 and he has yet to contact me. What is my next step?	Yes
256	Basically we hired this lady 6 months ago to be our wedding caterer. We were given an outline on pricing and sent over a deposit and agreed in principle over the phone to a price for the food and labor. I don't even want to get into how we got so far along without everything being signed and settled.  Well two weeks before the wedding she sent a revised budget and basically doubled the price of everything. When we asked her to honor the original prices that she agreed to she refused. So we fired her from the wedding a week out. Only downside is that she has several thousand of our dollars.   What is the best course of action to get the money back from her? Obliviously we have asked her directly and have not been able to get a hold of her. What steps should we take to apply the most pressure on her to refund us?	Yes
257	Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
258	Here's what I know.   Back in March of 2017, I used my roommates phone and account for Lyft but used my card information to pay for ride. Afterward, we deleted the app and it was done.   In June, my roommate wrecked his car.   The charges were small because I didn't notice them until a week ago (end of June) and notices they were coming up more frequently.   I have probably cause that my roommate is using my card information without my permission to use Lyft.   Where do I go from here?   I called my bank and Lyft and have taken care of it on that end.	Yes
259	I'm just wondering if I'm opening myself up to anything here. I bought a car last year and was told that it had a clean title. When I asked if it had been in any accidents they avoided the question. I Carfaxed the car a couple months ago and found out it was a total loss rebuilt that is somehow not marked on the title.   I submitted a BBB complaint and the owner has done nothing but make up lies, saying I was told about the damage and repair before purchase, and even lying by saying I hadn't driven the car prior to purchase.  It's ridiculous, and at this point if I'm not going to be compensated I will make sure others know about their practices.	Yes
260	This is in Brooklyn, NY. Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage.   Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,  The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.  When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.  The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife.   The body damage is just cosmetic so it wouldn't be thousands (I don't think) to fix, but it would be at least a few hundred, maybe more. I'm also really anxious about what was done in my car without me knowing and how often this might have happened. I am due to move out of state this Thursday, 7/13, so I'll be severing my relationship with the garage anyway, but I'd appreciate any advice on how best to proceed. Thanks!	Yes
261	Bought a car with my ex about 6 years ago. Was on and off with payments most of the time. My Ex leaves me and leaves me with the car and no way to contact her. About 3 years ago they took it back. Then said we still owed over 6,000. I never responded or made any attempt to pay for that as I no longer had a way to get around. Costing me more money to live. If I could have afforded to I would gladly pay for my mistake. Still don't have a car and still too poor to do anything about it right now with a 2yr old to watch. Not to mention the 30 minute drive to his babysitter. I got issued some legal paperwork from the local official, was wondering what the chances of getting the bill split between the two parties is, and basically what to expect in a worst case best case format.	Yes
262	Tl;dr: booked hotel, they upped reservation price after the fact. called bank to reject the charge and now hotel is threatening legal action and am just wondering if they have the right to do that.  I was looking for a place to stay for a few days in NYC and had stumbled on this hotel. Thinking it was okay for the price I had booked a reservation to stay only to find out the price that I had booked it for was later raised and I was charged for it. When i called to try to cancel the reservation they had said there would be a cancellation fee equal to the booking cost, which had already been charged to my card months in advance of the reservation date. I called my bank claiming fraud, that was charged wrongly and today i receive a call from the hotel threatening me with legal action asking for triple damage charges. I don't know what to do and feel entirely wronged. I do see that I had told the bank fraud, where in fact that mag not be the correct way but I was so frustrated and flustered that I didn't know what to do. I really need help on this and need to know what to do to just get this out of my hair.	Yes
263	Hi /r/legaladvice, throwaway here.  I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options. On my separation agreement, they extended my exercise period from 90 days to 2 years, which made me not buy the shares and wait for an exit or something like that. Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.  Around 10 months after the separation agreement, my options were cancelled, and the CEO said this was because the extension wasn't allowed under the stock option agreement. A few lawyers went through the agreements and said this was BS. Despite this, she (the CEO) tried to make a monetary agreement for a fraction of what the shares are worth for me to give them up.  I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.  Should I try emailing the directors explaining my story, or go straight to a lawyer and send a letter of demand?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
264	I own a media circuit board company in Colorado. 3 weeks ago, I sent out a board that was broken to a testing and repair facility, hoping to have them repair it. It would have been worth around $7k. They determined they couldn't fix it, and would send it back. I sent them another one worth $5k to test a week ago, they said they'd respond to me the day they got it.   I've called the office many times, it goes straight to voicemail. They do not respond to my emails. Fedex Tracking stated that it was signed for. I had a buyer lined up which now I've lost due to them not responding. This is causing me significant damage to my business, given they are the highest end product I offer.   I have no idea what to do to get it back or more, I have no legal experience. Please help!	Yes
265	"Reposting for clarity.  Nearly three years ago, we had two garage door openers installed by Bill. Over the next year or so, Bill came several times to work on not only the new openers, but also on an opener that he had installed for the previous owner of the property. The work on the two new openers was covered under warranty.   Over the last year, all three openers stopped working. Due to Bill's deteriorating health, we opted not to call him and instead to just open the doors manually.   Bill died this spring and his widow sold the company and the customer list to two guys with no previous experience- just general handyman experience. The new owners called my husband to introduce themselves, and my husband told them that they could come give us an estimate on fixing the three openers, and also to see if they were under any type of warranty.   The first day, one of the partners was met at our property with someone who seemed to know what he was doing. They spent time looking at the openers, but didn't actually do any work.   A couple of months later, the partner came out. He told me several times that he had no experience with openers and was learning as he went along. He spent a couple of hours here. He got one opener working, and told me I would have to replace the second new opener. I expressed to him that I had no interest in a new opener and would just open it manually. He ended up ""trying one more thing"" and had it working 15 minutes later. He also worked on the third opener and told me it was in working condition.   Before he left, he told me that they had 5.5 hours of work in. I nodded uncommittally, remembering that my husband had told him that we needed an estimate, and also that the new doors may have been covered under warranty.   Instead of receiving an estimate, they charged us $60 an hour so they could learn how to fix garage doors.   I am planning to call and dispute this ridiculous amount (can I charge him $200 an hour to listen to how horrible his ex wife was?), but wasn't sure what my legal options are. Thanks."	Yes
266	I wanted to get my watch fixed, the repairman said they would get it fixed for $1,000. It took them 3 months to get back to me and in the end, it still did not work. He refused to give back a refund, what legal action should I take to get the $1,000 back?	Yes
267	"Last year, myself and hundreds of others put our money down on a product called a ""Marble DCS"". The company is an established company with another successful product. The ""DCS"" was offered in two versions, the DCS-1 and DCS-2.   The promised ship date or the DCS-1 was October 2016. Units were finally being reported as received by backers in May 2017, 9 months after the promised ship date.   But everyone who paid for and backed the DCS-2, has yet to receive anything other than emails describing ""engineering challenges"", and offers to change their order to a DCS-1 instead. The DCS-1 has completely different ports and options.  I've been trading emails with their support asking for an ETA on when the DCS-2 will ship, or asking them to refund the money they've already collected a year ago from backers.   Their only responses are continued emails asking me to change my order to the DCS-1, instead of ""waiting for"" the DCS-2. The DCS-1 will not work for me, nor hundreds of other backers who paid for theirs.   After more stonewalling, I've asked them to pass on the details of their legal department, and haven't heard back in weeks. My bank claims that they cannot return the funds or file a claim because it's more than 75 days past the promised ship date.   What are my options here, or should I just write this off as being a victim of yet another vaporware fraud campaign?"	Yes
268	My kids (9 and 8) are doing a dermatology study on a cream of some sort. When the dr approached us we were told they would each receive $650 for about 16 weeks of study, using meds and getting blood drawn. We discussed this with them and they wanted to do it. Upon signing the paperwork we noticed that it said the payment would be $500 for each. My wife talked to the Drs tech about it and she was assured that the payment was $650 and that it would be changed. Fast forward until now and we are being told it is actually only $500 and that we signed for that amount. Drs office isn't willing to do anything about it. Do I have any legal action I can take or are my kids just screwed for trusting them the staff in the beginning?	Yes
269	How do I get proper legal advice on this? do I approach a tax attorney or an accountant? I used TurboTax to file taxes for the past two years.  Is getting proper legal advice going to be more expensive (or close) to paying this debt directly?  If I can get advice on this directly that would be great, but I am almost more afraid and need advice on getting the proper legal advice itself.	Yes
270	I bought a house. I was aware of small amounts of termite damage. Easily fixable. I start removing siding and find that almost half the house is eaten away.  There has been a bond on the house since 1998. The previous owners treated in 2013. They also did an extensive remodel. I pulled down sheet rock with manufacture dates right before they put the house on the market.  There is also damage where the house leaks every time it rains. The sheet rock covered up the termite damage and the leaking damage. It is very obvious that they new there were covering it up. Can I sue? I am up to 45k in repairs as of now.	Yes
271	I inherited an older house and it needed a new roof. Searched for roofers, found a guy, and hired him.      Materials and dumpsters paid for directly by me. About $25,000. (It's a metal roof where the metal is stamped to look like slate and they interlock like a puzzle. That's why so expensive.)      His labor was agreed to be $10,000. Half up front, the rest upon completion.      This was February 21st. It's now almost halfway through July and the roof is only half finished. He comes sporadically and will go a week or more at a time without coming. He has left trash all over the yard. He is wasting materials. Basically, the guy is a mess and I want to hire someone else.      But we signed a contract before he started. I am worried that if I fire him and hire someone else he might be able to sue.      Can I fire him without being liable?      Would I be able to sue him for the wasted materials, months worth of dumpster rental, or anything else?      I can upload pictures of the contract if it helps.      Thanks!!	Yes
272	I am currently battling with my insurance company about my claims. This is not for an car accident claims. Just strictly medical treatment and I am in the State of Washington.   I started receiving medical treatment back in April 2016. and inquired about starting my claims in September 2016. I made all the inquiries through emails and never actually submitted my claims. They told told me is that, in order for them to reimburse me, I have to make the payment out of pocket. I did not have the money to pay for the expenses at the time so delayed my claims. They NEVER told me that I have to submit my claims within 180 days of my services.  I finally was able to make payments on the medical services in July 2017. Subsequently, I my claims and the Company deny reimbursement for treatment received from April 2016 through December 2016 since it was outside of the 180 days window.   I was doing some research and it mentioned something about Washington State is a notice prejudice state but I am not sure if it has been extended to health insurance claims.   Am I out of luck? Is there anything that can help me?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
273	I purchased a website about 6 months ago, however the website was not as described, and does not have the capabilities that were promised (such as a fully functional shopping cart with integrated payment processing). I've tried to work with the original owner to get these items done, but she is very slow to respond and always has excuses about her health, her child's health, and how she is traveling.   I'm in Northern California. The woman that I bought the website from lives in San Diego, but the LLC that she does business through is in Pennsylvania.  Can I file small claims court in my local court, or would I have to go all the way to San Diego or Pennsylvania?  Thanks for your help.	Yes
274	I took out a student loan in 2013 to attend trade school with a company called TFG and we paid those off in full. Now - 4 years later - NELNET is calling me saying that I have a student loan that is delinquent and will need to pay or it will start affecting my credit.   I know for a fact that we never took out federal student loans. What do I do?	Yes
275	I purchased a computer and it cost over $1500. The computer was slow, incredible heavy, and very large. This was a computer that was stated as mandatory by the university but when you get there you quickly realize that is not the case. I emailed the support email stating that this computer does not seem adequate to what needs to be done, and compared to the other options. They asked me to meet with them and offered to replace the computer with another model. I accepted the offer but now they want me to meet with a guy from the company that made the computer. I waited for the email from this corporate guy and it took about a month. He has been slow to reply ever since then. I'm talking a week or days. He set up a meeting for a few weeks out, then emailed me a few days later saying he was in town, give him a call, and we can meet if I'm available. I called, no answer, left a voice mail, no call back, emailed mentioning the call and that he could call back at any time that suits him, no email back for 3 days so far.   At this point I am just tired of the process. I don't really want to deal with this any more and the weak computer seems to be less of a hassle than this process. What can I do? do I have to keep going through this process?       ---      **tl;dr**: Customer service of university offered to replace computer and the process is just incredibly tiring. They are slow to reply and it seems to be more work than its worth	Yes
276	So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	Yes
277	"Ontario, Canada  My husband and I bought a new car in March. It was a showroom demo, so it was last year's model and had 10k on it. The manufacturer rebates let us upgrade to a nicer model because it had those kilometers on it.   At the beginning of May, we brought it in and told them it was leaking from the arm on the driver's side. They tried to say oh maybe the door wasn't shut right. I insisted they look anyways and once they pulled the interior plastic off and put the hose to it, it was like a sprinkler. They ended up pulling off the windshield and reseating it in new seals. At that point I paid nothing because of the warranty.  Now here we are over two months later. We've had a bad smell in the car for about a week. Took a few days to get into the dealer's shop. Asked them to do the free full inspection we got at 3 months owning the car and try to find the smell.  Turns out the back seat floor carpet (we are very very rarely in the backseat as it's just the two of us) is soaking wet and growing mold.   It's been raining a ton here lately, and we're both anal about closing windows since water in car = bad and nobody likes a wet butt. A couple weeks back it was raining so hard people were pulling over from low visibility, and we thought we heard water in the car but assumed it was splashing in the wheel well.   When the dealer service guy called back he told me this, said I had to have left a window open, and that I'd need to get the car detailed to ditch the smell.   I explained while it's not impossible that we left a window open, it's very unlikely, and our car had an established history of fucking leaking water inside. The guy repeated what he said and told us our car could be picked up. I hung up with him and called back to speak to the manager in service.   I told the manager I was beyond frustrated because we bought new specifically to avoid things like this. If we were gonna dump this much money into a car every year instead of it being a 13 year old junker trying to stay driving might as well buy new. I explained I didn't like being told it's my fault too bad, same as last time when I was told I must have ""shut the door wrong"" and it was a leak. That I suspect it's a leak again. That I don't want to come back for ""oop third time's the charm found all the leaks"". Service Manager laughed and said he doesn't want me in again unless it's routine service.   At this point the manager is sending it to a body shop owned by a good guy who my family sends all our business too, and I called him and he'll have his guys go through the car top to bottom to make sure everything is sealed right.   I'm very concerned about damage to the car. It's not even 4 months old.   1. At what point is the car a ""lemon"" and does that kind of thing even apply here?   2. What happens if the floor boards are rusted from the wet carpet for so many weeks (and who knows how long before that? Last summer when the sales guy drove it around?)  3. What happens if I keep finding leaks for all eternity?   4. What steps should I take to resolve this if things aren't being fixed? Like dealer/owner first, then corporate, then lawyer? My insurance? The warranty people?   This is our first time owning a brand new car that won't end up being sold to a scrapper for finally dying down. Please help. I'm lost and angry and not sure where to go next while I wait for the verdict from the body shop."	Yes
278	I was sold a car from an ad on Craigslist and I was completely mislead by the owner. The car has major issues that he didn't tell us about. I took the car to the mechanic today (a day after buying it) and he said it's completely unsafe to drive. The seller said it just needs a tune up but that wasn't the case. The muffler was on its last legs,there's a hole under the passengers side seat that you can put your hand through. The car wouldn't start for our mechanic and it had to be pushed out of the garage and left in the parking lot. I have pictures as well. My mechanic said I could have a lawsuit on my hands against the seller. How can I get my money back?	Yes
279	"Link to the last thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6e7o4c/north_carolina_my_apartment_complex_burned_down/  Like you guys said in the last thread, our renters insurance eventually came through to help with claims. They hired ServPro to handle moving what was salvageable and cleaning various items (furniture, clothing, books, etc.). We have filed a claim with State Farm for the items that are not salvageable and they reimbursed us a couple weeks ago.  So here is where we are now:  - ServPro returned furniture that was ""cleaned"" that had dirt and soot all over it. It's obvious that no one ever touched it. - ServPro returned furniture and items that did not belong to us. When we told them about this, they seemed baffled by who it could belong to and took it back. - ServPro returned almost every piece of furniture damaged (including antiques). This isn't cheap Ikea furniture, this is high quality furniture that survived half a dozen moves across the country with no problems. One of the beds won't even assemble anymore. Parts to the bookcases are missing. Every dresser has at least one handle missing. - When we called them to let them know about the damage, they sent someone to take pictures of the dressers and take sample handles so they could have one of their people make matching pieces. It's been a month since they took those and haven't returned them.  - Two months after the fire, they finally delivered the suits and dry cleaning. There are at least two $500 jackets missing that were supposed to be included in the dry cleaning. - They still haven't delivered other missing items we have told them about, and don't seem to have an explanation of where they are.  We've tried being reasonable with ServPro, letting them know about all of the issues as they come up, but this level of incompetence isn't something that can be reasoned with apparently. I'm at the end of my rope in terms of dealing with them. They don't return phone calls, never have answers, and take weeks to get back to us. We called State Farm to see if we could claim the damaged/missing items, but they told us that was an issue we needed to take up with ServPro.  My questions are:  - What are my rights when dealing with this company? Is there any way to move this process along and make them take this issue seriously? - If renters insurance will not cover items missing/damaged via ServPro, and ServPro won't even return basic phone calls, who is responsible? They're both saying that the other has to pay for the items, not them. - It is time to hire a lawyer, and if so, what kind?"	Yes

281	My fiancé and I live in California and after shopping around for a while, we decided on an engagement ring that was from an Etsy shop in WA.   We were led to believe that the ring would be 18k gold and after having it on my finger for less than 24 hours, it turned my finger green.   We are a young couple, he is still in grad school, so between student loans and living expenses, (although we were budget conscious when looking at rings)  $500 + is a lot to us right now.   I know that this seems like a stupid thing to post/be upset about, however, I don't want any other couples to be duped like we were.   If any of you have suggestions as to how to deal with the seller or how to proceed going forward, please let me know.   Thank you.	Yes
282	TL;DR: There's an abandoned car in the parking lot at work and my coworkers and I are wondering if it's possible/legal for one of us to take it home.   Background:  I work in a retail store that is next to a body shop. Their parking lot is abysmally small and ours is huge, so we have an agreement that lets them temporarily park cars at the back of our lot when they need to for storage.   About two months ago a car showed up in our lot in the area that the shop usually parks their cars. We didn't think anything of it. A few days ago we asked  the shop owner to move the car, he said it wasn't one that had been given to them to be worked on and they had no information on it at all. It looks like it's been completely abandoned.   The question is, is there a way for one of us to legally take ownership of the car to fix it up and use it? How would we even go about that? We're in Texas in case I have to put it in the body of the post.	Yes
283	I live in WA state for reference.  Suppose that I vacate my apartment, and the landlord sends me an itemized list of charges from my security deposit within the 21 days, along with a small refund check.  Is there a deadline to dispute the charges? Also, does cashing the check imply that I accept the charges?	Yes
284	So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them.   For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.  I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?  My business is in Pennsylvania and they are located in New York.   Thanks for your assistance.	Yes
285	My brother got into some trouble with the law in Dec. 2015 and he got arrested. My cousin and I went to bail him out everything went well, we paid them as agreed. I thought it was all over then but now they're saying that my brother skipped court one day in Apr. 2016 &amp; which forfeited the bond and cost them $450.  They want $668.99. $450 demand amount, $55 filing fee, $14 service fee &amp; $149.99 attorney fee.  Is there anything I can do? I have until 7/31 to respond.	Yes
286	Last year while I was visiting Paris, I purchase a rather expensive pair of boots I had been saving up months for. I figured I'd buy them in Europe since it's cheaper there ($1036) instead of $1293 in USA. I was told by the salesperson that I would receive a VAT tax refund at the airport after filling out several forms at the shop that I would just have to see customs and get my tax (about $120)refunded to me there.  I got to the airport, waited in a long line, almost missing my flight and the agents told me that I didn't have the correct form.  When getting home, I emailed the boutique explaining that I was unable to receive my money.  The sales person offered to speak to me via WhatsApp and gave me instructions how I could go to my local French Consulate and pay a 35 Euro fee to file the VAT tax return form to EU Customs located in Ireland. I gathered all the documents and made multiple trips to the consulate since each time I kept forgetting the appropriate documents. I mailed everything out, waited about 3-4 weeks and received no update. It's been about 8 months since then and I still have not received my money, even after emailing them several times and having them tell me that they'd look into this.   I know it's only $120 but I paid $35 and the sales associate said that the company would refund me for the fee and I went through all that trouble and they promised I would get it. I am visiting paris next month so I thought I could speak to their sales manager, but what can I do at this point?   Thanks	Yes
287	(Indiana and California, for the bot, but I think it's all federal.)   My former cell phone provider thinks I owe them $300. I disagree, but that's not really the issue here.  I sent a general dispute letter the first time it was sent to collections, asking for verification. Instead of verification, I got a letter back from the collection agency that they were returning it to the cell provider. Today, I got a new letter in the mail from a different agency.  I plan on disputing that one as well, but if the same thing happens, is there a point where I'm done? Or can the provider just keep sending it to a new collection agency every time I dispute it, rather than having them actually send the verifications they're required to provide by law?   Sending certified letters will eventually rack up more than the debt, but I'd hate for the one I don't send certified to be the one I actually have a solid FDCPA violation with.	Yes
288	I have purchased digital currency, called Town Points, from a game called 'Town of Salem', owned by BlankMediaGames, and have never received it.   They have never replied to my emails — their only communication.   It's been a while so I want to take legal action. Now their terms of service are pretty tricky and it basically makes me have no way of winning against them.   Here are their terms: https://www.blankmediagames.com/terms/ https://www.blankmediagames.com/merch-store-terms-of-use-agreement/   A friend sent me these from their terms:  &gt; A. Negotiations. Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days.  They will not reply to the informal negotiations so I will wait until that is over — which is soon, then take legal action.  &gt;YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS BlankMediaGames FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND COSTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES)  &gt;BlankMediaGames RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON *OR NO REASON*, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU.  This means they can just destroy my account freely even after I win a legal battle and finally receive my legal currency. Correct?  &gt;IN NO EVENT SHALL BlankMediaGames BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ANY AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO BlankMediaGames FOR GAME-RELATED TRANSACTIONS  Does this mean they cannot be liable for more than what I've spent on them in the in-game store?  &gt;NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF Town Points  This includes purchasing — but says nothing about receiving.....  &gt;BlankMediaGames SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE *DESTRUCTION*, *DELETION*, *MODIFICATION*, IMPAIRMENT, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR *Town Points*  So they can say they added it — but then deleted it and not be liable?  &gt;If there is a dispute regarding payment of fees to BlankMediaGames, your Account may be closed without warning or notice at the sole discretion of BlankMediaGames.  I can't refund nor dispute.  &gt;BlankMediaGames has the right, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you.   Does assets confine 'Town Points'?  &gt;As BlankMediaGames feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion BlankMediaGames may limit the total Town Points that may be held in your Account.  Can they say my limit is 0?  &gt;YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR Town Points THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR Town Points OR VIRTUAL ITEMS.   &gt;You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Town Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify BlankMediaGames immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Town Points balance. BlankMediaGames will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. BlankMediaGames will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.  So... they can legally say my claim is invalid, even if valid, because of their sole and absolute discretion.   I must take legal action, but I don't know where to start or what the laws confined in digital goods are. I've emailed them and it's been a while without a reply, and I cannot wait for their 'sole and absolute discretion' to determine anything malicious as a resolution — I want the law. I don't have a lawyer or know of an arbitrator, but I do have $25,000 ready for all the fees that this will bring.	Yes
289	I recently bought a used Subaru with 118k miles, with the knowledge that a high mileage service need to be performed on it. Before I bought it, I called my local Subaru dealer to see if they had any service info on the specific vehicle. They looked up the VIN and confirmed that they had performed all the work on the car for the past 50k miles. They listed off the past couple years of services that they had done on the car, and nothing major came up, just typical stuff like spark plugs, oil changes, etc. I bought the car, and took it in yesterday to have the service performed, and I get a call from them saying it has a misfire requiring the replacement of the entire valve train, totaling $3,200, in addition to the other service. The mechanic told me that they pulled up the service history, and just a month ago it had been brought in for spark plugs when they diagnosed the misfire. The previous owner traded it in because of that, to an unrelated Ford dealer.  The misfire is in the service history that was not disclosed to me when I checked with them before I purchased it. I'm not sure if the $3,200 quote would be in the history, but I can find out. The call may have been recorded but I don't know where I'd check. Is there anything here that can help me?	Yes
290	"I have a plan with a telco company that is akin to mobile device insurance. I get to replace my defective set for a new/refurbished set with a small out-of-pocket charge ($130). The device that I would receive is covered under a 6 months warranty.  5 months in the warranty, said device started malfunctioning. I tried to exercise the warranty but it was out rightly denied on the basis that there is cosmetic damage on the device (small dent).  I disputed this on the basis that no where on the service terms and conditions did it explicitly state that cosmetic damage voids this 6-months warranty.   The warranty clause is as such:   Warranty – You are entitled to a 6 month warranty for each Like Mobile Device against manufacturer malfunctions and defects that starts from the date of delivery of Like Mobile Device. }  They claim that my cosmetic damage is ""against manufacturer malfunctions"" hence my warranty is void. So far I have spoken to two senior managers who have given me the same reasoning.  How should I reply them? Can what they mean be interpreted from that clause?"	Yes
291	We just finished our 5 hour drive to the beach, and our hotel says they never got our booking(through booking.com). We called two weeks ago to make sure that our reservation was in order and we were assured that we had the room that we requested. They owners were adamant that there was no booking, and the only other hotels in the area are more than twice what we were going to pay. Is there any way I can be compensated for the extra expenses?	Yes
292	Before I start let me say I live in California.  What happened was I purchased a product (bike) for $1,000 and after the I received the product I learned that it was going for several thousand dollars over retail price, $3,000 $4,000 and some selling for $5,000.  After learning this knowledge I decided to take it to a local shop for appraisal, and I was given a quote at that the time that the bike would sell for $5,250. After the appraisal process I decided to sign a contract that would let the shop sell $5,250 on my behalf and give me 80% ($4200)  Everything went fine for the next 10 days, but on the 11th day I get an E-mail saying my item sold for $1,800 and to come into store to collect my check for $1,440 (80%).   I immediately call up the shopowner who verifies that this item did sell for $1,800 and asked him how that could happen when the item was listed for $5,500. The shopowner then explains that the price was lower because I called in over the course of the past week lowering the price by small amounts $300-400 each day because I needed rent money.  I go into the store to sort it out because I didn't make any calls to the store to lower the price. The shopowner shows me a series of E-mails made to an E-mail address I don't own in which the topic of discussion was to lower the price, and in the E-mails were a sob story about how I apparently needed the money to pay rent or I would be kicked out. After this he shows me call logs of the person calling in and with very little verification except my first name and  e-mail address (not mine) making him able to lower the price.  What do I do? The shop owner says he is enable to re-reimburse the cost because to the best of his knowledge the person calling was me. In the contract there is a theft clause saying the store would re-reimburse the entire cost of the product if it was stolen, does this apply?	Yes
293	Great Grandpa recently passed and at the settling of his estate me and my brother were presented with envolopes that had our names on them that were full of bonds our great grandparents had purchased in our names when we were born and while we were young. We have not cashed any of them in yet, but now members of our family are telling us to not cash them in due to the fact that none of the family outside of my Grandpa was present for the reading of the will. They are claiming it'd be illegal in some way or another. The bonds are in our names and all. Is this just a load of bull shit or do they have something here? Thanks in advance for any advice I get here.	Yes
294	I recently attended a concert that was put on by a third-party entertainment company which used Eventbrite to sell tickets. The concert was advertised to run for four hours and included a T-shirt and poster as part of the ticket sales. Long story short, the artist showed up 3 hours late and only performed for 10 minutes, if that. T-Shirts were distributed, but posters were not.  The refund policy set by the entertainment company (and restated through Eventbrite) was no refunds. I submitted a refund request through Eventbrite anyway but it is stated that it is at the discretion of the entertainment company to respond to the request if they want to.  I'm considering disputing the transaction through Bank of America as I made the purchase through credit card. Do I have grounds for a chargeback or dispute for bad services rendered? I realize that the bank will ask if I tried to contact the merchant first, but with a no refunds policy it seems unlikely that either Eventbrite or the entertainment company would respond. What are my options in this scenario, from a legal standpoint?   If it is relevant, I have been using this credit card through Bank of America for over 3 years now, haven't missed a payment, have high credit, and have never requested a chargeback on anything.	Yes
295	"So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.  However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.  My question is, if Steve does not receive the TV (which is seeming incredibly likely) is there ANYTHING I can do legally? Is theft by deception even a crime in PA? I don't know if Jay and Sean are their real names even, but I have ""Sean""'s phone number and the text message where it was laid out that we were meeting up to exchange the money for the TV. And they can obviously check to see that Steve has not received the TV in the jail. It's just extra complicated bc everything between Jay and Steve and Steve and I was verbal obviously."	Yes
296	My partner co-owns a popular restaurant in our city, and I tend to deal with the general complaints and inquiries that we recieve.   Recently, a woman contacted us over Facebook complaining that she and her friends got food poisoning from our restaurant. [Here's an album of our conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/1OIvv)   In order to prove food poisoning, you must first provide evidence that the food you ate was contaminated, and that this contamination caused you to fall ill. Typically a customer would call their local health committee in order to have an inspection done, which she hasn't. We issued an inspection ourselves, regardless of always having an incredibly clean restaurant with quality produce and staff. We've always passed our inspections.  I actually used to work at the newspaper company she said she talked to, so I contacted the director of the newsroom to confirm that she was in touch with them. The director has yet to get back to me, but I find it odd that a customer would contact the media prior to contacting the restaurant itself. It feels threatening from our end.   I should note that neither of our servers from that afternoon remember ever seeing her, but we can't rely on their memory. I also eat at our restaurant often and have never felt sick afterwards.  Is there anything we can do about this lady?  **TL;DR: A woman contacted us over Facebook to say we gave her and her friends food poisoning. We've never received claims like this before, and our restaurant consistently passes health inspections.	Yes
297	I purchased season tickets for a local team prior to the season. I signed a form that stated that the deposit was non-refundable and that I would make monthly payments towards my season tickets.  Fallen on tough times and can no longer afford. The team is telling me I cannot refund my tickets, but there was no stated policy that included refunds or cancellations. The season doesn't start until October.  I looked online and found that merchants have to give a refund after 30 days with no mentioned policy after a transaction is made...but technically I haven't received the these tickets since the season hasn't started.  I started making payments back in April and they go to September 1. I have paid almost $1000 thus far.   Any other questions welcome.	Yes
298	"Hi Reddit, i hope this is the correct subreddit i have posted it on but i need some advice. My dad purchased a used car from a Ford Dealership. He was ""approved"" at a certain interest rate. He had told me that the financial department had said a couple things would be free in the agreement. A couple days later they call my dad saying he did not get approved for that contract and that they are working on other one to get it through. I had found out about multiple lies they had told my dad and at that point i told him to return the car because they were not being completely honest with us. I live in CALIFORNIA and i understand that the dealership has 10 days to get another deal for us. But we do not want the car at this point because of how dishonest they were. I went there twice with my dad and they pretty much denied us to return the car. What are my options? They said they have a couple more days to get the right deal. If anyone wants any more information please feel free to ask i hope i gave enough information to get some answers so we can steer in the right direction. I just want to return the vehicle at this point and i believe it is at the 6 day mark."	Yes
299	"Last year, I went in to a California urgent care center because I ended up having strep throat. I gave them my Aetna PPO insurance, paid the $75 copay, and then went on my merry way to the pharmacy. This was about a year ago.  I did a credit report check recently, and to my surprise a $200 bill had been placed into collections over 6 months ago, with the urgent care center listed as the original account holder. So I call this urgent care, which is located in a small shopping mall and is not attached to a hospital or any other medical offices. The receptionist pulls up my account and tells me that she sees that I paid the copay, but that they have nothing to do with further billing, as they send all their claims to a contracted medical billing office for insurance collection, which is apparently the standard in the industry. She kindly gives me their medical billing company's phone number, apologizes, and says she has ""not heard positive things"" about them. Great.  So I call the medical billing office explaining that their buddy, the urgent care center, sent me to them with my qualms about this phantom $200 medical bill. She looked me up by my name and birthday, and said that yes, they did send that amount to Stanislaus Credit Control Agency after four unsuccessful attempts to contact me. Interestingly enough, the main offices for both Stanislaus and this medical billing company are both located in Modesto, CA. Anyway, the lady says this is a result of me not reaching my insurance deductible, and that this $200 was the amount my insurance, Aetna, would not cover for the urgent care visit. I thought that sounded legitimate so I eased my tone and said thanks for clearing that up.  However, I now believe she was giving me a pre-scripted run-around. I call Aetna to ask what my deductible would be for an urgent care visit. **Aetna says there is no deductible for urgent care visits, only a copay.** I ask them to look up the claim for this urgent care visit, as the urgent care center has my Aetna insurance policy on file. **Aetna has no record of any claim for any urgent care center on my behalf.**   My Aetna customer service guy says hold on, he will personally call this medical billing office. I stay on the line listening to the provided elevator music, and he comes back reporting that the person who is in control of my account is apparently not in the office today, a Monday afternoon at 2pm. I ask my Aetna customer service guy if he thinks that sounds shady. He agrees, and says he personally will try again tomorrow and get back to me. I google the urgent care center on Google, and there are already four negative reviews mentioning surprise letters from collections agencies.  Are any/all of these companies in cahoots with each other to make money from collections, instead of correctly filing a claim with Aetna? I am still waiting to hear back, as this Nancy Drew stuff all went down today. Thanks in advance for any theories."	Yes
300	Just wanting to know what, if anything, I can do in this situation. I filed 0 exemptions on my W-4, yet 2 exemptions are reported for my W-2. We now owe about $3k in taxes to the IRS. I did not notice that not enough taxes were being taken out, and I do realize that that was a huge oversight on my part. Thank you in advance for any advice you may have.	Yes
301	"My Ford F250 flooded in the Louisiana flooding in August 2016.  I called and turned the claim into insurance company immediately.  An adjuster came out and gave a “basic” estimate and said the mechanic shop we chose to take it to would check it over more and see what else needed to be done.  The shop and the adjuster decided it could be “FIXED” instead of totaled out. Small things were done here and there to ""fix"" the truck but it never ran right again and when I would get it back it would break again days after leaving the shop. I decided that the Ford dealership was apparently not going to be able to resolve anything as this had been months of back and forth so it was then brought to a diesel mechanic shop, after finally finding one that would accept the job (most places would not even accept the truck because ""it should have been totaled""). The diesel mechanic said, as the others did, that this was a vehicle that needed to be totaled, he told me and he told the insurance company multiple times. They always denied totaling the vehicle because they ""Goggled it and it could be fixed"".  I submitted a claim to the Louisiana Dept of Insurance and after a month they decided it a closed case as there was ""no proof that water got into the engine"" and caused the truck to be damaged beyond repair.    Now this is where I am completely lost, I have a ""totaled' vehicle (even though the insurance company refuses to total it, it is still just a sitting hunk of truck). It now sits at the mechanic shop because it will need to be towed away and this man has been nice enough to let it stay there as we were in the middle of disputes with the insurance company. His next ""fix"" will cost 5k and may or may not fix this truck, his thinking is more likely NOT. I am completely tapped as I have bought a ""cheap"" car to get me by and it is constantly needing this or that done to it as it is a 1986. BUT my 250 is still financed through the bank and pay off is over 22k.  Is there anything that I could do to try to get out from under this truck? It's ruined so it is not worth anything at all but still has a 22k price tag on it. I have considered letting it be repossessed but that sounds like the worst idea possible for my credit. I just don't know if there is anyway at all to get out of this without ruining my credit, I am now in a huge financial bind with no vehicle and no where to turn. Any advice would be great"	Yes
302	Hi, I recently had to cancel a long term Airbnb reservation in Bay Area California, because of host breaking the agreement on which we agreed on before reserving midway through my reservation.   Airbnb's case manager handled the issue and it was agreed that I would be refunded for the nights not stayed in the reservation and would be refunded 50% for the nights since which host voided the agreement. The case manager changed my reservation dates accordingly, however, since it was listed as a new reservation, the nightly price was hiked by my host (something I was neither informed about nor agreed to). The case manager also started saying I did not pay for all the dates of the reservation according to the new dates, and hence they will not refund me for them. However, according to the previous receipt and my bank statements I paid for the whole month. I mentioned it to them, but they disregarded this. Every time I try calling them on their phone line, they say they will email me. But their email just repeats what the case manager said.   How do I go about solving the issue. The amount is quite high and as a student I cannot disregard the amount completely. I have all the necessary receipts and statements from the case manager. Thank you.	Yes
303	Seven year old credit card coming back to haunt me!  Ok, I've never posted here before and doing this on my phone, so bear with me please.  I'm in Ohio, today my brother in Oklahoma called me and said someone had called him about needing to send me some documents.  I called the number they gave him, and it's in regard to this credit card, last activity was 2010.  They say they are attempting to serve me with papers to take me court for 2,705.49 plus 1,500 in attorney fees, or I could set up pymt plan and pay them 1,664.39.  My question is, how do I keep them from calling family members?  (He said it was an outside company)  He also said statute of limitations was 12 years in 2010.  The reason this card defaulted is initially I lost my job, then became ill and am now on disability.  Any advice would be appreciated.	Yes
304	Hello!  I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.  This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.  When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?  Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.  Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.  I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.  I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.  At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.  I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)  It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.  **tl:dr University won't accept payment via an AmeriCorps award, won't release transcript, how do I negotiate with them?**	Yes
305	I just got a call today from my storage unit stating I have used their on site dumpster when I shouldnt have. I threw away some empty packing boxes. They told me the dumpster is not for customers. I apologized and said it wont happen again and that I was unaware I was not allowed to use the dumpster on the property where I rent a unit.  Then they told me that there is a $200 penalty for using it. I said I dont remember that listed in the lease contract I signed that I wouldnt use their dumpster or any mention of a fee/penalty for doing so.  I checked the contract and there is no mention of use of the dumpster or a fee for using it.  They called again in the afternoon which I let go to voice mail. They said they have me on their surveillance cameras using the dumpster and to call back.  Do they have grounds to charge me for use of the on property dumpster where I rent a unit?	Yes
306	I got my financial aid letter and a scholarship i got last year for $2,000 is there this year but it's for $20,000... And since it's a scholarship they auto accepted it for me. What happens if I just let it ride and see if they catch it? Could I get in trouble? Is financial aid considered a transaction that is complete when I pay my bill? Is there a certain point that they wouldn't be able to have any recourse?	Yes
307	Throw away for obvious reasons!  The gist of this is the soon to be ex wife filed a false PFA against the soon to be ex husband. Ex husband DID NOT plead guilty, but DID take a plea deal to make things easier and to avoid a battle. STBXWife currently has sole legal and physical custody, and STBXHusband is paying support on kids. Children are allowed to text dad, set up times and places to meet dad, etc.   However. Things the kids have said have made dad think the home environment has become seriously harmful and STBXWife has become uncontrollably irresponsible.  To avoid involving the kids and asking they testify against their mother, the option of a PI was brought up.  STBXHusband knows where she lives, as she's still in the marital home with no intention of leaving (which is no issue). Knows where she works as she owns her own business. The PFA is essentially a court enforced no contact. It states STBXHusband isn't allowed to contact via third party or otherwise. But this isn't contacting.  As the divorce is proceeding, is STBXHusband allowed to hire a PI to get specific information to use in said divorce and subsequent custody battle?	No
308	Paid for parking at a college and was mailed a pass, in the meantime I printed a Temp Pass which states I paid for Summer Parking + my vehicle license plate.

309	Newbie here looking for advice on my current legal situation. I'm a lesbian mom with a 4 year old child from a previous relationship. My wife has been in the picture since my daughter was 10 months. Majority of time is spent with us, bio father lives two hours away and sees her about once a month. All medical, school, etc.. is handled by my wife and I. When we enrolled her in pre-k last year, they required birth certificate and wouldn't let me put my wife as other parent. She is only listed as emergency contact. We have been legally married for almost 2 years. Question is, how do I go out about making my wife her legal parent/ guardian, without stripping any rights from bio dad? I know it bothers her that she doesn't have the same legal rights as him even tho she is a provider.. note that she is listed as other parent on all medical forms, never had issue until school. Daughter had surgery at 2 years old.. she was able to be there and sign all forms with no issues. Frustrated, just want her have the legal rights she deserves. Please help and sorry for the ramble.. thanks!	No
310	"Basically, my friend is willing to come up with the 4k to break the lease, however, the apartment management requires a signature from both people and her ex is refusing to sign until she ""meets with him alone"".  Which is obviously dangerous.   The apartment complex is looking into if they can do anything on their end, but until then, what are her legal rights?"	No
311	I'm trying to get on disability (height is 4'10 with a few mental disorders that have been left untreated, and 27 years old). The only diagnosis that I have are over 10 years old. It feels like I've developed another disorder as I feel like I can't go outdoors and have trouble completing my job because of this. I know that you have to have documentation of your disorders to get on disability but without insurance, I can't readily get up-to-date diagnoses. What is it that you guys recommend?	No
312	"A young friend of mine is 19 and has been bouncing around from house to house since she was around 17 because of her father and brother abusing her. She's constantly worried he'll find her and force her to come back like he did when she'd run away as a young teen. I've let her know that as she's an adult, he now has very little legal control over her. That was a relief to her, but her big fear now is he'll find a way to change that. I know that an adult can take the actions to legally have ""custody"" so to speak and control over another adult if that adult is mentally disabled and unable to make their own decisions and care for themselves. That's where the problem is. Part of his abuse was convincing everyone she's crazy. He would talk to her friends behind her back to tell them she's crazy, talk to all the adults she might report to with a sob story about her manipulative nature and tendency to lie, even talk to the therapist he got her after each session and tell her ""his"" side of everything and how it ""really"" happened. He had her on tons of meds with tons of diagnoses and going to a bunch of doctors. He covered it up when her brother sexually abused her and told everyone she made it up/ asked him to do it. Bottom line, she's got a VERY small circle of people who believe that she's NOT completely unstable. Right now she's lives with her boyfriend and is safe. Her fear is that he's going to convince everyone that she's so unstable that she can't care for herself and needs him to still be her guardian even as an adult. Is this legally possible and if so what should she do? She currently has very little money as she's been on the run and does not have a license (her dad wouldn't let her get one - he told her years ago she was going blind and could never drive because of it and that one day she'd loose her vision entirely. She only discovered she isn't going blind a year ago after an eye doctors appointment as an adult)."	No
313	So, this is about my grandfather in New Jersey. about two years ago, we were browsing on amazon when we found something strange. A book my grandfather had published... kind of. You see, he was going to run a business a few years ago republishing old books, however the initial cost proved to high so the idea was shelved. that said, before he stopped, he sent one of those books to the PoD service lightningsource to do a small run of a few test copies (iirc, the count numbered less than 10). so, imagine our supprise to find this: https://www.amazon.com/New-Yorks-Awful-Steamboat-Horror/dp/097150590X on amazon one day.  Out of curiosity, I ordered it, and the book that arrived was a perfect match to the test-print he had. somehow, it had gotten printed and sold without his knowledge. Its been two years since then (and who knows when they started and stopped printing the thing), yet even now copies are floating around. Amazon was very unhelpful as we couldn't find a good way to contact somebody outside the customer service department, and obviously Lightningsource never replied to our questions. Was there anything we could have done? his name is even on the book as the editor, as is his company name. it has all the edits he made too.	No
314	My mother moved to Indiana to be close to her parents, as they are getting quite old, and they allowed her to move in with them. She's on disability and has several mental disorders (bipolar, depression, and is likely an undiagnosed schizophrenic). They allowed her to move in on the condition that she look for part-time work and a place of her own to move into. There was no written agreement or lease, all verbal.  Her brother wants her out so he can move in with them, and has obtained their dad's power of attorney. He video recorded himself telling her she has 30 days to vacate. Their mother (of whom he does not have PoA) since told her she could continue to stay as long as she continued to look for work. Since then, her brother has continued to try to convince their mother to evict her, and has just recently apparently succeeded.  My mother has been served today, indicating that a hearing has been set to evict her on this coming Tuesday, the 1st. I had informed her that because there is no lease she is considered a month-to-month tenant, and that they need to give her proper notice to vacate before proceeding with an eviction, but her brother claims that his attorney said that because she's a child living with her parents that doesn't apply.  I'm reasonably knowledgeable about tenancy laws, but I'm not a lawyer and I'm out of my depth here. If evicted, my mentally ill mother (who has been hospitalized for suicide attempts) will become homeless, living in her car, halfway across the country from me. If anyone has any input I would appreciate it. I'll try to answer any questions as best I can.	No
315	Pretty simple.   I rented an old farm house in VA.   My wife and I discovered a grave from the 1940s that wasn't exactly hidden but not obvious.     Should my pandlord have disclosed this?	No
316	I told this landlord I wanted the apartment and she took it off the market for approxamitely 2 weeks. The rent is 1100 a month and I gave her my security deposit of that much. I changed my mind about moving in as I found a cheaper option and I would have had to double rent for a month and a half. Is there any legal way to get my deposit back or have I lost the  money? This is all happening in missouri.  This was the email my potential landlord sent:  Not only have you wasted my time but you’ve cost me income. You did not take responsibility to know when your current lease ended. On July 11th when asked in writing, you confirmed you DID want to take possession on July 15th as previously agreed to verbally. On July 12th you informed me you don’t. Your current lease termination date should have been considered before you committed to take possession of my apartment July 15th when you gave me your deposit on June 29th. The unit was available July 1st and I compromised and split the month with you. From June 29th to July 12th, you still have not provided the requested information to complete your application.  I have now lost, at the least, one month’s full rent of $1,100. I’ve paid for two background checks at $25 each due to the information you provided for your social security number was incorrect. Both of our time is valuable and I’ve spent at least 8 hours dealing with this issue. All totaled I’m out, at least, $1,150 and I need to begin the entire process over.

317	Hey guys I was in a motorbike crash on the 2nd July, I was going down the motorway in the fast lane and it turned into a merge lane so I merged. About 10 seconds later all I see is brake lights come on so I tried to brake aswell, couldn't slow down fast enough so i had to swerve to the right and clipped the rear right side of the car in front, now comes to my problem. I have decided not to claim and just wanted to fix my bike up myself without getting insurance involved but I have just had a claim made against me by the other party involved. My insurance ran out on the 12th so I wanted to know if I would still be covered and how to handle the claim against me. Any advice would be helpful .	No
318	"Massachusetts-In the span of a very bad year, I have gotten divorced AND have sought treatment for mental health issues related to my military service.  Initially I had a minimal disability rating due to hearing damage; my veterans service rep streamlined an application for an increase due to my continuing issues.  My ex left me a voicemail that stated she ""wants increased child support when you get that bump up in your monthly check.""  I never told her about any disability monies that I receive, nor did she know I was seeking assistance for my issues.  It's a horrible, extremely non-amicable divorce.  We do not interact.  I went to the VA and asked the advocacy rep if she could have gotten this information due to the fact that she still has a yet-to expire dependent ID; *he said he recognized her and had been in the hospital last week*.  My medical issues are my issues alone.  What do I do from here?"	No
319	Hello!   Today I moved out of my student-centered apartment complex. It was fully furnished when I moved in, and over the course of my stay, I broke the chair that came in my room. No problem, the replacement fee was like 30 someodd dollars. The chair was never replaced by maintenance, however, and when I tried to log into our resident portal this morning, I was told I currently cannot access the account. This is where the itemized list of charges and payments was housed, and we were given no indication that we would not be able to access it at any point. While I do have payment receipts that show on my bank account, it's not itemized, and since I paid for the chair in one swoop along with rent and utilities, I can't prove that the money I paid was for that charge.   There is a good chance that when they evaluate my apartment, they will see the broken chair and charge me again. Is there any recourse for this? Or any way to regain access to my account and my records at all? Without those, it becomes a game of he-said she-said, and I feel certain I won't win.   Thank you!	No
320	"Alright so I'm in a weird situation. I've been with my kids mom for several years now and it has never really worked out. We've stayed together for our son. Anyway, she hates my guts and I don't really enjoy hers, I live in her apartment(her aunt pays for) and I pay rent. It's been this way for a long time now. My name is not on the lease and hers is. My question is this; she is telling me that she is going to have the cops come tomorrow after I get off work to kick me out. I've told her that I need a notice to have some time to find a place but she's adamant in the fact that she doesn't need to give me a notice and she can ""do whatever the fuck she wants because it's HER apartment."" Am I wrong for thinking that a notice is required? I pay bills and I am here for my son. She's guaranteed me that the cops will come tomorrow and make me leave. I've tried to reason with her but she isn't having it. We agreed a few weeks ago that I will leave the first of September(which I'm COMPLETELY ok with) and now she's doing this. Do I have any rights in this situation? I'm the breadwinner in this household, it's not like I don't contribute. I'm just trying to figure out what to expect IF the cops get involved tomorrow."	No
321	is a lawyer needed to get your driving record expunged?  I have several things in my 10 year print out that are preventing me from working many driving jobs.  any help is appreciated.   first timer here,  thank you!	No
322	Weird situation but this is where I'm turning. I am in sales and share a territory with another individual. My colleague has had issues adapting to the workload and was written up for performance.   Here's where my issue starts. They have ties to a higher up in my company. They were able to work something out where she was not to come Into the office, but rather look for a new position outside the company. In the mean time their side if the territory was left without support and those who needed her support reached out to me. It just so happened thay while they were out looking for a new job, her territory landed some big deals and netted her with a commission check that doubles my own. But I supported the territory and picked up the slack for them while they were gone. This went on for 2 months.   They were unable to find a job and are now being allowed to return to work where they are to simply try again. Conveniently when quarterly commission gets paid out. I'm a loss for what to do here because I feel quite used by my company. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
323	Son is 23 years old and is still living at home. Unfortunally he hasn't got a job for a long time or makes too much effort to get one. I told him many times to better his life, but for years he continues to just make a mess and play video games the whole day. Nothing we tell him seems to let him want to change his behavior. At this point we are considering to force him to move out so he needs to learn to provide for himself. The problem is, he probably won't like the idea and would probably refuse to cooperate.   In that case I wonder, are there any legal grounds on which we could force him to move out, or could he just refuse and stay home? And if it's neceserry (when he refuses), are we permitted to move his stuff to a room we will sign for him and take his key of the house? Lastly, if he would refuse to pay, are we obliged to take him into the house again (because he proobably would) or is that not the case?	No
324	"Hi everyone, I just wanted to know if there's anyone higher-up in my town/who I should call about this? People have been piling old mattresses outside of the dumpster for over a month now. I came back from vacation yesterday and there was even more junk- ovens, dressers, washing machines just dumped at our complex. My landlord put signs up saying ""no dumping"" but hasn't actually done anything about the mess. Does this count as something the Board of Health would deal with? Is there anything legally stopping them from allowing this gross dumping? Thank you!"	No
325	I can't really get very good sleep and work early, but also from home so it's constant, constant... chirping.   I think that there are two. Two of the things...  Due to the consistent nature of the chirping. It started as one was going off at about every 37 seconds the other at every 35 seconds and gotten closer to 33 and 32 seconds. I timed them and that's about the pattern. Seems to be quickening...  They have been doing renovations on at least one of the apartments nearby for over a week and I suspect that is probably where the noises is coming from.	No
326	Hi, I'm from San Diego. I began receiving tickets for expired registration for a vehicle that could not pass smog and that I could not fix so I sold it. I was just wondering, does releasing liability count as a correction or do I pay the full fine?	No
327	Hi all,   I turned 26 this year and got booted from my family's health insurance plan, was making almost no money as a contractor, so I went on Pennsylvania's public health benefits. Two months ago, I got a job offer and I needed to both start right away and move to where the job was, and in the personal tornado of making that happen, I just remembered that I never cancelled my public benefits.   The moment I took the job, I left the income bracket in which I'd been eligible to receive benefits. My health insurance with this new job didn't kick in until one month into it, so I've technically only had 'double health insurance' for one month. The only costs that my benefits have been covering in this overlap period are the monthly rental payments on a medical device I need - it's a cost that I could hypothetically reimburse the state for out of pocket.   What kind of trouble am I in? Obviously, I'd like to take action first thing Monday morning when their phone lines open up and report my mistake, but am I looking at any potential legal issues here?	No
328	My grandfather passed away recently.  More than a year ago he added me as a co-owner on his bank account. What happens to the money in that account? Does it become part of his estate, am I entitled to it?   I thought I was entitled to at least some of it as the co-owner, but my aunt said not to spend any of it because she would have to pay creditors with it.   The whole point of putting me on his account was because he wanted me to have the money. (I was his caretaker &amp; he lived with me). It's not a whole lot - prob about 5k.   I'm in PA.  TLDR had a joint account with my grandpa, in PA, what happens to the money?	No
329	So just as a warning this will be long, and details may slightly vary due to my mom being the one going through this. If a certain detail is pertinent though I can get the specifics from her.  We are located in Indiana.  My grandma is 90 years old.   My grandma got put in the nursing home around 6 months ago. She had broken her hip and needed rehab.  She is till there because she can't go to the bathroom by herself and sometimes she feels too weak to sit up in bed by herself. My mom stays there with her every other day (all day) and her sister stays on the other days. They do this because they say if you leave grandma alone she will try to get up by herself and re-break her hip (she has done this once before).    They are currently paying the nursing home $225 per day to keep her there. They looked into getting Medicaid and apparently you have to pay a lawyer $10,000 to represent you, it won't cover costs for another year (who knows if she'll make it that long), and once she did pass they would have to pay a certain % of the money back.  She has quite a large farm they had planned on selling (~$1,000,000 my mom thinks) but a lawyer told them if they sold it before she passed they would have to pay a large amount of taxes.   Grandma's savings has run out and my mom is trying to figure out how to pay for the nursing home bill. She is thinking of getting a loan, then paying it back after grandma passes once they sell the farm. However she is having a hard time finding someone to give them a large enough loan. So my questions are:  is this the right option?  Are there options out there we don't know about?  Was she given the correct info about Medicaid?  Tl;dr need advice on how to pay grandmas nursing home bill	No
330	"My roommate and I are interns in VA. We signed a 3-month lease for May 25-Aug 25, and our lease says   &gt;""If your current lease expires and no renewal or extension more than three months has been signed, then you will be considered as being on a 60-day option. The rent during the option period will be current MTM rate for the apartment.""  Today I realized we haven't provided a move-out notice. I immediately went to  the office and submitted a notice, but I'm curious if there are any avenues we can take to escape the extra charges since we didn't receive a reminder to renew/terminate our lease. The manager said that they typically provide courtesy reminders 3 months out, but she admitted that we fell through the cracks because we signed a 3 month lease.  I have another question.  I asked the manager for a move-out checklist. She casually mentioned that there is no list and that we ""just need to clean the apartment"". When I pressed her about ""clean""--specifically if I had to clean the carpets--she admitted that we need to have the carpets professionally cleaned and provide a receipt. I cannot clean the carpets myself.  Am I legally obligated to professionally clean the carpets? The lease does not require professional cleaning.   This really frustrates me because the previous cleaners clearly weren't that professional: I've found several strands of long hair in my room and the living room. Neither my roommate nor I have pets or wear shoes into the spartan unit (air mattresses are our biggest pieces of furniture), so I'd really like to avoid a professional cleaning.  Thanks"	No
331	"Hi so I used to live in an apartment complex and I left in may. When I left I was told things were all good however I did not receive paperwork that states that (a mistake in retrospect). As I was told I would receive my deposit in the mail. Fast forward a month to June and I still haven't received my deposit issues with the mail at my new place I guess. I go physically to ask what's up and they say theyll email me for instructions etc. So the next day I get an email that I owe damages and the itemized list they sent in the body of the email:  Date	Description	 Amount 06/05/2017	Beginning Deposit Held	 $0.00 06/05/2017	DAMAGES	 $543.62   So multiple issues here I didn't damage the apartment they claim they had to replace the carpet but the carpet was fine aside from a single stain which they said wasn't an issue so I request an itemized list they said they'd work on it and then fast forward to today I get the same email again with the same ""itemized"" list but this time threatening legal action.  So I guess their are two issues here 1st: I never got my deposit back so the fact they're obliging me to pay over and above my deposit is ridiculous. 2nd: does what they sent in the email count as a proper itemized list or am I right to stand my ground until I receive one?"	No
332	Basically, it's pretty straightforward. I moved into my current house last january, after starting a new job. I paid my first three months in advance as a sign of good faith, and lived here since. My last position ended in November of 2016, and I didn't have a job until May. Obviously, being unemployed made it hard, even with a roommate and girlfriend, to always make the rent and bills. (my girlfriend had her own place til May, roommate moved out in may.) In March, april, and May, I paid the rent before the fifth of the month; in part because the 1st fell on a weekend. I was a week late in June and July because my new position and bills and my car dying made money extremely tight. I had originally signed a lease from january 2016-january 2017, but because he was busy, we didn't resign the new one until march, so it goes until march 2017. I cant' find a paper copy, but I was under the impression there were no late fees until the fifth. As of July 9th, my landlord basically let his brother be in charge, as he didn't want to do the landlord thing anymore. As of the 12th, out of nowhere, he sent me a letter saying I owe 175 in back rent (late fees) for march to july, or I must vacate the property by the 22nd of July. Basically 10 days to pay late fees I didn't know were an issue, or I'll be homeless. My girlfriend and I both work 35 hours a week at 10 dollars an hour and share a car; but it's impossible to keep up with bills. Is there anything I can do? We live in Indiana. We may be able combined with our paychecks this week to pay the past due, but then we won't have the ability to buy groceries for the week or the gas to get to work.	No
333	I'm about to get married. My dad just went through a really rough (second) divorce. I don't have the whole picture, but from what I gather, they each spent around $50k+ on lawyers to fight over maybe $500k in retirement savings and home equity. This sounds like an absolute nightmare and a total waste of money.  My fiance and I are both 25 and just starting out our careers. Neither of us have anything worth fighting over in terms of existing assets/savings so I wasn't planning on any sort of prenup. But, ideally in 5+ years we would have plenty to fight over, and that is what I'm worried about.   Is there any sort of prenup to make sure we don't both blow a ton of money on lawyers if we ever do get divorced? A sort of civil agreement that would benefit everyone involved? Should I bother bringing it up to her?	No
334	I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Significant other and I are moving in together. We signed the lease and our official move in date is August 1st. I am 27 weeks pregnant so LL has been allowing us to slowly move stuff into the house because I cannot lift or move heavy things so it will be a slow process. We have already paid landlord security deposit, first month's rent and the pet fee for our dog.   LL informed my SO via text last night that the previous tenant was still receiving mail and utility bills at our new address. LL stated in text that he opened one of the utility bills from the water company and saw where previous tenant owes utility company a past due balance of $806.31 and the total balance is $1016.78. LL said we must pay this utility bill or else the water is scheduled to get shut off on August 11th.  Obviously, SO and I do not want to pay this large utility bill for someone who is delinquent. We have already given LL $2500 and we haven't even spent a night in our new house. LL is saying we must pay it. I don't know how much truth that holds, hence why I'm coming to LegalAdvice.  I plan on calling the utility company when they open at 9 am and explaining my situation. But can the LL / utility company make us pay the previous tenant's past due balance? There is absolutely no way we can afford to pay the full balance at once but if we must, is there a way we can set up a payment plan? LL did not provide us with a stove or air conditioning unit, so we are also having to provide that for ourselves, along with furniture and other necessities.   If we are not responsible for the past tenant's utility, what will the company need to disconnect the previous tenant's bill and we continue to get service at our new address? I have a copy of our lease in my email but no printed version.   Any help at all would be super appreciated. Thank you!	No
335	I am in Montana. A rental car driven by a 19yo pulled out in front of me while I had the right of way and I collided with the vehicle.  The 19yo did not have personal car insurance. The vehicle was rented by (I'm assuming relation based on name and the fact that the 19yo couldn't rent the vehicle without full coverage insurance) the father who opted out of the rental company's insurance.  I do not know if the father has personal insurance. I heard from a reputable source that in Montana the rental agency is still required to carry liability insurance on their vehicles.  Should that insurance cover the accident even though the vehicle wasn't being driven by the renter?  Also, if the father has personal insurance will that cover the vehicle he rented even though it was driven by the son?	No
336	This takes place in housing located Port Arthur Texas. It's a section 8 lease.  We've been staying at my parents house partly because it is so nasty. There have been roaches since day one but it didn't seem overtly bad. We've been out of this place for the past 4 weeks. We went back there to clean things out yesterday...  There are roaches everywhere. We have filed several requests for people to come by and spray, even before it was this bad.  Supposedly people have come by but the roaches are still literally everywhere. Mold is covering a decently expensive couch and chair to the point of it not being  even worth salvaging. There's mold on the kitchen counters and table. There is a fee for not removing all belongings before the lease is up. Should we be required to pay the fee and is there any way we could be compensated for damages to said couch and chair? Clothes have to be washed as well, like 20 plus loads.	No
337	"Most of the ""fair use"" discussions that I've seen on here focused on either musical parodies or graphic IP's but I'd like to see if ""fair use"" extends to things like a plot structure. Here's some context:  Right now, I'm hoping to make a comedic puppet series that bases it's plot on Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" In doing so, I will certainly rename the characters/locations but will most likely use the archetypes (doctor, judge, church lady, etc.) and the general plot structure (10 people go to an island where one is killed off each day). It would be a comedic riff on the book and not much outside of it thus disqualifying for satire (as I understand it) and I can't imagine it would have any positive or negative affect on the original copyrighted material. So is there any sort of legal precedent any of you know might know of that addresses comedic literature-to-film adaptations?   For what it's worth, the book was published in 1939, Agatha Christie is no more, and I'd say most people are familiar with it. I doubt that makes a difference but I thought it might.  Oh, and I live in the United States and may post it on YouTube which I understand has its own set of rules n such.  TL;DR version: Is a re-named comedic adaptation of an old, well-known IP a bad idea or not? Thanks, friends-in-law!"	No
338	Location info: I'm still in Conneticut, the supposed apartment was in Stamford, CT, and I'm pretty sure this guy lives in Miami but is working somewhere in South Carolina.  I'm interning in CT this summer and in early June I was looking for a place to stay. I ended up trying to rent a place on Craigslist. After a week or two of talking with the guy leasing it he sends over a contract, we both sign it, and he says I can move in that Friday. A big red flag I missed is that although the apartment existed and he showed me several pictures, I never saw it in person. He requests rent for the first month (1250) and a security deposit of another month's rent (1250) for a total of 2500. He gives me the account information and I wire it. Everything looks good.  That Friday when I try and get the keys he no longer is responding to my texts/calls. When I call the front desk of the apartment block they tell me that the guy is a known scammer and I should contact local PD. I do so, give them all the information I have, including his phone number, real name, actual facebook profile, and a large amount of text and email correspondence. They say to wait for a call. That was about 3-4 weeks ago. The police report was filed but I've never seen any follow up. Everytime I try and contact the local PD they tell me to contact the officer I reported to, but I haven't been able to get in contact with him. I tried contacting the bank that we wired the 2500 to and they told us they couldn't do anything about it.  I have a huge amount of info on this guy including where he lives, his real name and phone number, I managed to find his FB profile, and I'm fairly certain I know where he works (all of this info he either gave me or I found legally online).   What are my options? Am I screwed? Is there anyway I can hold this guy accountable? Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks.	No
339	I went to Wisconsin in June for the only vacation I could afford in years. On my way back I was passing someone when they decided to speed up so I couldn't, I was running out of room so I too sped up and finished my pass then let off the gas. I came over the hill slowing down and about a quarter mile up the road I saw a state trooper. He claims I was doing 23 over, I wasn't, I was issued a 225 dollar ticket that I can literally not afford to pay. Nor can I afford the increase in my insurance if I pay the ticket admitting guilty. I read on multiple sources that all that will happen is I can't go back to Wisconsin since they will put a warrant out for my unpaid fine. What do I do?	No
340	I am living in a house with my half sibling (we can call Richard) we have been living together for 3 years. Currently working on getting Richard evicted but that is another story. My main concern is I don't want retaliation against me living in the same house with Richard when then notice of eviction comes around. Since I have lived here Richard has threatened to hit me once. Broke the cable on the outside of the house that give us internet twice. Told me to move my stuff out of my room by Saturday of last week or that Richard would move it himself. Threatened to kick me out twice. Yelled at me to stop talking to our grandmother. He has decided to repeatedly pull the power for my internet modem (I alone pay for.) And has now slid open house flyers under my door. (I assume he wants me to move.) I am having a lot of anxiety because Richard has been known to have anger issues. I also know he owns a firearm and I really am afraid of what would happen when the eviction notice comes around because he will take it out on me. Do I have to wait for something more to happen, what can I do?	No
341	The initial accident happened ahead of him. People were swerving out of the way. One of the people in the initial accident got out of her car and ran across the freeway. Fate would have it that she ran right in front of my friend's car. She died on the scene.  I have another friend who was a firefighter/first responder on the scene. He said that there was nothing my friend could have done. It was the other person's fault for getting out of the car. He doesn't know my friend, so there's no bias. The family is not pursuing legal action.   Fast forward to last week. He got 2 letters in the mail (or phone calls... I don't remember the exact details.) One was that the insurance company in formed him that there will be no liability on his part. The second one was the DMV saying that they were suspending his license for being involved in a fatal vehicle vs pedestrian accident.  Any advice for him?	No
342	"Located in North Dakota.   PICTURES OF DAMAGE ARE LINKED AT BOTTOM OF POST  I posted in this subreddit a few weeks ago. Long story short, I own a twinhome. My neighbors are renters. One of my neighbors moved their sump pump hose right outside my basement window, and it proceeded to come into my basement destroying my carpet and padding.   It was suggested in here to file an insurance claim, which I did.   First I filed with my own insurance company, and they said they wouldn't cover it as they would consider it to be ""flood damage"" and I don't have flood coverage. They suggested to file a claim through the other homeowners policy policy, and it may fall under their liability coverage.   So that's what I did. His insurance company sent out an adjustor, inspected the damage, and did his thing. A week later, I got a call from the insurance company saying they wouldn't cover it, since it wasn't their insured (the actual homeowner) that caused the damage, but rather the person renting the home from him. I asked if the homeowner has any liability for his renters actions, and the insurance company said no, not at all.   So now I'm in my present situation.  I paid 2300 dollars for carpet and padding, which is going to be installed on Tuesday. Admittedly, this carpet is nicer than the carpet I had to take out (5 dollars a Sq foot as opposed approx 3 dollars a Sq foot for the original).   I know my neighbor isn't going to want to pay for the damages they caused, as that is the nature of negligent neighbors. So I'm guessing my ultimate course of action will be to take them to small claims court. I'm only really armed with pictures of the damage as well as pictures of where my neighbor left his sump pump hose. Is this enough to get a judgment in my favor? I've never gone to court for anything, so any opinions are appreciated.    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-FrQKc4fy6qVEFxemdpblNBN2c?usp=sharing"	No
343	So my father has been in jail/prison for a while now, and my mother is a narcissistic bitch who blames any problem she has on him. I don’t want to visit him with her.   She says she doesn’t want me to go with anyone except her, so that’s a problem. It’s probably been almost 8 or 9 years  My question is, if I visit him with my grandparents (his side) and she somehow finds out, can they get in legal trouble for bringing me without asking her, since I am under 18  Also if he is located in a different state does that affect laws?	No
344	Don't know if this is the right sub but here goes...  Started renting a property September 2016, moved in and there was mould in the bath, food from the last tenants still in the fridge and even some of the lights weren't working. The house wasn't even cleaned before we moved in and was handed over in the most vile state. We took photos of everything obviously and when it came to moving out (A week ago) we didn't really bother to deep clean the house since throughout the year he practically ignored us and hardly ever repaired anything when we needed it. (One shower didn't work most of the year)   He now is ignoring all of our calls and this is when it get's interesting he is actually a barrister (prosecutor) and he is trying to take all of our deposit.  He might be taking us to court :(  Any help would be appreciated	No
345	Does anybody know if they are not allowed to have pages such as Facebook? I ask because my bio father who I refuse to have contact with is harassing me on Facebook. I am constantly having to block a new page of his. If he is not allowed to have these pages I am more than happy to report it to his probation officer. But seeing as I don't know the correct legal information I as of yet have just been blocking him. Every few months or so I'm having to block him to continue having no contact with him like I have continuously told him I do not want. I have minor children that I want him having nothing to do with.	No
346	My leasing company had sent me a letter in July stating that my rent would be increased to, let's say 3000$ for simplicity sake, from 2000$ and this new rent would be effective on the 2nd of August.  Now my leasing contract states that my rent is due on the 1st of every month, so my roommates and I paid the 2000$ for the month of August because it was the 1st and not after the second.  However, our leasing companyis saying we must pay the extra 1000$ for the month of August.  Are they legally able to require this?   To me this seems like if I bought concert tickets at 25$.  Then when it came closer to the venue date the ticket prices increase to 50$ and the venue calls me saying I have to pay 25$ extra dollars in order to get into the concert.    Shouldn't the leasing company be legally binded to the effective date stated on the letter of notification?	No
347	"A couple days ago, my mother went to the doc for a bump in her eye that seemed to be infected. The eye doctor examined it and said everything would be fine if she just rinsed it with warm water for two weeks. However, my mom didn't like this advice as she has been misdiagnosed before (years ago). Upon getting another eye doctor's opinion the next day, her fear was confirmed- the bump on her eye was infected and she needed surgery within 72 hours.  My question is: what can be done from a legal standpoint? I am sure that a complaint to the hospital will just be a slap in the wrist for the first eye doctor and I would hate for the same thing to happen to another person. I believe it to be utter unprofessionalism to say ""wash with warm water and rinse,"" and so I've came here to ask for advice.  Is this medical negligence, malpractice?"	No
348	Just like the title says, my brother's rent was raised $300 a month starting next month. Probably beside the point but a further relative (cousin) in the same apartment house (house broken into apartments) was also raised $400 a month and all of this comes a week after the cousin was sexually assualted by a plumber the landlord hired doing work on the house. The police were called and a report was taken. We don't know what eventually happened as everyone just got back in town from vacation.  Is this legal in the state of Nevada? Is there any recourse? He has a wife and 3 children and we do not have the room or resources to do much to help them right now. I don't know what to do in this situation and I could really use some advice.   Thank you for any advice.	No
349	A few years back, our neighbor set up a new floodlight to go along with his new enormous barn. The floodlight is probably a bajillion terrawatts, and is having a seriously negative impact on my family's sleep. The light is there for security - an entirely fair reason, especially considering the value of the equipment he stores in his garage (he's a contractor). But it doesn't just illuminate the barn and their driveway, it comes straight across, horizontally, into every window on that side of my house.  When the light first went up, we asked him to do something about it. He was entirely dismissive, and didn't do anything. We didn't take it any further, but now that I'm home for the summer, the light makes it very difficult for me to sleep. Even with the curtains drawn, it lights up my bedroom and disturbs my sleep.  I do plan to get in touch with them again and try asking nicely once more, but I'd like to be confident that there's something more we can do if he won't agree to change it. In shining a fuck-ton of lumens through our windows at all hours of the night, is he in violation of any laws or codes?	No
350	Okay, so my friend has been renting an apartment for a couple years near the campus of the university that we attend and every semester his landlord has called him and asked if he wants to renew his contract for the next semester. Well this semester instead of calling him, his landlord sent him a letter saying that all of the contracts in his building had been sold and that he would need to be out of his apartment by this coming Saturday.   So we understand that it's not her obligation to ask him every semester if he will be renewing his contract but is it legal to give him 2 weeks notice to be moved out of her apartment? Is there anything he can do to stay a bit longer until he can get a contract at another apartment?	No
351	My father plans on getting re-married later in his life.  I always thought when he passes away my brother and I would gain his inheritance and estate, but will my new stepmother be the new heir?  My father is older than her, so he will most likely pass away first.  My soon-to-be stepmother also has two children of her own.  I'm afraid she will gain all my father's assets and use them to benefit her children.  Is it still possible for my brother and I to inherit all my fathers property and assets when the inevitable happens.  We all live in California.	No
352	I have orders to ship out with the marines late February for boot camp. I'm currently in a lease until December, ending right as my college semester does. I've saved up a good amount of money and want to rent in an apartment in Utah before I go in, before my ship date. I'm having trouble finding any month to month leasing options. Would I be able to get on a 6-month lease, give my 30 day notice and copy of orders to break the lease without repercussions? I would basically be renting from January 1st-March 1st.	No
353	"I recently signed a contract for a new construction home expected to close in December 2017.   The financing section of the contract states ""If buyer intends to use a lender other than designated lender, buyer shall cause said lender to execute an ""outside lender addundum"" within seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract, one the form prepared by seller, and buyer shall provide seller and escrow holder with a copy thereof within such seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract.""  Does this mean after 72 hours, I am stuck with the designated lender and can't shop around for a mortgage with different lenders?"	No
354	Husband works in the oilfield.  They want to close down the yard here and relocate him to Oklahoma.  If he says no they say he has to quit so he won't get severance or unemployment.  What are his options?  Is this legal?	No
355	I've been on probation for the last three years. I got caught with a fair amount of weed a couple years ago and got put on 2 years deferred adjudication. I violated once last year, but got re-instated with one year added. Today I saw my probation which he said would be the last time. So my question is will I go before my judge before I'm off or what exactly happens now. My official off date is August 22.	No
356	I received a ticket for urinating in public in Fullerton, ca at about 2:30 am after all the bars closed and nowhere to relieve myself. The ticket was marked as a misdemeanor.   I understand that it is mostly at the discretion of the prosecutor and that I should seek an attorney. I'm worried that I won't be able to get the ticket reduced to an infraction because I have a DUI on record from almost three years ago.	No
357	I'll try to stick to details and ask for specific advice, forgive me if this is a bit scattered. I am planning to leave my husband of 4 years due to overwhelming debt and lies regarding our finances. My credit has taken the bulk of the hit due to the fact that he had no credit cards and I signed the lease on our first apartment, I am about 60K in debt and have been trying to get documents together for bankruptcy. In doing so, I discovered lies and deception were more involved than I had thought and I need some advice on moving forward.  Filing bankruptcy in PA- I forget what the term is, but we are both liable for the debts accrued during the marriage in PA. Can I file for bankruptcy after the divorce is finalized? Would they come after me for his debts accrued during the marriage later? Child support, house- I'm not asking for abuse and name calling, just advice. He tells me he won't pay me child support or help me in any way and I will be homeless. How exactly do they decide what he pays and how? How can I support myself inbetween the filing and official divorce? Is a homeless shelter my best option? I really would like to stay with my kids in a home and not put them through that situation, and I'm worried of what it would look like to the courts if I took them out of a physically safe home to a shelter. -As another question, can he kick me out of the family home? His parents own the residence and we rent from them. He says I'm not on the lease and have no right to be here.  Do lawyers ever make payment agreements in these types of circumstances? I can't afford to even begin this process and I'm unsure where to start.  Can he use mental illness against me in the proceedings? I had PPD with my first child and had trouble bonding with her, but I have attended counseling and parenting classes since that time. He says I am unstable and he will get full custody if I leave.  I appreciate any advice and thank you for taking the time to read.	No
358	In California. I told roommate (via text) that I would take care of all cleaning matters, she refused and said she had a right to clean the apartment as well. I wrote back to her stating that I would be out of town for two weeks and she was more than welcome to clean what I didn't get to. I returned to the apartment and she didn't clean anything. We have 3 days left on the lease and I'm curious if it's possible that she spoke to the landlord and made it seem like I should be charged for everything that is not done. I cannot ask her because she will not answer me and the landlord is very busy and does not respond right away.   TL;DR: Can roommate privately ask the landlord to charge me for certain things that pertain to our common space?	No
359	Hi, I was told by r/personalfinance to post this here.  So, I am going to try to make this as brief as possible, but I also need to add in enough background information that may also help provide a better answer.  My dad and mom have been living together for nearly 30 years, my dad has worked full time post of that time in various positions. He is retired now and receives a significant amount of retirement income each month, totaling between 3k-4k. My mom has worked, but only infrequently and only has SS of about $500 per month.  Their combined income should be enough to live off of, but... My mom has been recklessly spending money on various things, mostly dining out and groceries that seem to disappear. Not only that, but my mom and sisters are semi-hoarders and breeders of animals (cats and dogs) which are destroying the house and costing them hundreds if not thousands of dollars each month to maintain. The amount of cats and dogs combined are almost 20. My mom also has power of attorney over my dad for unrelated reasons.  I recently found out that my mom forced my dad to open several credit cards in his name and has maxed out of them to a total of 25k. Additionally, in the past week my mom and my sisters have left me and my dad at home with a barely operable car and we do not know where they have gone or when they are coming back. The biggest issue is a large settlement that is incoming for my dad to the amount of 200k. Since my mom has power of attorney over my dad I need to know whether or not she can take the money out right or if we have time to stop her.     He has already been to a notary public to revoke the power of attorney and has a set appointment date for receiving the settlement in person. So, my question is, what the hell do I do or can do? What the hell do we do when we get the 200k? My mom and dad also own the house, both of their names are on it. My dad wants to setup a living trust and invest the 200k and keep it away from my mom. Is this the right decision? I just need help or advice.  Additionally, my dad is going to see a lawyer on Thursday about getting the POA fully revoke and we'll see  Thank you.	No
360	Three years ago I 'moved out' of my house. By this, I mean that my physical body and about five outfits and my cat moved out. All of my things are still there, and my mail has always gone there. The situation im in right now isn't optimal, and I'd like to live in the house I bought. It's in my name only, and the people who live there are under no formal lease. The bills are in my name. If I move in, do I have to go through any procedure? Do I have to give them more than just a polite heads up?	No
361	I live in Northern Wisconsin. Our Central Air unit for our house that we are renting broke. I notified the landlord she made the calls to get it fixed. Tech call her back and tells her she needs a whole new central air unit. It is going to cost 3K to fix. She can not afford to fix it until next spring. Which i completely understand. But with that being said I have a 3-4 week old newborn a two year old toddler and my wife who is a stay at home mom with them at this house. So we need to be able to have the house cooled down.  I understand not having 3K laying around to get it fixed. I also understand having to save up for the money to get it done. But with that being said my gas and electric bill through WPS is going to go way up to keep the house cool with window AC units. I currently pay $800 a month plus all the utilities. Is it reasonable to ask her  if she can shave money off the rent payment in order to supplement the differences of the AC units I am going to need to use? Also how would I go about wording this so I do not seem like and a-hole. I like our landlord and i like the house we are renting but I feel like something should be done for the remainder of the summer.  So again....Is it reasonable to ask her if she can shave money off the rent payment in order to supplement the differences of the AC units I am going to need to use? Also how would I go about wording this so I do not seem like and a-hole?	No
362	Living in New Jersey and my landlord passed away. Have a signed lease through June 2018 but unsure of who to pay rent to. His wife and his daughters seem to have a battle looming over custody of his assets so definitely on edge. His wife asked us to pay her in cash but definitely don't want to put myself at risk of paying the wrong person and being forced to pay again. What should I do? When and how will we be contacted about who legally owns the house?	No
363	I realize the logistics of the father ending up with a child make it less likely, but I'm curious about the legality of it. I know different states have different laws, so really just interested in any states that allow it.	No
364	"Hello, I am a 23 year old male with no past criminal or any legal history. I was camping with friends in Acadia National Park in the state of Maine and we bone-headedly didn't realize that the land inside the park is federal and not part of Maine. We were caught with a small amount of weed and given US District Court Violation Notice that charges me with 36 CFR 2.35 (b) (2), ""possession of a controlled substance marijuana."" The park ranger repeatedly told me it was an ""infraction"" that would not appear on public record if I simply pay the fine to the Central Violations Bureau as documented in the notice. Is this true? Ive been reading online and have gotten conflicting information. Will this show up on my criminal record? What impact could it have on my professional-life or future? I am also planning on getting a 1 hour legal consultation. What would be the best ways of finding a good lawyer to talk to about this? Also I plan on calling the Central Violations Bureau tomorrow. Are there any specific questions that would be good to ask them? Sorry for all the questions I'm just really nervous about this. Thank you, for taking the time to read this and any help I receive!"	No
365	I'll start with that I'm living in Atlanta, GA. I moved here and have been living in this apartment since June. Last week the apartment complex was taken over by new management. Over the weekend I got a letter stating that starting in September my flat rate water/sewer bill is gone and in it's place will be a $46 sewage, pest control, trash, and management fee + water charge based on consumption.   The issue is that in my lease I signed for the $xx flat rate water/sewage fee and the rest was just included in the rent. Is it legal for the new management company to charge this new rate or are they breaking the lease?	No
366	Colorado. I was assaulted by my (ex)partner last night, him being taken to jail and I to the hospital. He was seen by a judge today and I have a Mandatory Protection Order that specifically mentions the apartment we are both on the lease for.   About an hour ago I received a three day notice to quit for substantial violation. Am I out of luck or is there protection for me since I was the victim?  I will be calling around when offices open tomorrow, but right now I am scared I will have to move on my own in three days. If I left anything out I am very sorry.  TL;DR He broke the lease by assaulting me. Do I have to move or can I fight a notice to quit?	No
367	"Hey Reddit, I need some MAJOR advice.   I'm married with a baby on the way. [27F]  We rent a three bedroom house in CA for $1,400. Currently my husband [24M] is the only one working. As a result, we figured it would be nice to have a roommate to help out on rent. We found a friend of a friend who was willing to rent a room for $750. We eventually agreed to $700. Now here's the stupid part -- we never had him sign a lease. Legally my husband and I are the only ones on our lease.   Now it's the 3rd of August and our rent is due on the 1st. Our roommate hasn't been home in a week an a half. Hasn't mentioned rent at all and has no contact with us.  We've tried everything we can think of. Calling, messaging, texting, texting/messaging his girlfriend, calling his work, stopping by his work to find out what was going on and if he was okay and coming home or not, all the while just ignoring us. Now we just got ahold of him and he claims that we have been harassing him, threatening him and he has publicly said he has rent but will not pay because of all the ""harassing""   My question is what can we do legally? He never signed a lease and if he doesn't want to pay us his rent then what can we do. His room is still occupied with all his stuff and I don't want to move it in case he somehow gets cops involved.   TLDR; Our ""friend"" rents a room from us without a lease and now refuses to pay his rent. What can I legally do?"	No
368	"So some back story first off.   I moved into this apartment complex almost a year ago. The rent was great and the staff was friendly, plus it was three months rent free. What a great deal! So a month into the living there the company who owned the apartment complex was either bought out or something and ownership changed. Since the change, the company has changed a lot of rules around the complex, such as parking and trash pick up.   That leads me to last night. I pay $2000 for this 3 bedroom apartment and there was not a single open parking spot beside the covered parking that needs to be paid for. I didn't want to park on the street almost half a block away from my apartment so I decided to park under the covered parking at 11:00 o'clock at night and move it in the morning. I woke up at 7:00 AM to find my car was missing. I was assuming it was towed, but there wasn't a notice or warning. I walked around the complex to try and find a grounds worker but I couldn't find anyone. The office is closed for a few hours so I called my ""emergency grounds"" number just to end up leaving a voicemail...which I have not heard back from yet. In my lease, it does state that the ""Owner may regulate the manner, time and place of all parking."" in the agreement. I was notified by email that the change was happening a few months back and thought it was silly to pay for parking on top of the 2k I already pay to live here. So my question is, does my apartment complex have to provide me a warning or notice before my car is towed? Also, in the contract shouldn't there be an emergency number for me to reach that actually answers the phone instead of waiting for a response? Shouldn't my contract include the towing company or is this up to the leasing departments discretion? Now if you excuse me, I am going to drop almost $300 to go get my car from the towing company after having to call around to figure out who towed it.   TL:DR My apartment complex sucks. The leasing agreement states they can change parking rules at any time. Shouldn't I have been given notice before being towed and shouldn't I be informed of the towing company in the contract?"	No
369	"Hello,      My GF could really use any advice available because she is in a crappy situation with her roomates. All of them are signed as co-tenants on a month to month lease. But the other couple had recently broken up and both wanted out. They never were going to tell my GF but she found new apartment applications on the dining room table and then asked them about it. Thats how she found out about everything. That was only a month ago, and both of them have already removed the majority of their stuff from the apartment, besides their cat, who has caused a lot of damage to the apartment and is being neglected. Last night one of them tried to move in a new girl to take their place but she has not even filled out an application and is not on the lease. My GF told her roommate that before she can move anybody in, it needs to be approved by the property manager first. Her roomate responded by saying ""i'm still moving her in if you want the bills paid"". We have this text screenshotted because shes threatening to not pay this months rent (even though she has been staying there and has not taken her cat yet) and to move somebody in without signing the lease first. Also, we were told by the assistant property manager that they were never even notified of the cat being in the apartment, meaning that she lied to my GF about having their permission. We have many photos of the cat, her admitting that the cat caused the damage, her saying that she ran it by the property manager (she didn't), and an ad that she put out on craigslist that was dated august 1, meaning she didnt start looking for a roomate until this month. My gf has given a 60 day notice and wants the three of them to split the remaining balance due so they can all be done with it. But the other girl is refusing and the bill is overdue. My gf does not want to live with a stranger, she does not want to stay there anymore, and she has not had the time to move out her belongings even though her current roomate is pressuring her into moving im a complete stranger by saturday. The property manager said a couple days ago that they can still perform a roomate swap, allow the new girl to move in, and release my gf from the lease, but the new person would be solely responsible for the rent and need to fill out an application first. But her current roomates still have not fixed the carpet that their cat ruined. What are my GF's options? Is there anything she can do? We have been documenting every little thing and have copys of the lease and monthly payments. She's also trying to pressure my gf into finding a new roomate to take her place, but thats not her responsibility, she just wants out. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	No
370	"So I recently moved into a new place, but my old landlord keeps dodging me. He keeps saying that he's sending my security deposit back from my old place, which I left absolutely spotless, but it's been two months and I'm still missing my entire deposit. I thought of recording him on the phone where I request either the bill for the damages or the deposit back, but don't know if this is the best idea. For the record his real estate ""company"" no longer exists and the only address is a PO box he gave me. Is this an issue of I should've been smarter to begin with or is there anyway I can still get my somewhat large deposit back? Thanks for all your help"	No
371	My sister is a Canadian citizen who married a US citizen over a year ago.  They had a child about 7 months ago, born in Canada.  She tried to cross the border yesterday with the aforementioned family and she was denied, because they believed her to be emigrating to the states, which in a way she was, but she wasn't aware of how strict the process to emigrate was.  Her husband has a job in the states and he had to go, but she had to stay here.  As far as I know, being denied from the border already puts her on a list which makes it harder to enter.  She's been living long-distance from her husband for a very long time already, she was very excited to finally have the family together and after returning early this morning she has been crying on and off all day, I haven't really seen her this torn before.  Is there anything she can do at this point?      Any and all information would be extremely helpful.  Thank you ahead of time.	No

373	"Not sure what to do at this point but I'm hoping for some advice.  My mom is in a marriage with a guy who seems to be mentally unstable. They have been married for almost 9 years. He verbally abuses my mom, saying very nasty things to her, of which some have been recorded. He has an extremely bad anger issue and will literally get mad over anything and everything. She had him arrested once for getting extremely angry and throwing her phone against a wall. He has even told my mom that he will ""beat the sh*t"" out of my brother and I if we ever go to the house that is in my moms name.  My mom had left the house about three weeks ago due to him being angry. She lived out of a hotel for about 2 weeks and is currently living in a RV. Today, he closed all the bank accounts, which have a fairly large sum of money and told her that she has to come back and be a ""good little wife"" or she will never see the money again. The accounts where joint accounts. He also started to throw out her property since she left the house.  She had hired a lawyer around the same time she left the house and yesterday had to fire him due to his office taking too long on the paper work and barely responded to her phone calls and emails.  I'm not sure what to do and I'm trying to figure out what my mom should do next. She says she going back to him because she has no other choice, financially. My mom is 70 and he is in his late 60's. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."	No
374	I'm currently in the process of trying to move out of mind and my ex's shared apartment. We both sighed the lease together.   A few days ago he went behind my back and talked to the landlord without me even though I told him a wanted to be there with him, but he refused to let me come.   He lied and told me he was able to take me off the lease. But then I realized that's probably not even possible considering I didn't sign anything and I wasn't made aware of even being taken off and I haven't spoken directly to the landlord at anytime.  He tried to kick me out yesterday because it's the beginning of of the month. He told me I should go sleep in a hotel or in the park.  He threatened to bring his parents over to come talk to me.  He also threatened to call the police for trespassing (Even though I'm still on the lease) and I told him he could because I don't think I did anything wrong here.   I moved to the other side of Canada to come live with him so my family's not here.   I want to know if he could try to get in trouble for me leaving and still being on the lease in the future. This whole thing seems really shady on his behalf.	No
375	"Good afternoon!  Several weeks ago, I was pulled over.  When the officer had approached my car initially, he said he pulled me over because I was close to the middle dotted line (195, highway with 2 lanes going one way, two the other way, separated by a rather large grassy median) and had pulled me over to make sure I was OK to drive.  I'm assuming as if I was drunk, or under the influence.  The stop continues, the person I was in the car with got picked up on a warrant (irrelevant to me, I'd believe).  He came back to the car after arresting my friend, and notifies me that he has written me a ticket.  He did not explain the ticket, but handed it to me as the final interaction (basically, call the court if you have any questions, here it is, bye).  When I looked at the ticket after leaving the place I was stopped, it had said ""Unsafe Lane Change"".  Which didn't make sense because when he initially pulled out, I was not changing lanes.  Anywho, I got to the court, talked with the prosecutor, and he had told me the ticket was actually for not keeping in the right lane (keep right, pass left).  There was a bit of traffic at the time.  I was in the left lane with a stream of other cars also staying in the left lane, and I didn't have the opportunity to get into the right lane until further down the road when the officer had made his way behind me.  So, all in all, I think I was given the ticket erroneously.    Anyways, I need advice on how to obtain what information that would help support my case.  I would like to avoid hiring a lawyer, as I'm pretty low in the funds department, and if I can represent myself, that would be a very awesome alternative.  Thank you and please let me know if I can provide any other information."	No

The things that stood out to me were: - ""Probation: The first six months of employment are a probationary period during which Employer may, in its sole discretion and for any reason, terminate employment without further compensation, notice, pay in lieu of notice, and severance"".

378	Just like the title says. I have a recurring payment the first of every month to have money automatically taken out to pay rent. However, for some reason it was not taken out yesterday and now the apartment wants me to pay a late fee. I dont plan on paying that fee since it was the complex's system that did not take money out. However I am worried about them threatening the lease if I dont pay the late fee. What can I do?	No
379	So, my sister met someone online who had a shit life, so she invited her to come live with us. It was alright for awhile, but she slowly started showing more and more of the fact that she's an awful person, until it finally blew up and my dad kicked her out, and told her to never come here again. My sister has been talking with her, offering to give her her things somewhere not on the property, but she's refusing to, saying she has legal squatter's rights to come get her things, since she lived there for over 6 months and has proof, and that she can't be evicted without a full months notice. However, she never lived here and paid rent, it was always as though she were another family member. Does she actually have these rights?   I did some Google-fu, and it said that when evicting squatters they need a month's advanced notice like any other tenant, but is she even a squatter since she was living with us in our house?   Thanks for your help.	No
380	Over the weekend I was having a discussion with friends and they turned me on to the California Overtime Exemption laws. I work in the IT field, and according to [one site I found](http://ckslaw.com/it-and-computer-technology-workers/) it appears I'm paid significantly below the Overtime Exemption threshold, but am salaried and not provided overtime pay.  The main hangup I have is that if I check the [actual wage order](http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/WageOrders2006/iwcarticle4.html), it breaks down the salary cutoff as 2 times the state minimum wage, so I'm not sure where that number in the first site comes from.  I've never had any experience with legal matters like this and am not really sure what to do with this information. Any advice is greatly appreciated!	No
381	Hey guys, so a few months ago I got a speeding ticket, I went to court and got it reduced to a small fine and traffic schools. I opted to pay the fine in monthly installments since at the time I was preparing for a newborn and didn't account for the extra expense of the ticket. So a few months go by and I thought everything has been settled and having completed traffic school but I get a letter in the mail saying I only made one monthly payment. It turns out I had to manually make the monthly payments and they weren't recurring. I called the courts offices and they said I can't do anything, I need to pay it through a collection agency now which almost tripled the ticket and if I write a letter to the courts they might allow me to retake traffic school since they couldn't accept it the first time due to not having completed payments.  Is there any other option for me?	No
382	i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	No
383	Partner locked me out of bottom floor of house (where we live). All my stuff is down there. We are both rental tenants on the same lease. Is this legal?	No
384	"I just got ""fired"" (he didn't say I was fired directly and didn't give me a pink slip or any notice like that but told me ""leave my restaurant"") after turning in my written two week notice last Friday. How should I follow up? Can this hurt me if in the future an employer calls for references? I've never been fired and am not sure what to do."	No
385	My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	No
386	I'm looking to change my name and gender marker. It costs $435. I looked into waiving the court fees and I'm not sure if I can qualify because I'm a dependent. A foot injury from 6 months has prevented me from getting a job in case anybody says I should just get a job. Does being a dependent affect the possibility of waiving the court fees?	No
387	I never took my husband's last name and now we're divorcing. We have a child together and I'd really like to have the same last name (his). Would he be able to protest my taking the same name as my daughter?	No
388	So I live in Colorado and my roommate who's on the lease with me and 2 others recently broke an 'outside of the lease agreement' and she got a verbal eviction from the landlord because we all signed a contract stating that if we had the cops over it would result in immediate eviction for whoever was responsible. So we found a replacement.  But now she is refusing to leave, so the landlord has to go to the courthouse to get a court ordered eviction and she has made it clear she is only staying to make our lives hell and will be trying to get us kicked out right along with her. She has even went as far as to get a civil protection order under false allegations! Including false allegations of assault, threat with a deadly weapon, and holding against her will! The night this all supposedly happened the cops were called and seen that nobody was assaulted and she had locked herself in the house. They told me they could give me a harassment charge (I was being an asshole because she was walking around naked!) but never said anything about assault or threatening. So i'm guessing it wasn't in the police report. So i should be good once we go to court right? I guess my question is what should i do in this situation?	No
389	I have full custody (legal and physical) in this situation, and my ex has monitored visitation. I won child support through the court as the CSSD was never able to verify my ex's income. Recently my ex filed to open a new case with the CSSD, and I'm unsure if that's even possible nor do I understand the intention of that. So I guess my question is, if there is already a support order through the court, will the CSSD even bother with this?   Thanks in advance!	No
390	He has an attorney. There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her. Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	No
391	Last October I moved out of an apartment. I gave two months, written notice, moved everything out, cleaned, and turned in the key as per my lease. Around February I got an email claiming that I owed the property company ~$650 for occupying the dwelling 23 days after I had moved out. I contacted the office, they said I was fine and it was a mistake. I called the collections department (same company) and they said the account was correctly in arrears and I needed to settle the debt. I told them to contact the office and settle this themselves and to leave me out of it. Now almost a year later I have a notice in my credit report that I have a delinquent account in collections. I cannot find my copy of the original lease either. The apartment was a low income housing situation and it seems like a bullying tactic to take advantage of people in poor financial situations, thinking it would be easier to pay $600 to make them go away rather than get a lawyer involved. It's starting to negatively affect my credit score.  How do I rectify this? Do I need a lawyer?	No
392	Mainly referring to working in assistive living (nursing homes) but I guess this could apply to any employer.  I recently acquired a med-tech certification and they gave me a hard time about receiving a copy because they were afraid I would take it and apply to jobs elsewhere.  I'm pretty sure I never signed any kind of contract to complete the training and the management at my facility keeps trying to refuse giving copies of licenses to employees but I don't think they can legally do this.	No
393	"First time asking for legal advice, so forgive me if this is maybe the wrong place?  Firstly im 24, living in Michigan. I was adopted privately when I was 2, after being removed from my birth mother's home for child endangerment.   Now, my adopted parents and I are estranged. My birth mom is actually deceased, she died in 06' and I have no idea who my birth father is as my parents have denied me access to my adoption file. My birth father also walked away when my birth mom got pregnant.   I'm wondering if its possible to legally unadopt myself? I identity with my birth name, my birth family  (who I found and am in contact with). I'm currently married so this wouldn't even effect my current last name, only what my legal ""maiden"" name is. Personally I want to be as completely removed from my adopted ""family"" as you can be. My adopted brother basically gives no fucks about his parents and I know for a fact I will be saddled with any sort of care for them, funeral costs etc if something happens. They are not my parents and I want to be untangled with them.  Is there any way to do this?"	No
394	"Repost because nobody responded, I could really use some help.  I am currently a student working at a camp, and am in Canada. So we had a training week, in which we worked 35 hours total.   Under the contract, we are to be paid ""A weekly amount $480 will be paid for employment-- not to exceed 40 hours per week."" They said that because we worked 35 hours during training, they can deduct 5 hours of pay. But I interperted that as no matter how much we work, 1hr,10 hr, we get paid 480 a week.   They replied stating another line in the contract: ""Pay will be deducted for days of work missed, for whatever reason, and calculation of said pay will be on a pro rata basis.""   If that was their argument, I was calling bullshit (figuratively) because no day of work was missed, and that line states that you can deduct 96 for every day of work missed (Pro rata).   Can an lawyer be able to confirm that I am under just grounds?"	No
395	Finished up my lease on an apartment with 3 other guys on the first of July and received the itemized list of charges against the security deposit. Some of the charges on it were $150 for labor in replacing a fist sized hole in the wall, 150 for parts and 225 for labor in replacing a broken door jam which I had already bought a door jam to be installed, and some other things. As of right now he said that he was being a nice guy and not charging the cleaning fee, which he priced at 400 and pretty much said that if we complained about the pricing he would apply that fee.   What I'm wondering is if there is some standard for pricing that a landlord can charge and if they are able to tack on more money after sending the itemized list because $150 to replace $10 of drywall and to paint that area seems absurd. Anything helps, thanks	No
396	My father left when I was young and never paid any child support after the split. He has reached a debt of about $50,000 and is somewhere in Georgia or South Carolina. I still have a way of contact and could find him if need be. Being in college, I could really use this money he owes me to pay the bills and make a down payment on a house after graduation. My mom won't pursue the issue herself, despite him using my sister's social to rent homes only to not pay on them. What can I do to begin receiving payments or put him in jail? Thanks Reddit.	No
397	The short story is that the repairs our landlord has done to this house, starting from long before we moved in, are dangerously bad - ie; tin foil and duct tape holding together pipes, rags tied around pipes in leu of insulation, etc.   The latest issue is that water started pouring through the furnace and electric outlets because the roof is bad, we asked them to fix it, they came and dabbed some tar in random spots on the roof and left.  They insist that this was appropriate (they didn't even know where the leaks were inside the house and didn't come in to look and see if it was even safe with all the electric and water) and we had to shut off power to the furnace and ceiling because of all of the water and the antique cloth covered wires.    We have a baby due in two months and with all of the water/electricity being maintained in this way, there is no way it's safe for us to keep living here.  So we (while completely paid up to date on rent) told them that we would not be paying any further rent and are moving out as soon as possible, with a maximum of 30 days.  We have done several thousand dollars worth of improvement on the house, and we even told them to keep the security deposit.  We were late on rent one time last winter and the wife came over at 10pm at night with no warning screaming and accusing us of being liars, when we were genuinely just waiting for a check to clear.  They are very angry with us for blowing the whistle and calling it time to go, so with the wife's history of late night drama, I don't really feel safe having them come in the house when we are already this stressed and trying to move.    They are demanding entry, demanding to start showing the house and threatening to bring the police over to let them in.  As far as my legal knowledge goes, they can't possibly do anything of the sort - can they?  At this point this whole thing just seems insane - I just want to move somewhere where I know that my family is safe! We are in Michigan and this whole thing started on Monday.	No
398	"Hi guys. I have a lot of questions. Thank your for being well versed in insane minutiae. I did a lot of googling about this and found only bits and pieces of answers    **Scenario**   I am a toddler teacher at a daycare with about 70 employees and two locations, NAEYC accredited. Our location is in a very old building. Today we came in to find that the storage facility connected to the designated break area (they share a door) is undergoing asbestos abatement. All proper signage, warnings, and info packets posted. The room was blocked off with a sheet of plastic and some plywood. None of the employees were alerted, nor were the families. We were also not offered alternative locations to eat lunch. This break room stores all of the food for the children, as well as all cleaning supplies, classroom supplies, extra toys, eating utensils, and a fridge where the employees store lunch and some snacks for children are stored. My boss claims the owner of the building told her to ""keep kids out of the break area because work is being done"" but that asbestos was not mentioned.     **Action sequence**   I am on the playground with my children speaking to another toddler teacher. I ask her if my boss is informing the families and she isn't sure. I indicate that I'm going to let them know that they should keep their children out of the designated area, as they are often in there. My boss's sister (this is it's own problem obviously) hears this and immediately texts my boss. Boss storms onto the playground, interrogating me about why I would want to tell parents about these ""chemicals"" and saying I don't know what I'm talking about, etc etc. When I immediately agreed that i would keep it to myself if she so wished, she continued. She said I just like to caused trouble, that I was a gossip, immature, strange thing like that. I mostly ignored her as I was with my kids, and holding one of them. At the end of her ranting she asked me ""Why do you even come here every day?"" I just kind of gave her a blank stare because that question made no sense to me. I reminded her that I'm putting in my two weeks notice on Friday (going to grad school) and She tells me I'm not needed and I should leave that afternoon and not return. So, humiliated and devastated, i did.  *Note: When I say boss, I refer to our assistant director, as our director is out of town. That's why i was waiting to give my notice, as the Director would return friday. The AD indicated that she was in communication with the director the whole time. I have had no luck contacting the director.*   **Questions**    *1* Does a landlord have any obligation to tell the tenants when asbestos removal is being done? Is the presence of children relevant?   *2* Does my boss have an obligation to let employees know that this work is being done? Does she have an obligation to tell the parents?   *3* Does the landlord have the responsibility of having the air tested for asbestos levels after removal?    *3* Is there anything shady about her reasoning for firing me? I understand at will and all that, but does the safety concern change anything?    *4* Will I be able to collect unemployment from them?    *5* Will I find myself in legal trouble if (now that I am no longer an employee there) I let the parents I know/have contact with that there is asbestos work going on?    I know this is a lot so I truly thank you for reading and considering. I am so lost right now and sadly no amount of googling is bringing me solid answers to these questions. Any help or insight would be incredibly appreciated. And if there are legal issues that may arise that I was unaware of, please let me know! This is turned my life right upside down. Help.  **tldr**: Asbestos abatement being done in a daycare, no one was told it was happening. I found out halfway thru the day when my coworker asked what all the cancer signs are about. Boss/acting boss fires me (allegedly with permission from real boss) for indicating that I wanted to tell the parents of the children who attend the daycare."	No
399	Looking for advice on how to apply for apartments with an emotional support dog. I haven't had luck finding dog friendly apartments but I want to know my options on notifying the potential landlord about my dog. I know that landlords can't discriminate based on ESA's but I'm worried that if I tell them about my dog they will make up another reason. Can I not inform them of my dog until after the lease has been signed? Or do I have to bring it up earlier in the process to avoid being on the wrong side of the law?	No
400	I'm a divorced mom of 3. My husband took me to court and got temporary custody of the children, because I was abusing adderall and meth. I moved away and went through outpatient treatment and was able to see my kids every other weekend supervised. After I completed treatment, I received my portion of my ex-husband's 401k from the divorce. Well, that money led to a relapse and the temporary custody order was finalized.   I went further away this time to an inpatient rehab. I signed up for a year but decided to leave early. Right now I'm living in a halfway house. I've been clean almost 6 months.   My ex said he's willing to reconcile whenever I'm ready to move back. He's forgiven me for everything.  The problem is, I fell in love with a guy in rehab. He's been clean for over 2 years though, because he was in prison for over a year. My ex found out about it and isn't too happy.   So, my question is....if I move back to my hometown and live with my new boyfriend, would family court take into consideration his criminal history when deciding on custody?  I love my children, and I would do anything to get them back. But I don't want to walk away from a potentially amazing relationship. Any advice would be much appreciated.	No
401	I currently work in Minnesota. I have both personal and vacation hours that can be used for whatever reason. I recently accepted a position at a different company and was told by my current employer that I owed $870.00 in overused vacation hours.   What I realized was that even though we have access to the entire year's vacation as of January 1st each year, we earn them by accruing them throughout the year. I currently have gone over in vacation from what I have earned at this point in the year by 35 hours. I am a non-exempt employee.  The frustrating part is that I currently have 89 hours of unused personal time that will just be lost. My employer has informed me that our payroll system does not allow personal and vacation days to be switched after being processed. I have been asked to initial a document to allow me last paycheck to be garnished for the $870.00. If I do not sign it, the company has the right to take legal action to recoup the funds.   Is this common? If I do not sign it is it likely that legal action will occur? I understand that I should have researched the company policies beforehand, I am just disappointed that I have so many personal hours that I could have used instead. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
402	Hi there,  I'm going to be moving in with my SO, into a house that he owns, and I will be paying him rent. We live in Ontario. What are the laws like regarding cohabitation and how would things work if we get married? Does the money I put in for rent give me some sort of equity in the house? Also is there any kind of standard document that we could use for a rental agreement? Do we need to have a lawyer look over anything? Thanks in advance :)     Apologies if this has been posted before (please link if so) but searching on mobile is a nightmare!	No
403	Hello all.  As the title says, my grandmother as of this morning is unable to use her shower (bath/shower) because she can't lift her leg over the tub to get in.   Her building manager says there's nothing they can do.  She's lived there for about 10 years now.    I realize that it's a bad situation for everyone involved, but are they required by law to accommodate her at all?  This is in Metro Detroit.   Thank you.	No

405	There is a video of a woman, who is antireligious, drawing a picture of Muhammad.  And in the comments there was  a guy who found her address where she lives, and another man wrote 3 days ago that he is going to her address to address kill her because she drew the cartoon.

406	Hi,   I am typing this in front of nice lake I am staying at the next a few days while this issue has been going on.     I signed a lease agreement back in March 2017 with a roommate for the period of Aug 2017 to July 2018. The end of June the roommate wanted to get out of the lease so I released him and took care of his part. On Aug 1st, I contacted the landlord to reschedule key pickup to the 2nd. On Aug 2nd, I again called landlord to schedule a key pick up and a walk through of the house. During this call, the landlord asked for the payment of Aug's rent plus last two months of the lease in advance because I do not have a co signer (foreign student). I asked the landlord if I can pay more than half ($2000) of the total amount $3600. And the rest will be paid in a week or two after receiving an international wire. They refused to comply and told me to pay the full amount or no keys. After the call, I read the lease agreement multiple times. And the clauses in the contract dont mention anything about paying last two months or even a co signer. However, the agreement of paying the last two months was only verbal back in March. One thing to mention, the contract has stated the amount of one month rent to receive the keys. Another thing, they have a late payment clause which 10% of the amount. Anyway, after deep thinking, I made an online pmt of $1200 which is August rent to put them legally liable in case of attorneys involvement. What do you think I should do in this case?    I am now living in my car the past few days. I am mentally exhausted and restless with lack of sleep and not sure what to do.   Thank you.	No
407	My boyfriend started renting a house in June. He inquired about signing a lease multiple times but the landlord never had him sign a lease. He has been paying all his rent and utilities on time. The house has multiple issues, including a leaking/sinking in roof, walls, clogged pipes, possibly black mold in the bathroom, and overall needs to be deep cleaned. Not a great place, I know. As my bf did his walk through he noted all these issues and since has messaged the landlord multiple times about fixing everything. The landlord response was to do nothing. He's already looked into moving out into a new apartment in August.   Now, my bf and I were supposed to take a road trip out to my home state in June, so I came out to the house so we could get ready to go. After some unexpected expenses, we couldn't go on the trip until the following month. I have been staying with him since.  Today, the other tenet who holds the primary lease (who he has had many issues with, including the landlord telling bf she tried to take money from his overpaying the rent) started yelling at my bf that he needed to pay back rent for me staying here. The landlord never said that I had to leave or that I had to pay anything while I have been here, and when we called to talk to my bf's dad he said that he has never heard of such a thing and he would ask his attorney.  Any advice would be helpful, neither of us have had to deal with all these issues before.	No
408	So I signed up for a property online where I gave me esignature. I went through a housing agreement, and signed it. Now I'm in a position where I have provided no bank information, but the place still expects me to pay $1000 even though I never moved into the property.  Like I said, never paid a deposit, never moved to the property, is there a way out of this?	No
409	"I'm currently employed in GA and my boss is trying to force me to resign... My boss mislead me to believe I could work remotely and relocate to another state (not in writing unfortunately) and then changed her mind weeks later. She has been trying to get me to submit a resignation letter since I plan on moving (even though I work remotely now in GA). I told her I wasn't ready to submit the letter (as I don't have another job) and she decided to find a replacement for me anyways. She hired the person under the guise as ""help"" for me but has made announcements in meetings (in front of me) that I will be leaving.   She also requested for me to be present in the interview process for my replacement and told the applicants I was leaving the company. She is going to continue pressuring me to submit a resignation letter and I'm ultimately afraid she will fire me for misconduct. She has said in the past that no one will get unemployment on her watch, etc. I'm afraid that she will create a reason to fire me for misconduct... How can I protect myself in this situation?"	No
410	My parents bought their California house in 1981 and their property value never goes up for property tax reasons.  Does anyone know what law caused them to have this benefit?  It's not proposition 13 because their property value doesn't even go up 2% each year.  They are in San Bernardino County in California in case that's relevant.    I believe that people who bought their house at a later year don't get this benefit because their next door neighbor bought about eight years later and has a substantially higher property value for property taxes.	No
411	"I recently had to shut down my business, it wasn't working out. i wasn't making any money, but i own the office space i was working out of. this was three months ago.   last week, i broke up with my girlfriend and we will be moving out of the apartment we are currently renting on July 19th.   the space i own is pretty large. the bathroom has a drain on the floor so i can most definitely build a shower in there no problem. shouldn't take me more than a couple hours work, and it'll look decent when i'm finished.   there is a small room in the back i used to use as my office, i was thinking about moving my desk and putting a bed back there. there is also a break room that already has a refrigerator, toaster oven, and microwave. i don't need more than that for a ""kitchen"". anything i cook is in the toaster oven or microwave.   that leaves the rest of the space for me to ""live"" in. can i legally furnish this place up and just live here for a bit? i live in florida if that matters"	No
412	In the U.K. If a minor runs away from home (due to bad parenting) can they face any kind of charges (so long as no laws are broken) and also, if they stop at a friends house and the friend doesn't tell the authorities can they face charges too?	No
413	I was fired from my job as a health inspector at a county government in Illinois. I was told it was because I was not performing to expectations. I was on a 6 month probationary period and at 5 1/2 months through it, and would not have protection from the union until 6 months. I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me.   I work very little with my bosses (the director and assistant director of the division), and instead work closely with senior people who work as trainers. In the 5.5 months I received no formal performance review or corrective action.   I was part of a harassment investigation, against the director of the division as I witnessed him say something sexist to another coworker. This was the second harassment investigation against the director.   There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire.   Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires.   The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women).   Do I have a case for retaliation since I was fired being part of a harassment investigation? Do I have a case for wrongful termination since there was little to no documentation about corrective action and heterosexual employees, who performed worse than me were retained.   If I do have a case, what do I do next?	No
414	"We've since moved out of state but the property in question was in Eastern Washington. Landlord sent a proxy for the walk through who was in our opinion completely over the top with the walkthrough, but despite that we thought it went okay. We were expecting for the landlord to find ways to chip away at most of our deposit with stuff here and there (for instance, there had been an ancient, cheap garage door opener which disappeared; we got charge $50 for it, but whatever). So even though we thought we had done a very good job taking care of the place and prepping it for the next renters, we were prepared to kiss our 1200 goodbye.  The landlord sent us a bill for $5,000 in ""damages"". That's it. No explanation, just ""tenant damages"".   There was no damage whatsoever that was caused by us that wasn't repaired before we left. There had been some severe damage caused by a freak windstorm a year prior that the landlord had never fixed. There had been damage that had been there before we even moved in, but the landlord claimed they didn't have our damage report on file and that they were going to go off old photos from ""before we moved in"". We had completed that when we moved in, sent it in, and wrote it down separate in a notebook since it was a single page form that they said they would copy and send back and of course never did. We completely repainted, we completely rebuffed and waxed the floors, we made every bathroom sparkle cleaned the chimneys, etc. We can't think of anything else they could possibly be charging us for.  What can we do to dispute this? They said we had ""ten days from the time of this letter"" to respond before it would be escalated to collections, and the date on the top of the letter was clearly marked two weeks before it was even sent. I've never had a landlord try to screw us like this before so I don't even know where to start."	No
415	"California  Earlier this month, a drunk driver crashed into my parked car. My car was towed and later deemed a total loss. During the entire ordeal I was studying abroad.  It's been taking quite a while to get this sorted out. The claim has just been sent to a settlement adjustor who is hunting down the responsible party's insurance. My question is, since this is not a personal injury issue on my part, is the settlement only limited to the value of the car? Or is it possible to argue for a settlement that considers the stress of dealing with the problem while abroad, the emotional ""pain"" (for lack of a less dramatic word) of losing a prized possession, and the inconvenience of not having a car for over a month (I need to get a job for the summer, but not having a car is making that more difficult than it would have been)?   Must these negotiations take place solely through insurance, or is it possible for me to file a separate claim outside of insurance? And would I need to hire a lawyer for that?  Some supplemental information: if not already obvious, it's my first time dealing with anything car accident or insurance related. I'm a student that classifies as low income by most measures in my area.   A quick Google search indicates the responsible party comes from the family of a wealthy and powerful former city council member, so I have some trepidation in trying to negotiate as good a settlement as possible."	No
416	"On Jan. 31, 2012 I left my abusive (now ex) husband. The next day, I got a restraining/no contact order against him. Divorce was finalized 12/12/12.  Fast forward to 5/5/15. I was pulled over by the police and I wasn't sure why (I'm careful, don't speed, etc.). I was told there was a warrant out for my arrest for the past 3 years! I asked the officer to please double-check and re-run my license.  He did and told me the warrant was for ""Failure to pay a medical bill to [name redacted] Community Hospital"". Officer's exact words.  I was taken into custody and was in a holding cell for several hours while my son and my current boyfriend paid my bail. I was held on a $5000 bond for a $1000 medical bill.   On 5/8/15, I went to my mandatory court date. I thought I was going in front of the judge, as per my release papers. I  was actually taken into a conference room with the owner of the collection agency that was holding this medical bill. I tried to explain to him that I had no knowledge of the bill and no knowledge of a debtor's exam....I didn't go  to the debtor's exam because all papers regarding this issue went to my ex's house and I had the no-contact order. I had NO way of knowing about any contempt of court charge from missing the debtors hearing.  I was told by this man that if I missed one more payment or was late even by 1 day, that he would re-instate the warrant.   I have been paying $25/month for over 2 years now and they still say I owe over $700 on this bill. None of my $500 bail went for the medical bill....and this is a medical bill that I believe is actually my ex-husband's.   I did take the owner of the collection agency to court and was only awarded damages in the amount of $1000. I was not allowed to take the 2 police departments involved in my arrest to court. Both agencies harrassed me during my arrest even though I gave them  no problems whatsoever. For instance...when I was switched between departments,  I was put in leg irons and my wrists chained around my waist and had to ride in the K9 cruiser and I was told I was the ""new chew toy"" and they threatened to sic the dog on me for no reason. I was harrassed for ""ignoring the bill"". Mind you, my ex's father is also a bailiff in that particular jurisdiction and at the time I still had their last name.  One more point of interest....when my bail was paid, the owner of the collection agency who also posed as a judge on 5/5/15 was the one who signed for my bail! (I still have the receipt).   My question is, do I have any recourse in any of this? Is there some way to make all of this go away? I honestly cannot afford this bill and I do not believe it is mine....no one has ever sent it to me to look and no one will show me. I honestly do not know if it even exists.  How can I handle this. This bothers me and since this whole incident, I refuse to  drive alone and I  get scared to even go into the jurisdiction this happened in. This is negatively affected my life and I'm fed up about that fact. Please help/advise. Thank you!"	No
417	My husband and I are pretty sure we just witnessed a raid in our expensive apartment complex. Due to his job sensitivity, we don't want to live in a place like this any longer. Can we break our lease due to feeling unsafe? Our apartment complex might be filed with rich, drug dealing college kids. (Also, we're pretty sure our mailbox got broken into the first month we moved in.)	No
418	"I live in California. My boyfriend signed a lease with a new landlady on July 13th and moved in on July 15th. He's renting a bedroom from a three-bedroom house. The second bedroom is occupied by the landlady, and the third bedroom is occupied by another tenant who's been living there for four years.  Today is July 21st. This afternoon I was over at his place and no one was home, so we had sex in his room. Afterward, I went to clean up in his shower and he stayed in his room to tidy up. While I was in the shower, his landlady came upstairs saying she heard noises and asked what was going on. His door was already a bit ajar, because I didn't shut it all the way on my way to the bathroom (I thought no one was home). She pushed the door open to see my naked boyfriend and started freaking out, asking him who was in the shower (she could hear that it was on), telling him it was not okay for him to have a guest over, especially if the guests use the utilities, and stormed downstairs after yelling all of this loudly enough for me to hear over the running shower. I ran back into his room, scared and confused and dripping wet (not one of my finest moments). He was putting his clothes on as I came back in, and went downstairs right away. They talked downstairs for about ten minutes while I hid in his room, and when he came back upstairs he told me he had a to find a new place to live. Apparently, she told him he was not allowed to have guests over (1. He didn't see that on the contract when he signed it, but he's going to get a copy of it to make sure; 2. The other tenant brings one of her friends over frequently). She told him he has a week to find a new place to live, and then she's going to kick him out because ""she can't trust him anymore."" She also said she's not going to give his security deposit back. Is she allowed to kick him out for this? He's been living here for less than a week, and he paid for an entire month of rent. Obviously he doesn't want to live here anymore regardless of the outcome, but it would be preferable if he could stay through his first month or if she could give him his money back. I especially don't understand how it's legal for her to keep his security deposit. I don't know the exact language on the contract regarding eviction, but she has to let him stay at least until the end of the month, right? Thanks for reading, and any help is appreciated."	No
419	Tomorrow I have a court date for a petty larceny charge. I've already been arraigned and this will be My second court date. My lawyer called me up this morning and told me he won't be able to be there tomorrow, and to show up and ask for an adjournment and he said the judge will have no issue granting this.  Is there anything I should worry about regarding this?	No
420	Hello. My father passed away a couple of months ago. He didn't leave much in the way of assets, but he did have a 401k with a little over $52k in it.   My siblings and I weren't close with him, he wasn't a nice guy. My mother wants no part of anything to do with him.  So, I met with a local estate lawyer who was willing to handle everything, but he wanted a $3000 payment up front that would cover all costs associated. He said that if we were to put it on a credit card, we could get money out of the estate that he would be opening in order to pay it off before the next payment is due. My siblings and I, being young, don't have access to that amount of capital up front, and with my mother not wanting to get involved, I don't know what to do.   So here are my questions: 1. Does this seem to be a fair rate for setting up an estate and handling all of the probate stuff 2. Are there any services that you're aware of that could pay the money up front for a fee, that we could pay back quickly from the estate 3. Is this something I could handle myself 4. Am I running out of time to do this  One of my siblings and I are adults, just young and in school. We don't want to miss out on this money, the only good thing our dad has ever really done for us as far as we are concerned. He listed no beneficiaries on his 401k and had no will. This is taking place in Michigan, and the lawyer came highly recommended by my mentor in the local chamber of commerce.  Thank you so much for your time.	No
421	Hello Legal Advice,   As stated our previous tenant owes us a sum of money and the sum was sent to a collections agency. The collections agency learned the individual was arrested and sentenced to jail for 10 years.    I am being told the statute of limitations for suing him is 4 years so we are out of luck. Is there anything I can do?	No
422	So the title says my STBX and I are getting divorced. There was a domestic incident tonight and I'm filing for a restraining order in the morning.

424	"I live in Oregon in the US btw  I have been receiving phone calls from a ""company"" called Bahama Island Cruises based in what they call the ""Orlando promotion center"" for a few months now. I have received over 20 calls over the past few months most of them wake me up during the day because I work graveyard.  The past six times I have talked to an ""agent"" and told them to put me on the do not call list, stop calling me, and have also told them that its illegal to keep calling me when I have said this (I'm pretty sure it is right?) The last time the ""agent"" said that they weren't a telemarketer (lol) I told him that he is calling ME trying to sell ME a stupid trip that makes him a telemarketer he replied with ""have a great day...""

426	So, we noticed the beginnings of some rot on the siding &amp; decking over this past winter and decided to tear it all out and get it repaired.  When the contractor pulled off the ledgerboard for the deck, the siding was completely rotted out and came off with the ledgerboard.  We expected this, but what we did not expect is that there was ZERO sheathing or moisture barrier under the siding.  It's T1-11 plywood siding nailed directly to studs, no tyvek, no OSB sheathing.  The only thing separating the insulation &amp; studs from the outside elements is the cheap 8'x4' plywood or pressboard siding sheets.  Can I sue the previous homeowner (they had it built in 1983, original owners) or sue the inspector?  Does homeowners insurance cover this?	No
427	Long time lurker, first time poster in the sub.  Our landlord has chosen not to renew our lease which expires today. I co-leased with my father who is electing not to leave. FWIW, my father is mentally ill and does not have arrangements to live elsewhere.  I have moved out of state this week expecting my father would leave as well.  The landlord is saying I would be liable for the apartment because of my father. Since they've chosen not to renew the lease, I'm not sure if I can be liable for my dad.   I would call the cops and have him removed but since he was formerly on the lease, not sure what I can do.   Any thoughts to remove my dad would be great. I would also appreciate advice on how to handle the leasing Office.	No
428	An officer came to my home to speak to me after I specifically told him on the phone that I wanted to speak to him the following day instead of the day that he called me. When we spoke he asked me a broad question to which I replied yes. He took that as an admission of guilt and said I was guilty to everything. Now a police report is going to be filed. Everything was in person, I never wrote a statement and there is no real solid evidence against me besides that I'm a suspect. This is about a texting harassment case.  Basically my question is what will be in this police report? Will he say I'm guilty even though I answered a broad question?  Montgomery County-MD	No
429	The apartment complex that I moved out of owes me about $1,000. They kept “forgetting” to send the request to sent me the check. And then they “accidentally” got the address wrong twice. And now they aren’t answering my phone calls. Can I put lien on the apartment complex. Or is there a way to get a hold of whoever hired the manager at that complex?	No
430	So.    My ex was arrested for child porn and i am divorcing him.  He is now filing motion after motion to delay not only his trial, but our divorce.    I can't get legal aid because of the circumstances, and don't have the money to get a lawyer.  I know Florida tends to have the spouse who has custody stay withibk 50 miles of the other parent, but I need to get out   Any ideas, info, advice....  Would be greatly appreciated.	No
431	So I submitted my K1 visa petition back near end of May.  It went to California which shows 3.5 month processing time (should get word in September).  The next steps are confusing.  Some say you fill out support information and gather civil documents and pay a fee for consulate interview and should be a fast process.  When I look at NVC website, they are saying copies of documents mentioned above go to NVC for processing before the consulate interview and can take up to 11 weeks to process now!  What is the correct process and is it really 11 weeks to process at NVC before an interview can be arranged (which takes 3 weeks to get that set up)?  If anyone can help me understand the process and timeline, I would appreciate it!	No
432	"Location: South Carolina  Okay, to understand what's happening, you need to know a little bit about my living situation. So here it goes;  I'm 20 years old and live with my parents - two women who I'll be referring to them as Ma (Step Parent) and Mum (Bio) respectively. We've lived in this house for years, it'll be six years next Spring. Anyways, when we began renting this house, we set up all the necessary payments with various companies - Electric, Water &amp; Sewer, Trash, ect. - we ever asked all of these companies if their was ANY extra steps or processes we had to go through to get their services and they all said no, more specifically Water &amp; Sewer said something along the lines of ""No, ma'am your water and sewer is all ready to go"". We confirmed with our Landlord and he even said that everything was good to go.  Anyways, almost 6 years down the line, my Ma gets a call (in the middle of her workday), and is told that if we don't start an account with them TODAY that they will shut down our sewer services. Before today this company has NEVER contacted us - not through calls, emails, or mail. So because they close at four - which is ridiculous, by the way - Ma has to leave work two days earlier, which she get in trouble for, and has to rush to get all these documents that the sewer company claims they need to start an account.  As she's getting everything together, she calls the Sewer company several different times (six to be exact) to confirm what she needs and they tell her this; 100$ Account start-up fee, a signed copy of the lease, proof of residency, and an ID. However on her last call into the company, as the girl goes to tell Ma that she's got everything, my Ma hears in the background ""GIRL, that's not all she needs. She needs to pay the last two years worth of service!"" from the girl's boss.  When my Ma went into the Sewer company to start the account and pay the fee, they told her that they can legally charge us the past two years of service even though they never once told us that we needed to pay them or start an account with them. We can't afford to pay that, however when we told the Sewer company that, they told us that they'll just split up the full six years charge on our sewer bill until it's eventually paid off.  We have never had to contact this sewer company before, in fact any time we've ever had problems with our sewer, we've always called the water company and they've been the ones to fix it. The sewer company has had our house listed as ""VACANT"" in their systems for almost seven years and just never bothered to actually shut off the sewer system to the vacant house - which the girl on the phone admitted was the company's fault since their employees never shut it off.   And that's not all, we my Mum called the water company to ask them if this a legitimate company trying to charge them, the lady speaking with her told her that we weren't the only ones this was happening to. Apparently a lot of people are having this done to them by this Sewer company.  My question is; Can they legally force us to pay for those six years when THEY were the ones who screwed up? Especially when it's on such a large scale AND the company admitted it was their own fault?"	No
433	I rented a place at college for a year and graduated 6 months before the lease was up. I got a sublet for the second half of the year. I was never able to sign over the lease to him because my roommates weren't ever current on rent, so I stuck with the lease. We are close with the rental company, so they allowed this to happen and allowed him to pay the rent without us having to do anything shady to trick them. He paid the first one on time and everyone was happy, so from then on I just asked/ reminded him to pay rent. Every time I asked if he had paid the month, he would say yes and I bought it. Now the lease will be over at the end of the month and I have $2,500 that hasn't been paid, which came as a big surprise. The kid moved away and isn't responding to any calls or texts. I have no idea what to do right now, I don't have the money for the rent or for lawyers. And the other two roommates will probably be dragged into this as we all have a lease agreement on the full rent being paid. Any help would be appreciated, and I know I'm an idiot... but I had no choice but to gamble in this situation.	No
434	"So as the title says, I have some evidence of my landlord entering the house I live in with my 3 other adult room mates.   We are 28, 29, 40, and 21 males respectively with the 21 year old being out of the country for most of the summer. The three older of us all have full time jobs while the 21 year old attends college full time in the fall and spring. We rent all 4 rooms of this house and obviously with that comes use of the bathrooms, kitchen, common areas, etc. Typically all four of us are only home in the late afternoon and hang out in the evenings, so we have little interaction with our landlord Paco (changed for this story). Paco is an Argentinian immigrant, and for the most part a nice dude. All this is just background info.   Recently my girlfriend has been off school for the summer and has been spending time between my house, her parents house, and work considering she hasn't been bogged down with papers, class, etc and has been working a little bit more. On Friday 7/21 she had decided to stay the day and just hang and watch tv in my bed while I went to work so she could meet me at the gym afterwards. Obviously that's boring and she decided to clean the kitchen in the meantime, because with a house full of dudes it hardly ever got a deep clean. Pretty nice of her right? She figured since she was staying over extra that would be her way to contribute something to the house.   Well at some point Paco opened up the side door to the kitchen from the backyard and came face to face with her mopping the floor. He quickly said something along the lines of ""oops sorry"" and quickly closed the door.   Quick backstory on Paco, he pretty much bought the place as a tenant cash grab. My room is an illegal addition that used to be the living room, he lives in an illegal studio built off the side of the garage, and he lugged two Gulf Stream trailers back into the backyard to also rent out to additional tenants.   Suffice it to say we all know it wasn't the perfect situation to be in, but it's cheap so whatever.   Not anymore. After Paco opened up the back door with gf there mopping the floor he decided that we could only have guests over one night a week, which was never specified in the contract. The ONLY thing explicitly stated by the rental contract is that I would be paying rent on the 5th every month and that I would pay a security deposit before hand. Nothing limiting any sort of guests, or behaviors for that matter.   We had a talk about it where I reiterated that gf was off school for the summer and would be spending more time here until she goes back at the end of August. We seemed to agree on that point, and I thought that would be the end of it.   Well he decided to take the thumb turn off of the kitchen deadbolt, and then started stalking around my bedroom windows this morning while gf was getting ready to leave for work. When I walked her out to her car he was sitting right at the fence to his driveway staring at us while he seemed to be trying to fix the fence.   I'm pretty sure code enforcement would love to come have a look at all the living situations up in here, but until I find a new place to live that really isn't an option. Is there anything I can use to keep my landlord out of my place, or am I screwed because I rented a room and not the house? I'm just trying to see what my options are, me and the two older room mates are getting a new place as soon as one becomes available because living with this petty weirdo is getting really frustrating. Beyond giving me grief he's been giving gf anxiety and making the rest of the house incredibly uncomfortable.    (Sorry if this is rambling, it's kind of a developing situation and I'm a little frazzled)"	No
435	My roommate and I were feeling unwell in our basement apartment for a long time. We discovered a drier was exhausting directly into our unit. We asked the landlord to fix it, but he did, and ever since then it has gotten way worse. There's a chemical smell in the air and staying in the apt more than ~15 mins causes extreme fatigue, loss of focus, sinuses closing up, and chest tightness (Whatever it is isn't triggering the CO2 or natural gas alarm)    Landlord agreed to terminate our lease and let us keep our stuff in there unpaid for the first few weeks but now he wants us to set a move out date and pack up. But I feel really bad when I stay in here. The last time I went in to get my stuff I fell asleep suddenly and woke up 2 hours later with a nosebleed and difficulty breathing.    Landlord refuses to hire an indoor air quality inspector and says he plans on sealing off the whole basement and no longer renting it. I called the housing inspector but he said he only inspects whole houses, not just the basement... so I would need to go through my landlord... what do I do?	No
436	We are suing our former landlord for the return of our security deposit. In CT, you can claim double damages. However, we have some charges that we do agree with that were taken out of our security deposit. Let's say the total deposit was $1200.00 and the charges that we are not disputing equal $400.00. In filling out the paperwork, there is a spot to put the amount you are claiming and then a box to check off if you are claiming double damages. The paperwork specifically says not to include the double security deposit in that box, but I need to claim the amount in the area where I write my complaint. So, I have a few questions:  1. Do I put the full amount of the security deposit in the box where it says amount claimed ($1200.00)? Or do I put the amount of the security deposit minus the charges we are not disputing($800.00)?  2. When putting in the amount for double damages, do I subtract the charges before or after I double the amount. For example, would I claim $2000 ($1200 x 2 = $2400 - $400 = $2000), or would I claim $1600 ($1200-$400 = $800 x 2 = $1600)?  Any and all help is very much appreciated!	No
437	I live in Los Angeles. I lived in an apartment for around 6 months and moved out on July. I lived with two other girls, girl1 and girl2. I went to visit another country when the actual moving out was happening. To get out security deposit back, I gave girl1 permission to write my signature on the security deposit form. Girl2 left the house and was AWOL so girl2 forged her signature as well. Now, girl2 realized what happened and got her hands on the form on which the forged signatures are and she's threatening to sue unless we change the forwarding address to her name. She plans to run with a lot of our money. Please please help.	No
438	My water bill went up $150 after the landlord sent someone out to power wash the house. I am responsible for the water bill, but the lease doesn't say anything about power washing. I called the leasing office and they basically said there is nothing they will do because there is no proof the increased bill is due to the power washing, but our bill has never been this high in the year and a half that we have lived here. My husband wants me to call a lawyer, but do we even have a case here? I'm not sure what to do at this point because we just can't afford this right now.	No
439	I'd prefer to leave my location out as it is quite a small place and I don't want people knowing about this for obvious reasons. It is in Asia if that helps any and I am willing to PM the country to anyone that asks.  Basically I overheard my brother on the phone mentioning that he had videos of him and his girlfriend in compromising situations and I told my parents as well... they needed to know. I was told that they knew and that my mother had accidentally seen the video when she went to turn off his computer.   Both him and his girlfriend are under 16 and my parents have confronted him telling him how illegal this is and stuff but he is just not listening and denying everything. There was no like actual sex but just other stuff in the video apparently.   Legally how fucked is he?	No
440	10 years ago parents house added an extension on their deck. Entire room is elevated 8 inches with wood. The room extends past the cemented deck so a portion of it is just overhanging over dirt. Overtime water sipped in a bit and recently we noticed termites on the floor of the overhung area towards the house wall. Wall and a portion of the room needs to be replaced. Is there any legal action we can take or will it all have to be out of pocket? Thanks in advance.	No
441	The lease has no provision covering the possibility of the property being sold.  Would any buyer be bound by the terms of my existing lease?  I've found conflicting opinions when I searched Google. Some say the lease is tied to the property, and the buyer is buying the lease as part of the property. Others say the buyer has a right to execute a new lease or evict us if they so choose.  The lease doesn't start until 9/1, and the property is currently on the market. I'm just trying to figure out if I should expect to get kicked out of this place.	No
442	Hello, in my state there is a reduced offense you can plead guilty to, a $500 fine and no points, in exchange for removing a violation with points such as speeding. But you are only able to do it twice in 5 years. I did not realize I reached the limit when I mistakenly plead to it a third time. But as this should not have been available to me I wanted to know if any legal action can be taken against the municipality where the allowed this egregious error on their part.	No
443	"Rental tenancy dispute over flood damages caused by faulty toilet that clogged and overflowed.  A close friend of mine was renting a downtown vancouver high rise apartment. She lost her job 6 months ago and had to move out since she couldn't make rent.   The landlord - a property development company that owns the entire building - told her that she could not break the lease. She looked for subtenants and found one. Subtenant was approved by the landlord.  The subtenant didn't know if she wanted to stay longer than a month.  But after the month, she really liked the place and decided to stay till the end of my friend's lease - which was the end of last month. My friend didn't have this extension approved by the landlord. They thought she was only staying for a month. (More on this later)  Two weeks before the lease came to a close, the toilet had clogged and flooded. Apparently, the subtenant had flushed the toilet and went to bed. But the toilet tank flapper valve was stuck open and by perfect fucking coincidence, managed to also to be clogged on the drain end.  Water flowing in. Water not draining out. The toilet bowl floods all night. Subtenant wakes up next morning and discovers the water under her feet. She starts putting down towels and attempts to unclog the toilet drain.   Neighbors notify the landlord at this point. They walk in with their emergency repair crews and start ripping out the flooring.  The property manger takes down a statement from the subtenant. The subtenant apparently told her that toilet was always faulty. That it had overflowed and flooded twice prior to this incident. But in those cases, she was able to plunge the toilet out and fix the issue herself. So she didn't think it was necessary to notify my friend or the actual landlord. She fixed the issues herself.  My friend and I were on a business trip far away at the time. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a hold of the subtenant. She was notoriously hard to get a hold of even before. She's an international student with some difficulty with English. At this point, she saw the condition of the suite with the floors ripped out and went and stayed in a hotel. That weekend she went back home to Taiwan.  Landlord is now claiming that my friend is reponsible for the entire damage since the flood was caused by the negligence of the subtenant. Since the toilet had clogged twice before, she should have notified either my friend or the landlord directly and made sure that there was nothing wrong with it. The damages are some $60k since the water went 4 stories down. I find this extremely hard to believe since the pictures the landlord showed us as proof very clearly shows the water didn't even go 6 feet outside the bathroom door.  My friend does not have any form of rental insurance. She is not in a great financial position to pay for this claim. She's a wreck at the moment. She has been living at home the last 6 months with her parents. Her dad is the guarantor on her lease. And now she's terrified that the landlord would go after her dad and force a sale on their house. They're not financially well off either, with major credit lines already racked up. So she's not in a productive state of mind at the moment. I am helping her out by scheduling meetings with lawyers etc.  So far, we've met 3 lawyers. Each have their own position on this.   Lawyer #1: The least sharp professional I've come across. I genuinely thought she was hungover when she met us. She kept insisting that 11:57 AM - which is when the emergency repair crews went into the apartment was in the middle of the night and not almost noon. Even after I pointed this out, she kept saying that no reasonable person would expect the subtenant to be awake ""so late in the night."" She said we had a 50-50 chance nevertheless. She wasn't clear on what is expected from a reasonable person in this situation. Buying a plunger and fixing the clogs herself is not enough to be not negligent? Or was her responsibility very clearly to notify the landlord about this issue that she already fixed herself?  Lawyer #2: He was super-optimistic. We walked out of there and my friend actually was happy enough to respond to a high-5 I gave her. He said we're going to delegate responsibility for this damage on to the subtenant. Since she is in Taiwan now, the landlord will have a hard time going after her. What we needed to prove was that the landlord understood and knew very well that the subtenant was executing the remainder of the lease and not my friend. Unfortuntely, the landlord explicitly stated in an email that when the walked in to do emergency repairs, they had no idea who the person living there was. Later, she responded by saying that she was the subtenant they had approved 6 months ago. But they had only approved her sublease for 1 month as part of her original plan. True. My friend failed to inform the landlord that the subtenant wanted to extend.  What would it take to delegate responsibility towards the subtenant? How can my friend walk away from this and point the finger at this subtenant? I am not sure if it's that feasible. Moreover, I think this lawyer was trying to make a quick sale and lock in the retainer (We paid him at the end of the consult for the retainer). He was super confident that we were going to win. He later emails us asking for basic things like the tenancy agreement. So not inspiring confidence here.  Lawyer #3: This was probably the only person we met who was telling us the full truth as it is. He straight up said we were going to lose on the negligence part. It will be found that the subtenant was indeed negligent. He suggested we ask the landlord for proof that the damages were actually the amounts they claim they are. I suggested the idea of offloading responsibility on the subtenant. He said that wouldn't go so well simply because the plaintiffs already know she's gone home to Taiwan and it would be very hard to get a hold of her, especially not worth it for this sum of money. Makes perfect sense. Why would they not fight with all they have to make sure the cross-hairs are on my friend and her dad.  This happened today. Confused on who to go with. Never hired lawyers before. L3 is expensive. I felt he was too professional and that he would only stick to the absolute proper and morally correct ways of doing things. L2 seemed like he was a conman trying to convince us that we would win easily. Could it be he can play his charm trick on the judge as well and it would work? He is talking about filing a harassement suit against the landlord's lawyer who is calling my friends dad pretty much every day now. If we are going to be found responsible for this if it goes to trial - maybe the strategy we need to apply would be to roadblock them on every single step of the way and make their lives as hard as possible so they won't even go through the effort?   L1 was garbage.   L2 is super sharp and honestly an extremely effective salesman. He is incredibly effective at producing convincing arguments. And not without supporting evidence and case citations, etc. L2 is young, inexperienced (2 years) and works for a no-name law firm in the middle of nowhere.  L3 is very straightforward and honest. I don't know if he is going to exhaust every possible loophole and sink to the level of doing whatever it takes (as long as it is legal, I dont care about morality or appearing to be an asshole). I didn't get the feeling that he is ready to do this. But he's more experienced in litigation cases. He is also part of a prestigious law firm in the region.  Any obvious things I am missing here? Any obvious choice?  There is a 3rd option. The landlord's lawyer spoke to me over the phone. He wanted to get a hold of my friend's dad. But I picked up and blocked it. He did mention that he wanted to see if there was a way to resolve this issue ""in good faith"" instead of resorting to measures that are irreversible. While I am not on the lease or related to my friend, I do have a substantial savings accumulated up over the years. Maybe just calling this lawyer who wants to talk and having a conversation with him directly would help resolve this quickly? My friend, her mom and her dad are all terrified and simply unable to be productive in any capacity since there is the real threat that their house is going away on top of their already exising problem of criping debt.   They want ~$60k for all sort of damage to the suite and to 10 other suites across 4 stories. Most of that is inflated bullshit, I am convinced. They've never provided an invoice or any sort of evidence of substantial damage in the emails. Would there be a reason why they would have all this evidence and not show it up front when they make their claims? My gut feel tells me if I personally write them a cheque for $15k, I can tell them to fuck off forever. Plausible or am I on crack?  Need some advice. Apologies if this is a giant wall of text."	No
444	This is in Maryland.  Recently, Conover v. Conover came to the top courts here in Maryland, and a lawyer friend advised my family to take advantage of this ruling.  We have a polyamorus triad ( M -F^1 -F^2 ) with 2 children, one biological child per female. (M+F^1 = 1 child, M+F^2 = 1 child).  The lawyer friend hasn't been available recently, due to workload and whatnot, so I can't ask them questions right now.  They emailed me a Baltimore Sun article, and said we should look into it. [This is the article in question.](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-de-facto-20160710-story.html)  We have one big question in considering this.  What, exactly, are the benefits to seeking this ruling in our favor?  I'm gathering that it means that custody and visitation is assumed for all parents involved if there's a divorce or dissolving of the the triad.  And I also gather that, if something happens to one of the females and the male, the other female will have custody automatically, without requesting so from the court, since they are the de facto parent to their non-biological child.  I guess I'm asking for clarification about what it's all about, if any of my assumptions are correct, and why it would be in our best interest to do this.  If more details are necessary, I'd be happy to provide them, as I'm not sure what is and isn't relevant.	No
445	So I live on a property where my lot, neighbor 1's 2 lots, and neighbor 2's 2 lots are all part of a restricted covenant. According to the restricted covenant, none of us are not permitted to have animals besides the usual household pets. Regardless, they have chickens and roosters. The chickens and roosters are on their property but are physically closer my house than they are theirs. This means I hear them ALL THE TIME. Now, these people are total a-holes. I went and spoke to them earlier and as I approached the end of my property to speak to them, I saw one of the chickens had actually flown into my yard. Had my dogs been outside it would not have ended pretty.   What can I do to enforce the restricted covenant to keep them from having these disturbing chickens anymore? Pic of restricted covenant in comments. TIA.	No
446	My landlord has entered the premises twice without notifying us tenants. Each time he has said that it was for an emergency, but the emergency is fixed in usually 1-5 minutes. Is there anything we can do to have privacy? He will just casually walk in without any prior warning and then abruptly leave. I do have to admit that one time there was a grinder sitting out.  He still has not replaced any of the smoke detectors (we have none in our apartment) or fixed our A/C yet, which he has been notified on. I am wondering if there is anything I can do as a tenant because a landlord appearance every 20 days greatly bothers me. Thanks for any help.	No
447	I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?   I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.	No
448	My roommate got caught with so an eighth of marijuana while getting pulled over the other day, he was about to get his medical card this next week. He so far hasn't been charged but was taken to the police station. If he gets put on probation can he still get a medical card without any issues? I saw that the supreme court here passed a law saying that probation can't stop medical patients (http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/04/07/medical-marijuana-arizona-supreme-court/25416337/) but I can't seem to get anything about getting the card after being caught by the police.   Can anyone help me out on this?	No
449	So this is about my fiancé and his two kids (7) (4). she left all three of them back in march 2015 and in the divorce decree he waived child support but she's required to pay half of everything for them. he has primary physical custody and they split custody though she very rarely comes around. back in Nov 16, they went to court to make her pay half of day care by court order, so that's all she's been paying since.  now, it's been well over two years, she never has them, never offers to pay anything and we are wondering how easy changing a divorce decree in regards to child support will be. This is VA.	No
450	"So this has a ton of backstory, but I guess its all important.   My mother got me diagnosed with Autism syndrome at a very young age. She believes vaccines caused my Autism, and had to go through EIGHT DIFFERENT doctors to actually get me diagnosed. (I am convinced you can get anyone diagnosed with anything, especially when they are young and do what their parents instruct them to do during evaluations)  When I turned 18 I started having to do stuff like pay taxes and etc. I was working full time while going to highschool. I had a very strong social life with many friends, and was well liked throughout school. I am the opposite of what you would call ""Autistic"" and when I did eventually explain my situation to my school, they offered to help me get my diagnoses fixed. Even the special ed director quietly told me ""I'm not legally allowed to say this for sure, but you do not come off as autistic at all""  Anyways, I came across something that led me to believe I was receiving SSI for my disability. I confronted my mother about this on 3 separate occasions. The first two times she denied it. The third time she says that I used to receive a minuscule amount (less than 300 a year) I had called the SS office and they confirmed I was receiving disability, but could not specify how much.  The nearest SS office was a bit of a drive from me, and I did not have my license, so I couldn't get there any time soon, especially with working on graduating highschool and work on top of that. Everything I do/get I do on my own, buying food, clothes, my asthma medicine. The only thing I didn't pay for was rent. I never had any help with getting a permit or learning how to drive.  When I finally got an appointment set up and a ride to the SS office, my mother caught wind of it. 3 days later I am kicked out (2 hours after my graduation) and move to Texas with my father. Now that im here I am getting all sorts of shit done, and just recently went to the SS office. I received a statement of Disability benefits and realized I have been receiving $532 a month since early 2015. With my mother listed as my beneficiary.  This money has 100% NOT been being used for me or my wellbeing. And she has been collecting it for a full year after I turned 18. on top of that apparently she did something to disable the payments after she got last months payment (the month after I got kicked out) So I no longer receive the SSI ( something I shouldn't have even been receiving in the first place)  Do I have any legal recourse??? Is there any way I can prove she used these funds  fraudulently? I know that she will fight in court, she is insane and not the smartest person, but very stubborn. I didn't pay rent while I lived with her, and wonder if she will say thats what she used SSI for? (even though she is married to someone that makes over 100k a year, and she just started working full time for the first time since I was a kid, and only because my stepdad forced her to)  She blatantly lied to me that I recieved SSI, and this is mindblowing.  Sorry if this post is all mumbo jumbo, I just learned all of this withing the last 30 minutes and my mind is in a million places right now. If I didn't explain something well enough just ask and I will be happy to elaborate."	No
451	My (ex)husband and I have been separated for two years. I moved to Ohio (Cleveland area) from Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area) and have resided in Ohio for the entire two years. I started paperwork for a disillusionment, but he refused to sign the papers because he says he can't make the trip to Ohio for the final court hearing. Papers were never filed.  We have no children, we never purchased anything together, and we have agreed on our debts.  My question is am I able to file for divorce here in Ohio without him? Or do you I have to file for divorce in Pennsylvania? Am I able to do this on my own or would it best for me to hire a lawyer? Is there any legal aid available for this if I do need a lawyer?  Okay that's like four questions, but I have no idea how to proceed and I just want this to be over. Help, please.	No
452	"Looking for advice on pursuing a freelance scammer. My close friend was just ""scammed"" out of 50 hours of digital work that was agreed to be paid after completion.   Payment was per hour ($100.00) which the client agreed to multiple times through email. There are emails even letting the client know how many hours have gone by and if they wish to continue, in which the client replied that they wish to continue the process.   The job has been completed and now the client is arguing that it took too much time and they are not paying the amount they owe.   Is there anything my friend can do in order to receive payment? Is suing an option?  Thank you for the help in advance."	No
453	This is the third time in a week we've had some kind of power shutoff. We've had exactly one advance warning, and we've lost food that we had in the fridge. Can we withhold rent in the amount it would take to replace our groceries, or are we out of luck?	No
454	I work at my state university, and there is a cap on the hours a student may work (25 hours/week). I am an instructional aid (I teach the chemistry labs), but instead of paying per hour that you are actually there they pay you at a rate of 7 hours per every lab you teach (factoring in 3 hours per lab plus 2 office hours and 2 hours grading), and 3 hours for every recitation class you teach. Now, this summer I teach 3 labs and 3 recitations per week: this should equal 30 hours per week, but since I'm capped at 25 hours, I can only enter that many on my timesheet.   I thought that this was far, since often times the 7 hours they pay you for doesn't really equal 7 hours of actual work, but then I thought that they're making me work more per week for the same amount of pay as another student who works 5 hours less than I do.   Is this legal? Thank you in advance for any help!	No
455	Does anyone have any information on what it's like to be the victim when OSI investigates a sexual assault?  I admitted to having been sexually assaulted at AFROTC LEAD in front of my Field Training Officer (FTO). Unbeknownst to me, FTOs  are mandatory reporters. Also, because I am a cadet, my report was considered unrestricted (cadets aren't eligible for restricted reports). I was able to talk to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, and my investigation will take place at my local base rather than Maxwell, AL, and I was told that I can apply to have a Special Victims' Counsel present, but other than that, I don't really know what will happen.   I don't have any rape kits or previous police reports on file. Can OSI make me give them information (especially the name of the person who assaulted me). Can the interview/subpoena people who I have shared the name of my rapist with? I'm a college student and I really don't want to have to undergo legal proceedings. Especially not for something like this. I dramatically altered my life to avoid contact with this guy, and don't want to have to face him in this investigation.   Also, although this is a military investigation, as a cadet, I am contracted, but I believe I'm IRR. Will I continue to have my civilian rights?	No
456	Landlord did a last inspection before we move out on September first and said that damage to the bathroom floor caused by repairs that were not done when reported and Jo ventilation to Bambi floors in the bathroom and a dirty stove is tantamount to us owing her twenty thousand dollars for repairs on a trailer who's total value can't possibly exceed four thousand dollars as it's a piece of shit. What do I say to her?  Tldr:landlords a crazy bitch and wants five times the value of a the trailer I rent for damage that's not my fault nor my reasonability.	No
457	I'm so flustered right now, and trying to type on mobile. Apologies for incoherences or confusion, I just have no idea what to do.   So, as far as I know the Bureau of Narcotics Investigation and Drug Control officers visited my home this afternoon while I was at work. My wife is a stay at home mom, 4 kids whom were all always with grandparents by some stroke of luck. They confiscated 24 plants that have been growing for a few weeks. They said they had pictures of my wife and I watering them. She took all the blame and said I had nothing to do with it, attempting to compartmentalize the damage. She also told them she was growing for someone else, so now they're pressuring her to flip on someone. Problem is, that's a lie. It was all personal because we have zero connections right now. I wish she would have just asked for a lawyer, but what's done is done. They also confiscated our paraphernalia, a couple pips, bongs, grinder, etc.   I'm worried about her going to jail. Neither of us have anything on our records, but I'm hearing PA had mandatory sentencing. I need to get her a lawyer, but I'm also barely surviving on my current income. The fines will ruin us if the lawyer fees don't first. And the fact she would be a felon means most of her career options are impossible (she got her MBA while raising kids).   I just want to leave the state for greener pastures, but I we have to deal with this. Who do I contact, what do I do? Any advice is appreciated.    Sincerely Yours, Sobbing and Sorry Pot Growers in PA	No
458	My roommate hasn't paid rent in 3 months. I live in Arizona. He has had 2 other people illegally living in his apartment, along with several drugs being done in his room. I want to go the leasing office and tell them about this issue, but I'm afraid it will backfire on me, and I'll get an eviction on my record which I obviously do not want. Would it be easier to break the lease (for $3000), and sue him for the total $5000 he owes me, or just tell the office and risk it? Or do I have any other options? Can anyone help, or direct me to an Arizona lawyer who can, that won't charge me an absurd amount of money? Thanks in advance.	No
459	Current location: Colorado  Original birth certificate: Virginia  Name change:  Illinois  During a recent move, my birth certificate got destroyed.  To do some recently-moved legal things in Colorado, like switch my license, I need to order a certified copy.

460	I haven't posted on reddit before so forgive me if I am in the wrong sub or not adhering to protocol.  My young son and daughter are currently in Japan with their grandparents and myself and my wife are currently in the US. My wife has hinted before that she might take the kids to Japan and never come back, but so far hasn't acted on it. However, she made the threat again during an argument last night and has demonstrated behavior today that suggests she plans to go through with it since the children are already in Japan.  We have not filed for divorce or separation and she isn't currently scheduled to fly to Japan for another week, but it's possible she might be changing her flight now. My understanding is that I will have little to no recourse to get access to my children once she decides to follow through on her threats and I'm wondering what my options are to either prepare for the long legal battles ahead or to try and stop this from happening in the first place.  I have sought local legal counsel, but haven't heard back from them yet. She is not a reasonable individual at the moment, but I am hoping to appeal to her for a more rational solution than taking this kind of drastic action. That said however, how can I prepare for the worst case scenario? Thank you for your time.	No
461	"Tuesday around 2:30 AM a couple friends and I were leaving a bar. I knew I was drunk and shouldn't drive, but this isn't about me justifying myself. Well, I was heading from one parking lot to the other across the street to take my friends back to their cars, where someone would have taken me home or I would have Uber'd (more on that later). I turned left on a road where I didn't know there was a median, crossed the street, got to my destination, but before I could pull into the lot I had lights on me. Since I already knew I was driving on the wrong side of the road like an idiot, I figured that's what I was being pulled over for. It was. However I just left the bar, I had 3 (and a half) beers between 10:30 PM and 2:30 AM, so I'm sure I smelled, or my non-driver smashed passenger did. Officer has me do field sobriety tests, I probably failed, but while under the impression my sentence would he lighter if I blew, I consented and went along with it.  Blew a 0.121, arrested, and I was allowed to leave the station with my stepdad.  Totally cool with paying the fines and the 90 day suspension and even the classes as I know I shouldn't have been driving drunk, even if it was just to cross the street. Got off lucky that no one was hurt, I acknowledge that. The important part for me is when my court date came, the judge told me I was being charged with 2 counts of DUI, one for driving and one for blowing over the limit, meaning my first offense is counted as my second. He said I'm facing something like 180 days in jail/10k fine/1 year suspension. I wasn't even in the car for 5 minutes. Sidenote: my breaks are broken and I was driving my brother's car. How big of an issue is this? (Again, I know I shouldn't have, even to cross the street, but honest to God I was JUST crossing the street, I was not driving home. I was on the wrong side of the road, so me getting pulled over is justifiable, I just didn't think it through. I would have gotten pulled over sober because I'm just stupid.) Though it's not my place to say, is that ""fair""? I have an attorney who I can hopefully afford, but I can't meet with him until Friday. I just need some peace of mind, and knowing how much trouble I'm in could definitely help me prepare mentally."	No
462	Hello, I'm 25 and I met a 16 year old who desires sexual relations. While I know the age of consent in Indiana is 16, I want to recognize the legal complexities of the matter. Please advise me on how to best chart this course and what I should avoid.	No
463	Need some basic legal advice.   Two friends and I found a house for August 1 move-in. Prior to signing the lease, the agent we were working with told us there might be a chance we could move in early and to speak with the owner about sorting that out. This all occurred in late June. We spoke w the owner and agreed that 7/30 move-in date would work. We were asked to pay security deposit to secure house + first month's rent on July 1. We paid security deposit as promised. Then paid rent (plus pro-rated rent for early move-in) on 6/29.   This week we called landlord to check about getting keys. At this time he told us that one of the tenants (there were three) was still at the house and is not able to move out by 7/30. We reiterated that we'd already paid a month in advance for early move-in and that informed him that it's not possible for the three of us to rearrange uhaul, movers etc. for later move-in.  This is where things got weird. We've been back and forth with both the landlord and the tenant. They seem to be wanting us to change our move-in date. It's absolutely not possible. We have three people moving from three different places and we've already informed our current landlords we're leaving on the 30th.   We told landlord/tenant that we're able to move-in later on the day to give the dude time to get his stuff out. We also asked about cleaning... If someone is still residing there has the house had a walk-through? Has there been any cleaning done? When we signed the lease we asked that 'made ready' be placed as an agreement for cleaning terms (i.e. basic cleaning, paint if needed, holes patched if needed).  So turns out the landlord hadn't visited the house until today and who knows how long it's been since the house has been visited by him. He's agreed to get cleaning people out there tomorrow, but he can't get them in to clean the dude's room cuz all his stuff is in there. He just told the dude to make sure all his stuff is in his room and they'll clean everything else. Apparently the other two tenants and talked w the landlord and agree to move out by the 30th but no one spoke with dude that's left behind we had to get in early.  The person taking over the dude's room that's left behind is pretty pissed that her room won't be clean prior to move-in. So she called landlord to talk about it, see if he'd be willing to compensate in anyway. Well landlord gets pissed and says he's doing what he can and drops the bomb that apparently that dude might not even be out by the 30th... Insinuating that he might have to stay the night there w us.   It's all super weird and we're trying to figure out how to handle it. We can't terminate the lease as we have nowhere to go. We just want the place to be cleaned and for this dude left behind to jet by the 30th. We are not sure how to approach asking for compensation (i.e. 1 days rent for the 30th).  Any advice? Sorry if this is confusing/poorly written. Please let me know if any clarification is needed.	No
464	I'll put the gritty details next, but in short: Live in Ohio. At end of legal proceedings came to be declared owner of 'undivided one half interest' in the estate. Person who owns other half had medical charges put against the house for almost half the value of the house. Presently no one lives there, though the other half owner was until a couple years ago.   Onto the gritty. There was some issue with who really owned the house. My mother and her ex both shared the house - married at the time though they divorced. She was forced out of the house through threats of violence many years ago and left. According to the best of my knowledge the divorce papers said when children were 18 or my mother was gone from the house for a period of time it was to be sold.    This never happened and instead her ex and his new wife lived there. No legal action was taken as my mother was afraid of him. Eventually, he passed away some years ago and my mother made an agreement with his widow that she could live there as long as she paid bills, taxes, etc.   The property taxes came in my mother's name, she paid them, and got a check in her name from the widow. This was fine until a neighbor found evidence that the widow was being more or less forcefully housebound by a younger man who claimed to love her and was stealing her checks. My mother wanted her out of there for her safety as she was going to let him back in after he got out of jail. She got a paper to evict though I am not 100% certain it was needed or the widow left earlier to stay with her daughter.   Fast forward a bit later, my mother decided to sell the house instead of let it sit there and fall apart. But before everything could be finalized, she passed away. The idea was it would be split between my 3 siblings (not me, as I was not from her previous marriage), but with the will it instead went to me fully. So I was going to give the money from the sale to them anyway, but during trying to sell it the bank had an issue with who owned the house.   Went to a lawyer and it took months and months. Evidently what we thought was solved in 2012 was somehow erroneous. A new paper stated that a certificate of transfer would be filed in both my mother's estate and her ex-husband estate. I got one in the mail indeed saying I now owned 'half interest' instead of full.   Two issues came up. One being the earlier mentioned lien. Whatever medical care the widow was receiving (she is still alive) had put against the house. IIRC it was around 28k (house value ~60k-65k on market when we tried to sell). We talked to her about selling and she said she would sign the other half over to me but only if I paid half of her lien. This would end up meaning paying about 14k from the 30k half I would get. Splitting that three ways would be ~5k then taking away the realtor's fee and any others as well wouldn't leave much. Doesn't seem right considering.   Another thing is I can't seem to find where the other half was officially issued. Granted mine definitely says 'an undivided one half interest'. When searching through the county records the same paper showed up, but I couldn't find one for the ex or her deceased husband showing it. Not sure if that matters, but don't know why it isn't there.   So I guess in the end if it is in a stalemate is there anything I can do when all this craziness happened? Can I force her to sell and make her responsible for the lien? Or even if it is half interest in the house does that mean I also am required to pay half that medical lien?  And since no one is living there right now does it matter?   Definitely not trying to be petty. Following my mother's example she let her ex's new wife who he cheated with stay in the house as long as she paid the bills. But I also don't want to be responsible for this house I have no interest in nor do I want to screw my siblings over by giving them just a few grand each for a house two of them grew up in.   Sorry for the length but it is a crazy situation! Any leads on what to do or where to go? The last lawyer we had to handle this whole fiasco when my mother passed seemed to struggle with it.	No
465	"Hey folks.  My family just moved into a new apartment and today it will be exactly a week.  Before move in we noticed the light in the fan wasn't working in two different rooms but the lady showing us the place told us not to worry they would be fixed before move in.  Move in comes along and they're still not fixed but we figure it's not a big deal we don't need them and they'll be by to fix them at some point.  Then we go to do laundry and discover the brand new dryer in the apartment isn't working so I take a peek behind it.  It probably is new because they never bothered to hook it up to anything hence why it's not working.  We called and informed the leasing agent immediately of these problems then handed in the move in paperwork that you fill out any damages/problems at move in and included both issues.  We have called every day since then and every day we've been assured that maintenance is coming that day to fix these problems, and every day they have not.  Now we honestly don't want to rock the boat here because it's hard to find an affordable apartment complex here that you aren't likely to get shot by.  But I was wondering if it's reasonable to ask for prorated rent based on the value of a working washer/dryer.  I was digging through our lease and found this about repairs, *""We'll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections. Rent will not abate in whole or in part.""*  Now obviously this states that they won't prorate rent at all, but I figured it can't hurt to ask if there's a legal definition or whatever for customary diligence and if over a week without the working appliance would be considered breaching customary diligence.  At the end of that day we're not going to fight this if it's not a black and white yeah you can ask for that and see what they say kind of thing.  As like I said, we don't want to rock the boat."	No
466	http://imgur.com/a/mFeJL  I believe the property line is pretty much exactly where he sprayed to. That's his garage against my yard. He does it because he doesn't see the dead grass. The rest of his yard is fenced from the garage to the house. He must be in my yard when I'm not home to even get there to spray.   Is what he's doing legal? Do I have any recourse? I had a dog that died recently (7yo) of lymphoma and I suspect his pesticides might be tied to it because I tethered him in the backyard.   If it matters, I live in Westmoreland County PA.	No
467	My mother and I were left behind in India by my father when I was a baby but after 18 years he brought us to USA but we came here to find that he is another mistress and his family has been treating my mother and I like slaves and maids actually worse than that. We were being mentally torched everyday for about 1.5years. But then since he kept on saying us to leave his house we decided to not live like servants and leave their place. But even so he refuses to pay for my college tuitions and my mother and I cannot save up enough to pay for everything. What should we do? Please help us. What kind of lawyer should we consult or what we should do. We have no idea. We would be grateful for the help.	No
468	If anyone has read my previous posts about this, I have since paid the utilities bills in full so there shouldn’t be any issues stemming from that. Back in November my bf and I filled the propane tank and paid $363.00. We expected our asshole roommate to pay his share. He didn’t. My bf and I texted him a couple times over the next couple weeks about it, he ignored us and began avoiding us in person. One day he ran into my bf and my bf asked him why he didn’t want to resolve it. They got into a fight and my bf said some mean things. Nothing threatening. Just name calling. That was the last time they spoke in person or have seen each other. My bf apologized through a letter and I apologized twenty times through text and offered to make things right/come to a solution. The roommate refuses to talk to me or figure anything out. My landlord claims my roommate is scared and feels unsafe in his home. Even though my bf and I have not done anything to him or even seen him in person since their argument. Can I really be evicted over this?	No
469	I have a friend who is a minor who lives in the UAE (united arab emirates) whose parents just divorced. They are all citizens of the US and not of the UAE. There may be some up-coming custody issues and what court system they would take place in would completely change the outcome. So the question is where would the decision take place? In the US where they are citizens, or in the UAE where they live most of the year?	No
470	We believe this might be illegal, but don't know what steps to take next.  *The previous property owners for our house entered into a mineral rights lease two days after all parties signed the contract to buy/sell the property.  *They signed the final mineral rights lease a 1-2 weeks after we closed on the house (after we assumed ownership).  The company they leased the rights to (Company A) claim division orders were never sent out on the property and the profits placed in escrow from previous drilling were never paid out. They traded the lease off to another company (Company B), which I haven't contacted. That company traded the lease to another company (Company C) which I have contacted and is not being very forthcoming with information. The lady I spoke to (Company C) said my only recourse would be to roll over the previous owners (illegal) lease into my name, at the rock bottom terms that he signed on. I would be getting 12% and no signing bonus. I'm furious.  Any assistance as to getting a new lease negotiated on our terms would be appreciated, as well as any legal recourse I might have against the previous owner. Ideally I'd like it simply to be a small claims issue. This isn't concerning a lot of money, but is rather a matter of the BS the previous owner has put us through on a number of fronts, this one being the most egregious.	No
471	In 2005 I had a child with my Ex -- things were not very smooth in the custody process. My ex had primary custody of my daughter up until about 2012 when the state removed the children (she had other children with another father later on) from her due to allegations of abuse and neglect.  In 2012 I was granted sole custody and have maintained sole custody since. The child abuse allegations never came to fruition and she ended up getting all her children back aside from my daughter who is now 12 years old.  My daughter has consistently seen a therapist throughout the years and still suffers from PTSD and has on multiple occasions told the therapist about the abuse she endured (mostly at the hand of my Ex's current husband). Every therapist that she has seen (they have changed as we moved from Montana to St. Louis for a year and then again moved to Colorado about 2 years ago -- all work related moves), all agree that it's in the best interest for my daughter to stay in my custody.  There is a parenting plan in place currently that allows for phone contact. These phone conversations tend to last no more than 10-15 seconds as my daughter has no interest or desire to talk to or be with her biological mother, and in fact gets anxiety from having to have any communication at all.  I have now received certified documents showing that her biological mother is filing a motion to amend a final parenting plan that includes giving her full custody of my daughter, as well as seeking attorney fee compensation, with very little visitation granted to me.  My current plans are to get an attorney here in CO and have the case transferred here as she (my daughter) is a resident here, and has not lived in MT (where this all originally started) in almost 4 years.  Anyone with experience in this kind of situation? How high are the chances that the mother gets what she's seeking?  Asking here, because it's going to take some time to speak with an attorney directly as the weekend approaches and I'm hoping to ease my anxiety.  Thanks!	No
472	"Quick question and I'll delete once answered.  I'm renting a town home from a husband and wife who own a few properties around my town. The lease is the shortest I've ever signed, probably because they're not a huge complex or company. The lease is pretty standard and we've had no issues with anything since moving in. When my fiancé went to drop the rent off, he had left a lease for us to take home and sign. It's the same lease we signed when we moved in, with only the dates changed.   One of the clauses (if that's the right word, but basically description)  in the lease is ""deposit:"" then something along the lines of a $650 non-refundable deposit due at the start of the lease. We paid this at move in. I emailed him for clarification and I'm sure he will say we don't have to but here is my question to you:   Is the email sufficient enough as an agreement in the event he tries to charge us and takes us to court as proof we don't need to pay it? (Although i doubt this will happen, I've read horror stories on here so now I'm second guessing everything) or should we go in together, sign it with him, and have him edit that part with initials?   Thanks!   TL;DR - lease renewal mentions paying a deposit already paid. Is an email agreement that we don't need to pay it enough in the event they later say we owe it or should we have them edit the lease?"	No
473	This is a throw away account  My partner and i were living with a couple of friends. We've been waiting to sign the official lease for this place to put us on there and the landlord said she would get back to us in a week. It's been two months.  Our landlord knows we're living there and helping with bills but is not responding to the messeges about the official lease.   A week ago our friends moved out and my partner and i need to find our own place where the landlord isn't as dodging about contact.   If my partner and i move out would we get into any legal trouble since we're not on the lease/bills?	No
474	Title says it.  Daughter had rented a high-rise apartment and it the toilet flooded and damages were caused. $60k worth in total remediation. The landlord is demanding that the Dad and Daughter pay for it. They are threatining to sue.  So far the daughter had been in the spotlight. However, I believe the legal counsel for the landlord had conducted a deed search and found that she had no assets. So they are now focusing on the dad.  Daughter has no assets. Dad has 50% of the house and several land claims in northern BC that he fully owns. Mom owns the other 50% of the house and the single car the family uses. Mom and Dad are in debt ~$180k in credit lines. So only possible way anyone can get any money out is to force a sale on the house or dad's land claims.  Regular surburban house. No separate basement or secondary suite units. Can the judge force a sale? If so, how does that work? How does one purchase half a house?  Side Question: How does one find all the assets belonging to a certain person? Public information? Where can I find this? I need to know what they know.	No
475	Since she was born, I have raised her myself. She is almost 3. Her mother is currently in Texas in a rehab center (she got into meth after she left me with my daughter) I've talked to lawyers but can't afford one upfront. I live in Indiana.	No
476	So here’s the deal. For the last four years I’ve had my name on my apt lease in Queens. Decided to move in with my bf to Brooklyn this month. His name is on his lease in Brooklyn. Question is - should I immediately add my name to his existing lease when I move in this week or can I wait until his lease is up for renewal in January to then add my name to his lease? Are there any cons related to credit score or taxes etc if I end my lease now and wait until January to add my name to my boyfriend’s lease? Any tips? Maybe I’m overthinking it but would love your legal advice!	No
477	"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	No
478	"I live in Washington State and have a long-term lease on a property which includes a multiple-bedroom house and a backyard ""mother-in-law"" unit which has a 1/4-bathroom and no kitchen.    My agreement with the property owner allows me to sublet portions of the property at will; I manage the whole property, collect rent when subletting, and send one check to the landlord each month.   I sublet the backyard unit to a person who said she was going to use it as a music practice studio. She signed a one-page sublease agreement which explicitly refers to it as a NON-RESIDENTIAL UNIT. Six-month initial term, reverting to month-to-month, small refundable security deposit.   Shortly after she took occupancy, we realized that she had moved in, and even had a little dog staying with her.    I had a lot going on over the last month, including planned vacation trips and work stuff, and I have kept putting off dealing with it.    Now she has two unpaid months of rent (July and August) and I need to deal with it.      Her sublease doesn't specifically address late charges, or what happens in the event of non-payment.   Questions I could use some help with/insight into:  * What laws/statues govern a nonresidential subtenancy of a residential tenancy?  * Can I just change the locks like, say, a storage unit manager might? or I need to give her a pay-or-quit notice, etc, first?  * If I do either of the above, and she still doesn't pay, do I have to give her access to her belongings, or do they somehow become forfeit at some point?  * Do I have any chance at a small claims judgment against her for the unpaid rent (+/- statutory interest?), either up until the time she was ""evicted"", or for the entire six-month initial term, based on the simple sublease form?  * If I were to successfully pursue a judgment, is there any value to it if she is the ""uncollectible"" type?"	No
479	To start off, neither me or my spouse have any sort of record what so ever, we have a hard time even giving our toddler a time out let alone physical discipline. We could easily have 50 or more people testify to the care of our children who have spent several hours with us. We've never gotten any notifications from DHS, CPS or anyone prior ever about concerns with our children. No record of substance abuse or mental illness.   In May my infant daughter had a bloodshot eye, our daycare provider informed us and sent a picture. We asked if it seemed to be bothering her, she said it wasn't. We told her if it got any worse to let us know and we would come get her and bring her to our pediatrician. It cleared up in a day or so, so we didn't seek medical attention for it.   A couple weeks ago my wife was in a car accident with my son, the vehicle was totaled but my wife and son were perfectly fine. My son was sleeping, he woke up for just a second then went back to sleep. A ambulance came and checked him and my wife out, they said he was perfectly fine and didn't need to seek medical attention unless he was acting odd and to look out for any odd behavior. Which we did. He acted 100% as normal so we did not seek medical attention.  My daughter started crawling and is borderline obsessed with standing up, she has an accident in the kitchen where she tried pulling herself up my wife's pant leg and as she went to pick her up she slipped and unfortunately fell on her face. It left a decent size bruise on her face, she contacted me at work and we looked out for the normal warning signs, she was fine.    A few days ago my wife got a phone call asking how soon we could get our children and meet at the E.R. It was CPS, they wanted us to have them there in an hour. We went and got our kids, my daycare provider had called about these instances, because she said her licensor was there and they made her, someone else had contacted her.   We were at the ER for almost 9 hours, they checked out my son, did a CT scan, X-rays and blood work on my daughter.  About 4 hours into the visit the DHS lady said we had to make arrangements for our children to stay with for the night. This was too much for us and we came to the conclusion that my parents would come down for the night. The DHS lady agreed and did background checks and left to access our house after we agreed to a 'safety plan' where my parents supervised us with the children.  We were discharged and got home around 1am.  The next day we had to take our kids to an abuse center where a doctor interviewed us and evaluated the children. In addition to having to go to our pediatrician for more blood work because the original was clumped and there was an error.  Later that day we were informed that we no longer have to follow the safety plan and there was no suspicion of abuse or neglect. Every test came back normal and that Pretty much that we were all set.  We asked the lady if we were going to be responsible for the ER visit etc. and she said that our insurance should cover most of it, we explained that it was a $8000 deductible between all to us. Her response was that typically the people that she deals with were on (state) care and that they didn't typically have to worry about it.  We got on the phone with a lawyer to ask a bit of advice, he said that typically they send a letter to the parents first and do a parent interview and go from there and that he has never seen someone go to such an extreme.  He said we should sit down and draft a letter about how mistreated we were, and that if they try to make us pay the bills to contact him immediately.   Additionally, another parent at the daycare used to work as a CPS supervisor and think that she may have made the call and that's why it was escalated so much. She knew that the kids were taken to the hospital and asked our daycare provider if they were kept overnight, without having knowledge of any of this.  Am I worrying too much? Having to have our kids in the ER for nearly 9 hours was more abusive than anything me or my wife have ever come close to doing to them, we are  in horror, it was a nightmare. We're terrified that it's going to happen to us again anytime my son gets a scratch riding his bike or something. Should we do more legally? Can we? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.	No
480	"Hi guys. I don't know what the format is here so I'm just going to go. Also not sure how detailed I should/shouldn't be, so ask for more detail as needed. GA resident, flew to VA for interview.      I was able to make contact with the VA company through a GA recruiter, so GA recruiter handled all the communication. VA company asked for me to make the flight reservation, which I was uncomfortable with because I am accustomed to the company making the reservation. So I asked the GA recruiter to do it for me on their dime, and they agreed.      When I got to the airport, *excuses here*, I missed the flight. I called up the GA recruiter and asked how best to proceed. He told me he would reach out to VA company and call me back. He called back and said they are fine to do the interview later that day or the next day, and that I should book the next flight I can. I specifically asked whether the flight change fee would be reimbursed, and discussed the specific amount it would be with GA recruiter. GA recruiter spoke with the hiring manager and then GA recruiter explicitly told me on the phone that the VA company would reimburse this amount. After this conversation, I booked the flight change, took the flight, rented a car and hotel, and had the interview the next morning.      I submitted my expense reimbursement request with the flight, car rental, hotel, and taxis to and from the airport. A full month later, I received a check from the VA company, reimbursing the car rental, hotel, and taxis. The flight change fee, which was over half the total reimbursement, was not reimbursed.      I called the GA recruiter, and sent subsequent emails because he was picking up on what was going on and not answering calls anymore, and asked what had happened. GA recruiter told me that an ""HR guy"" at VA company had ""put his foot down"" on the flight change expense, and it would not be reimbursed. To my knowledge, GA recruiter has been reimbursed for the flight they booked.      So I figure I have a couple of avenues. One, there's promissory estoppel re: detrimental reliance on GA recruiter's advice. Two, there's some kind of convoluted argument for detrimental reliance on the hiring manager (although I think that would work better for GA recruiter to use on VA company, and GA recruiter is not interested in suing a client, especially on my behalf), even if he didn't have the authority to make that decision. Three, there may be laws around interview reimbursement I haven't really looked into in VA.      I have already reached out to GA recruiter and been told to go pound sand, so any further communication there will likely need to be all lawyered up. I'm not flush with cash, but I am willing to fight this precisely for that reason.      So, uh, advice?"	No
481	This is the [relevant part of the lease](http://i.imgur.com/jL2qw3N.png) about move out, which references these [move out cleaning instructions &amp; fees](http://i.imgur.com/9HNGJY4.png) that I received from the front office. The office also mentioned verbally: &gt; You'll probably get charged about $50 for carpet cleaning or you can show a receipt as proof of cleaning from your own cleaners or rugdoctor rental for example).   Being pressed for time I decided to assume the charge, besides, I'm a clean &amp; responsible renter so no worries right? After I got done cleaning I decided to walkthrough &amp; take video of the entire vacant unit... just in case.  Later I'm charged $195 for carpet cleaning. The complex won't budge and could only provide the [invoice from their cleaner](http://i.imgur.com/JVqDdeW.png). The complex says that they usually they take pics but for some reason couldn't find the ones from my unit. The parent company (receivables) also won't budge, even after providing my video and referencing the relevant sections of the lease &amp; cleaning instructions posted above.   Overall I would expect to pay about $65 for our final move out balance: Security deposit - ($50 carpet + a second legit charge).  I refuse however pay the extra $140 on principle. I intend to send a $15 check for everything else, leaving the full carpet $195 outstanding until there is resolve. What are my options here? At a minimum I don't want this to impact my credit.   Additional notes:  * I had a 2bdr unit, the bedrooms were the only carpeted areas * I had a dog, but it was strictly forbidden from entering the bedrooms * I can post screencaps of the final carpet if relevant, but I don't think it is given the above cleaning instructions. FWIW I think it was in good - not great - condition. There was one spot with slight discoloration about 3ft in diameter)	No
482	My friend's parents are finally getting a divorce. The wife has been abusive of her husband/her kids for a long time, and the husband is finally going to file. However, my friend just told me that they're going to be settling in court since the wife refuses to agree to terms.   Most importantly, she wants her soon to be ex-husband to keep paying her money so she can continue to live in her house (the husband will move out once the divorce is final). My friend is concerned that she'll get the money because she'll claim that she was abused by her husband. My question is, is she legally allowed to do this, considering her children are over 18? (My friend still lives with her mother.) Regardless of the legality, is the judge likely to award her money? I want to reassure my friend/offer her courses of action she can take, but I have practically no knowledge of law.	No
483	Hi,   TLDR; who's responsibility is it to find someone to take over a part of the lease  when one signer wants to stay and the other wants to leave?   Asking this for my girlfriend - she is living with a roommate and they are both on the lease. GF wants to move out and the other roommate is undecided but isn't taking any action / contacting the landlord. GF has informed the landlord that she will not be renewing, and the landlord has responded saying roughly that GF can't be removed from the lease until either (a) roommate is assessed to be financially capable to take on the entire lease, or (b) another tenant is found to sign onto the lease.  The landlord's phrasing implies that it is GF's responsibility to find someone to take over, whereas my reading of it is that either roommate or the landlord should be responsible:  if the multiple signees to the lease is interpreted as a contract including GF and roommate, then GF pulling out should break it for roommate too (unless she finds someone to replace).  OTOH if it's interpreted as a separate contract for GF and roommate, then the landlord should be responsible for finding someone to take GF's half of the contract.   The fear is that if the landlord and the roommate don't take any action then the lease will be auto-renewed with GF's name on it, and she would be solely responsible to find someone to take over, which she doesn't have time for.  Thanks! Any advice is much appreciated.	No
484	I was arrested for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, but I was caught with both plant matter and concentrate (dismeanor amounts), along with 3 pieces of paraphernalia (3 packs of rolling papers).

485	I'm  here because I'm not sure if I should pay for a lawyer as of yet.  My wife and I are separated and we have a 3 year child  together. She is Polish and My daughter and I are American born.  I will just get the point of my situation and not get into too much back story. So my wife told me that she was going to Poland to visit her family for two week which I never objected to and I knew the date of her departure and everything seemed fine, I even had a chance to say bye to my daughter at the airport over the phone.  My wife promised that she will call me when she reach there but something seemed unusual,  she kept insisting that she just going to see her family and I just said fine and she just hung up; I found this strange that she was trying convince me of her intentions. At work later that day , I was bother by her last comments when then I got a call from my best friend, I explain to him my situation  and he ask me if I sign a child travel consent form ? I ask him what consent form ? He ask me if my  wife told me that she can't board a plane or leave the US with my daughter without my written consent? I wasn't aware of this and told him that I didn't sign anything.   My friend works for a major Airlines and he told that he will call me back, when he called back he told that he talked to his coworkers and that I should report her for kidnapping of a minor. After seeing this form online and realizing that she forge my signature , I was so mad but  I didn't want to report her yet , if i did she will be arrested and my daughter will be taken away by whatever legal system for whatever length of time. Until now , my wife haven't called or message me since she left for Poland over a week ago . My friend and I think it is best that I wait but it driving my crazy. If there are Lawyers or legal experts  here can I  please get some legal advice on international laws on child abduction and what advantages are in my favor ? Please help! 😔	No
486	Essentials: Ex had a dog before we were married. After divorce, she asked me (via saved text messages) to take care of said dog until she found a place that allows pets. 18 months later, and with only one attempt to visit the dog 14 months ago, she's moved to California. I'm renting at the same house since the divorce, and the ex provided the $500 pet deposit for the dog at my house. Assuming no further contact, what do I do about the deposit money when I move next year?	No
487	My older brothers house was raided by police. He has 2 kids which were taken into protective services. Right now I guess he is being charged with burglary, theft, possession of an illegal firearm, child abuse , possession of controlled substance. His wife is being charged with receiving stolen property, and possession of illegal substance. According to my younger brother who was staying there and witnessed the whole thing, all that was in the house was stolen stuff, and 3 meth pipes. Now I love my brother very much and I want to do what I can to help, but he's in Nebraska, and I'm in California. I don't think he can afford a lawyer so I was wondering if I could hire a lawyer from here to defend him in another state. I also want to see about taking custody of his kids while this all gets sorted out. Wtf do I do?There is more, but I'm on my phone right now.	No
488	My husband has decided to leave me. Even though I don't want or agree with a divorce I have to accept that it is happening. We don't have kids, house, etc. Very little in the way of assets and we mostly agree on how to split everything.  We have decided that an uncontested divorce is best. My husband thinks that we can share a lawyer but I wasn't sure. I have extensively googled and not gotten a definitive answer. Any idea?	No
489	So I have been separated since 2014, filed for divorce in October 2015. I have sent several offers to hopefully soon to be ex wife's attorney to end the marriage. Never once has she countered any offer or given her own offer of what she wants. All she has done is fight against things I have tried to keep (children visitation).   I am a veteran and retired in October 2016. Didn't have a job when I got out due to hiring freeze at military shipyard where I lived due to Obama and approaching election. I paid support of what I could until I got job in February. I was half a month behind in support and she tried to get me for support in arrears. I had to use tax return to come current. And again no offers from her. Started new job she again took me to court for support modification since now making more money. Sent her offers and still nothing to try and settle this.   Now my question is it seems to me something is keeping/making her want to stay married. It's not my military retirement she only has under 17 yrs based on agreed upon date of separation which equates to about 37%. She will never get her own tricare health plan under the 20/20/20 laws. The best she can get is one additional year of benefits from tricare under the 20/20/15 law if divorce is after this august.   So with that information, what would be the odds a judge in Washington state would allow me to pull my petition for divorce, I am the one who filed, and she has done nothing to get this done. I don't really care if we stay married so she gets medical benefits, I'm just tired of spending money on attorneys that I don't have. She is still in Washington state and I now am in Maryland working at my new job.	No
490	Mom in Ohio is a permanent resident of a nursing home but underwent surgery in a hospital and upon her return to the nursing home requires physical therapy to recover. Medicaid has covered her permanent residency but then Medicare Part A steps in to cover the skilled nursing physical therapy she is receiving post-op.  The question about simultaneous status has arisen because we took her to an appointment outside of the facility (unrelated to the surgery) and we were informed that her status as a permanent resident vs skilled nursing patient matters for billing purposes. They explained if she is covered under Medicaid then they would bill them, however if she is currently covered by Medicare then the nursing home should be billed directly or her personally if the nursing home doesn’t deem the appointment vital.  So can you be considered both a permanent resident and a skilled nursing patient by a nursing home? Meaning the nursing home is concurrently receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid (the per diem and the patient liability amount).  This is my first post! I am sorry if it is not worded well, I have very limited knowledge of Medicaid/Medicare/Nursing Homes and am learning as I go. Also, I am cross-posting in hopes of getting it in the right place!	No
491	"Hello,  I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop.   Reference:  ""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic stop for another violation.   Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement. Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""  From the Arizona state legislature.  The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.  The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.  I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt.   I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this.   Thanks"	No

493	"I am a first time renter in New Haven Connecticut for off campus housing. (also first time posting on Reddit so sorry for any formatting errors)  Since I signed my lease it has been nothing but a nightmare for me.  I originally signed in May of 2017 and added an addendum to the lease due to the apartment not yet being finished and all of the fire extinguishers being out of date by two years! ( a serious fire safety violation).  Come June when I moved in I find that my apartment isnt even finished yet and nothing on the addendum has been completed.  the rental company ended up terminating the agent who sold me the unit and gave me the lease.  they then made me sign a new lease with the same conditions as the last one.   Again I made sure to include that the fire extinguishers needed to be updated or replaced because it is a very serious health and safety concern. In my contract/ lease there is a paper signed and dated by the renting agent stating "" please note that the fire extinguishers and the fire exit signs will be fixed""  fast forward to mid july two weeks after my new lease starts I again go to move in and this time everything is completed and looks good... except the fire extinguishers in the hallway.    I then write a email detailing that I will be foregoing this months rent due to their negligence and breach of contract.  in that email I include dated photographs of the multiple out of date fire extinguishers as well as copies of the signed addendums from the original and current lease.    I get no response for four days, I call the agent on his cell, he sends me straight to voicemail and texts me asking to call back tomorrow after 9:30am.  I leave a voicemail then addressing the concerns of my email.  I call the next day at noon, again voicemail and again I leave a message, finally I send a text at 4pm that day to the number he texted me from.  it has been 3 more days since then still no reply.   now my rent is due on the 1st of this month and I know I will have 9 days before they can charge me late fees or start an eviction process (which they already attempted to evict me because of an error saying I didnt pay rent that was included in my deposit). But I want to Know can I legally forego rent this month due to the violations or will they be able to evict me if I dont. again this is my first time renting and I dont want to be taken for a ride by my landlord.  TL;DR, landlord has failed to meet requirements/ promises agreed upon in lease multiple times, can I legally forego my rent this month?"	No
494	Oklahoma is the place.   So, friends of mine are dealing with their mothers death. She passed last week. They are pretty sure that their parents were not divorced but have been separated only for 20+ years.   The father(or widower) might be married to someone in another state for around the same time of the separation to now. He is also starting to try and call the shots on many things with the estate.   Anyone have any advice on what they should expect? This is confusing me to no end but I'm not a lawyer.	No

497	I am moving out in purchased a home and my landlord has attempted to come in to show my apt. I gave them a list of days and times that are good because I work 12 hour overnights at a hospital. They tried to come in and I had the hotel lock on. They said they were going to come in even though I was sleeping and they wouldn't enter the apt. Their lawyer called me now and stated if I have the hotel lock on again or don't let them in whenever they want I will be evicted. What can I do ?	No
498	I’m having an issue with my neighbor and I’m educating myself before I take my next action.  I have a flag lot with a driveway leading to my house, planked on both sides by fencing from the street up to my gate.  The fences were there when I purchased the property 10+ years ago.  One property adjacent to my driveway was sold about 3 years ago.  This new neighbor recently opened up a section of the fence and excavated the ground on both of our properties and prepared for paving, to connect his driveway to mine.  If he were to succeed, it would give him a convenient loop for his driveway.  He does not have a (recorded) easement to use my land, nor did he ask permission or even notify me that he planned to do this. Attempts to communicate with him have been fruitless.  He tried this once before, not long after he moved in.  He took down the fence sections without asking. I put them back up, and sent a letter demanding him to leave the fence alone and stop trespassing.  He refused to accept the certified mail.  I recently vacated the property and put in on the market.  This latest attempt of his started a couple days after the realtor’s sign went up.  I presume he thought I moved away and would not catch him, or care, and a new owner wouldn’t know any better.  I had the sheriff come out.  He told the sheriff that the fence is his, that it’s on his land, and that he has a prescriptive easement to use my driveway.  I asked the sheriff if the neighbor had any proof and he said he had “paperwork from a lawyer” but no County records.  The sheriff bowed out of the situation, saying they can’t make judgement calls in such civil matters. I understand.  I’m reasonably confident that the fence is mine, and that it’s on my land.  I could get a survey done to prove it, but even if it’s mine, there is still the claim of an easement, and I would like to avoid the cost if possible.  Regardless of fence ownership, if he can prove easement on my land, he’d be allowed to cut through, I assume.  Regarding his claim of a prescriptive easement, I have some ideas and questions.  Here in California, if I understand the laws correctly, the occupant of his lot would have to use my driveway for 5 years, without permission, yet unchallenged.  Looking back using historical imagery, it’s clear that about 20 years ago an unimproved connection existed between our driveways (then the fence got built and has been there ever since).  Thus, it’s remotely possible to establish the 5-year statutory. But did that previous owner use my driveway with or without consent from my previous owner?  I don’t see how he can possibly prove it was without consent, which is a factor for the establishment of a prescriptive easement.  We’re talking about a window of time some 20-25 years ago, minimum!  The old owners from that timeframe are deceased.  I think my best angle isn’t to disprove the possible creation of a prescriptive easement, but to prove that even if one existed, it would be terminated by now.  If the owner of his lot built the fence, blocking the path, is that not a reasonably clear indication that he abandoned the easement?  If the owner of my lot built the fence, wouldn’t that then prescribe the easement back after just 5 years?  What do you all think?  Is my strategy sound?  -Mia	No
499	"First of all sorry for the bad English I'm working on it and for the wall of text, but it's a very delicate situation.   Background: We are a family of 5, very poor, living in a Villa near a small town in South Italy. Since I was a child I remember violent quarrels between my mother and my father, he hitting her, screaming on her face, insulting her, spitting on her...   The quarrels are always the same, he started spitting on my little sisters, hitting them, hitting me. When I started growing up i began defending my sisters and my mother; once he said this to me ""get off my way or I will kill you too"", I'll never forget these words.   Nowadays: Since my father has discovered Internet he basically lost all interest in living with us, getting more and more confident with his own smartphone (payed by us, his 3 sons- he cried for it, he wanted the money else he would have just screamed like a mad and maybe got violent). Now that he's 60 he still retains that violent nature, but I'm here now, 24yo, stopping him, helping my mom (who had an accident caused by him hitting a parked car because he had a sleep blow due to him never sleeping spending all night on internet), my sisters are new adults -19yo-. I'm afraid one day we'll come to hitting each others and there will be only one of us alive.    He started cheating on my mother with other people online, chatting with them, meeting with them (i suppose) and calling them (heard one of those names  this morning).   He has his facebook with no privates settings, so I accidentally stumbled upon his profile. All my doubts were solved, words like ""i love you"" ""The place I'll stay with ***** forever and ever"" (that place was the photo of our Villa...)   I wanna lock him outside of the house as soon as he leaves for a reason, what would the consequences be? Is this legal? What should I really do?"	No
500	I'm in the middle of getting my flight (China Eastern from US to Japan) cancelled in order to attend my great grandmother's funeral. In order to get the full refund, they're asking for legal proof of relation in addition to the death certificate since we don't have the same last name. Her grandson (my father) doesn't have the same last name either. Any tips for how to go about this? When I google I only see stuff about immigration.	No

Please ask me for details... i dont know what to add that is relevant	No
502	My boyfriend is the person in question. His parents had an extremely messy divorce 8 years ago; they have had joint custody (physical and legal) since then, with the kids switching houses every week. The legal battle has been going on all of the past 8 years. The parents are very hostile, and they hardly speak to each other.  His dad is a hedonistic, power-obsessed monster, and he's been consistently emotionally abusive. He is also an attorney, which is what worries me. His mom didn't work during the marriage, but she's since started her own business helping autistic children. She's not without her faults, but she truly cares and wants the best for him.  Recently, things have escalated greatly. My boyfriend is transgender, and he came out to his parents very recently. His mom is very supportive. His dad is not.  His mom had a major lung surgery earlier today in Boston (we live in North Carolina). My boyfriend is staying with his dad. His dad has taken away his phone, computer, and car, and he's not allowing him to leave the house.  I've talked to him on the house phone, and he's very scared and doesn't feel safe. He talked to his mom who said that they could fly him up to Boston tomorrow, but his dad has said he can't go. He doesn't want to live with his dad; he's repeatedly said that it's not healthy for him to be in that house anymore.  I'm seventeen years old. I have no idea what to do. First step is getting him to Boston. It's his mom's week, so I don't think his dad can stop him. Then there's the custody piece. This might have an easy answer, but I have no idea. Please any help is enormously appreciated; thank you so much.	No
503	He was pulled aside after a shift and accused of theft. The LP guy said he had video evidence, fingerprints, and if he admitted it he'd let him keep his job. He then took his phone and wouldn't give it back until my friend went to the carrier to have them print out a receipt as proof of ownership. The LP guy then called the carrier store to speak to that employee to confirm that my friend had in fact walked in. After that, he said he was still lying because he must be friends with the employee at the carrier store.   He then said if he gave up whoever stole it he'd be rewarded with a check. Said his boss was on vacation so he'd like to wrap this case up before he arrived. He also banned my friend from using his phone and that if he was ever caught he'd personally escort him out and have his job.   Apparently to even take your phone in the trucks it has to be registered and a sticker is placed on the back. My friends sticker faded so it didn't have the info the LP guy wanted. However, when they checked the records of the registered phones her serial number, the IMEI, and all the information added up. The LP agent then accused my friend of making a counterfeit sticker to put on it so he could steal phones.   What can he do? If you guys have any more questions I'd be happy to provide more information. This is the gist of what has happened.	No
504	As stated, My roomates and I each have signed our names to a lease for an apartment. Together we make the required 3x monthly income. However he recently bought a car that makes him unable to move, but is willingly to keep his name on the lease. We can make the payments for the apartment, without his aide.  However, would we be penalized for having his name on it.  If he doesn't live with us? The lease is signed with five people, but only four will be living there.	No

Would it be seen as the cost of registration, taxes, and fees in the buyers name. Or is it too vague to mean anything? 3) If someone registers the car with a fraudulent VIR, is there a way to prove that?  For all of you people who seem to want to criticize me for buying a used car, and being unhappy that it broke down the next day. I have taken the story out and only left with the questions I need answering. If you need background, I won't give any as you will just insult me."	No
506	I found that my child is not my child, the mother and I got married because I thought he was mine, she told me she slept with another guy, but he was sterile. Well 9 months after the baby was born, he doesn't look like me, we're fighting, I take the DNA test, and before I get the results back she moves in with her parents and takes all his things. Turns out he's not mine, we're filing for a divorce based on results of thepaternity, but what do I do to get off the birth certificate. I've called vital records and resources and they say they need a court order to get me off. Is that the same thing I am getting with the divorce? Do i tie it all into the same court case? What do I do? I don't want to pay child support for a kid who is not mine. Also, I know the other guy's name, and where he lives.She doesn't want him to get involved, but I don't want to pay for this kid.	No
507	I signed a sublease on an industrial commercial warehouse property. It has a 1 year lease with a 2 year option. The main landlord consented verbally and via an email, but there was no place on the lease for the main landlord to sign.  I am in the business of buying impounded cars and performing minor repairs as needed to get the vehicles in sell-able condition. We do not do major repairs like paint, body, engine/transmission, etc. Mostly things like replacing battery, starter, alternator, etc. Once the cars are functional we either sell them on EBay, or reconsign them to other auctions as running vehicles. The ones we are unable to repair are either sold as-is or have the major components removed to sell as parts online or as spare repair parts in our warehouse.  The location is zoned for light automotive business. In fact our location is next door to the city auto impound lot and surrounded by several automotive shops, paint&amp;body, etc.   The building owner informed his property manager that he didn't want a messy business on premise and basically told her to get us out. We listened to her request to keep our covered work area cleaner and better organized. She sent us text and email saying the placed looked great (we kept pics for our records).  The next month the owner told her he didn't want us there anymore and told her to take care of it. I asked her what grounds he had for doing so since we have a valid lease in place, we pay timely each month and our business purpose is allowed under the zoning. Her reply was that he just wanted us gone.  We incurred a lot of expense setting up that location including transportation fees for the vehicles plus typical setup expenses like  installing warehouse shelving, setting up PC network, etc.  We informed the office manager that it would not be realistic to expect us to move just because he changed his mind. In an attempt to appease them we agreed not to have any additional cars delivered there and started looking for a new location to move into at the conclusion of the lease.  The sublease landlord is not willing to let us out of the remaining term of the 1 year lease because they are counting on our portion of the rent to afford the total lease rental.   I got a nasty VM and EMail from the landlord today stating that he would have all our cars towed in 2 days at our expense. I have tried explaining that we are current in our lease, we are not violating any codes or ordinances, and that his office manager had already told us that this would not happen. With 2 days notice we will not have time to secure adequate storage and transportation for 7-8 vehicles.   Question is... should we just figure out a way to move them and be done with these people? Should we let them tow them away and file suit for the damages? Should we move them and the file suit for the costs associated with complying to this demand?   Question is... shou	No
508	Title. A bit of history, I believe a parking spot is included in our contract for the apartment we live in. Recently they have really dropped the ball on parking enforcement. They reassigned our spots but never gave us new placards so nobody has them displayed and this is the 4th time this week we can't get into our spot due to someone else parking there or just bad parking due to our neighbor.  We contacted the towing company and they said they can't do anything unless the landlord calls them or security calls them. We have no (nor have we ever had) security on site, our landlord does not live her AND they DO NOT provide any contact information for situations like these.   We got a hold of our landlord's number and we called and she refused to come down to the complex and sign the towing papers.  So to recap, they don't enforce the parking rules and when we tried to do the right thing by following all appropriate steps, the landlord basically refused to help us.   Is this something we can go to the city about or anything?	No
509	So I am moving out next week and my parents are becoming increasingly bitter over it. They told me I have to take literally everything that's mine with me when I leave (which I will not be able to do, I have a small car and also the house I'll be renting at has no space for anything and is already furnished anyways).   I'm wondering from a legal perspective if I have to do this? 90% of the things that would be considered mine, there would be no way to prove that it's actually mine (bed, nightstand, tv, etc).   I have a week to get rid of all this shit and I'm kind of freaking out. Most of it is unimportant to me and I wasn't planning on taking it. Do I legally have to?  I am 20 years old if that matters.	No
510	Hello. I am from Mississippi. My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We always used birth control. A few months ago, we were fooling around, and, out of the blue, my boyfriend suggested we try to have a baby. I was perplexed because he had always expressed disinterest in children. He started fantasizing about a wonderful family we could have, emphasizing his love and commitment to me. I was so taken aback and, after a few hours, he eventually persuaded me. I probably asked him a hundred times if he was sure, each of which he replied in the affirmative.  Well after a short while, he changed his tune and told me to go back on the pill. I was again confused but obliged. Shortly afterward, I found out I was pregnant. I felt a rush of emotions – fear, anxiety, and, surprisingly, joy. I thought it was nice to have a little person growing inside of me, depending on me for support. But I was mostly worried about how my boyfriend would feel. That night, I gradually broached the subject and eventually told him.   He hit the roof and accused me of plotting against him. I reminded him that he persuaded me to try for a baby, and he said that was just stupid pillow talk. He ordered me to “get rid of it,” to which I felt sick. He has known from the very beginning of our relationship that I am terrified by even the thought of an abortion, and he always said felt the same way. I tried to placate and reason with him, but he just kept calling me a lying slut and a bitch. He snapped that I would never get a cent of his money and stormed out.   I was completely flummoxed and scared. I know several single mothers who were abandoned by their boyfriends/husbands and are struggling immensely to raise their children on their own. I swore I would never end up like them. But I know that I cannot raise a baby on my own. I even started considering abortion, but the closest abortion clinic is over a hundred miles away, and abortion is not covered by insurance in my state.   Unfortunately, I could not even have a conversation with my boyfriend, as he kicked me out of our apartment and cut off all communication with me. I spent weeks simply trying to talk to him. He eventually relented, just in time to introduce me to his new girlfriend, seated in the passenger seat of his brand new truck. I felt defeated and gave abortion a second thought but realized I had just passed the 20-week threshold. To top it off, I was fired from my job for unexplained reasons (just days after I put in a request for a larger uniform to accommodate my baby bump).  My boyfriend was the one who coaxed me into going off the pill and making love night after night. He promised me, swore up and down, that he would always be there for the baby and me. And now that we are pregnant, he wants nothing to do with the baby or me. How can he do this? How can a father want nothing to do his own child? Our baby is our creation, and every day, I find myself growing more and more attached to it. When I feel it kicking inside of my stomach, I feel warm and joyful. But I know that I cannot afford to feed and clothe it on my own, and I know that I will not be able to give it up once I hold it in my arms. I really, really do not want to have to go to court, but as my bump grows and my paltry savings diminish, I fear that I may be the only option at this point. I don't care about myself; I only want our baby to have his basic needs met. What can I do?	No

512	I had just recently passed my road test in MN. I am a 16 year old and need a parent/guardian to sign off. Here's the issue I am currently living with my aunt and uncle and my parents are in China on vacation and they won't be back until December. They haven't given legal custody to my aunt and uncle so they can't sign off on my license. My uncle has the same last name as me so could I tell them that he is my dad and would they figure it out? Is that legal to do? Is there anything else I can do before my parents are physically back in the states?	No
513	My wife and I have decided to build a house and just by luck we stumbled upon a brand new subdivision exactly where we want to live.  The subdivision is not even being advertised yet, but we stumbled upon the brand new facebook page and contacted the builder.  Houses in this area go crazy fast, so we wanted to get in early.  He had a mockup of what the subdivision will look like with all the lots sketched up.  There are going to be 3 ponds in the subdivision so we really want a lot that backs up to one of the ponds.  It was everything we were looking for so we decided to move forward with the builder.  We put down $5k nonrefundable earnest money and have been working out all the details of the house while they have been preparing the land over the last several months.    We decided to go out this weekend to the land to check on the progress and there is absolutely no way the lots will be anywhere close to the size of the mockup that we were shown.  The lots around the ponds look like there is barely enough room for a house to be built on let alone have any kind of yard.  Leading up to this we had asked if he could give us an estimate of lot sizes and he never would, and would just say that he would have to wait until the land is cleared, etc.  But, when we asked about fencing the back yard for our dogs, he said fencing the whole thing would be pretty expensive so we could fence it halfway and have a gate in the back so we could walk out to the pond.  We took that as it would be a pretty large lot.  Also if you compare the pictures of the lots to the pictures of the ponds, they should be pretty large.  The ponds have already been dug so its easy to see that on the mockup the lot is half the size of the pond, but in reality its not even close.  There is still a little ways to go on the land before any construction will begin, so things could always change, but with 2 dogs, a backyard is an absolute must for us.  If it turns out the lots are not even close to what we expected, would it be possible to get our $5k back?  So basically, the size of the lots was never specifically given as far as sq ft, dimensions, etc; however, using the mockup of the subdivision, an educated guess could be made.  Now the lots are not looking even close to what was expected.	No
514	"I live in an apartment complex that's specifically for students. these are the cheapest, shittiest apartments in town, but they have gotten a lot better over the 2 years i've lived here.

Will be going in person today and I'm not leaving until I speak with someone.  THe problem is, this apartment is classified as ""upgraded,"" and it is not. they started to upgrade it, there was a flood, and the rest of the work that needed to be done was forgotten while they did a shitty patch  job on the rest of my apartment. They've now raised my rent beginning in August, and I'm not sure i want to live here if they dont finish upgrading soon, but i cant afford a place thats more than $50-100 more than this place.  My question is do i even have any legal rights? I've even tried to contact their corporate HQ, where once again I was not able to speak with anyone but a low level worker who was rude and unhelpful.

517	We are currently in the process of buying a house and set to close on it by mid-November. Our lease contract includes a fee of $3450 for early termination. When asked about this, the reply was that it will not be prorated for the remaining months left on the contract and that a total of $3450 plus any remaining rent and damages will be due at the time of lease termination. Below is the specific clause in the contract:  EARLY MOVE-OUT. You'll be liable to us for a reletting charge of $3450 if you: (1) fail to give written move-out notice as required in paragraphs 23 or 37; or (2) move out without paying rent in full for the entire lease term or renewal period; or (3) move out at our demand because of your default; or (4) are judicially evicted. The reletting charge is not a cancellation fee and does not release you from your obligations under this Lease Contract. Not a Release. The reletting charge is not a lease cancellation fee or buyout fee. It is an agreed-to liquidated amount covering only part of our damages, that is, our time, effort, and expense in finding and processing a replacement. These damages are uncertain and difficult to ascertain— particularly those relating to inconvenience, paperwork, advertising, showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking prospects, office overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees. You agree that the reletting charge is a reasonable estimate of such damages and that the charge is due whether or not our reletting attempts succeed. If no amount is stipulated, you must pay our actual reletting costs so far as they can be determined. The reletting charge does not release you from continued liability for: future or past-due rent; charges for cleaning, repairing, repainting, or unreturned keys; or other sums due. Lease Buy Out. If you desire to buy out your Lease Contract early please refer to your Lease Buy Out Agreement. If you have not been provided with a Lease Buy Out Agreement you must contact us regarding such an agreement. A lease buy out may not be available in all cases. Other than as required by law or otherwise stated in this Lease Contract the Lease Buy Out Agreement shall govern the means by which you may terminate this Lease Contract before the end of its term.  My question is, can they do this? My lease will be up in January, we'll be moving out mid December, and I've been a tenant here for 3 years with no defaults (not that that means anything).	No

519	Yesterday evening I was on my bike stopped at an intersection when I got rear ended by a car. Long story short, got a concussion, a cut in my head that was stitched up, a bunch of bruises and spent the night at a trauma center.  The thing is, I found out last night that my insurance was cut off about a month ago so I don't have any coverage. I'm a graduate student who has less than $1000 in his account so there's no way I can pay it off right now and would hate to have to pay off the bills over time, stunting my personal expenses once I'm out of school and working. I don't know exactly how much it'll cost me yet but I'd guess the $6-7k ballpark since they took a bunch of scans too.  My intent is to get the woman who hit me to pay off my medical bills. Besides this, some compensation for my injuries and the time I'll have to take out of school would be good as well. I don't know anything about her but she didn't have the best car so I'm guessing she's not too well off. What is my best course of legal action?  Thank you for the advice.  Location: Atlanta, GA, USA if that helps	No
520	So, long story short, my family is and always has been dysfunctional. My sister has serious mental illnesses that she refuses to take medication for. She has been in trouble with CPS multiple times. One of my nieces had been living with her biological father, whom had apparently been abusing her. CPS came to get her on 7/20 and now no one knows where she is (I was only told about this a couple of days ago!) I don't know if my sister has any custody or if CPS would have placed her there at all. I haven't spoken in over two years, and either way she hasn't answered me at all if my niece is there or not.   So my question is, how do I go about trying for custody? Am I even eligible? Who do I call to even inquire about this? CPS? A lawyer? My niece wasn't treated well at my sister's house either and I'm finally in a place where I can take her in. I just want her to be safe.	No
521	"I have just over an acre of land in a residential area. I am in the process of having a fence put up around the entire property. It is being installed by a licensed contractor, we have the proper permits for the work being done, and the plans have already been inspected by the city to confirm it fits code with respect to distance from property line and so on.  The plans for the fence were made over a year ago (they were the last stage in a series of improvements to the property) at which time the homes on both sides of me were vacant. I had spoken to the owners of both properties as a courtesy FYI in case there were any issues or concerns to address.  Unknown to me, both properties went up for sale and were sold to families who have moved in within the past month. I introduced myself at the time they moved in and talked to them about the fact that a lot of work is being done on my property - that it won't be at any odd hours and the date around which it will be finished.  As soon as they saw the fence going up both new property owners were upset. My lot is very large and their lots are substantially smaller, but without a fence the spacing of the houses could give the impression that we all have nicely sized lots (instead of me having a very large one and them having small ones). They both believe that my fence will make it obvious that their lots are small, and make them look even smaller than they are because their lots will be compared to a much larger lot.  After several weeks of discussion they are now threatening to get together and sue me for reduced property values for each of their homes, and the fact that in general they apparently believe my fence is an ""eyesore.""  I am wondering what the likelihood is that this will turn into anything (i.e. a problem for me and my fence)."	No
522	Somebody left our house a few months into the year and now won't pay the share of the bills - despite not being relieved from the contract. Is the person obligated to pay?   I know some bills aren't fixed, ie heating/gas - but even then diminishing returns means we would be paying more. However internet etc are fixed - surely they should still pay for them?  Thanks	No
523	I'll try to keep this brief.  My parents' divorce paperwork from 1989 in MO says that my father is supposed to pay for my wedding, if I have one. My mother says it is in there because she is very poor (she works for a non-profit), and my father's very wealthy, (He retired at 40).  While my father and I aren't super close, we're not estranged either. I live in CA so we see each other once a year, unless there's a major family event. I didn't know about this being in my parents' divorce agreement, so I'd saved up the money to pay for my dream wedding myself, but when I called my mother to tell her about my engagement, she immediately brought it up, even sent me pictures of that section of their divorce paperwork.  I'm not sure whether or not to ask him to honor that part of the divorce agreeement, but my mother is practically SALIVATING about it. (Their divorce wasn't exactly amicable.)  So while I'm weighing other options, I figured I'd ask so I have a clearer view of the situation. Is something like this enforceable? And if it is, what are the steps for pursuing it if he refuses when asked? If I don't ask him to pay for my wedding, and just pay for it myself, does my mother have the option of going after my dad?	No
524	"This might end up being quite long and complicated, so I apologize in advance, but I really do need advice. I'm not entirely sure where to start, or which parts of the story are relevant or not, so I'll try to do a quick summary in chronological order.   Background: My mom and I have had a very rocky relationship since my childhood. I won't get into much detail on that as I don't know if it's relevant or not, and I don't want to draw attention away from the more pressing questions I have. I think what's important to note though is she has the tendency to be very manipulative and controlling, and uses her money (she's quite rich)/position (as a mother) to get her way with pretty much everything. She'll result to yelling, physical abuse, threatening to withdraw financial support, etc. to sort of force you into doing whatever it is she wants. She absolutely has to have her way about everything every single time, or she'll have some kind of crazy violent outburst.  My dad's a calm and quiet man - the complete opposite of my mother. He's very understanding and is ""passively supportive"". He'll let you live your own life and make your own decisions, and will help out when asked. However, he's very laid back, and will try to avoid confrontation as much as possible, so he tends to stay quiet and let my mom go crazy and have her way with whatever she wants, only stepping in sometimes, when she gets excessively violent.   Summary: [2007] I had a son when I was 18 out of an abusive relationship with my then boyfriend who was 19 at the time. The relation very quickly deteriorated upon me finding out I was pregnant, so much so that by the time the child was delivered, we were barely speaking to each other, which is why he isn't on the child's birth certificate at all. I was in college at the time, and unable to adequately provide for myself and my son, so I stayed at home, and my parents provided for my son. My mom would rub this fact in my face throughout the years, but I figured she's right anyway, so I might as well endure, as I really won't be able to afford the same standard of living she can provide for me and my kid.  [2011] Moving a few years forward, I'm 21 (my son is 3) and my family decides to migrate to the US. My mom and sisters would be able to apply as dependends of my dad who had a work visa at the time, but my son and I could not, as I was already 21, and he isn't legally my dad's dependent. The plan was we all go together, visit other relatives and tour around the US, help my family get settled, then go back home with my son. When we got back, I'd finish with university and get a job to be able to support us both. I figured this would be a good time for a fresh start and to finally get away from her manipulative ways without stirring up any trouble.  [2012] When it was about time to go back home, my mom started hinting that I should leave my son in the US with them, as they'll be better able to provide for him. I told her I'd prefer to take him home with me, even if it'll be harder for me. She then started to say things like ""Well if you insist on going back, I can't stop you, but the fact that you're choosing to leave despite my objection means you don't need my help, so don't expect any support from me when you get back."" or ""How are you gonna pay for school, and where are you gonna live? Are you gonna live at my house?"" Being still quite young at the time, her statements scared me. I knew I'd be able to survive on my own, but I also knew it'd be so much harder, specially since I had to provide for both myself and my son. I knew I could take it, and for me it was worth the hardship to finally be free of her, but I didn't want him to suffer being poor just because I couldn't stand my mom anymore. I felt like getting away was something I desperately needed, but I also felt like I was being selfish - taking away an opportunity at a better life for him just because of my strained relationship with my mom. I had a talk with my dad afterwards and he said I'd always be his daughter so he'll always be there for me, but it really was in both my son's and my best interests for him to stay behind with them, as I could focus on finishing up school and getting my act together without having to worry about being able to provide for my son. So in the end, I gave in to what my mom wanted and left the country without my son.  [2013] Mom tells me that she needs me to grant her legal guardianship so she can enroll my son to school. She says she's talked to a lawyer about it and will send over papers for me to sign. It seemed reasonable and innocent enough at the time, and nothing untoward happened so far, so I figured it'd be alright. She sends me the papers and I sign then send them back, my son starts going to school, no problems.  [2015?] My entire family (dad, mom and sisters) get their green cards and become legal permanent residents, as opposed to just legal dependents on my dad's work visa. Mom says she'll need custody of my son so he legally becomes their dependent and would thus also legally qualify for a green card. I don't remember the entire conversation in precise detail, but she said something about how I'd have to legally abandon him, or relinquish my rights or something in order for her to be granted custody. I was of course taken aback by this and didn't wanna sign any papers because I didn't like the idea of abandoning my son or relinquishing my rights, even if it was to my mother. .She assured me it'd all just be on paper, that he'd still be my son, that it was just so he could get a green card, it was for his future, etc. Also we' (mom and I) have stopped fighting so much after we started living in different countries. She repeatedly said this was the only way, and I decided it truly was what was best for my son's future, so like before, I had her send me the paperwork, I signed and sent them back. I think it was around this time she said something like it might be best to stop trying to contact my son so it actually looks like I abandoned him, and so he won't get confused if he has to go to court or something. I figured I'm signing the papers anyway, I might as well do what I can to make this go smoothly for my son. It's the least I could do for not being able to provide for him myself. She gets granted custody, and they start the process of getting my son legal permanent resident status.  [2016] I'm finally done with university and am free to visit my family. My son (who's 8 by this time) and I make up for all the time we lost by being around each other pretty much all the time. He follows me around everywhere and sticks by me pretty much all the time, wanting to do everything with me. I think this is only natural, as we haven't seen each other in 5 years. Everything's going alright but I start to notice mom getting jealous. Every now and then she'll say things like ""remember that I'm in charge here"" ""he's under my care here so I'm the authority on him, not you"" ""you have no rights here so I get to make the decisions"". It gets offensive from time to time but I let it go for the most part because I figured there'd be no point in starting an arguement with her. She'll just go crazy til she gets what she wants anyway. I can tolerate her controlling to an extent, because she really is providing my son with a kind of lifestyle I can't afford to provide. I just graduated and flew here to see them pretty much immediately after, so I don't exactly have much saved up. I mean, she is my mom and she has been providing for my son this whole time, so I really do owe her a lot. Plus, her house, her rules, right? They get along quite fine anyway, and from what I've seen, she very rarely gets physically violent with him, so it seems like her relationship with him is nowhere near as messed up as mine. The only thing that really gets to me is every now and then, she'll call him aside, and tell him things like ""I'm the only one who cares for you around here, so you should listen to me"" or ""Your mom doesn't think youre the most important thing, thats why she left you here with me and that's why I'm in charge of you"", things like that. I don't know if that qualifies as brainwashing, but what bothers me even more is if she says things like that to him when she knows I can hear them, what kind of things does she tell him when I'm not around?  [2017] It's almost time for me to go back, and my relationship with my mom has pretty much gone back to what it originally was - extremely strained and borderline dysfucntional. We've had a few fights where she ended up getting violent (literally dragging my son away from me, pulling my hair, clawing at me, etc.) and it's gotten to a point where I've pretty much lost my patience so I actually fight back, specially when she starts pulling my son away. That just really gets to me fast. Fights like that only end when she decides to walk away, as I literally have nowhere else to go. Sometimes she takes my son with her, or sometimes she leaves him with me when she walks off. On a few occassions she's forbidden him to come near me and things like that, but things usually settle down and go back to normal after a few days.   Sometime last week, another such fight broke out, where she was again dragging my son away from me while yelling ""I'm the authority over him you have no rights here"", and as per usual when she started going for my son, I decided to fight back. She started getting physical again, so of course I fought back, and eventually my dad stepped in and pulled her away from me and my son. She disappeared for the rest of that day, came back the next day and everything was as normal as it gets around here. After a few days, she gets into another one of her ""I'm in charge of you and I'm the one who takes care of you"" talks with my son, and I really couldn't stand it anymore so I tell her to stop, and just say what she has to say without any of the brainwashing crap. We get into another argument (purely verbal this time), and she starts yelling ""I reported you to the police you know, I can have you deported"" among other things.  Ever since I left him here in 2012, I've always had that feeling of regret with me. I feel like I should have just taken him with me because even if we did end up poor, we'd be together, plus even if my mom stopped supporting us, my dad would still be there, and my dad would never abandon us. But I always told myself this was for the best, because this gives him the best chance at a stable future. I told myself it doesn't matter if I miss him or if I'm sad or if it's hard for me, as long as he's okay, because it's all for him in the end.   Now though, 5 years later, I feel like I'm facing the exact same situation again. I don't know if I'm being selfish,  but I feel like this time I shouldn't give him up and I should just take him back home with me even if it means my mom will withdraw financial support (or any kind of support for that matter). I brought it up briefly with my dad after the fight last week, and he said it's not a problem with him, and he supports me taking my son with me if that was what I really wanted, but that I shouldn't make a decision while I'm mad.  I'm still thinking things through, but I might be running out of time, so I thought it'd be best to explore what my options actually are before making a decision. If I decide to take him home with me, my mom is gonna object for sure, so I wanted to figure out if taking him with me is an actual option in the first place, and if not, what should I do about that? I know that if I do decide on bringing him back with me I'll have to get an actual family lawyer, but I figured maybe I could avoid having to pay for a lawyer first and find out if I actually stand a chance? Because if we do go back together I'll need every penny I have, so I'm trying to avoid having to pay a lawyer hundreds if not thousands of dollars if there's no chance I can get him back.  -----  TLDR; Signed custody of my son over to my mom a few years ago, relationship with mom has deteriorated beyond repair, I wanna take him back but I have no idea if I'm legally allowed to. She has a lot of money, and I don't."	No
525	"I've been a long-time lurker but never felt the need to post on Reddit until now. I'm desperate for some sort of help.  I live in a large apartment building. I'd estimate that we have about 300+ units. In April 2017, I was notified that a building-wide renovation was to take place, and that all of the North side of the building (which is where my unit looks out to) will have their windows replaced, so that the building looks like a tall glass tower. It would improve the building's appearance.  They told the tenants to keep things a few feet away from the window, as the windows will be removed. I had a bunch of books stacked against the window as well as some furniture, so I removed my books and stacked them on the floor and my furniture was off the window by maybe a foot (I live in &lt;400 sqft studio, so there wasn't room to move all of them and go about my normal life. I figured that the workers will eventually move them as they see fit.)  May rolls around, and every day at 7am, Mon-Sat, I am woken up with the sound of jackhammer drilling into the concrete (I don't know much about construction, all I can say is that I'm a heavy sleeper but I can't ignore this noise; I have slept through numerous block parties, however). The local bylaw says that quiet hours are over at 7am, and they start pretty much on the nose (or sometimes even 6:45am).  According to the timeline given, my floor should be under renovation between May 1 and June 15. So every day, I force myself to go to bed early (I'm a night owl, and I'm the most productive at night), because I don't want to be caught sleeping by these workers, or worse yet, maybe one day they'll remove my window and just basically enter my unit that way while I'm sleeping. There wasn't a single day where I felt comfortable falling asleep, because I really hated the idea of waking up with some stranger in the unit.  End of June rolls around, and my window hasn't been replaced yet. I am physically fatigued from not being able to sleep well, and I start to wonder if the one piece of notice telling me that ""they need intermittent access to my unit"" is still valid. Can a landlord even claim access to my unit for that long a period of time? I have no idea.  At the beginning of July, I get another notice saying that from July 5, they will begin the renovation of my floor. WTF? I've been anticipating their entry into my unit every day for the past two months. They tell me that it'll take another 5-10 business days.  I'm annoyed, but I had a business trip scheduled, scheduled to return on July 10. So I think, this will shave off a few days from having to wake up early and be stressed. From my previous experience with construction work though, I know that not everyone is super respectful of my space. So I think through the possible problems that might occur to my space while I'm away.  I post a note telling them that while they're welcome to use AC, to please shut them off when they leave. I likely have slight asthma (my sibling is a doctor and that's what I've been told, although it's mild enough that I never got officially diagnosed) so I never use AC, as AC actually makes me breathe not as well.  I worry that the dust will be everywhere, so I take out every bedsheet and cover all of my furniture.  When I came back a week later, at about 9pm, the AC was on. It was possibly on for a week straight, I have no idea. The workers had piled furniture onto my bed (like seriously, who even thinks that this is an option?) and they had grabbed my garbage can to use in their construction work. Likely they had also used other stuff (I just replaced my roll of kitchen towel before leaving, but there wasn't much left, although I can't prove it). My blinds were gone. Considering that the north wall of my unit is entirely glass (and there were construction platforms just outside my window), I feel that I can't go to sleep like this, as I have zero privacy. Also, there's a huge gap between where my old windows used to be and where there are the new windows now. I guess the space used to be filled with insulation, but now all of that is gone. With the insulation gone, my room is not soundproofed at all, and I can hear my neighbours' utensils clicking against their bowls/plates as they eat dinner, not to mention other everyday noises. They must have thrown old insulation of fibreglass on my bed at some point too, because my entire body itches Tuesday morning, and I pluck some light fibres off my body where it hurts the most.  I am livid, and I call the supervisor. She eventually picks up, and tells me that while she can install a ""zip wall,"" I'll have to deal with it for tonight as she doesn't want to drive in for an hour. She'll pay for the garbage can (this was 5 days ago, no news from her yet) and the electricity bill (the difference between last year's July and this year's July).   So now, the situation is slightly better as the zip wall has been installed, although it makes my already small room very small. My furniture is also all piled up, so it makes normal life almost impossible. My couch is up against my piano so I can't use either, my table is right next to my bed so I have to eat on my bed. Although their promised 10 business days are almost up, no one has been in my unit since Monday (other than to install the zip wall) to finish the construction, even though I hear very loud noise every day.  With the lack of the soundproof system, I've set up an air mattress in my walk-in closet and I sleep there now, because I can't continue to go to bed at 3am and be woken up at 7am by loud noises. I've slept in my closet for four days now, and today, I realized how pathetic this is.  I'm just a renter, not a unit-owner. My life has been disrupted for two months, and I don't feel like I have my own space anymore, although I pay the (relatively high) rent of $1100/month. I also hate that the construction company (and hence the landlord) can just give me a notice for blocks of times and expect to enter my unit at any given time. I'm cranky and depressed because I can't sleep well, and I'm not really sure what options I have, because the construction company technically isn't doing anything illegal, as far as I know.  I'm not sure if my whining is just me being entitled, or if there is actually some legal recourse that I can pursue. I'm desperate for any advice. Thank you so much for reading this rant."	No
526	"There's a lot of craziness going on in regards to housing in Portland right now. Particularly with building companies offering large cash sums to home owners with large lots, demolishing the existing home, subdividing the lot, and then building smaller houses on them.   My parents' neighborhood wanted to prevent this from happening (most of the homes sit on large lots and the neighborhood has a very distinctive look they want to ""preserve"" by preventing these new construction projects). So one woman spear headed a campaign to get the area designated as a historic neighborhood (I don't know how or why this prevents the whole subdividing thing so I can't provide much more info than this). My parent's and their next-door neighbors were both strongly against this idea and refused to sign some sort of petition that was going to be presented to whoever makes the decision about historic neighborhoods.  The designation attempt failed, and the woman who spearheaded the campaign places a lot of blame on my parents and their refusal to sign the petition. There is now a lot of bad blood between them.  My parents and the next-door neighbors were actually approached a few years back by the historical society about possibly placing their homes on the registry. They turned the opportunity down because being placed on the historic registry creates a lot of red tape should you ever want to remodel, or even just plant trees in your front yard, down the line. This is the main reason why they were against asking for a historic neighbourhood designation.  This same woman is now trying to create an HOA in order to try and prevent the whole subdividing issue.   Again, my parents and their next-door neighbors want no part of it. They've both lived in their homes for decades, are about to retire, and don't have any complaints about the types of things HOA's usually seek to fix. They don't want to have to deal with the headache of an HOA. The rest of the neighborhood supports the idea, though.  They recently received an email from the woman spearheading the idea that according to the lawyer the attempted HOA has hired, should the HOA actually be created, my parents will be forced to participate in it. They're obviously upset by this.  This doesn't seem right to all of us. I would think that their ability to not join would be ""grandfathered in"" for lack of a better word since they purchased their home long before the HOA was created.   They've been warned that should they try and get around the HOA situation by not following the rules they create or by not paying dues, a lien will be placed on their home.  Long story short- would they legally have to pay dues and follow all the rules the HOA creates or is this woman so full of shit that her eyes might as well be brown?"	No
527	"I've been taking medication since I was 10, ones to help my depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I also got on a birth control pill when I was 17. My mother always kept my medicine in a lockbox and only set out a weeks worth of pills af a time which sucked because she's HORRIBLE at remembering to give me more at the end of the week and she procrastinates on it even when I remind her. Once I turned 18 I told her to stop keeping it locked, but she refused even though I'm medically independent. When I miss my meds I get horrible withdrawals that include vomiting and migraines. The birth control is locked away too, and the last thing I need to to become sexually active and miss a day and get pregnant because the pill isn't accessible. My mom justifies herself by saying she doesn't ""want me to kill myself"" via pill. The very pills I need to stop me from wanting to hurt myself. Is this legal for her to do?"	No
528	My wife and I bought a house and closed about a month and half ago and moved in.  Apparently the house used to be a rental house as the last tenant has contacted us saying he is being sued by the previous owner(landlord). He wants to ask us about move in condition and wants a picture of the back screen door.  If I talk to him about move in condition would that tie me up in his court case?  I own the house and just want to get on with living here and don't want to be pulled into court for statements if that's something that could happen.  Thank you	No
529	"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	No
530	"After a bit of digging I found out my lawyer did not have a license to practice in Texas, only in Kansas also found out some of the money orders that my parents gave him weren't even cashed in yet so I was able to retrieve half of the money they had spent! There were a few others involved in this case out of the many he screwed over as well.   I followed some of the advice some of y'all gave me and am really glad the letters and calls I gave helped out on this case in the end.  Here's what the final letter they sent to me said.

531	"Hi legaladvice. So, I have recently (2 days ago) moved into a place that seems more and more illegal every time I talk to the guy who I'm renting from. I'll briefly explain the situation. I received notice from my previous landlord that they no longer wanted cats in the house. Because we were unwilling to get rid of the cats, we were forced to find a new place. I looked at a few places but found a guy with a good-sized basement he was willing to rent out for $700/month. I asked about cats and he said they were fine to have and would be free to roam the house. The next time we talked, he said he talked to the landlady and she didn't want cats at all, but would allow them in the garage. He showed me the garage, assuming that was the only space I would have and did not make that clear to me. The next time we talked about a week later, he told me we were only going to get the garage, but now it's ""good news"" and we have a room to stay in because one of the other roommates was moving out. I thought okay, whatever. as long we we have a room to stay in besides the garage. We got to the place 2 days ago to find out that 1) the room is not vacated and we will be forced to stay in the den adjacent to the now occupied basement and the garage we were promised that is now full of other peoples's stuff. In addition to this, there is no hot water or internet at the house, which was not disclosed beforehand. I also asked the man I'm renting from for a key to the house. He told me ""oh we lost it lol been too lazy to get a new one"". Am I about to squat in a house for a month? What should I do? Do I have any legal recourse whatsoever? Thank you.  Tl;dr guy promises basement with free range cats, then steps down to cats in garage and basement, then tells us no basement only garage, then we are promised a room, then we arrive and the room is unavailable and while all of our stuff has been unpacked, come to find out that there is no hot water or internet at the place and they ""lost the key""."

532	I live in Austin, Texas and for the past month and a half, I have had a mold and humidity issue in my (nice) apartment. I have put in work orders and have talked to the leasing office in person on several occasions to address this issue, but the problem remains. I've had to throw out pairs of moldy shoes, clothes, and buy a dehumidifier for my bedroom (which hasn't really done much).  I just got an email from the leasing office a few minutes ago saying that to repair the problem, they will allow us to terminate our lease agreement and move out. They previously offered to move us to a different unit in the apartment complex but its on the top floor, and we're really fed up with the complex in general.  My question is, can I take any actions here? Can I push for them to reimburse us for our damaged clothes and the cost of the dehumidifier? What about getting them to reimburse us for any moving costs associated with moving to a different apartment complex?	No
533	My uncle is married to a women who has a child. They were married when the child (F/16) was about 8 or 9. Her bio dad is not involved in any way (I am not even sure he has ever interacted with or paid support for her).   There have been a few concerning moments that I have seen in the past. When she was 15 she was dating and 18 year old, and having sex with him, all with her mothers approval. When he broke up with her over text because he was apparently also sleeping with a different 15 year old her mom's response was that it wasn't a big deal, and there was no reason for her to have to talk to the child. I have also seen the mother freak out at her for no apparent reason to the point that my cousin was in tears, and for years they have locked certain rooms in the home (like the master bedroom and some other general living spaces) just because they don't want her to have any access to their space. I know her mother also has another child that lives with bio dad and mom has not seen in 5+ years.   Now the current problem is that they have apparently kicked her out of the house. I have no idea why but knowing all parties involved it was for something ridiculous. My cousin is a great student and, besides the one horrible dating choice, is generally responsible. She isn't doing drugs or anything like that. I only found out about this because she was meant to come to a family event and told me that she couldn't make it as she was currently working two jobs and crashing with friends.   Is the correct person to contact about this CPS? or the RCMP? They live in a very small community in BC, Canada.	No
534	In the lease agreement it states that the landlord is responsible for taking care of garbage. It was only after moving in that the garbage company said that we need to put things in a special bag that costs like $15-20 bucks for 5 of them or they won't take the garbage away. Shouldn't the landlord have to supply the bags or take care of the garbage if it's left out? I honestly am curious and don't like wasting money.	No
535	"This is for a friend who's currently being investigated by CPS for what they suspect is child abuse.  I'll be keeping this as vague as possible to protect the identities of those involved, but I have a few basic questions that I was hoping someone would be able to help out with.  It sounds like this could get bad pretty quick for my friend if things aren't handled properly, and I don't want to see that happen.  **Quick Background**  One of my friend's kids got hurt from an accident in the home, and ended up having to go to the hospital.  Everything seemed normal, CPS didn't show up, and they were never mentioned during the trip to the hospital.  It wasn't until the next day when CPS showed up at my friend's house for questioning, and even then, no additional issues were brought up.  They showed back up the following day and said my friend was going to be investigated for possible child abuse, and everything since then has been an extremely hectic, mental and emotional mess.  **Questions**  * If my friend is unable to afford a lawyer from a private practice, how long does it usually take to get a court appointed lawer?  Is this something a court appointed lawyer would be a able to quickly act on?  * If my friend is required to have a ""supervisor"" in order to be around their kids, but they don't have any friends or family who are able/available, what will happen?  Will a lawyer be able to help with this?  (I read that some courts will counter CPS in some cases, at least with the ""supervised"" stuff, but I wasn't sure how often that happens.)  This investigation has only been going on for a couple days now, but CPS is already saying my friend is at risk of losing their kids.  It sounds like this could happen sooner than later if my friend isn't able to find a friend or family member that what would essentially be a live-in Nanny that could serve as a full time supervisor.  I understand the reasoning behind this stuff, but I honestly don't know how some families are expected to make it through these situations in one piece.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."	No
536	He freaked out on her and then tried to cover it up saying he was giving the cards back to the respective customers in an effort to get them a better deal on their phones/plans. Shady as fuuuuck. I am certainly not a lawyer, but this smacks of fraud to me.   Question: legally, what specifically is this considered? I'm telling her to seek legal advice, but I need her to understand the gravity of the situation (if there is indeed gravity).  Thanks in advance.	No
537	"Firstly, yes I realize I fucked up and what I did was dumb. I did it out of spite and anger which makes it's doubly a bad decision.  **Location:** Texas, USA  **Quick Background:** I rented an apartment from an acquaintance who uses a particular management company. After some weeks I realised that I needed to move outside of the country and asked to end the lease early. The contract stated that I could do that without fees if I found a replacement tenant. So, I tried to and the company managing the property made my life hell for many weeks by doing every shady thing possible to make sure I failed (lying to prospective tenants, turning others away without reason, etc). In the end the landlord, who was being lied to by them as well stepped in and told them to stop fucking around and they finally relented and accepted a tenant. They were hoping I would leave without finding one so they can charge me to find a replacement tenant instead.  Once I moved out, I was very angry and wrote a few negative reviews online using my own accounts and some others. I knew a tenant review doesn't hurt, so I proceeded to write reviews as if I was a property owner who worked with them and the management company stole from me, charged my tenant fees without informing me, and so on. Unfortunately one of the accounts I used is my personal account (dumb x 2), so it can easily be identified as me trying to hurt their reputation by creating a false story.   **Current Situation:** I currently live abroad and will not be back in the states until December. A few days my parents received notice from the Constable that I was being sued. I wasn't positive it was them, but had a feeling so I quickly took down the review that was most damaging and the one that is under my name directly. Yesterday I got a hold of the constable and he confirmed this managing company is indeed the one suing me. He gave me the details for their lawyers, who I called and left a message for saying I am currently abroad and they can contact me via email.  There are still a couple of facebook reviews that are up, but not exactly 'false'. And another false review on google, but that one cannot be linked to me. I intend to take those down, but am not sure whether to do it now or after they contact me.  I have not been served yet, as I am abroad. Not sure if they can and/or are planning to serve me in another way and if I should be avoiding this at all?  My biggest question is - should I contact the management company directly saying something along the lines of ""I've been notified that you are suing me. I can only assume that it is for the 2 facebook reviews you do not agree with. If that is it, please withdraw your lawsuit and I will take down any reviews that were made by me"" ?  I am not sure if they want to hurt me financially or just want me to take down the negative reviews - which I am happy to do as I now realize it was a dumb thing to do, even if they are a less than honest company who tried to screw me over.  Any advice is much appreciated."	No
538	"Hello,   I currently live in GA and have a GA license and vehicle registered here. I have something I need to do in NY next year that requires me to be able to prove residency in the state (nothing to do with college or the federal or state government). My parents live in NY and I already have a valid state ID (non-driver) with their address on it. I'm sure that would be enough to do what I need to do, but to be extra careful, I was thinking about ""moving"" to my parents house a month before and switching my GA license to NY. If I do this, will anything happen to my GA registration or insurance? I would switch my new NY license back to Georgia within about a month of getting it. Are there any other unintended consequences of doing this, such as income tax or something else I'm not thinking of? I also don't know the legality of this because I could easily justify any questions by saying I just decided to move back in with my parents if asked. Thanks."	No
539	"Hi, r/legaladvice  I'm at work and on mobile so forgive any issues formatting and I'm also going to try to keep this as short as possible.  Back story: Wife and I together 5 years, only married for 3 months before we separated. She moved out because she had been seeing someone behind my back for a while, fell in love with him and moved in with him.  Prior to that I worked. When she took a new, much higher paying job that also allowed her to be home more (but on call) her hours changed and was unable to keep her kids (2 boys from previous marriage) as often as she liked. She asked me to leave my low-ish paying job so we didn't have to deviate from the kids' schedule they'd had for years. I reluctantly agreed, but did and hadn't worked in about a year.   Fast forward to us getting married then her shortly moving out abruptly. This left me with the rental lease on our home (though the lease is in both our names) and forced to somehow come up with rent money with no job on a home I could not afford by myself.  I quickly went back to work but making roughly $1600/month and paying almost $900 in rent + utilities just wasn't happening. Her and I agreed I would move out by the end of July, splitting the rent until then, and then she would move back in with new boyfriend. Fine whatever as far as I was concerned.  I have been doing my best to save up money to move while sharing rent and utilities with her for 3 months, but it's not easy to save up the roughly $1500 I need to move on my security salary.  I told her this last month and she agreed (in text message, I still have) that she would pay rent for July and August and I would be out by the end of August. Last week my landlord came by saying rent has not bee paid and she called him saying she was not going to pay it. She had changed her mind.  Now my landlord has filed eviction on me, and my court date is the 26th of this month. I do not have the money I need to move out by then, and no friends or family to stay with. My mother lives an hour away in a retirement home and cannot have overnight visitors.  My question is, assuming I'm not out by my court date of the 26th, how long do I have to be out before my landlord can start removing my belongings and lock me out? Do I have any legal protection at all considering the circumstances?   I also would like to add - and this is speculation - that I have very good reason to believe that my landlord and my ex are working together on this. He is not responding to text or phone calls from me, nor is she. I know good and well she wants to move back into our home with her new dude because he has kids, plus her and her kids and it's my understanding that his two bedroom is just too small, whereas I have 4 rooms. The landlord has had a ""thing"" for my ex for sometime and their families are close knit. He was always very rude with me and her and I used to both joke it's because he's jealous of me.  Thank you in advance for any help.  (This is South Carolina btw)"	No
540	"I’m moving for a job. My future employer has given me a set amount for relocation reimbursement, but I need to submit receipts. Per my contract, I will have to do a partial payback to my current employer (didn’t stay the specified time). Ideally it would be nice to use some of the moving stipend to pay off my current employer.   Here are my questions:  1.	Can I set up an LLC moving company and hire my own company to move me? And then submit the invoice? I would rent a moving truck and then use family/friends help. 2.	What is the legality of this? If I can’t set it up under my name, can a family member set it up for me?  If it’s legal:  1.	How difficult would this be to do? Could I use Legalzoom or something similar to set up the LLC? Would there be any other costs? 2.	How hard would this make taxes? 3.	Is it worth it?  Thanks for your help. Throwaway account for obvious reasons."	No
541	So I am in need of an Occupational Drivers License because my license got suspended until March 2018. So I'm torn between getting a lawyer and paying around $300 so they can get that for me or just going through the process myself! I've been looking up different lawyers and they all basically state it's fast and simple with them and that if i were to go about it on my own, it would cost more. Is that true? Any advice would help. Thank you!  P.S I am in San Antonio, Texas. I don't have any outstanding tickets, warrants or surcharges on my driving record and I have already gotten a notarized SR-22 applied to my current vehicle.	No
542	"Hello /r/legaladvice,  I work for a privately owned retail chain you may of heard of in the news recently, and we've come under new store management at our outlet here in San Diego county. While I accepted this manager with an open mind and hope, she's done nothing but demoralize my fellow co-workers. She seems to be incapable of separating numbers on a spreadsheet from human beings, but I digress. To keep this succinct, let me jump into actions she's taken and the California labor codes I believe she's broken.  I'm aware of multiple employees she's disciplined for ""excessive absences"". She gave a write-up to one of our pregnant employees who was absent for 3 consecutive days for scabies (a highly contagious and uncomfortable skin disease caused by an infestation of insects **burrowing** into your skin), despite proper documentation from a doctor. She gave a write-up to an employee for missing work due to a family emergency. She gave a write-up to an employee for absences that were clerical errors (she had switched shifts with another employee and had it manager sanctioned, but they marked her absent *by mistake*). The list goes on, and she's expressed plans to reprimand more. Although I myself have not had anything done unjust to myself, likely because I'm leaving soon, I can no longer stand by and let this happen.  I've done my research, and I believe this violates California Labor Code § [233](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=233) &amp; [234](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=234) (tl;dr: an employer can't discipline an employee for sick time off if they don't exceed what they've been allocated by the company, and none of my aforementioned instances have done that). Since this happened to so many and will likely happen to more, it would be difficult to spread this knowledge to everyone verbally. So my plan is to arm my co-workers *en masse*. I intend to print these labor codes and covertly post them in the break-room with the title: ""Have you been punished for absences lately? This may interest you:"". I'm quite sure it'll be taken down very quickly, but I trust the rumor mill and a few backup copies should cover this.  So my question is; am I understanding these labor laws correctly, and what do you think? I am also open to suggestions of all sorts, as well as opinions on how I'm going about this.  It should also be mentioned, I'm sure they'll suspect me. My co-workers (and managers) have grown accustom to my taste in mischief/shenanigans, and often turn to me first when something of the sort has happened. They are almost always correct in doing so. Although I don't intend to admit to doing this, my employer is an ""at will"" company."	No
543	"I'm speaking on behalf of my parents. These past 2 months have been very unfortunate financially. So this is what happened.. (My dad is a trucker) Yesterday my dad was unloading on a companies lot during the day. Just in front of the company the other lot is owned by a restaurant. Later that night after unloading, around 8:00-9:00PM my dad got tired and moved his truck ONTO the other lot (restaurants property) to rest a little bit. The truck was still running, my dad was in the truck. The only sign that was there was ""no overnight parking"" which I'm assuming is after 12 not before. They locked up one of his wheel before coming up and banging on his door to talk. Apparently they didn't have any ID's or anything. My dad called the police and the police couldn't do anything about it. Apparently towing companies in Charlotte won the bill where it seems like they can give a ticket for any amount they want. Seems very unregulated to me. This price is very hefty on my parents and they had to pay with credit. Is there anything we can do? My parents called their lawyer and the price added up to 200$ +200/h. They don't think it's worth it. Help would be much appreciated!"	No
544	My dad was arrested last year in Fulton County, Georgia on a theft by taking misdemeanor. He found a phone and took it home to wait for someone to call to return it, but he forgot about for, left it in the car and the cops tracked it down. My dad gave the phone to the cops when they camped out in our neighborhood, but was arrested and taken to the Atlanta jail. My mom had to pay his $2970 bail to get him out the following morning and was told he will be receiving notice of a court date within three months. This happened two years ago and we are still waiting on a court date notification in the mail. Is this the normal process? Do we just have to wait? I read online about a 1 year statue of limitations on theft charges in Georgia to be charged, but I don't know if this applies to my dad. Since a year passed, can he still be charged or has he already been charged? We have a card that says to call the state court clerk after 3 months if we do not receive a court notification so we called three months after his arrest and they told us to continue to wait. Should we call back to get an update or will they tell us the same thing?	No
545	Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	No
546	Hi sorry if everything is jumbled I'm trying to figure everything out.   I got a call from my husbands phone this morning saying he was just hit by a truck while on his motorcycle. He was on the freeway when this happened and was slammed by a truck and he slammed into the side of a semi. I have no idea what the state of his bike is but chp gave me the number of the wrecker towing company that took his bike.   I called the company who has my husbands motorcycle and they told me the fees was close to 500$ (I'm in such a panic state I almost forgot the exact number they told me). They also informed me that it'll be an extra 70$ past 5pm and everyday so on.   Right now I unfortunately don't have that money due to us having another emergency less then a month ago so we already used our emergency funds we had saved.   I've already called our insurance, I called CHP to get the other drivers insurance information but they said they won't be able to give it to me until tomorrow. What steps do I take from here, my husbands been asleep most of the day due to his pain meds so I'm really a mess trying to figure out what to even do from here. Is there a way to get the other persons insurance to pay for the bike fees to get it out? Our insurance hasn't been helpful because the policy is under my husbands name and they keep telling me that they need to speak to him.   I'm sorry again for the erratic mess, I can't process my thoughts correctly right now.   Edit to add this is in California.	No
547	I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this	No
548	"Currently renting at an apartment community in GA. I've been here for a couple years and every year they send out a renewal offer each year. Well, i've been trying to get them to send the lease over so I can lock in my renewal rate for another year (we lucked out and pay MUCH less than any of our neighbors). The staff in the office has changed a lot over the years and I'm worried someone new will come in and really jack up our rent. We received a written renewal offer on the company letterhead stating our renewal rate for 2017-2018 with absolutely no expiration date or stipulations (i.e. offer is void if presented with future offers). Would they have to honor this since it's in writing? We've been calling and going into the office in person and keep getting the old ""we'll get to it"". Starting to get very nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!"	No
549	Hi there! I live in Colorado and have a question about a security deposit dispute I'm having with my landlord. Colorado law states that SDs must be returned within 30 days, unless the lease states another period, which can be no more than 60 days. My lease stated 60 days.   I contacted my landlord (a company that owns a bunch of apartment buildings) on day 71 after my lease ended, inquiring where my security deposit was, as I hadn't received it. The leasing manager told me that it had been mailed out 30 days ago, and gave me the address it was sent to, which was wrong. I double checked that I had given her the correct address, which I had, and I let her know that it was mistaken. She apologized for the clerical error and said they would write me a new check and send it out asap.   I finally received the check in the mail 85 days after my lease ended, and found that they had taken out $134 from a $500 security deposit, and did not provide an itemized list of the reasons.   I'm planning to write a 7 day demand letter, since a) they did not provide me a list of the deductions taken, which is illegal, and b) CO law states that if the landlord sends the SD after the 60 day period, they are not able to take any money out of it.  I'm hoping for some advice as to whether the above checks out. I'm particularly wondering if the fact that they sent out the check within the window, just to the wrong address, at their own error, in any way negates the fact that they sent it late, or whether the fact that I received it 85 days after moving out is all that matters. Thanks for reading and I'd appreciate any insight, this is my first time dealing with something like this.	No
550	Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old. My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.  I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.  My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.  This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.  I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!	No
551	My wife and i have just signed a lease for a house rental that went into effect on the first. We havent moved our furniture over yet, but ive been over every day doing little things like changing the bulbs and putting up flower baskets. Anyway today i was in the living room when i smelled something acrid which led me to a dimmer switch. After turning off the power i found some burned wires, and what i suspect might be aluminum tied into copper. I took a picture which ill post soon and the cable is pretty clearly black from overheating.  We are leasing through a property management company, and i submitted a ticket for repair (and another one for the two broken smoke detectors), but what can i expect going forward? I've also installed a CO detector, which has stayed quiet.  My question is, given that we are in texas, what can i expect if the landlord attempts to just replace the switch without addressing the broader safety issues of the wiring itself? What are the best and worse case scenarios and how do i plan for them?	No
552	"I've recently made an offer on a home.  In the listing for this home, there was no mention of a solar panel system installed and I didn't even realize it had solar until the following morning when I was looking at the photos of the house.  I made an offer that stated the panels were to stay with the home.  I received a counter offer stating the solar panels would not be included in the sale of the home.  Since I didn't even know it had solar, and I loved the house, I accepted this contingent on the panels being professional removed and the roof repaired as needed.  Today my realtor, at my request, contacted the seller's realtor to ask about a timeline for this, as I'm going to have to get a 2nd follow up inspection to make sure the work was done correctly.  My concern is that we are only 4-6 weeks from closing and being in the construction business...I know how busy everyone in town is.  I don't see how he's going to get the work done in time.  Their reply was asking if I, the buyer, might be interesting in taking over the payments for the solar system at $70 a month.  That is all the information they provided.  I've requested more information as far as what the amount owed is, how much the savings is per month on the utility bill, what is the APR, warranty, etc.  So, I have some questions assuming I said no.  Does he have an avenue to back out of the offer or is he committed to either removing the panels or leaving them and eating the cost.  I'm also assuming he received a tax credit for the installation, which makes me wonder if he's even allowed to move the panels to his new home (I assume that was his plan).  My biggest question is regarding the wording of the counter offer.  They specifically stated       5. Per section 2.5.1: Solar Panels WILL NOT be included in the sale of this property. The wording states solar panels and nothing about the electrical system that goes with the panels.  Am I splitting hairs or do I legally have a right to any electrical, inverters, batteries, etc or would that logically be part of ""solar panels"".  I love the house and don't want to do anything that would prevent us from getting it.  I'm just wondering about my options as this is a situation I am not familiar with.  Thanks r/legadvice!"	No

I'm going to operate under the assumption that he needs to be looking out for his own best interests (and also the baby's) and not assume she will..  What state laws apply for child support? What are some common things that he can get in order to help his life less hectic?   He's the type of person that will ignore hard decisions or conversations hoping it all just works out.  Any input is appreciated.	No
554	Hi. My husband and I, married 11 years. I am thinking of leaving my husband. He originally purchased the house before we married, but I have significantly improved it, ie repainting, tuck pointing, re-grouting, and basically building 2 new rooms out of a sleep out. I don't want it to get messy, I guess I just want to know where I stand if leave.  As he owned the house before we married, do I have any claim on it? I am worried as we have 3 children. I am happy to  move somewhere else, but I don't quite know how to move forward.	No
555	My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	No
556	Hey all! I've recently started an NBA blog. I'm currently writing posts to fill up the site before I begin to promote it a little bit, and, I use images (which don't belong to me) in posts. My parents have mentioned that this might get me into some legal trouble, but I wouldn't think so as I don't profit off the blog.  A lot of NBA YouTubers use images such as the ones I use on my website. As well, many use real footage of the NBA. These are monetized videos with hundreds of thousands of views. If they never get into trouble for using the material, is there any reason I would?  I'm planning on getting this site to be fairly big (I have the ability to promote the site pretty well, so there's a decent chance it can get pretty popular -- that sounds kinda braggy, I don't mean it in that way though haha). I figured I should mention that because I'm guessing it's a bigger issue legality wise if the website is popular.  Thanks so much for any help! Feel free to ask any questions in case I left anything important out.	No
557	"I am moving to North Carolina, and applied to lease an apartment. With the application, I paid $350 as an application and administrative fee. I signed a document stating that this payment was non-refundable. I understand that I cannot get this money back despite changing my mind about renting the apartment.  Two days ago, I received lease documents to sign and return. In the lease it states that $200 is required as security deposit for ""Resident's fulfillment of conditions of this agreement."" I paid the security deposit over the phone, anticipating that I would sign and return the lease documents the next day. I had a change of heart, and decided that I would not sign the lease. I have since found a different place to live.  When I contacted the apartment to inform them that I would not be signing the lease, they told me that they would not return the security deposit. I was told that I signed away ""all monies paid"" when I applied. I have a copy of the application acknowledgement form, and it says that the $350 admin fee is non-refundable, but makes no reference to ""all monies paid."" I believe that tenant rights in North Carolina prohibit a security deposit from being used/retained without a renter's agreement (though I could be misinterpreting the law). I think the relevant statutes are the North Carolina General Statutes § § 42-50 to 42-56.  I am wondering if the law is on my side in this instance. In the case that I somehow did manage to sign away as non-refundable all monies paid (without noticing or obtaining a record), would that be in direct violation of the North Carolina Tenant Security Deposit Act, and thereby void? I would like to get the $200 back. But more than that, I don't want to let this management company steal from me, if they are in fact retaining the deposit unlawfully."	No
558	So my fiance and I live in the Bronx and our lease ends on August 15. We've given our landlord ample amount of notice that we were leaving (about 4 months ago) and that we'd actually be gone by August 1. We even went on vacation for two and a half weeks last month and gave them permission to showcase our apartment in our absence.   However, since we've been back, the man who is supposed to be showcasing our apartment has not been the best at letting us know when he'll be showing up. On one occasion, he even broke into our apartment while we were napping. He thought we weren't there because we didn't answer our phone within the 5 minutes he called. He tried pulling the stunt again a second time, to which we said no.  The one time he gave us notice of him coming, nobody showed up. He didn't even show up.   My landlord just texted us stating that if there is a delay in renting out the apartment, we will be held responsible. Can they do that? We've only been back for two weeks. They've had and will have so many opportunities to showcase our apartment, can they legally withhold our deposit for this?	No
559	"I have 2 roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. ""John"" is the one bringing his family over. He said his mom would be over for a few days, and we consented. He had 10 members of his family over for 5 days, then had 4 members stay over for another 5 days, at which point he had 10 again for the final 2 days.      I told him this was too much when I realized, but he said they had to stay as they had nowhere to go. This is the second time his mom has come in 4 months (totalling 16 days).      We are all on the lease equally. I want to know, what are my rights in this situation? I've googled and saw it was OK if it was just an overnight guest like a girlfriend, but I saw nothing about 10 people... I'm not trying to get all of us kicked out, but it feels like I have no power in this situation if he wants to bring his family back. I told him not to bring them back, but I also said to get a hotel for them, which he did not. Any advice you can give would be helpful"	No
560	Baltimore, MD  We moved out of our last apartment at the beginning of June. Since then we've been trying to get into contact with our old landlord, trying to get some sort of response re: our security deposit ($800+interest-damages). He never sent us a list of damages or the cost of those damages. He hasn't responded to any of our emails (we've emailed at least twice).  The thing is... the last time we saw him (in April or May), he said he had been in (basic?) training and was heading off for deployment. Based on his linkdin profile, it looks like he's been with the military for several years. It seems that he's in some sort of abroad training program, not quite active duty. I'm not really sure I understand the technicalities, but I feel like he must have some sort of way he can communicate. He never gave us a phone number or email address or anything for someone to contact while he's away who can act on his behalf regarding the property.  I'm just really stumped on what to do here. I think I read that after 45 days if the landlord doesn't send a list of damages/repair costs, they forfeit the security deposit and any interest it accrued.  So I'm hoping to get some input on this. I'd really love to avoid having to get a lawyer... it doesn't seem worth it if it's going to end up costing me more than $800. But we also could really use that money because our wedding is next year.  Thanks reddit.	No
561	My deceased grandmother died in 2009 and she left me money in her will. My aunt is the executor of the will but won't pay it out, and I'm legally an adult now so what options do I have in claiming this? Also the will dictates that there is cash money in my name but my aunt says that the money was put into a 529 college plan for me.   What should I do?	No
562	"I realize this is minor complaint compared to a lot of other posts, I just want to know my options really.  The apartment I'm in is the corner next to the entrance to the building and there is a lot of traffic in and out. I expect this and have gotten used to it. However, there is one neighbor who is quite loud on his entrance. Nearly every time he is shouting about how everyone in this building is a drug addict and that I'm a drug dealer. My window is open at all hours of the day and night, and this is pretty obvious. So there is little doubt, at least to my mind,  that he understands I have at least the potential to hear him.  What is just the biggest thing is that this has been happening for months ever since I moved in. I have and had barely any interaction with him, nothing more than the polite ""Good afternoon."" Furthermore he is doing this at all hours of the day. Whether its midday or midnight, he is not afraid to shout how he ""always winds up in buildings with tweekers"", and how I'm a ""drug tycoon"". Which, in honesty, would be impressive since I had only moved to a state a month before he started his soapbox.  I have already filed a complaint with the office, and plan on filing a second because to me it seems like he's escalating in volume and frequency. I'm just curious what, if anything, can be done from a legal aspect. It's just demoralizing, insulting and annoying to be dealing with this day in and day out. I'm at the point where I'm willing to take a urine based drug test in front of him just to get him to shut up."	No
563	My friend is going through a contentious divorce right now. She has asked me to give a deposition and possibly testify for her. I really want to, but have an underlying concern holding me back.   They both have a history if drug use, and I have smoked pot with both of them in the past. The things she wants me to testify about have nothing to do with drugs, so I guess my question rests with the likelihood that I would be questioned about my own drug use and what the consequences would be. Is it possible that testifying to that could mess up job, adoption, or similar prospects for myself down the line? Also, my friend seems to think I might get drug tested for agreeing to be a witness. Is that right? I really just want a clear understanding of what I'm getting into if I agree to do this.    Do they drug test witnesses in situations like this?	No
564	"Il  I was stupid and lucky. I parked somewhere with free parking for an event at a con. Only rule I could see was ""No overnight parking"". I get back to my car around 1am to someone calling  in my car to be towed. He said that once the mall closes you can't be parked there and it's a big fine. Luckily he let me go.   Now, this is just for curiosity sake, but he put a big sticker on my car window. On the driver's side back one. It isn't coming off easy, it's ripping like a sticker does and is leaving behind sticky shit. It's irritating. Is it legal for someone to vandalize my car like that?"	No
565	My boyfriend has a 6 year old son, we'll call him John. Bf has a very strained relationship with his ex (John's mom) and exes bf. Up until a year and a half ago, John lived with my boyfriend, ex got him every other weekend, and she paid child support. Bf's company shut down, lost job, and lost his apt.  Now John lives with the ex and her boyfriend with her other children. My bf for the last year has been in and out of apts, homeless for a few weeks at a time, and occasionally lives with his parents who are EXTREME hoarders (so not a legal or viable option for John to stay).  Now my bf has a steady job for last 3 months. Is making child support payments and sees John only sat and Sunday.  In the last few months my boyfriend also called CYS because ex's boyfriend put his hands around John's throat. He has proof and pictures. Took him to police station they took pictures, John told them is was ex's bf, CYS case worker said they couldn't label it as child abuse because there was no hospitalization and no lasting marks (the hand marks eventually faded after a few days)? So they didn't do anything and John had to be returned to his mom. This is not the first time the ex's boyfriend has placed hands on John but I believe this is the first time we have proof.   My bf also has reason to believe there may be some sexual abuse happening in that house as well. John was caught taking very obscene, inappropriate picture of his genitals, and taking videos. It could just be a sexual exploration thing but I can't remember doing that when I was 6?  My bf is trying to keep up with his child support payments, get an apartment (for him and John), and find a lawyer but it seems impossible when he's literally starting from scratch.  His payments for child support are less than $200 a month, most apartments require a credit check (he has shit credit) and first+last/security which he doesn't have, a lawyer is so out of the question financially.  My bf doesn't want to put John in foster care but we're at a point where we feel strangers could be safer then leaving him with his mom. We would have to do an emergency custody hearing which would cost him around $400 just to file. He also did this a couple years ago and this resulted in zero punishment the last time the ex's bf hurt John so it feels pointless.   He just feels so defeated with the whole situation. I can tell he's at a point where he would rather beat the shit out of his ex's boyfriend just to get rid of him, end up in jail, rather than his kid stay there another day and risk more abuse/injury. I can't really blame him. He's terrified the boyfriend is going to take things to far and seriously injure or do something worse to his son.  I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but he needs legal help. This situation has been escalating on a weekly basis. I can tell that my bf is feeling cornered, desperate and that his kids life is being threatened probably on a daily basis. Does anyone know of an organization that can help a parents with low income? We live around Philadelphia.  :TL;DR son is being abused. Need to get him out of mothers house. Very little access for funds or resources.	No
566	"1st floor resturant 2nd and 3rd are 8 apartments.There is an office on the third floor included in the restaurants lease.They let one of their employees live in the office.He is drunk all the time and you can hear him playing acoustic guitar wasted out of his mind in the hall way because he has 0 respect for anyone.He his words ""put a cigg out in a plant and fell asleep (drunk im sure) and when i heard the fire alarm i opened my door to the hallway engulfed in smoke.Services came and put it out (about three hours out side freaking out).How can i get this guy out?"

567	Texas  My husband and I are splitting up. We have a 3 year old son together. My husband has offered to pay me $600 a month in child support. $500 would go to child care and the extra $100 would be for anything else he needs. My husband brings home around $4,500 a month. He also has our son insured through his work.  Here is the issue - I want to go through the attorney general for child support. He doesn't want me to because he says I'll get more money from him and I 'don't need more money than that'. He says that he put me through school so that I could have a career and can take care of myself and that I really don't need any more money from him in child support. I make about half of what he makes monthly.  I didn't think this was fair, so I told him that I was going to get a lawyer for all of this. His response to that was that if I went out and got a lawyer to get more child support, he would ask that I take our son to an actual daycare. My dad has been taking care of my son since he was born. He watched him every day when I was in nursing school, and he watches him while I work. He's been to every single doctors appointment, he takes him to his T-ball practice and he does 2 learning programs with him at home - ABCmouse and a program with actual books and flash cards. He's doing really well with these programs. My son is very close to him and I feel safe knowing that he's with him.  So my question is - would I likely get more money in child support if I go through lawyers? And can my husband make me send our son to a daycare facility?	No
568	I've tried to supply all the infomation that I can (so it's long) - questions at the bottom. Thanks!  Obviously, talking with a VA lawyer is on the table, but I'd also like to wrap my head around things.   Backstory: - Current GF bought a house back in 2004, VA - Lived there for years with her sister.  - Decided to go to Med School, Sister got married and moved - Rented the House out to a friend of a friend - No property management - Everything was fine, until recently - We are all going to sit down and talk about a plan of action this weekend. I've been reading VA laws to try and get a handle on options.    Downside(s): - GF is in residency in OH (3rd year) and hasn't had time to visit VA for a little over a year. Being in VA will be next to impossible until July 2018, but could be around xmas if they give residents time off. There may be options to trade days with other residents and get a weekend off - Lease is up in January; very simple cookie cutter lease (just pretend a lease doesn't exist outside of ending in Jan) - No security deposit made, no last month's rent   Recent Events (last year or so) - Tenant has been systematically later and later on rent and will pay portions.  - In June, Tenant was behind a month and send 3 checks. June and July's rent were post-dated until the 10th of the month (when rent is due on the 1st). 3rd check was a partial payment for the behind amount (about 80%) - My GF has always been lenient, so there are no late fees in the lease and no warnings outside of text messages - GF's sister was driving through VA to visit in Ohio and stopped to do a walk through of the property - Apparently, the place is a wreck. Garbage everywhere, doors off of hinges (or broken), un-kept yard, smoke detectors hanging from the ceiling, mold from soap scum growing in the bathtub, etc.  - A strong odor of weed in the basement - tenant admitted to her co-tenant smoking weed inside   According to the sister, the place is absolutely trashed and will require a couple of thousand dollars to make the necessary repairs. She apparently took pictures, but I haven't seen them yet. Sister believes tenant should be evicted, repairs made, and a new tenant found. Brother in law claims to have had property in VA and mentioned it taking a very long time (8 months or so) for the eviction to happen. He was awarded a large sum to cover damages, but never actually got any of the money. I'd like to avoid that here.     Eviction: - LL must provide a notice, depending on 1) not paying rent (giving 5 days to fix) or 2) Violating the lease (30 days notice, but 21 days to correct the issue) or 3) Criminal Activity (no notice needed, straight to filing a complaint with the court) - If tenant doesn't fix the problem in the time frame, we file a complaint with the appropriate court in VA - Have a hearing where the judge hears both sides and decides (or potentially pushes back to another date for a fuller trial)? - Tenant can supply a defense   **Questions** - Since my GF is super busy, can I represent her in court or for any of the proceedings?  - There are some obligations that the LL has to maintain the property, but it looks like VA law requires the tenant to provide notice. 21 days for the LL to fix or the Tenant can break the lease. Since the Tenant hasn't mentioned any necessary repairs (not in writing, text, or voice), can she still use this as a defense?  - If there is no real lease, is essentially trashing the place enough to count as violating the lease? - Does the LL have a good chance at winning small claims for any damages caused by the the tenant?  - If we follow the rules, how long should we expect an eviction to take place? (Let's say tenant gets a notice to fix or quit on the 15th and does nothing. We could file a complaint in court on 8/15? If we're blessed enough to get a trial soon after (9/1) and the judge rules in favor of the LL - when would the tenant have to be out? Another 30 days?   Is there anything else I should consider?  We're mainly trying to avoid periods of time when my GF has to pay both her current rent AND the mortgage on the house. Any time that the house is unusable and no one is paying rent, it's going to be a huge strain.	No
569	The other side has told me that they have drafted some kind of stipulation or other agreement to announce to the court at the upcoming hearing, which was supposed to be the date of the trial. They say it closely tracks the original agreement. I am not sure if this is proper or necessary.	No
570	My son’s father filed for a child custody modification last year. We are going to trial at the end of the month. The original judgment handed down by the court gave me primary physical custody with visitation for our son’s dad on Wednesday nights and every other weekend.   I cannot afford an attorney so I will be representing myself at the trial at the end of this month.   I have a few questions: 1. His lawyer emailed me a “take it or leave it offer” regarding visitation (for me) which I declined to sign. Since then, my son’s father has not let me see our son. His lawyer indicated in the email that I could not show the judge the “offer.” Is the lawyer allowed to say this? My son’s father has now said he will ask the judge for me to see our son a few hours each week.   2. DCF (Mass) was involved during a domestic violence incident in 2015 in which I was arrested and my son’s father had a 51A filed against him for abusing me. A 51A was filed against me as well because I was arrested in front of our son. At the time, our son was 4 months old (I had full legal and physical custody) and I was used to the abuse and thought it would make more sense for me to decline to press charges against my son’s father so that my son wouldn’t be taken into custody by DCF. How can I most effectively tell the judge the circumstances of that night?  Thank you in advance for your help.	No
571	Long story short.  My wife and I separated for a short time and filed for divorce, divorce was dissmissed.  We have a minor child and there was a child support order issued.  We worked things out after about 6 months and have been back together for several years.    I have been paying the child support all of this time up until 6 months ago when I took a new job.  Our question is how do we request the child support end?  The only forms I was able to find were if the child turned 18 or was emancipated.  I know to dismiss the divorce all we had to do was write a letter to the judge requesting it, is that all tjjat we would need for this?	No
572	This past week we have noticed people selling one of our t-shirt designs through some online print on demand platforms. These companies are the sort where anyone can submit artwork and get it printed. I believe these companies are in the US. One company we contacted and they have removed the listing, and the other we are contacting right now. Between both listings, these people have earned a few thousand dollars from my design. Since it's relatively a low amount I understand that it might not be worth dragging lawyers into the situation...but it annoys me that there are US companies that are aiding these a$$holes and profiting from stealing my design.   I can post more specific information if it would be helpful.	No
573	My situation is as follows, we live in a two bedroom apartment but we split it between 3 people. In order for one of us to get off the lease we (all) have to sign a relinquish form.   The question is, once this form has been processed and he is officially off our lease are we legally allowed to change our locks and remove any of their left over belongings? We live in MD. Also is he officially off the lease once we sign the relinquish form or when we sign a new lease?? We are worried about the possibility of them trying to squat.  Thanks in advance!	No
574	I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	No
575	Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	No
576	The charge is for under 21 alcohol consumption in Deleware County Indiana  Successfully completed a diversion program months ago that involves community service, but not sure if it will show up on a background check for job interviews, etc.  Thank you for the advice.	No
577	"So I moved into this apartment complex in Anaheim, CA in September and have been parking my car inside since then. This morning, my car was towed because the permit I received from the office was deemed ""invalid"". When I went to speak to the property manager he looked in his system and couldn't find anything about my car being registered to park there (or my roommates for that matter) and refused to believe that I've been parking there since I moved in. He even accused me of falsifying a parking permit. He then refused to have my car released from the towing company and told me there was nothing he could do. The very same day I moved in one of the other property managers made copies of my registration and drivers license and gave us the permits himself. But now since they can't find any proof about it, I get screwed over. What can I do to have them repay me for the tow? It's not fair for me to have to pay for their incompetence."	No
578	I'm divorcing my husband due to his alcoholism and verbal/emotional abuse, I have witnesses/recordings. We own a home, and had a joint savings account. He took all the savings, and wants to take over the house. He wants me to sign my half of the title to him, so I'm left with nothing. Plus he wants to jointly file taxes together so he gets half next year. I left a month ago. I paid my half of the bills for June, but he wants me to continue to pay my half. I'm lost and don't know what my rights are.	No
579	I've lived in my current apartment for about 6-7 years now, and management has changed hands a number of times. Over the last year a new company came in, and set up security cameras in all the common areas, including the building entrances and exits.  I never really had any issue with this, but now I've been handed a lease renewal to sign, and I see that there's a photography release clause in there. I can't copy &amp; paste from the source, so I'm summarizing, but if necessary I can transcribe it.  Basically it says they can use any image from any of the cameras in the building for any reason, and they don't have to notify you or compensate you.  Now, I'm sure they're not going to take a top-down photo of my fat ass staggering back through the lobby from the pub and use it in their next publicity campaign or anything, but it just seems absurdly invasive to me all the same.   Are they allowed to do this? It would be ok-(ish) if I could avoid the camera areas, but residents literally can't, they're in all the building entrances.	No
580	Greetings everyone.  I am having a hellish time trying to move on / away from my abusive ex fiance of 4 years. It's a complicated situation and it invovles a lot of manipulation, lies, defamation and abuse on her part that I would like to put a stop to, but need help doing so since my own efforts to disuade her have not worked out. I'm in colorado. If you know of any good lawyers that care about mens rights please help me find them because I am afraid being the male and her acting like a victim all the time when I never do anything but raise my voice and demand her to take responsibility for her actions!	No
581	I recently bought a house and am planning on bringing in roommates to fill my extra bedrooms. As a landlord, I know I am not allowed to discriminate based on age, gender, race, etc. However, how about as a roommate? For example, I am 22 and would prefer my roommates to be close to my own age. Am I allowed to consider this when choosing roommates/tenants?	No
582	Hello,  So today my 11 year old daughter came in upset with a paper notice from the office that included at the bottom in bold that minors under the age of 16 were not allowed in the common areas without parental supervision.   I was able to turn up some websites that say this is a no-no (per the Federal Fair Housing Act) but no solid case information that I could cite to the office.   I've already called HUD and the WA State Fair Housing Commission as well as the corporate office of these apartments.   The manager claimed she had taken fair housing classes and that this was totally legal, but it smells like bullshit to me.   Outside of the fact that my kids like the outside more than me or my wife, and that we're not helicopter parents, is there anything we can do here?	No
583	I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended license, and completely spaced the court date. I'm fairly certain that means I will now have a bench warrant for failure to appear, in addition to having to take care of my original charge.   I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker.   I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next? I take care of a parent and kid so it would be really bad to go to jail. (Otherwise I'd just bit the bullet and go for a short period.)   TL;DR: What's the best bet for getting my warrant cleared, without spending time in jail, and can I do it on my own? How likely (approximately) is it that I'll get arrested if I go in on my own?	No
584	"Hello  I am a college student, and this is my first ticket.  I hit somebody's back corner and then I fell into a ditch, totaling my vehicle.  The other driver only had corner damage on his car.  Nobody was injured.  I received a traffic ticket for failing to stop for assured distance.  I had the cops come to the scene to simply prove that the other driver was not at fault.  I was surprised that I received a ticket.  Later, I learned that calling the cops is not necessary, as long as information is exchanged.  The other driver was not jumping to call the police right away.  I regret involving the police.  I feel that I screwed myself over, beyond what was necessary.  I feel that totaling my car and denting the other guy's car does not call for a citation, especially considering the other guy did not offer to call the police.  I have a pre-trial soon.  I have to talk to a prosecutor and make a deal.  I would ideally like to drop the whole case, as my father's insurance is taking care of vehicle damage.  I am educating myself about courts.  I learned that the prosecutors want to spend more time prosecuting midemeanors/felonies and other serious issues.  They just want to get petty tickets out of the way.  Would it benefit me to ask for my case to be dismissed, and if he doesn't budge, say ""I want to learn more about the court process, so I am going to have trials regarding my ticket, so I can explore all of my options.  I have time because I am out of school for the summer.""  Would this make the prosecutor want to back off and not want to deal with me, especially because I am young.  I have had my liscense for about a year.  I know it costs a lot of money to run the courts.  I recognize that it's assumed that people who hit cars from behind are at fault, but the reality is, traffic court is designed to suck money from people.  The other driver wasn't upset when I talked to him.  I just want the insurance to fix the other guy's car, and move on with my life."	No
585	Under our side of our duplex there's a little door that leads to the piping, heaters/boilers, machinery of both units. Under our unit, while inspecting it with the maintinence guy, my boyfriend found a large amount of black mold.  &amp;nbsp;  For one, we've already spoken to our landlord about our AC not working properly, and we're in Georgia in the summer, so this is about as pleasant as you'd expect. They sent someone out and supposedly fixed it. They did not. They then (also on the first visit)  pointed out that there's a leak in our washing machine, to which the second maintinence guy said is probably what caused the mold.  &amp;nbsp;  We took a few pictures of the mold, and I plan on sending our leasing company an email outlining these issues, as well as the fact that we've been running our AC under their assurance that it is working and it wasn't, running up our electricity bill. I will be asking them to re-reimburse us as well as either fixing this mold issue within 24 hours or that they need to house us at another property, or something to that effect, as we just got a two-month-old puppy a day before finding this out, and black mold (which is right under our bedroom) is particularly dangerous to infants. **I've even read somewhere that this may be valid grounds to break our lease without damaging our credit and even get some sort of 500-dollar civil fee from our landlord?** I don't care about the fee so much as leaving this place, because I honestly don't feel like they're going to fix this in a timely manner, and my boyfriend and I are beginning to feel signs of the mold's effects... we have no clue how long it's even been down there, but the side effects have been felt for a month or two now (chronic fatigue, chest compression/finding it hard to breathe, etc.) and my boyfriend and I are fit, and healthy, well under weights considered to be obese.  &amp;nbsp;  What can/should we do here?	No
586	My girlfriend and I went to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico this past week. Went great, until I ate something bad and came down with severe fever, chills, pain, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Worst infection of my life. I ended up needing medical transport and was hospitalized for 3 days, where they pushed all sorts of drugs and antibiotics. Ultrasound revealed my colon was super inflamed, and I had a condition called gastroenteritis. The hospital stay cost $16,000.  We contacted the resort, asking for a refund. We know for a fact it was something that I ate from there that made me sick, since we didn't leave the resort at any time. If they refuse, do we have legal grounds to sue?	No
587	"**Scenario**  I  (car ""A"") had come to a complete stop near a busy intersection. Someone two cars up was turning which is why traffic was stopped so close to the intersection.  The car behind me (car ""B"") pulled up short. They weren't directly behind me, but I believe they were too close. The truck behind them (car ""C"") barely slowed down at all and slammed into them, totaling their car and damaging mine. I was at a complete stop for about 3 seconds before the accident.  1. My insurance is telling me that my best bet is to file through both car B &amp; C's insurances and let them fight it out. 2. Car C's insurance has told me that their policy was cancelled 7 days prior to the accident. They asked if I still wanted to make a claim and I told them I'd get back to them. 3. Car B is listed as insured via ""general insurance"", with no contact info. They do have a policy # listed (ex: ##-ST-#######).  My goal here is to get cash to cover the damage to my vehicle. Its mostly cosmetic, so will affect re-sale, but I don't otherwise care as long as it drives OK.  What is the best outcome for me to pursue here? Does having a cancelled insurance policy mean I need to pursue them civilly? Is ""general insurance"" a normal thing; it seems shady since I have no contact info or ways to file a claim against it (that I know of).  Thanks in advance!"	No
588	Hi,  Like the title states - the previous tenants in our apartment left a big couch, some tables, and some assorted bedroom furniture.  During the course of our lease, our building changed hands and now our new landlord is threatening to withhold our security deposit if we don't move the furniture out of the apartment.  We've moved out everything we own, but it'd be a huge pain in the ass to move out the other furniture (specifically the ancient, heavy couch) down 2 flights of stairs. Are we obligated to move this out? Or can we assert that we're leaving the apartment in the same state we got it in?	No
589	When I was 16, I thought I was in an online 'relationship' with a 35 year old. I was in a bad place - I was lonely and sheltered. And he gave me lots of attention. I gave him naked pictures and videos to satisfy him. This went on for 3 years (met him online at 15, broke up at 18).   When we broke up, he texted me to tell me he'd released all my photos/videos. I told him I'm calling the police. He got cold feet and said he was only angry, and had done nothing. He revealed he had kids and would focus on them and leave me alone. Of course, he didn't stick to this - he continued to fuck with me, telling me I'd ruined his life etc. He was prone to obsessive anger. I became afraid, as I was just beginning my life.   I changed my name, my number and deleted all online profiles. I'm in my twenties now. I slowly came out of that shell and made a LinkedIn and Facebook. I forgot about him.  He found me again. I know it's him. He has the same patterns in typing and habit.  I got a text from a stranger (again in the middle of the night, asking me how I was. They gave a bogus name. So I said I was a Tom from another town. He apologised and left me alone.  The next night, he messages asking 'how wasn't your graduation tom?'. Which is too coincidental. I ask who it is - he replies that he knows who I really am, and tells me my actual name. He says I'm doing his head in, and God help me when he sees me. And that we will meet soon.  He doesn't respond to other messages.   Now I'm scared. I want to go to the police, but I'm afraid to set him off. He's been following me for 5 years. And I have little evidence of his grooming as I had to delete it all.  All I have are the threatening messages. And a picture of his face and dick. I don't have the pictures I sent him.  This guy has worked in law and he terrifies me. He has it in for me. I changed my name once, and went into hiding. I don't want to live in fear again. I just made something of myself...I'm just beginning my career. And I have these naked pictures hanging on a thread..  Can you please advise on what I ought to do?  **TLDR: I was groomed online at age 16-18 years old, by a man in his 30s. I do not have evidence of this, due to very intrusive parents and a will to move on. I changed my name and moved to a different city. The man was very obsessive, and has stalked me for 5 years, without my knowing. I know this as a stranger has made contact, displaying very similar patterns to the groomer. He is also very angry, and has threatened to hurt me. I am incredibly scared. I don't know what to do, as he has a huge stash of my naked pictures and videos. I am afraid he may release them if I trigger him. Please help**	No
590	I tried searching online, but couldn't find any answers. My [23f] cousin [16f] is about to get her first job. She's already told me her mom has said she will get $20 a month to do what she wants with. The rest of the money will be put into an account only her mother has access to. Her mom is in a lot of debt and did the same thing with her older child. She does not spend the money on bills, she goes out to eat, gets new pets, and always has a different car. My cousin doesn't want her mother anywhere near her hard earned money.   Am I able to set up a bank account for my cousin? It would be only her work checks (and any babysitting money) put into the account. I would have access, but I have no intention of using her money. Is there a way where only she could have access?   Am I opening myself up to legal trouble by interfering with my aunts plans for the money?  I'm also looking into the possibility of her moving in with me due to family issues (specifically her mom), and I don't want to look bad in the eyes of the law when I just want to help her.   Thanks for any advice you have, I really appreciate it.	No
591	"As stated above, I am getting married and we are both signing a prenup. I don't come from any significant money, but my partners parents own several successful businesses that will eventually be passed down to her (she manages them currently). I have no problem signing a prenup excluding me from any inheritance or spousal support (I make good money, and have a good career), and my ""almost"" wife and I make very good income combined. Is there any legal shenanigans I should watch out when looking over this agreement? I obviously want to protect myself as well in the event that we get divorced. I am mostly looking for suggestions for things easy to overlook, before I sign I will go see a lawyer to look over it with me of course.  Thanks in advance!"	No
592	I am a social media employee for a venue in northern California. Normally, we have cheap local bands come in and perform. All our concerts are free, used to gather the community together. Recently we had a singer who is actually signed to a label come and perform. Nothing big, but I want to use his performance in an ad. He performed both his own songs and more popular songs. Legally speaking, what music copyrights might I be breaking?	No
593	My brother and his ex were never married and have been together for 6 or 7 years. They have 3 children and have lived in Iowa all throughout their relationship. They split up a couple months ago and had been sharing custody without any official agreement. She just left and took the kids, she is currently on her way to Georgia. What are his rights.  Where will a custody battle take place?	No
594	I am shocked and embarrased and upset right now. I have no idea what to do. This is my first offense ever and the only way I can expunge my record is if I wait two years. I'm 17 and a senior in high school and was planning on applying to Ivy League but now that's obviously not going to happen. I have no idea what to do to move past this.	No
595	My daughter (age 7) lives in Minnesota with her father. I live in Washington state. We originally lived in Washington together, moved to Minnesota together into his father's house, and then I came home after I had difficulty finding a job, in order to get a job here and save money so we could afford to get our own place in Minnesota because his father did not like having me and all of my other children there (I have 5 other children).   The agreement between my ex and I was that our daughter would stay there with him because his father is ill and he wanted her to have a chance to form a relationship with him. That was 3 years ago. I ended the relationship with him after I came back. We never married and never established a parenting plan or any official custody or anything. He claims I wouldn't win anything in court because he lives on a reservation and tribal court always favors the Native child staying with the Native family.   I say the tribal court doesn't have jurisdiction because he doesn't live on the reservation affiliated with the tribe he's actually registered with and that any custody proceedings would be in standard Minnesota courts. Regardless, I haven't seen my daughter in 3 years and when I schedule time to call and talk to her, he often doesn't answer the phone or isn't home. I haven't spoken to her since January.   I've offered to fly out there to see her but he usually makes some excuse about why it's not a good time. I'm fed up and frustrated and I have no protection because we have nothing established in court about my rights to have access to her. What do I do?	No
596	Hey now, So I wanted to move out of my apartment for 3 months of summer so I could go to europe. Well, I put an ad on facebook for someone to take over my lease for 3 months. We're not really allowed to do it at the apts I live in so we just agreed to have him pay me directly.   we didn't have a contract or anything. But I've got texts and so forth.   He paid the first two months, 500 each month, but i was gone the first two weeks of this month (july) and it's been difficult getting him to pay me.   Is there anything I can do to make sure that he pays the last month before he leaves?   I have his phone number but I dont know where he's moving to next.	No
597	Hi, I've been contracting full-time for a local firm. Recently they hired a new contractor who insists that they, their, and they're be used as the person's pronouns. The person also does not want to be referred to as man, or guy.   Though I don't mind trying to use said pronouns, it got me wondering about the legal rights an individual has to insist on using specific pronouns in a work environment. NYC if it makes a difference.	No
598	Hello, On July 7th I had my grandson over for a week. My property had a large population of feral cats who were extremely aggressive. I killed or trapped at least 5, and the rest eventually stopped coming around my area. I still received visits from the neighbors cat who lived several acres away) who wears a green collar. As well as an occasional feral cat.   On July 7th I was watching a western movie when my wife yelled at me to come help her through the screen door. I rushed on to my deck to see what was going on. My wife was bleeding from the hand, and the neighbors cat was hissing at her. The hairs on the its back were standing up, and it looked pissed. The cat stood blocking me and my wife from my grandson The cat swiped in our direction then slowly walked in the direction that my grandson was in as he cried. I drew my .45 (note I had it in a concealed holster, which I have a license for) and fired 3 shots into the cat, who died.   I then obviously called my wife and ambulance. She had to get several stitches, it was a whole mess. The police filed a report notified the neighbor, and now the neighbor is threatening to sue me. Claiming that her cat was docile and was not violent.   What are my options? Am I at fault here?	No
599	"Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.   As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her.   I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked.   When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me.   Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes.   and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record.   There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.  Thank you. TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it."	No
600	"I've had custody of my niece for 3 years. My sister was involved in a horrific car accident and sustained a brain injury to her right frontal lobe (regressed in mental age to a teenager). She developed a crippling heroin addiction and I eventually took custody of my niece.  My sister got pregnant 3 times within a 4 year timeframe and lost 2 children due to her addiction. My sister had recently ""got clean"" although she's still taking suboxone regularly with an infant at home. We had to block her number because she kept calling and cussing at my niece/her daughter when she didn't hear what she wanted. We've blocked her number, but now she's sending letters without return addresses.   I want to adopt my niece, but I don't think my sister well simply relinquish her rights.

601	Hi Reddit,  My wife and I have decided to separate due to unforeseen circumstances. (She left me for another fellow).  Anyways, I need help.   So I've spoken with a family lawyer and she gave me a bunch of papers for both of us to fill out regarding our financial situations. Including the last 3 years of tax returns.   We are going to both sign an unofficial separation agreement that I've drawn up. Once done I'll hand that to my lawyer to draw up an official agreement.   We are being surprisingly rational to each other and I want to know if this financial paper BS can be waived and we can just simply sign an official separation agreement and be on our ways.   We both think it's a waste of time and I was told once the official agreement was drawn up, she will still have to retain a lawyer of a different firm to explain it to her.   We just have the desire to end this as quickly and painlessly as possible.  Lawyers ain't cheap.   If you need more information let me know.   All responses are appreciated.	No

603	Hi I have some confusion regarding a leasing situation. Ill start with some background info before getting into the details. I signed a 1 year lease with an LLC, in 2015 from august 1st to July 31st. I renewed the lease last year for another year ending July 31st 2017. I sent an email with my notice to terminate the lease on May  2017. Now this is were the issue comes in to play. Last night my roommate sent an email to the landlord with a few general questions about deposit and other moving out related things. She replied that she had no idea that we were moving out and has started with demands that we need to pay rent for august and September.  Now some details from this point on I will refer to the landlord as B and my roommate as J. In 2016 B emailed us a lease renewal document on the June 1st, it had 2 options a check box to renew the lease or a box to terminate lease and vacate at end of the contract. It had a due date of June 5th. Because of this i thought that we needed to provide 60 days notice of intent to terminate the lease. Fast forward to May. After discusions with my gf and J I decided that i would not be renewing the lease. To give B plenty of notice, I sent the email stating my intent to terminate the lease on May 10th, 2017. The email was written as follows:  subject re Tractor   Hi B, I was wondering if you had an update on the mower? I would also like to inform you that I will not be renewing the lease. I met a wonderful women and I will be moving in with her. Last I checked J did not have plans to renew please double check with him.   Regards,  Now I know the email was received and opened on the same day because B replied with an update on the mower. So i assumed she read the whole email since it was 4 sentences. I forwarded that email to B showing her that i did provided notice. upon receiving that email B changed her demands from Aug and Sept rent to that the lease states the tenant must provide 90 days notice and that the lease automatically renewed.  this is what the lease states about renewal: 22. LEASE RENEWAL: A. At the end of this Lease Agreement, Tenant shall have the option to renew the Lease for an additional term that is equal to the initial term of this lease (Term of Lease Agreement) pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein.  B. If Tenant or Landlord does not wish to renew the Lease, written notice must be given to the other party at least 90 days before the end of the term (Term of Lease Agreement) to terminate the Lease (including any exercised renewal or extension thereof).  I understand that I only provided 82 days of notice.  Finally to my questions. Does the section of the lease above actually automatically renew? i understand that it gives me the option to renew and states how to go about terminating the lease but never mentions auto renewal. Since she only required 60 days last year and never sent a renewal email this year do I have some kind of case based on confusion and lack of notification from the Landlord? What should i do and expect from here?  Thanks for your time and advise	No
604	My brother and I recently created a card game (it's awesome). We were wondering the best way of going about protecting the game itself as well as the images and logos used in the game. We have also used stylized drawings of world leaders (not referring to specific images) which our research shows is fine but please let us know if you know otherwise. We have had the prototype printed which I believe gives us immediate copyright. Please let us know what is the best way to go about this. Thank you.	No
605	A friend of mine is on the run right now. Her mother tried to shoot her, and threatened to kill her little sister if she goes to the police. She's the only witness. Obviously she has to go to the police: what does she tell them so they lock the mother up and ensure her and her sister's safety? She's the only eyewitness right now. This is after a previous incident of assault after she ran away from home, also unreported no marks remaining. Thank you.	No
606	"At the end of this 3rd year, I was told I had to give termination notice before January. Otherwise I am not actually terminated and my lease renews for a year.  Disappointing, but ok my bad. Months go by and I find a leasetakeover.   But NOW they're telling me I'm actually terminated and can't do a leasetakeover.  They said it was, ""Due to a bug in the system""  Can I be terminated without even signing anything?   If not, am I on grounds to deny being terminated or recieve compensation for this ring around yes/no hassle they've given me?"	No

609	The landlord says that they're waiting to hear back from the fire chief (they have been waiting for days) when we were able to call the city and get an answer in just one minute. It's absolutely required by law where we see that the landlord provide one. We had bought one after landlord told us to get one and we'd be reimbursed but now they're saying they're not going to (yet) because they're not sure that it is actually required.  Now, it's only a ~$30 detector, but the point is the months that we didn't have one due to their incompetence of replacing our CO detector with a smoke detector. Would there be a point of pursuing legal action beyond just getting the CO detector paid for?   Also, who tf knows how many other tenants they're endangering.	No
610	Parents died, I assumed legal guardianship of my teenage brother over a year ago who starts high school this year. Husband and I are about to accept job offers for the Netherlands. Guardianship does not have specific restrictions on anything like this and I am talking with US lawyer this week as well but wanted to post here too.   But any lawyer from Europe or US know requirements for moving with a minor who has no living parents to a country in the EU?   Thanks!	No
611	"Quick backstory: I caught the ex wife cheating and asked for a divorce as a result. She gave a lot of lip service and crocodile tears before she just threw her arms up and went with it. In the agreement towards the marital home, she said that she would keep it. Our divorce decree states the following: ""8. Property Settlement: a. Real Property: Wife shall retain the marital home, located at REDACTED in REDACTED, and shall be responsible for all costs associated with the property, including the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities. Wife shall hold Husband harmless and indemnify him in regard to such liabilities. Husband shall quit-claim the property to the Wife within 14 days of judgment in this matter.""  Handed it over, she said that she would live in the house without issue. States also that my name must come off the house as of Jan 2019. So the mortgage was behind when I left, but I forked over my tax return (about 8k) to cover it, and was told about a week ago that she has no plans to make any future payments. This year she went to Disney World with her new husband, and just spent it there... however she has made every payment up to now, and I want to save my credit, as I just got into the Excellent range and was looking to buy a home once this one sells. For about 6 months, I was told that the house was going to sell. Unbeknownst to me, ex-wife took out a lean, with my name, on the house to bring the payments down. So when she went to sell, the bottom dropped out of the deal when they found the lean. I don't know where the 28k extra came from, but the decision to do this occurred once I signed the quit-claim. Last week, she tells me matter of fact-ly that ""I have no plans to make any more payments,"" since she got knocked up the week she met her current husband, and decided to take extra time off this summer when she could have worked. She DECIDED not to work. Yes. she had another baby, but she told me that ""she only got paid for 4 weeks off."" She also just moved into a 350k house with this guy and put a giant divide between me and the kids. A year ago today she didn't even know this guy.   Any case, I'm tired of the surprises. Surprise! I've been having an affair for 15 months. Surprise! I met some guy last Tuesday and me and the kids are moving in! Surprise! I'm also pregnant! The house I told you I was refinancing to get your name off, didn't get your name off! Surprise! NOW YOUR CREDIT IS GOING TO HIT THE TOILET!  No more surprises. I rented an apartment down the street so I could be with my children anytime, at the drop of a hat, and this woman decided that her tingles were once again, way more important than the relationship her children have to their father. I'm lucky that I have a 50/50 custody agreement, but I don't know what to do.   I spoke with my lawyer, who said that she could not represent me, but that my ex would be in contempt of court. I'm sick of this woman having jurisdiction to screw with my life over and over again. What does contempt of court mean? I asked but it was an inopportune time. This person can physically work, just refuses to because ""she just had a brand new baby"" with her husband and spent all of her money irresponsibly. She is still driving around in a car with my name on it that I help pay for... why can she just tank whatever deal she wants but she can tank her obligations to the martial home? I thought I was being really generous with her to keep her name on it. I had no idea that she was going to get knocked up and walk away from it. Her response to my saying that I will petition the court was ""what is that even going to do for you?"" I also found out that she stole money out of my son's college fund. It was only 1k, but this stuff is getting really old.   Any help that you can muster would be appreciated  Some guy in Connecticut"	No
612	"So there is a guy who for this story i will call ""Tyrone"" who grabed my girlfriend (19F) as she was at the drinkstation at Mcdonalds. She and i used to work there and Tyrone was an aquantence, but without warning today he grabed her, im wondering what we should do. I am going to try my best to get her to file a police report but aside from that what should we do? I belive that it was caught on tape because there is a camera over that area. The people who own this Mcdonalds have covered for an employee in the past who was accused of sexual harassment, so we are not expecting much sympathy from them. I am willing to hire a lawyer for an hour or two to send a threatening letter to the owners, ideally i would like for this guy (he might be a minor, like 16,17,18) to face criminal charges and to lose his job. If you have any questions please let me know, sorry if this is not well put together i am just upset right now."	No
613	"Hi everyone, posting this to get some info about a situation in California.  Thank you in advance for your advice and help!      This is a question about custody over a kid.  I read some links (pasted at the end of my post) in an attempt to answer my question, but I'm hoping to get more info and perspectives here.      Will try and keep things simple in bullet form.  Here is some background:      * Anna and Bob have a daughter Sally (Sally is now 8 years old)      * Anna and Bob were never married, they simply lived together.  Bob is legally not the dad, but is the biological father (Sally has no legal father)       * When Sally was still an infant, Anna left Bob due to emotional abuse (not physical as far as I know) and general unhappiness, and has been raising Sally as a single mom for the last 6+ years (while living with Anna's parents)      * Anna and Bob are on civil, if not amicable, terms.  Bob usually takes Sally out for a day/afternoon once a week.  Sometimes Sally will stay with dad a few days at a time, when mom has to travel      * Anna is single, Bob is now dating and living with a woman Candy who has kids from an prior marriage and when he takes Sally, it is almost always with Candy or to her/their home    * Bob has never paid any kind of child support, whether documented or undocumented.  Bob (currently) has no legal rights or access to Sally, everything is worked out between Anna and Bob on a personal level.  Anna wants Sally to have a dad, so she wants to keep Bob in Sally's life, even though she does not care for Bob at all      Now for recent events:      * Bob's girlfriend Candy recently met Anna, and started interacting with (borderline harassing) Anna (over text and call), and long story short, as a result of those conversations, Anna fears that Candy may be a bad influence on Sally, or may even be trying to poison Sally against her.      * Anna asked Bob to see Sally alone, or at least not let Sally see / interact with Candy.  Need to emphasize that Anna is not doing this to spite or make life difficult for Bob (and certainly not to get child support).  It is out of genuine concern.      * Bob agreed to do so verbally and over text, but Anna has since discovered that Bob is still taking Sally to Candy's or going out with Candy together, just as before      Questions:      * Does Anna have a (legal) right to request Bob not have Sally see Candy?  Would this be a tenable and legal request?      * What are some ways this could play out from a legal perspective if a custody battle ensues?      To elaborate more on why Anna does not want Candy interacting with Sally--there is no apparent threat or evidence of physical harm / danger.  It's simply that Candy is a drama-filled, selfish, and manipulative person so Anna would rather not have her daughter influenced by Candy.  To be honest, there is probably little tangible evidence that ""proves"" Candy would be a bad influence (not even sure how that works legally), but that's just how Anna feels as a mom.  Bob is not necessarily a deceitful or bad person, but is extremely simple-minded, and likely being controlled by Candy, so Anna cannot rely on Bob to shield Sally from potentially bad influence, or even to keep his word about when and how he sees Sally.      I read the info in these two links in an attempt to answer my question      * https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-child-custody-and-visitation-2997637      * http://www.livestrong.com/article/140913-what-rights-do-fathers-have-if-they-are-not-birth-record/       Based on that, I think Bob will have to establish paternity, at which point he can enter a custody battle with Anna.  What are some ways a judge may rule in this case, with all of the factors above?  Any chance for supervised visitation only, or unsupervised, but specifically no contact with Candy?  I am aware that Anna may appear as a jealous mom in court with such a request, but that is not the case.  She was initially happy that Sally could have some semblance of a ""family life,"" but has since discovered that Candy would not be a good ""second mom,"" so I'm just trying to get a read on the situation from the experts here.    Thank you for reading!  Again, any additional help or advice would be greatly appreciated!  Please let me know if more info is needed."	No
