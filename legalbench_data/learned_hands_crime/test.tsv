0	Cops discovered I had been using a fake tag for street parking near where I work. One day a cop approached my car and asked me if I had the fake tag, I said I didn't at the time. He stated that I wasn't in trouble and he just wants to get the tag back....... I agreed to just meet him on the streets I park around later in the week and hand it over to him. So yes, I did something very stupid. Since he knows I had the tag and claimed I still had it and knew about it, would it be best to give it to him? And finally, is there a good possibility I will be arrested for this...	Yes
1	My spouse and I have chose to move back to our home state from LA.  In doing so we had to terminate our lease early.  Our lease was a basic printed out 1 page agreement with our deposit amount and monthly rent and the agreement the land lord would cut the grass as long as we had no animals using it.  When we gave him notice of our intent to terminate the lease he let us know he would keep the deposit.  We told him ok we understood and that since we were paid up to a point we would be moved out by then.    This past weekend my spouse and I moved a trailer full of belongings to our new home and upon return to the home in LA today my spouse found our washer and dryer missing and all our stuff rummaged through and pictures of my spouses daughter who passed away in the trash with other things.  Called the land lord and he said he had Aarons (who we did rent to own with) pick up the washer and dryer for us since we were leaving.... He then threw things out since we abandoned it...... Keep in mind we are paid up to a point that we agreed to leave we were gone for just over 24 hours moving one load of belongings.      These are not the first issues we have had. During our months at this home we paid 1300 a month.  The landlord on more than one occasion let himself in with no notice. He even did so why we were home and the kids were playing just unlocked the door and walked in.  He refused to fix a leaking AC unit that kept soaking the floor at times as well.  He has threatened to throw all our stuff away as well because he has someone who wants the place now...  Also Aarons should have never picked up our stuff for him as he is not on the agreement at all and has no say so on our account.  They disclosed to him as well when picking up the washer and dryer that since that was being forfeited they also needed our kids bunk beds back  that we had already moved and that we owe X amount etc... They disclosed personal information and picked up belongings with out verifying anything or permission to speak with him.  Do we have any action we can take against either the land lord or Aarons?  At this point we are trying to dig through trash to find anything else that was tossed.   The house is in the same or better shape than when we moved in as well.	Yes
2	Hey guys, my grandpa was called today by a scammer telling him my car broke down while I was traveling and that I needed 750$. My poor grandpa sent the money right away without asking my relatives and now can't make rent. What legal action can I take ? He's too afraid to report it since he's not a legal citizen yet, so is there anywhere I can report the number? Or anything I can do on my end? Any help would be appreciated!	Yes
3	I was charged with a few serious but meritless crimes. I did the whole song and dance for over a year and finally everything has been np and now expunged.    I wanted to know how long does the final(?) step of expungement take? I have copies of the signed Expungement Orders from the judge which have been filed (last week) and sent to the state police.    Different attorneys I spoke to in passing gave me answers ranging from 48 hours to 6 months. Does anyone know when these charges will disappear?	Yes
4	Some years back, my gf's brother was charged for possession, but not with enough on him for attmept to distribute, and finished his probation last year.  Today, officers pulled him over, charged him with the same thing as before and arrested him, took about $1,000 from his wallet, impounded his car and threatened not to return it to him.  He had his pistol registered in his name with him, but I'm not entirely sure if he can have one legally. Either way, they confiscated that too.  They set his bail for about $300. Can they really keep his car or the $1,000?	Yes
5	There is a video of a woman, who is antireligious, drawing a picture of Muhammad.  And in the comments there was  a guy who found her address where she lives, and another man wrote 3 days ago that he is going to her address to address kill her because she drew the cartoon.  Im from Scandinavia, and i dont know how to report this to the police in LA. Maybe im overdramatic, but eeeh... am i really? For some reason i think this is quite important to report. Any tips?	Yes
6	"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	Yes
7	Got caught with a drink at a bar and i'm underage (18) the cop took me outside, wrote up a citation and left a number for me to call for a diversion program before she sent me on my way. I was also given a court date. If that number can't help me and I go to court, what punishment should i expect? Do i need a lawyer? I violated section 4301-69(e).

8	Hello Reddit,  I am a 21 year old male with no prior criminal record living in New York. I was recently charged with petit larceny for stealing a pair of sunglasses from a store I worked at. I returned the glasses the next day without ever being asked to because I didn't feel right taking them. Later that day I was pulled aside by Loss Prevention and told they have everything on camera. They brought me down to a detainment cell where I waited for the police and was given a field arrest for petit larceny. I am very nervous and afraid for myself because I wasn't raised to do things like this. I hope I didn't mess my future up.  My questions are these:  1) Will this stay on my record?  2) If so, how can I get it taken off 3) What implications does this hold for my future? 4) As a college student I don't have very much money, is a court appointed lawyer good enough to handle this? 5) What course of action should I take when handling this situation?	Yes
9	"I just opened a letter containing a warrant for not attending the court mandated, ""Mothers Against Drunk Driving"" class. It's not a good excuse, but the deadline slipped my mind as I've been focused on completing my 3 month DUI program (weekly group sessions, 6 weekly education classes, 3 AA meetings). In fact, I'll be done with the program this Friday.  I called a bail bonds place and he said they could put the bail ahead of time or something like that, where they would schedule a court date. But he also mentioned for a misdemeanor warrant, he doesn't expect I would have to do any jail time.   My question: what should I expect going to court tomorrow? The letter states to come in at 8:30 Monday-Friday. If I try to handle it without the bail bond and try to show up at the court and attempt get and extension with a public defender, will I be arrested on the spot? I'm just struggling for cash, so I want to know if paying the bail bonds place ahead of time is absolutely necessary."	Yes
10	A friend of mine is facing a serious felony assault charge, his lawyer told him he may be able to plead down to a lesser assault but it could go to jury where he is risking 2-8 year prison term. He asked the lawyer about if a person leaves the state for the coast since he hasn't been served a warrant. The lawyer said if he did he would never be extradited but would spend 30 days in jail and released basically any time he got a ticket. He also said that once this happens a clock starts and that after seven years there would be a statute of limitations. This doesn't sound correct to me, but if that's true it honestly seems better than risking his life being ruined. Any legal experts here that can verify this? Thanks. He is from Ohio.	Yes
11	As the title says, my girlfriend made a huge error in judgement the  other day and tried to  only pay for some of the makeup she had gotten off the shelf. She has a spotless record and is even hoping to  work for a very well known animation company and park. She immediately knew she'd made an awful and idiotic mistake and is completely remorseful. I'm trying my best  to help her through this with as little damage as possible to her employ-ability and record. What steps should I take, should I be out looking for an attorney? Any questions  I should know to ask? Any help is appreciated, thank you all for your time.	Yes
12	(Portland, OR) My transgender partner and I got into an argument. The argument continued to escalate to the point where I made a really horrible comment invalidating her gender. In response to this, she lunged at me and started punching me, pulling me down to the ground and beating me with a broomstick. I managed to constrain her and make my way out of the apartment. I called 911 and they arrested her.  When the police arrived, I made the mistake of talking to police who recorded a statement (I was completely jostled and nearly out of it when he was asking me questions). My apartment management also convinced me to call the DA and give them the case number. I have not yet been contacted by a prosecutor.  I do not wish to follow through with prosecution. While in this one instance she initiated the attack, I believe there has been a mutual pattern of abuse in our relationship. There have been times when I have yelled at her or made physical contact (such as grabbing her and trying to force her out of the room or pushing her when she was in my face). Usually this happens after we have been arguing and it quickly devolves into shouting matches. We are both to blame for raising our voices, talking over one another and escalating these arguments. We both say horrible things to one another. It's just a mutually abusive relationship that I want both of us to be out of because we've tried it for so long and it does neither of us any good.   tldr; me and transgender girlfriend got in fight, she was arrested for domestic assault, I called DA with case number. What can I do to have them drop charges / not continue with case?	Yes
13	The card was expired so the transaction didn't go through. The address the person used is very close to where I live. I would like to report this, but I'm not sure where to start. Is this a lost cause?	Yes
14	Alright. I was caught shoplifting at BesbtBuy as the title says, I need to know what steps to follow.  I attempted to steal a $78 dollar charger for a macbook pro, I am 17 and about to turn 18 in about a month in a half, this is my first offense ever. If you plan on telling me that I am stupid, I know, I feel like a dumbass and honestly wish I didn't have legs so I couldn't even have gotten there in the first place.   I was caught, detained by LP, and sat there for two hours. Mall security was there. I signed two pieces of paper, I don't remember exactly what they said. One was agreeing/acknowledging I was banned and I don't remember what the other was. I honestly would have signed away my left arm if they had asked me to, I was and am really shaken up.   I admitted to stealing to the LP and mall security, I realize after reading posts that I shouldn't have.   Currently it seems that I will be charged as they have no reason not to. My family can't afford an attorney, much less stuff like heat or wifi half the time.   It currently seems the best bet is to plea not guilty, ask for a public defender and then leave it in the hands of the PD to cut me a deal.   I am wondering if this is the correct course of action and what other options are available. I am freaking out because just one moment of pure idiocy seems to have put my life in such a shitty position that could ruin it. Thanks for any help I get in advance.	Yes
15	I'm not exactly sure if this is the right thread for this, but I need some insight and don't know where else to go. My boyfriend and I went to hard summer this weekend, and on Saturday he got caught selling ecstasy pills and I got caught in the cross fire. Before entering the event he asking if I could bring in his ecstasy pills ( 7 pills , Oreos and jacks) for him, I said sure. We made it through security with the pills. About 15 mins later he asks for me to give him the pills , so I hand him the pills, and he walks towards the guy he was going to sell to. They do the sale and my boyfriend gets handcuffed immediately and seconds later I get handcuffed.  We got the exact same charges. Poss of controlled substance, transportation of controlled substance and conspiracy( 3 felonies). Now the only possible charge that is actually reasonable for me is possession because I did have his pills on me. The other 2 are complete BS because I was unaware of the sale and everything else. I literally just brought his pills inside the venue.  I really need some advice here on what to do. Does anyone know any good public defenders in San Bernardino ?   P.s. This was my first time in jail and ever getting arrested, I'm a full time college student and work full time Also please do not lecture me, I know I shouldn't even been around him if he was selling, I just didn't think about all the repercussions.  This is in San Bernardino California	Yes
16	"So. Let it be known right off the bat that I was told by this minor that they were 18 years old on this mobile app called Grindr. Over the course of a few days we are talking, chatting, getting to know each other, the works. For about half a day they block me, but later unblock me saying they had to. Someone ""they had been with"" had caught them on grindr and he had to lay low. Weird, but as they are talking to me again, I assume all is well.  Anyway, as I am speaking to this supposed 18yo, I was also talking to other profiles. We decided to make this fun and invite a third person to this party. One particular profile seemed very interested and wanted to meet up but refused to send a face picture in response to my own picture and a picture of the 18yo. Eventually I tell this Faceless account to shove it after them giving me the run around. I was stupid. I sent Faceless my own face picture, as well as my cell number. I block them on grindr and just agree to meet the 18yo at a hotel they are already at because of a ""friend's party.""  I arrive at the hotel and am told to go somewhere. By this time I receive a Facebook message request. I ignore it. I continue driving around looking for 18yo. Don't find him. Eventually I get fed up and start recording on my phone of my current location, trying to get 18yo to give me better directions. Keep in mind this entire time I am texting 18yo over Facebook messenger, I have also sent the pics and videos of my location through FB messenger.  Then, the 18yo's messages bubble tells me that I can no longer reply to the conversation. I've been blocked. Huh, odd. I go to their FB profile and can still view it. I log into a secondary FB account and navigate to his profile, and that I cannot start a chat with him with this secondary account. The 18yo has not blocked me, but disabled messenger.  I finally look at my message requests, and find that this stranger has messaged me:  ""I'm calling [Local Police Force] right now. Reporting you for trying to have sex with a minor.""  Initially confuaed, but with a slow frightening realization, I book it. Haul ass off hotel grounds and take the long way home  This took place an hour and a half ago.  If what this stranger says is true, I could be charged with solicitation of a minor. I repeat again I was not aware that I was talking to a minor. No where in any of our conversations was there a number other than 18.  Redditors of r/legaladvise. Assuming that this"	Yes
17	"I listed an item for sale on the app LetGo for $300. I received a full price offer and provided my PO Box for payment. Since then I've had several red flags.   * The buyer asked for my phone number for the check, and since we've been communicating via text. The buyer has used two different phone numbers.  * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment.   * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.  * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.  * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.  * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.  Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.  Aside from not cashing the check what is my legal obligation at this point?  I've googled the credit union in GA and am considering calling them tomorrow to alert them.  In addition should I take the check to the police? Right now all i have is the check, the LetGo user information, and the two phone numbers the scammer used."	Yes
18	Some background information:  My parents were going through a divorce a couple years back and I got into an argument with my dad that escalated and ultimately resulted in me being arrested for simple assault domestic violence charge. I was 17 at the time and was tried as an adult since this was a few years before this 2014 bill had passed:   https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/19/house-raises-juvenile-delinquent-age/VP9KkZXfccwnOJ4EIsNNaN/story.html  The charge was subsequently reduced to an infraction which I plead guilty to. Now that the juvenile delinquent age is 18, are those records from before I was 18 expunged?   I'm thinking about pursuing a medical career in the future and am afraid that the regretful events of my past may become an issue.	Yes
19	"Hello, I am a 23 year old male with no past criminal or any legal history. I was camping with friends in Acadia National Park in the state of Maine and we bone-headedly didn't realize that the land inside the park is federal and not part of Maine. We were caught with a small amount of weed and given US District Court Violation Notice that charges me with 36 CFR 2.35 (b) (2), ""possession of a controlled substance marijuana."" The park ranger repeatedly told me it was an ""infraction"" that would not appear on public record if I simply pay the fine to the Central Violations Bureau as documented in the notice. Is this true? Ive been reading online and have gotten conflicting information. Will this show up on my criminal record? What impact could it have on my professional-life or future? I am also planning on getting a 1 hour legal consultation. What would be the best ways of finding a good lawyer to talk to about this? Also I plan on calling the Central Violations Bureau tomorrow. Are there any specific questions that would be good to ask them? Sorry for all the questions I'm just really nervous about this. Thank you, for taking the time to read this and any help I receive!"	Yes
20	I got a ticket for having a dog without a leash a few weeks ago. I'm new to Texas and have no idea how tickets work here but apparently I don't have a set court date yet. Is this even worth fighting? It's a $500 fine, which sucks, but I can manage. I'm more concerned with this being a misdemeanor and causing me to have a criminal record. I have no prior criminal history except for a handful of traffic tickets years ago in another state. Would it be worth contacting a lawyer? What kind of lawyer do I look for and what's the best way to pick one?	Yes
21	My neightbor has spying on me for like 3 years and harassing me. He complains about my garbage cans and my dogs. The other day I turned on my tv with my tablet in my lap and saw my own face on the tv for a split second before it changed to the show. My neighbor is using the camera on my ipad and brodcasting it. I called the police but they said theres no evidence. Can a lawyer prove it and make him stop?	Yes
22	I'm in desperate need of some help.  I am a 19 year old male who lives in Australia and I'm in a really bad situation and I don't know what to do.  2 weeks ago my girlfriend came over to my place to hang out for the night. Everything started off ok and I became pretty drunk after a few hours and I remember she helped me into the bedroom. Then all I really remember is waking up to find her on top of me with my arms tied to the headboard. I shoved her off and asked her what the fuck she was doing. That's when she told me if I tell anyone she will report me for raping her.  I don't know what to do, I feel disgusting I feel ashamed I have become so severely depressed I don't want to live anymore.  I want to report, I badly want to report her. But I know she will say I did it.  What do I do?	Yes
23	I was walking out with merchandise in my hand. I past the last point of sale but did not exit the building, three security guards tackle me then two grab my arms while the third chocks me out and I'm begging for my life this happens for about two or three minutes. When the cops come and review the footage the one who chocked me out is cited for aggravated assualt. Is there anything I can do?	Yes
24	I am on probation for a dui. Im done in 2 weeks.  On thursday i drank which im not supposed to but cops came to drop me off at my house. Apparently i was very compliant and they were very nice to me.    According to my boyfriend, they were just worried about my safety. I do not have a drivers license but i have a state ID.   Apparently i refused medical attention so they just gave me a ride home. They did not breathalyze me either.   I am of legal drinking age and the cops said i did nothing illegal and i was not arrested or given a ticket and my state id was given back to me.   I am on probation. But i do not recall them being aware of that. Unless they checked it later after they dropped me off.   My PO did not call the following day. What are the chances that i got away with this? I think the cops were just trying to be nice people and drive me home.  What do you think?	Yes
25	"7 of my friends went camping on a Monday night, I had work unfortunately. They were camping at a site where camping isn't allowed but many people camp there anyways. After being there for a few hours, a man and woman came to the camp site and held a gun(later revealed to probably be a pellet gun) to the back of my friends head. He started saying things like, ""Are you prepared to die?"" And remained there pointing the gun from person to person for about 10 minutes. From this I have found out his name and I am wondering what sort of action, preferably legal, we should take against him. Is there anything we can do considering they were camping illegally?"	Yes
26	Hi. So I was charged with one count of felony embezzlement from my previous employer. I stole $429.12 which I know seems oddly specific, but I worked at an animal hospital and tried to make it seem like someone had returned merchandise for this amount and the returned the amount onto my debit card. I was desperate for money (I still am) and used it to pay bills, get my cars oil changed, gas, food...nothing really important at all. Well come the next day, my boss noticed that something was off with the transactions from the day before. She started asking all of us up front a lot of questions and I panicked. I left work right in the middle of my shift and drove away. I then called and texted her asking if we could meet somewhere out of the hospital. I told her I took the money and she seemed surprised actually. She said she would have to tell the owner of the hospital and she would let me know by Monday (8/28) what the owner decided to do. She never got back to me, so I called her the next day which was this morning to ask. She said she filed the report and thought there was a warrant out for my arrest. I freaked out and started sobbing because I've never been in legal trouble before and my record is clean up until now. I called the district attorneys office to see if the warrant was indeed true, and she said yes and to go to the magistrates office. I did, and they all seemed surprised but kind of nice about the whole thing. I was crying this whole time and didn't know the charge was embezzlement until they had me do fingerprints and talk to the magistrate. The magistrate released me on an unsecured bond of $1500, which means I got to walk away without paying anything. He set my preliminary court date for tomorrow at 9am. I am freaking out because I didn't have time nor the money to get an attorney. I called the public defenders office and they said it takes 5-10 days to get my application approved for one and that I can ask for one tomorrow at my hearing. The problem is I wanted a lawyer to help me tomorrow since I have no idea what I'm doing. My grandmother told me to plead not guilty since a felony like this will be on my record indefinitely and basically screw me out of any job prospects which I cannot afford to not work hence the whole embezzlement thing...I just don't know what to do. Any help or advice is appreciated as to what is going to happen tomorrow	Yes
27	"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	Yes
28	I'm not too sure on the details but someone close to me was raped around 4 years ago with the person that they lived with. From my understanding the rape was never violent, but the attacker was repeatedly told no and to stop during the attack. Also the attacker would regularly use alcohol to the extent where my friend would be drunk to the point of passing out (so unable to consent) repeatedly. Attacker has also been slightly violent during arguments (old scars to prove it). Is there anything that can be done?   Also my friend had filed a police report years ago but nothing came of it, my friend believes the police were too lazy to investigate and she never tried again.	Yes
29	This happened before states began to outlaw student teacher relationships even if the student was over the age of consent.  Essentially, when I was going through a rough time emotionally, I began receiving a lot of extra attention from a teacher. It started innocently and then progressed to emails, followed my phone calls, then texts, then flirting, some sexting and sending him pictures of me in skimpy negligees. When I graduated high school (he was still my teacher for a summer session) we began to go out on dates. He then came to my college to take control of the department I was majoring in and remained my teacher throughout college (we maintained a relationship during this time).   Now with all of the new legislation and scandals being unearthed (like the choate one) I'm wondering if I have an obligation to report this to someone (the school, his current employer which still has him around students all the time etc). I don't want to get him in trouble because I do still care about him and as far as I'm aware he didn't break any laws (except possession of child porn when I sent the negligee pics (if they count) but they are long gone from all of my electronic devices (this was before the cloud etc).   See the thing is, I don't know if what he did was wrong/ illegal. My therapist (when I was 17 and involved with him) told me to cut ties but never reported him. My guidance counselor at school knew because the man in question didn't have a drivers license so I drove him one on one to the practice he had at another school after ours was over and I once told my guidance counselor I may be late because of driving him and she said it was inappropriate but never followed up. I don't like thinking I was groomed or a victim (though he was emotionally abusive once he had me in the relationship).   I also have proof/know he did this with at least four other students.  So, if it happens in the future and I don't report it am I liable for what happens to any further students he becomes involved with?   Do I have a legal obligation to report it to the schools he works for?  I need to know if there's anything I need (or should) do from a legal standpoint.   I don't want to press charges (I can't he did nothing illegal with me) and I don't want to get him in trouble but I also don't want any other students to go through what I did and I what I know others did because of his narcissism (he's diagnosed) and emotional abuse.  Yes, I am in therapy for this and working through it and I know it's messed up that I care for him but I do. I just need to know what my legal obligations are.	Yes
30	"Something that made me think a bit recently.   What if a person is looking for ""Chile"" and autocorrect or a mistake makes it to ""child"". Or what if someone searches for ""kind girl"" (because the person might remember that ""kind"" was in the title) without knowing that ""kind"" means ""child"" in German?  It's obvious that no one would really search for this disgusting stuff on renowed websites like Pornhub but how does Pornhub react, if they see that someone allegedly searched for it and how can you prove, that it wasn't your fault?"	Yes
31	I was involved in a road rage incident in which someone fired shots directly at my vehicle as I was driving down the road- one of the rounds hit my car, less than a foot away from me. The perpetrator was arrested immediately and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. It is a cut and clear case and I believe that this person will be convicted.  I am far from what you would call a proponent of pursuing damages in court, but I believe this individual intended to harm me (or worse). I was extremely shaken up directly after everything happened, but went on about my business as usual after providing my statement to the police, etc. It scared the hell out of me, naturally, but I never expected to have any further problems. Unfortunately, ever since the incident occurred, I have had persistent nightmares and experience panic attacks almost daily. I have missed nearly two weeks of work. I think most people would consider me to be a fairly realistic and level-headed person, but there have been times where I've been afraid to even leave my house due to the admittedly paranoid misapprehension of my assailant stalking me with the intention of harming me. I get anxious every time I see the same kind of vehicle the assailant was driving or if I hear a car backfire, etc.  Basically, I am dealing with quite a lot of unexpected mental woes stemming from an event that was more traumatic than I initially realized. I've given this a lot of thought and I have yet to come to a final decision, but I'd like to know what steps I should take in the event that I do elect to take legal action against my assailant.	Yes
32	I'm in Ireland so this doesn't really regard me, but I saw that in Montana, intimidation is defined as follows:   &gt;(1) A person commits the offense of intimidation when, with the purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, the person communicates to another, under circumstances that reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out, a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts:      (a) inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person;     (b) subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or     (c) commit any felony.   My question is would a threat of violence, for example, count as self-defensive intimidation if it in turn provably prevented potential physical violence from taking place?  We're a few pints deep, and clearly this isn't urgent, but if someone could clear up this semi-drunken debate we're having it would be much appreciated.	Yes
33	Someone filmed me having sex through my window. My university conducted interviews to get more information, and I have the transcripts from those interviews which pretty clearly point to who was responsible for taking the video. Is there any action I can take against that person? Can I take action against the people who viewed the video and didn't report it? Should I take it to the police? Does it matter that I don't have access to the video?	Yes
34	When I was 17 or so I got an internal possession of alcohol violation, came with a $344 fine. Then when I was 19, i was just chilling with a few buddies at a small fire drinking a few beers and cops showed up for I have no idea why. Well I got a  second internal possession charge (after admitting to drinking which I should've avoided I now know but too late for that). That came with a $750 fine and a license suspension of 2 months. The event wasn't driving related whatsoever but I guess that's just how NH rolls, pretty unfortunate, lost my delivery driving job. Anyways, I'm 23 now turning 24 and it's still affecting me in slight ways. Two years ago worked for a company and would have been able to drive one of the trucks (making a few more bucks an hour) until the company found out it'd jack up their insurance having me on it, because of these unrelated to driving charges. My then boss was very skeptical because he thought I had been drinking and driving and said I should've been straight up with him until I cleared it up and told him the story. Anyways, couldn't drive there. Then this summer, i got a job landscaping and AGAIN am not able to be put on to my bosses insurance because it would jack his insurance up leading to me not being able to drive any of his company trucks. I for one think it's completely unfair that these nondriving related charges can affect me so much, but that's beside the point. Getting to the point, are these violations ever going to go away or stop affecting me? The officer who I argued with about my second violation said it would in no way affect me and all I'd get was a fine.	Yes
35	"I was arrested approx. 12 months ago due to DUI. However, I blew barely above the legal limit, and only failed the field sobriety test because it was extremely cold outside and I was shivering, something the officer noted in the police report. On my court date, the cold, along with discovery that the breathalyzer was far past calibration date resulted in the DUI being dropped and I received a ""Failure to Reduce Speed"" charge. As my lawyer explained it, this was very good because usually if the DUI gets dropped, which is rare, you receive a Reckless Driving. Regardless, my license was suspended due to the DMV being a separate entity as I understand it. My question now is, I've now graduated college and am applying for serious jobs that inquire about previous arrests and such. Is there a particular way to go about explaining what happened? I will definitely seek legal advice in person ASAP, was just curious what Reddit would advise. Thanks!"	Yes
36	"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.  Last night, I was getting off of work at around 11:30pm.  I received a text from a former HS friend that he was stranded and needed a ride.  I don't hang out with this kid, virtually ever, and I haven't really even spoke to him much as of recent.  In all honesty, since HS really...  But I did run into him over the weekend, which is how we re-touched base and he mentioned to me that he was going through a bit of a rough patch, and to top it all off, didn't have a car because it was in the shop.  He texted me an address, and I figured since I was heading back toward that area it wouldn't help to pick the kid up.  I'm generally a very nice guy, sometimes too nice maybe.  Anyway, not within 45 seconds, as we were pulling away, a cop starts tailing me.  I turned once, and as soon as we approached a stoplight, his sirens go off.  Now initially I was a little confused, I wasn't sure why we were being pulled over.  Immediately my friend to the right of me goes ""aw fuck.""   Apparently, he had some weed on him (not much, 4-5 grams), and ""forgot about it"" until the cop was right behind us with his sirens on.  So, I tried to stay calm.  I figured maybe this was just a fluke, a coincidence; that I had made a rolling stop or whatever.  Well, before I could even think the officer was asking me to step out of my vehicle.  He also KNEW the kid that I was with BY NAME, immediately, and wasn't surprised when he saw him in my car (which makes me realize that he probably saw me pick him up).  Still, I tried to stay collected.  I felt that I personally didn't have anything to hide, and while I was very nervous, I was calm in the fact that if I explained to the officer my situation, I wouldn't be the one in trouble.  Then he informed me that the area in which I picked him up in was one of the ""heavier areas for narcotics trade in the city.""  Immediately my heart sank and I realized that I may have been in some deeper shit than I had imagine.   Well, he asked to search my car.  Initially I told him I felt it wasn't necessary, to which the cop to the next of him IMMEDIATELY rings in the K9 unit.  I have a vast amount of respect for law enforcement.  I have many close friends who are police officers, and my uncle himself was a cop back in the day.  I didn't want them to have to waste their time and resources for this crap, so I changed my response.  I told the officers that after what I had heard about the area in which I picked my friend up, I became a little hesitant as I did not know what my friend had on him.  (I DID not rat him out, I'm not a fucking rat)  So, they searched my car.  My friend was taken out, they searched him too, and found nothing....  Which is when it hit me.  The guy left it in my car.  It took not 45 seconds for the cops to find the baggy in my center console, which apparently is where he left it.  And what do you know after this?  The mother fucker tries to pinpoint it on me, yelling phrases like ""OWN UP TO IT BRO, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MINE"" blah blah blah, just a bunch of bullshit.  I still, stayed collective and said nothing.  I was always told growing up that ""the less you say to cops, the better.""  Well, a few seconds after that, I see him take my friend over to the sidewalk, where they empty the baggy out and crush it into the sidewalk (virtually destroying all evidence they had, which confused me).  He then, walked over, pointed at me and said ""you, get out of here.  Go home.""  I don't know how, or why the cop decided to bless me like he did, but jesus you know I got out of there as fast as I could.  I had a little aftershock about it throughout the day, but all in all I'm just very grateful that there truly are a lot of non-asshole cops out there.    I did, however, receive a call from a private number around 8pm this evening.  I didn't answer, as I was working, and they didn't leave a message (however I think my mailbox may have been full as I'm currently applying to different jobs as I intend to finish school in December).  My question is, is there anyway I can still get into any trouble for what happened?  If the private number WAS indeed the police trying to contact me (for whatever reason), what should I do?    Please help, as I may just be incredibly paranoid.  I just want to make sure that I know I'm in the clear from this so I'm not worrying about it over the course of the next 2 weeks.  Thank you"	Yes
37	"TL:DR at the end, plus my questions.  So, he raped me back in 2009, so the statute of limitations has expired from my knowledge. We were really young when it happened. I was 13. My mother had me convinced I wasn't really raped because that was the kind of mother she was back then.   After middle school we went to different high schools, and I thought ""oh cool, I won't ever have to deal with him again."" But alas, he's back.  I work at a big blue box store.   About a year ago I actually sold him cigarettes, I could no longer recognize someone who occasionally haunts my dreams because his face is so poc marked from doing meth.  Now about a month ago I am at the customer service desk, and he strolls up wanting to return something. I look up and he says ""how have you been?"" And smirked at me in a way that said ""yeah, I know I am causing you harm"" so I stammered out ""I'm going to go get my manager"" let her know of the situation and ran to the back room and I wouldn't come out until he left the store.  Today, he was in my store trying to steal stuff. AP said he was twitching like a tweaker, and that he wouldnt stand still because he was over heating. He was eventually deterred and said he ""left his wallet at home"" and would be back for his basket. We totalled up his basket, and it was well over $400 of stuff he was planning on stealing.  So I let AP know that the guy makes me extremely uncomfortable. They told me they can't ban him until he actually steals something, or if I can get a restraining order.  TL:DR man who raped me in 2009 shows up to my store, causes me great mental anguish, and tries to steal from my store. He cannot be banned until he actually steals something, or I get a restraining order.  My questions, can I actually get a restraining order even though the statute of limitations has past? Is it true that consultations with lawyers are usually free? I really need advice. I am scared to go to work."	Yes
38	Edit: Please read the entire thing before passing judgement  Hello, yesterday I was arrested for child endangerment because I took the keys out of the vehicle so we could stop arguing and to make sure I didn't go to jail for domestic abuse. (I was really pissed, it's a long story) yes, it was hot, but my wife was in the vehicle supervising my son. There was no harm to my son, this all happened in 5 minutes give or take. I got back in the vehicle, and offered her the keys, she told me to get out, so I got back out, and was then arrested for child endangerment. I looked at what the statutes are and my son was never unsupervised, and wasn't hurt in any way. (Less than 5 minutes in a vehicle, the AC had been going for a while, and at any time my wife could have taken my son out of the car) and I'm curious why I was arrested?	Yes
39	I hear people are banned from a CDL for life if they have 2 DUIs. But what if You never had a CDL before? Guessing it doesn't make a difference.	Yes
40	I am in Oregon, sister in trouble is in WA. Her public defender is terrible. Our family is kind of shitty, and I have no money for an attorney. She has been waiting for trial for a very complicated case for 2 years. Her court-appointed attorney has ignored all of the resources and advocate options as well as contact info for expert witnesses I have provided. He has condescended to me, yelled at me over the phone. I told him that I will only communicate with him via email.  He has been often rude and aggressive toward her, then seems to have compassion on their next visit. He has told me to send the information and contact info of the people I have spoken to, they have tried to contact him, and no response. I wrote to him and told him she felt bullied and disregarded. He seemed to be on her side for about a month, then back to the roller coaster approach.  She said she has written a letter to the judge and told me it had been ignored. I have so few details, her self-worth is shattered, she has lost her fight. She told her psych doctor she wanted a new attorney and she was condescending and dismissive.  I have contacted another public defender in WA because I think she can switch easily if someone else is willing to step in? That person did not contact me back, and I don’t want to continue barking up the wrong tree. I also am afraid that the next one might be worse.  What might my best strategy be? We have contacted all of the legal aid resources we could find, and have gotten very minimal response.  I really appreciate all of the great info here. Thanks for your time	Yes
41	I was recently involved in an altercation in Seoul, South Korea including 2 of my other friends. We were semi-sober and we were walking home. We accidentally bump into a Korean National and he decides to grab and hold on to one of my friends. I in my right mind was trying to break up the fight by pulling the Korean guy away from my OTHER friend that was punching the guy to let go of the one he has a grasp on. In the video and from what I remember I was just standing around at one point and yelling at the both of the because they were going at it. I ended up being allegedly accused of an assault charge and so did my both of my friends. When in reality only one of us got into an actual fist fight with the guy. He was 30,000,000 Korean Won (which is about 30k roughly) from all 3 of us and all of us being a minor we have no way to compensate. Need advise on what I should do/what could happen to me in this case. Thanks	Yes
42	"[QLD, Australia]  I have pet rats, I know they're not everyone's favourite pet but I care about my pet rats very dearly (try imagine them how you would feel about your pet dog or cat). However I had to go to America for work related stuff and left my rats (2 female) in care of a person who I looked after their dog for 3 months+ when they were on holidays.  I was gone for about 3 weeks, I came back and instead of my rats being in their cage the person had put them in a plastic container with air holes in it. I asked why and they said it was because the rats developed lice- occasionally rats can get lice from things like bedding or saw dust, etc. Then after treatment they put them in the container to apparently limit the rats from potentially getting lice again.  However the container was moist from the rats spilling water and peeing in the container as rats do. Well lo and behold I put the rats back into their clean cage and didn't thing much about it because they didn't look sick. However I had the rats out in my living room for a run, one of them peed on a newspaper and there was a live maggot in the urine patch. I could not believe what happened. Then I picked both of them up at separate times and did the gross thing of ""checking them over"" and one had pus coming out of her urethra with a revolting and strong ammonia smell, while the one that had the maggot come out of her has an inflamed/gapping vag.  I have them both booked in for the vet tomorrow while I'm sincerely worried they're going to die, I know they're easily replacing animals but I don't want them to die and it's costly, also if there's no hope for them I'm going to have to get them put down because I don't want them to die slowly. Apparently they were left in moist plastic container for 2 and a half weeks which obviously caused like a thrush infection of horror on them. I consider this to be animal cruelty and don't know what to do.  I do have text messaging from the person telling me how long they put them in the container for."	Yes
43	I had some misdemeanor charges expunged at the start of the year.  I know at the county level it's complete. They made mention that it can take a bit more time at the state level.  I'm being offered a job and I need to fill out background check info. Im not sure if I should put it on there or not.  I know that some BG check companies 'cache' backgrounds so it might still be listed, but I can't find any info online about my case. The TN site doesn't show anything, but I'm not sure it ever did.  What should I do?	Yes
44	Hi, I am in VA and wanted to know the legality of this situation.  I talk to men on tinder and then direct them to my kik, where i sext and send nudes in return for money, usually $100 per session.  I have the money sent via e gift cards to my email.  Is this legal?	Yes
45	Im in a really bad situation right now, i was caught at my school with possession of marijuana, and the court date is coming up. My family is stressed and they think they are going to be deported because we arent citizens. They think they will be arrested when we arrive at the court, and this was my first offense (im 14) please help, do i just get probation and community service or are we getting kicked out of usa	Yes
46	I run at night because it's summer and can't afford to get a gym membership and I'm not a morning person. Because it's night, I run with pepper spray in one hand and a box cutter in the other. The blade on it isn't any longer than two inches-- very short. But im wondering if I would get in trouble if I got caught running around with an open box cutter, even if its only meant to (maybe) scare off predators while I try to scare off calories	Yes
47	This friend of mine contacted this person and sent exploitative pics to her. This person is now trying to take revenge and is sending these pics to me and my other friends. I worry for my friend's safety and future. What are things he/I can do?  Sorry for bad English. Not first language.	Yes
48	I'd prefer to leave my location out as it is quite a small place and I don't want people knowing about this for obvious reasons. It is in Asia if that helps any and I am willing to PM the country to anyone that asks.  Basically I overheard my brother on the phone mentioning that he had videos of him and his girlfriend in compromising situations and I told my parents as well... they needed to know. I was told that they knew and that my mother had accidentally seen the video when she went to turn off his computer.   Both him and his girlfriend are under 16 and my parents have confronted him telling him how illegal this is and stuff but he is just not listening and denying everything. There was no like actual sex but just other stuff in the video apparently.   Legally how fucked is he?	Yes
49	I've been carrying this on my shoulders since Nov. 2015. The therapists know the entire situation, in depth, and even though I feel iffy about what to do, they still encourage me. It is not such a black and white/cookie cutter situation, it's also very twisted, and gross, and sick... So I'll spare you the details and make this brief.   I don't have money to hire a lawyer, but my current therapist told me to at least seek a free consultation with one. How do I do this? If the crime happened in another county, what do I need to do. What will happen if/when I finally press charges? What should I expect? I need to know so much, but I don't know what all to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
50	Are knives equipped with SpeedSafe® Assisted Opening by Kershaw legal in California?  I know that laws in California are fairly restrictive when it comes to knives, so I always stick to small everyday carry knives that you can only open using 2 hands. Recently I came across this one being sold in walmart in California: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kershaw-Blur-S30V-Steel-Stonewashed-Knife/21980329, I was fairly surprised, given that it has some sort of assisted opening. I later asked few friends of mine from the police department, but I would also like to know the opinion of the lawyers. More about the technology is here: https://kershaw.kaiusaltd.com/technology  My question is specifically about this knife model, so I will appreciate if people only comment if they have specific knowledge or experience.  P.S. I don't know if mentioning a specific brand or retailer is a violation of the rules here, but I am not affiliated to any of them and not trying to promote or otherwise affect brand visibility.	Yes
51	My son's car has been egged several times over the last few months.  The second time it happened we made a police report but it's happened 3 times since and we haven't called it in.  They have also gotten my husband's car and our house.  What I want to know is, is this considered illegal?  The egg just washed off so no real damage, but my son thinks it's kids at school doing it because he is gay.... would that make it a hate crime if egging isn't even a crime?  I am so frustrated.  We only have room to park one car in the driveway, not that it would deter them, but it seems like whichever one of us is parked on the street is getting it, just us, not our neighbors.  Our neighbor behind us did get it once, but not since.  My son's car is just a $2000 car, but my husband and I drive much nicer cars and don't want to have to deal with this crap.  It happened once on a Friday night, but all other instances were on Sunday nights.	Yes
52	"Hi guys, any help would really be appreciated. I'm going to be sentenced to 29 days in jail for carrying a loaded firearm in a public place. It is a deal offered by the DA for dropping two other infractions that happened at the same time with fines up to $3000. Here are some mitigating circumstances that may or may not help me.  -I'm a teacher and a very productive member of society -I have no criminal record, no priors -I was far away from anyone else, camping, when I was detained -I have 11 very-well written letters of reference  Here's the situation, my lawyer has determined the case to be unfightable (and I got a second opinion from a second attorney too, money going down the drain -__-) been trying to convince the DA to reduce my sentence with letters of reference, to no avail. Only positive thing is the the firearm will be returned to me, obviously I'm not a threat. So why the strict jailtime? The 29 days is pretty much set according to my lawyer; he also mentioned I can make a statement in court, but strongly advises against it because the judge may overrule not in my favor and request the firearms to continue to be withheld. Is there really nothing I can say during court to sway the judge?? Please help!!! The ""statement"" is literally the last thing I can do to avoid jailtime, I'm scared :( Anybody have any experience talking to the judge in court? Anybody know how much influence the judge has in deciding proper sentences? My lawyer told me that the strict jailtime punishment is meant to be something along the lines of ""setting an example"" for these crimes- which I feel is pretty cruel. I feel like going to jail will make me really bitter and turn me into a delinquent..."	Yes
53	So my buddy just called me, he had been on a dating app and been talking with this girl. She was posted as 19 and going to college in a few weeks and was just looking to mess around. Things happened and nudes were sent. After a few days she wanted to meet up and he was trying to figure out the logistics. Before that happened she told him she was actually just turning 17 in a few weeks. He said the hell with this deleted the nudes and cut contact. The next day he gets a call from a supposed lawyer and the lawyer said the father was an understanding guy and just wanted to talk to my buddy and figure out what happened. He got a weird vibe asked about the law firm and got vauge answers so he said he can't verify the lawyer he won't talk to him. Me and another buddy have been looking into the supposed lawyer and the name given doesn't show up on the MN and ND lists. I called the number and got a different last name that was a lawyer. The cellphone number doesn't match the lawfirms number. We are all confused and this smells of scamming... anyone have any similar situations or advice we would greatly appreciate it.	Yes
54	My boyfriend's mother is apparently pretty controlling. I have met her several times and she always seemed nice, but I have come to learn that it was a facade. One day, she was upset at my boyfriend about something. He had band practice, and she threatened that if he wasn't back by a specific time that she would report his car stolen. I don't know if she would have actually done this had he not been back in time.  He is 21 and not a minor.  Pretty sure actually filing the false report would be illegal, but is threatening to do so also illegal? This is mostly hypothetical because I am sure it wouldn't even be worth pursuing and risking my boyfriend getting cut off and unable to afford school, but I'd like to know.	Yes
55	I am an 24 year old male executive assistant in MD and I've been working for my boss for 7 years now, she is in her 50's. She was always touchy on the shoulders and what not and I never really thought anything of it... However yesterday was a meeting she's asked me for the last 2 weeks to tag along with, and it's nothing out of the ordinary for me to tag along to these kinds of things. 30 minutes into driving she's realised she has forgotten something at home that is needed for the meeting so she heads there which is about an hour and a half away from the office. We get there and she invites me in, and after 10 minutes comes downstairs with just a towel on and proceeds to tell me that if I don't give her what she wants then I won't have a job when I find my own way back to the office. At this point I'm completely appalled that she is not only serious, but that this is actually happening.   I felt cornered because I love my job, I am paid very well, and I am planning on proposing to my girlfriend very soon and if I did not have this job it wouldn't be possible. I went through with it and I have no idea what to do next. I feel ashamed so I haven't told anyone, because this situation isn't something that happens often. She told me to shower afterwards and I only showered parts of my body in case I needed the other parts to be untouched. I don't know what to do next.	Yes
56	He freaked out on her and then tried to cover it up saying he was giving the cards back to the respective customers in an effort to get them a better deal on their phones/plans. Shady as fuuuuck. I am certainly not a lawyer, but this smacks of fraud to me.   Question: legally, what specifically is this considered? I'm telling her to seek legal advice, but I need her to understand the gravity of the situation (if there is indeed gravity).  Thanks in advance.	Yes
57	I'm 15 and got caught stealing at Walmart I know I'm really dumb so don't bother commenting saying I'm dumb i know I am for this but in all honesty I need to know What my options are here . I stole under $30 worth of merchandise (2 iPhone chargers) and they caught me and took me to a room and officers came and wrote me a ticket or whatever . I gave them my first and last name as well as the first initial to my middle name but keep in mind this happened in Texas and I live in Florida. I gave the officers my old house address which is a rental house and they said I have until august 7th to go to court and pay a fine or they will put out a warrant for my arrest. So the question is should I tell my parents or just leave it alone and don't worry about them trying to find me back in Florida ? since they don't have my real address. Will they be able to put a warrant for my arrest in Only Texas since this all happened in Texas or Florida too ? or would they still be able to find me? can I pay this over the phone without showing up to court since I leave Texas tomorrow ?	Yes
58	Not much context to be had here. Just wondering if a 21 year old can legally be tried for underage drinking after their 21st birthday.  Say that there is video evidence, and you are pleading 100% guilty. Would a judge still rule guilty if you are no longer a minor?	Yes
59	"Before we begin, here's a little bit of useful background about myself: I'm currently 17, on probation for a misdemeanor paraphernalia charge, and live in a small town in Pennsylvania.  On Monday, (7/10/2017) I was hanging out at my girlfriend's house, as I usually do. Around 12 PM, her friend messaged her and asked if we wanted to hangout after said friend got off of work at 8 PM. At about 8:30 PM, my girlfriend's friend picked us up at her house. We really don't have much to do in my small town, so we decided to drive around for a bit.   At approximately 9:15 PM, the friend that was driving wanted to meet up with her other friend at a local gas station. When we arrived, the girl we were meeting there (19 years old) asked us all if we wanted to just ride in her car, since the friend that originally picked us up, had a pretty unreliable beater. We agreed and got in. I sat in the backseat on the passenger side, while my girlfriend sat in the backseat on the drivers side.   Having nothing to do, we again drove around aimlessly for a few minutes before deciding to go up to a pretty well known hangout spot that overlooks the town. When we got to the spot, the driver pulled out a mason jar with about 8 grams in it (so she said). The driver and friend that was the passenger offered my girlfriend and myself to smoke with them. I declined because i get regularly drug tested due to probation. My girlfriend also declined out of respect for myself. We had no knowledge of it being inside the vehicle before this point.   They rolled up and smoked inside the car, trying to hotbox it (it worked very well). The two finish smoking and the driver spots headlights at the head of the path you drive to get to the spot. She freaks out, and begins to drive down the path towards where she saw the headlights. Take a guess who the lights belonged to? The police. The driver takes a left and makes it about 300 feet before being lit up.   The officer comes up to the window asking what we were doing up there. I (respectfully) asked the officer what we were being stopped for, he claimed ""suspicious vehicle on private property"". Here's the thing, there's no signs anywhere near where we were, or even in the area that claim private property. I've gone up there with friends many times and have never once have heard it was private land. Anyways, obviously the car smelled like a dispensary. The officer collected everyone's ID and went back to his car. 5 minutes later, another police vehicle pulls up. The arriving officer comes right up to the window and the first thing he says is ""Where's the weed?"". Everyone in the car refused knowing who's it was or where it was, trying to keep us all out of trouble.   He then asks us all to step out of the car, and we all comply. He asks me if he can pat me down and search my person. I agree because I had nothing on me or in my possession, he found nothing on me and then repeated the process with the rest of the people. He asked me directly if I knew where it was and I politely plead the 5th. After not getting an answer out of anyone, he begins to search the car and finds the jar underneath the driver's seat. No body was arrested, they had us all call our parents to take us home.  I've went down to my local courthouse today and filled out a statement with my girlfriend entailing exactly what I've said here.   Here are my questions. The driver and passenger are both pretty good friends and I have no doubt they've tried to pin it on myself or my girlfriend by now saying it was one of ours. Would the prosecutor side with myself and girlfriend or them, being it was in the other girls car?   Also, what can I expect? I messed up before and was caught, now I have nothing to do with it and I don't want anymore legal trouble being as i'm already on probation.  Thank you all so much for any advice you can give."	Yes
60	Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	Yes
61	This is slightly personal, hence the throwaway, and this situation is based in South East Asia. So, I know that there will be a certain degree of difference but I just want to know what I can expect. Also note that I am not the embezzler  If a person has been embezzling money from the company and the company goes to the cops, will the tax records of the company be under scrutiny?   Also, if the some of the money embezzled has been used to buy houses listed under that person's kids names, will that money be recouped? Alternatively, is there any way to force the person to return the money without going to the police?	Yes
62	Now not reckless driving, but the one point negligent driving. It keeps coming back for job background checks and I disclose it now after the first time I was called out on it because I had no idea it was not a general type of ticket when I was 18 and then forgot the ticket was and never thought twice. I can't get a straight answer on if it is a misdemeanor or not? Also I have a lot of driving tickets (4) from the age 18-21. Will that impact me forever? I am embarrassed of them now especially since all my future employers can see them. I haven't had a ticket in two years (23 now) and drive much more responsibly now. I also live in Florida now with the one ticket at 21 in Florida, rest are in Maryland. Will all these forever show up?	Yes
63	I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up.  He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.    Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car.  He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point...  I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt.  I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor.  I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes.  Will they take me in for my warrant?  Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted?  Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order?  Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing.  I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.  My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school.  Is this a good plan?  Thank you	Yes
64	I received a Petty Misdemeanor about 5 years ago in New Mexico for shoplifting under $30. At the time I was homeless and hitchhiking through Albuquerque on my way back to Florida. I was never arrested but they took my information, banned me from going to any Kmart's, and gave me a court date. I talked to a public defender and she told me if I never plan on coming back to New Mexico that I should just leave. So I did. I ignored the court date and headed back to Florida without a second thought.  It's been 5 years, I have my shit together and I'm living in Colorado now. I haven't heard anything from the state of New Mexico since I left and forgot about the whole deal until I applied for Lyft a couple months back and was declined because of that charge from New Mexico. How should I go about dealing with this? I now regret just leaving like I did and feel like I probably made it worse. Does this mean I also have a warrant out for skipping a court date? The way the public defender talked about it made me think it was no big deal but obviously you can't just ignore stuff like this. Any guidance is appreciated.	Yes
65	"About 2 years ago I visited an escort at a hotel. Before I went in, I noticed there was a cop car parked at the edge of the parking lot. I thought they have no idea what I'm doing in there, so I just went ahead and went in. Afterwards, when I was driving away from the hotel, I noticed the cop car was behind me. He was driving behind me for a couple minutes or so, but then I turned and he went in a different direction. He did not stop me or anything. My guess is that the employees at the hotel reception desk were watching me on the cameras and called the cop as I was leaving. As I was walking out, I noticed a couple of them were standing looking at a screen and then one of them glanced at me and I am not sure if I am just being paranoid but I think I heard ""that's him"".  Is it likely the cop took my license plate number and put my name in an incident report saying they suspect I was visiting a prostitute even though they have no real evidence that's what I was doing? If so, can this information possibly be discovered by others in the future? And how long will it be kept?"	Yes
66	"Hi, last year I was charged with petit theft, around September (stupid, I know). I've been paying my fines on time and haven't been in any further trouble and don't plan to.   Today I received a letter for a ""notice of resetting hearing"". Does anyone know why this would happen? I was sentenced last year and my punishment was one day in jail (served) and a few hundred dollar fine, which I am paying and haven't missed any payments. The reset is set for August 23rd, so next month. One month before my sentencing last year.   Sorry I'm just a little flustered and nervous, I wanted this put behind me. If you have any questions I'll answer them."	Yes
67	"I recieved a felony DUI in Oregon last year. I served two months earlier this year and am out. I have a decent job now, however a couple ""dream jobs"" have opened up lately. Here is where I run into an issue. I do not know what to answer on the ""Have you been convicted of a felony (sometimes it asks for lower level crimes too, misdemeanor, etc) box. Now before you say to tell the truth, Oregon law EXPLICITLY does not allow that question. Oregon law HB 3025 states: This legislation prohibits an employer from requiring an applicant: to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction; to disclose, prior to an initial interview, a criminal conviction; or if no interview is conducted, to disclose, prior to a conditional offer of employment, a criminal conviction. Portland (where I live) then takes it a step farther, basically stating that they must offer conditional employment before asking about a conviction. They are not even allowed to ask DURING the interview. They must first offer me a conditional offer of employment (cuz ya know, Oregon). After that, if they learn that I have a felony, they can only rescind if the felony directly applies to the line of work I would be in. So this leaves me in a weird spot. When filling out job applications, local companies and national companies (even ones with large legal divisions, think Amazon, various national mortgage agencies) ask that question. It is yes, or no, and you cannot proceed without selecting an answer. Do I tell the truth and have a 0% chance at getting the job, or do I lie since they are breaking a law by even asking that question? It gets even more complicated when looking at tax breaks for hiring felons. They get $2400 for hiring a felon within 1 year of his release date, and are protected by a federal bonding program where they can receive $5,000 fidelity bonds, free of charge, as an incentive to hire job seekers that do not qualify for commercial fidelity bonds. Some applications afterwards have you fill out a WOTC where it asks you questions about foodstamps, government assitance, and being a felon. If we decide that lying is the best course of action, do I then tell the truth on the WOTC part of the application to then not be considered a felon on the part of the application where I am being illegally discriminated against, but be considered a felon on the tax credit part where being a felon works to the companies advantage?  If anyone has any in depth knowledge of this law, or my best course of action, please advise."	Yes
68	This happened in Washington, DC in March 2015. I was going to school there and dating a guy. We had been dating for about 18 months when the rape happened. He was very verbally and mentally abusive, and had me completely under his thumb. I was also suffering from depression and untreated anxiety at the time. He penetrated me while I was sleeping. I immediately felt assaulted, but I didn't file a report because I was too depressed to make myself do anything and too afraid of him.  I've been haunted by this ever since it happened. I still feel violated, I still have issues with intimacy, I still have huge issues with distrust. I know he's out there being successful and living his life with no consequences while I deal with nothing but pain. I feel like the only way I can move on is if I get some sort of justice.   But there are problems:  -I don't live in Washington, DC anymore. I ended up transferring colleges.   -It was so long ago. I don't even remember the exact date and time.   -We had consensual sex before he raped me and consensual sex afterwards, because I was in shock and afraid. I know that kind of thing looks bad to police and juries though.   -He asked me if he had raped me several times and I always told him no. I only said no because I still loved him like a fool, and I was terrified. But I know it makes me look really bad.   I would change what I did and said if I could in a heartbeat, but I can't.   Do the lawyers here recommend that I report him anyway? Would I look like a liar or someone who wanted revenge? And how would I go about it since I don't live in the same state that it happened, and I don't remember some vital details?  Thank you	Yes
69	Hey, so the gist of the story is as follows. I have a safe in my house that is key operated that used to contain $11000 as well as a rolex and some other valuables, during a party I had a few weeks ago some friends slept at my house, one of them in my room because it has two beds.  Today, I opened my safe to discover $5700 was missing.  To clear a few things up..  * The safe is in my room  * I never take my money out of the safe and the safe stays in my room so there is no way I would have misplaced the money, I know when I have opened the safe, and the last time I opened it everything was there.  * The only people that knew about the location of my safe was a few of my closest friends   * I have searched my house to see if my money was anywhere just in case  * the key to the safe was on my keychain which was next to me while I slept in my room  *  No one broke into my house or has otherwise had any unsupervised access to my room, the only time when the theft could have happened was while I slept after the party  * Me and my friends are all 17  * The money is all mine and of course I want it back  What steps would you suggest to recover the money, there is only 3 or 4 people it could have been, I have proof in the form of pictures and receipts that I had the money.	Yes
70	"My friend [F25] was out drinking at bar with a few friends and acquaintances over this past weekend. She drove home very drunk and one of her ""friends"" followed her home and raped her in her apartment.    I want my friend to go to the police and file a report against this scum bag so he doesn't find another drunk victim to rape, because I just don't think this was his first time. She doesn't want to go to the police because she drove home drunk and is afraid of the consequences. Can she get charged with a DUI or a misdemeanor if she admits that she drove home drunk without any incidents? If we find out that it's unlikely, then I think she'll agree to file a report of rape against this guy. Once that question is mostly answered, we need to find out if there's enough ""evidence"" of the rape to actually do anything. She's really worried that it'll just be her word against his.   Thank you for any help/advice on this issue. It's such a sensitive situation and she nor I knew where to turn to for help."	Yes
71	I am shocked and embarrased and upset right now. I have no idea what to do. This is my first offense ever and the only way I can expunge my record is if I wait two years. I'm 17 and a senior in high school and was planning on applying to Ivy League but now that's obviously not going to happen. I have no idea what to do to move past this.	Yes
72	I received an order of protection and have no idea what the consequences are if it's not removed, or worse, made permanent. The order came from Family Court - which I understand is a civil matter. So does an order of protection from family court show up on criminal background checks? Are there different types of restraining order such that some do show up on background checks whereas others don't?	Yes
73	Not me but a relative was fired today after 6 months working for a company. Their reason was that he did not inform HR of his conviction. This was his first job after prison and he was required to provide the halfway house he lived in a signed agreement confirming employment. His bosses both knew of the conviction from the interview forward. Even signed said document the prison system required.   Arkansas is right to work. But is there a case against the employer here? If not, is there a case to still get unemployment? They said he would not be eligible for failure to disclose the conviction to HR.   Please help! Thanks.	Yes
74	"I caught a dui case in January of 2017. I was sentenced to a year probation and was told to get an alcohol assessment and I am required to follow the recommendations from the alcohol assessment. Below is my story.     Jan 26 2017 I had an appointment with a lady named Katie at Dawn Farms  for my alcohol assessment. I was court ordered to have an alcohol assessment. During the assessment, Katie recommended that I do 24 weeks of outpatient group therapy at dawn farms with a lady named Hannah on wednesdays from 2-3:30. Katie was training a young lady and explained the rules and asked if I had any questions regarding the assessment. She asked me to sign a piece of paper confirming everything that we went over and that I was to attend 24 weeks of outpatient meetings as well as attend 2 aa meetings per week.  I attended the 24 weeks with no issue. After the first 12 weeks, I didn't get a review over my performance or acknowledged on how I did. I was just given a piece of paper that I had to write new goals on and that was it. After completing the 24 weeks on July 12th 2017, Hannah mentioned to me that I could either continue to do the Wednesday's 2pm groups or switch to Thursday's.  There was never a discussion I had with anyone from Dawn Farms regarding another 12 weeks. The program has two phases, recovery group support and recovery support. One is 24 weeks and the other is 12. Not everyone does 36 weeks, or 24 weeks. Some people do 12 weeks but everyone signs the same form that states that in order to complete the Dawn farms program, you have to do 36 weeks. There are check marks next to both phases that you are recommended to do. My contract had the recovery support phase checked off and had it wrote by Katie in pen ""2 sets of 12=24 weeks"". I was not court ordered to complete the program, I was court ordered to get an assessment and to attend the recommended meetings that were given to me during the assessment. Every individual is different went it comes to the assessment. Katie might recommend something completely different than what another person might recommend, but she did my intake and no one else did. And since everyone is different, she assessed me based on the information I provided her and made the decision to give me 24 weeks of outpatient therapy. And That was her job but she no longer works there.  On July 14th I went to dawn farms at about 3:10 to speak with someone who could help me better understand why the piece of paper says something different than what was said to me from Hannah. A lady gave me a card and told me to speak to ray, who is the coordinator of the program.  I got ahold of ray at about 5pm and spoke with him about the issue. I explained to him the piece of paper and he said Katie may have screwed up with my intake. I told him that was not my fault, but we can't talk to her anyways because she no longer works there. Did she really screw up? These are done on an individual basis. He said that things may have changed from when I originally signed the paper in January. I told him that if that was the case then I was to sign a new form.  He told me that he wants to talk to his staff about this to make sure there are no loop holes like this again. This is not considered a loophole if this is something that they recommend to other people in treatment. This does not seem fair. Everyone who signs the same form would have to do 36 weeks. I was planning on signing up for classes at washtenaw community college. How am I suppose to plan things out for myself if there is a lack of communication and a lack of review after the 12 week period? He said that he would not write a letter saying that I completed the 36 weeks at dawn farms. I never asked him to write a letter to be dishonest and say that i did something I didn't do. I told him I want him to write a letter stating that I completed my 24 week recovery support group at dawn farm. I told him I would pick it up next week. My probation officer told me that I need to do whatever they tell me to do basically... but I did! I did the 24 weeks with no issue and out of no where they are telling me I need to do 12 more! Am I wrong for trying to fight this?    In terms of the dawn farms client handbook, it states that the staff will not lie to you or emotionally or physically abuse you. I feel like I was lied to and it's emotionally hurtful to know that I was mislead and it's causing me anxiety. I should feel good about being sober, not bad. I haven't had any screw ups since I've been at Dawn Farms.     Dawn farms website states ""Group therapy – Several group therapy options are offered that are designed to help clients with varying needs, levels of motivation and intensity of substance use problems. Groups range in duration from 8 to 24 weeks depending upon client needs and preference.""    If I signed a contract for leasing a vehicle for 24 months. That's what I would expect. I wouldn't expect the dealer to call me at the 24 month period to tell me that things changed and that it was actually a 36 month lease without me being aware."	Yes
75	I'll preface this by saying I've been ticketed for this before, went to court, did a day's community service, wiped my hands of it. So recently I was at a park drinking, some officers came around and ticketed me. Especially since I only thought it was a ticketable offense, mixed with the fact that it was dark out, me and my friends were not yelling or playing music, I stuck around after the cops left. Not even a half hour later some new cops came around and arrested me, telling me I shoulda listened the first time around. Now I'm facing a real court date.   Will they probably just give me a ticket in court or am I facing a real problem here? I had no other charges in the system when I left (I double checked). Should I get a lawyer? This is my first arrest ever so I have no idea how to handle this.	Yes
76	"I went to a big box store and parked. When I got out I was stuck between two large SUV which limited my view going back. I honestly slowly went back when a car blasted their horn and sped. I would say around me but at no time were we closer than 8 feet. I let it go I did not even honk back or give them the finger or yell anything to them.  I had already put my windows down because the temperature was only ~80 degrees. My mistake. I happened to use the same exit as that person because there are only really two ways to get out.  I left at least one car space probably more. The passenger gets out of the car. Cars are coming into the big box store so I cannot go around. I am blocked on the right by a sidewalk and the passenger coming at me. There are cars already behind me.  The guy comes at me with fists drawn and in a threatening manner already yelling ""I am going to kick your fucking ass."" I panic and remembered I had pepper spray. I fumble for it as he is already at my car screaming. I yell ""GO back to your car"" at least 4 times and he takes a swipe at me and then spits at me right into my face and eye. I spray the pepper spray directly into his face. He immediately walks away and then his wife (driver of car) starts screaming at me. I call 911 the moment the situation was calmer.  He and she are screaming at me. I finally close my window (I forgot to do that) The police are there in about two minutes which is really quick. I tell my story. The other guy is warned to stay over there cause he keeps trying to get close to me. The police tell me that his story does not make sense and to tell me my story twice now. 4 more officers come. I tell them each and they warned me that I might be arrested because pepper spray is ""illegal"" in new jersey and that ""spitting does not constitute an assault""  Luckily a supervisor says that my pepper spray (bought on amazon which limits which size I can buy in my state) is legal and that spitting does constitute an assault or something else. I was still quite amped up to understand exactly what he said.  At the end, all of the officers told me had it happened to them they would have done the same or even more (one officer said I would have beat the living shit out of him) But they gave me my license, my pepper spray back, and a police report number no ticket was issued to me. I am not sure of the other person.  They said that the passenger already said that he will be pressing charges against me. The police told me at 9 am Monday to go to the police station pick up the police report and file charges against the passenger.  I would like to know what am I facing? Can I use a self defense claim? I never left the vehicle, he came into my vehicle trying to punch me and spit into my face.  What would I counter charge him with? Can I press charges against the driver of the vehicle as well as she preventing me from leaving.  Was anything I did illegal?"	Yes
77	I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother.   Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.  I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge.   Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three? Im just wondering if this is worth doing or if I am going to be doing the same thing wether i manage to get the weed charge off or not.  All input is appreciated, Thanks	Yes
78	Title pretty much explains it all. I pay all of my living and school expenses, while my parents pay my phone and insurance (which is changing after this.) I claimed myself on my tax returns last year, meaning my parents couldn't claim me. They proceeded to file an amended return on my behalf (without my knowledge/permission,) which caused me to owe the IRS $1200+, and my return to be garnished this year. They refuse to pay it. My mother also broke into my bank account yesterday, and transferred my savings into her account. When I called the bank to report fraud, she shut my phone off. I am planning to walk there myself (they hid the keys from me... yes, they're abusive narcs with whom I will be going NC when I move in a few weeks,) and my mom is saying she will report me as a missing person. Help!	Yes
79	I'm in Florida.   So I was arrested for failure to appear. While incarcerated the jail didn't give me my medicine and I had a seizure from withdrawal from Zoloft.   I broke my finger and had to had two surgeries, then the wound became infected while again incarcerated for failure to appear.   It's a shit sandwich. But is the county/jail responsible for my seizure, broken finger, two surgeries bill?	Yes
80	"Firstly, I'm not as much looking for legal advice specifically but for anything that could help me in this situation. I don't want to give away my country of residence. I live in the EU, I hope this is enough information. Mods, if you think this post doesn't belong here, feel free to delete it. But it'd be nice, if you could point me in  a better direction. *I am afraid. Please hear me out.*  **TL;DR:** Found child-porn on my flatmates computer but don't want to call the police on him because  he is my friend and I may be in more trouble than him if the police searched our place. **TL;DR END**  The current situation: My flatmate and I live in my fathers house, I get to stay there for free, he pays a small rent.  It's not big but it's enough for two people. My dad lives in a house directly across the street  and we use his internet, more about that later.   Short introduction to my flatmate, let's call him Nick.  Nick is the personification of the term ""neckbeard"".  He has long hair, a beard on his neck, his room is always messy, he showers only once a week,  instead of a carpet he has worn boxers. He doesn't work, spends 90% of his time in front  of his gaming-rig and his mother pays all his expenses. He orders almost all of his food online  and in the rare case that he attempts to cook something by himself, the whole house smells horrible  and the kitchen is dirty (of course he doesn't clean up after himself). He takes my food  without asking. It has gotten so bad that he eats almost a third of it because he is to lazy to go  out end buy some himself. To top it of he owns a Katana-like sword. The only thing missing is a fedora. Sometimes he leaves the house for hours at weird times and never even gives a hint as to where he goes. Why did I let him move in with me? Despite all of the above, he actually is a very nice person and totally  oblivious to the fact that he is a neckbeard. Also, i didn't know how bad his neckbeardism was until  he moved in and we were friends for a long time.  Here is what made me suspicious of him and how I found the cp:  Clue 1: He once sent me a picture of a naked loli-girl (young anime girl for those who don't know what  ""loli"" means) and told me how cool it looked. The girl in the picture made a pose that concealed  her vagina and (probably non-existant) breasts. There was no real sexual aspect to it, the pose  was not sexual in any way. It was well drawn and actually looked pretty cool tbh. I also try to be  open minded, and loli isn't real.  Clue 2: He sometimes sends me memes about cp, but we have pretty dark humor.Even though the cp-memes  didn't really match the stuff we sent to each other normally, I didn't think too much of it.  Clue 3: Not really a clue, but it contributed to my actions: Nick has zero social awareness. He randomly puts his hand in his pants, blows his nose in his hand,  farts while talking to people and doesn't even realize that all the things he does may be disgusting. And of course the fact that he is a cliché neckbeard.  All of this made me think:""Well, if this isn't the perfect out-of-the-book pedophile."" And then I realized that he is using my fathers internet. My father once got (wrongly) accused  of being a pedophile by his crazy ex-girlfriend, therefore an investigation due to his internet access  being used to download cp could be more than dangerous for him.  I made a plan: Open Nicks Computer while he is away, get his harddrive, copy all of it's contents  to my own as fast as possible, put his PC back together and review the acquired data later.  I executed the plan, but didn't really think I would find anything. I just wanted to be sure.  What I found: *Several loli-pics. *A japanese loli-game. *A 15 minutes video of a ~ten year old girl masturbating (presumably) in front of a webcam.  I was horrified. I only watched a few seconds of the video, but I almost threw up on my keyboard.  I immediately deleted it.  After I calmed down a little I took my phone and wanted to call the police. But here are the problems:  *I now have cp on my harddrive. Even though I deleted it, it can be retrieved in case the police  decides to take my computer too. I could overwrite all free space on my disk (and thus making it  impossible to retrieve the deleted data), but that would be even more suspicious.  *Stealing someones personal files is probably illegal and evidence that was acquired trough illegal  means is often ignored by the court.  *I browsed some shady imageboards and accidentally stumbled over sexualised pictures of children. Not  even nude pictures, but little girls in swimwear doing poses and such. In case they can find out what  sites I visited in the past year, they may think I'm a pedo too.  *Sometimes I look and hentai-pictures online, so naturally I came across some loli material too. When  this happens I just ignore it as there is no real sexual appeal in it, but the police can't know that.  *I'm somewhat of a privacy freak. I use TOR browser, extra-long passwords and encrypt everything I can. One doesn't need much fantasy to turn this into just another pedo who is trying not to get caught.  *We laid our internet-cable from my fathers house to our house under the street. This was my dads idea  and probably is illegal.  *I used an encryption program to overwrite a few of my old hardrives so nobody can retrieve my old data.  The police will probably think there are hidden volumes with cp on them because there is no way to tell  the difference between a ""cleaned"" drive and and encrypted drive.  *I still kinda like Nick. He is just such a nice person and seems so helpless in his total ignorance  of everything. I don't think he would actually harm a child. And I don't want his mum to find out. She is  very sweet and protective of him and seeing her only child being locked away as a pedophile would break her  heart.  Long story short: If I called the police, my flatmate wouldn't be the only one having problems."	Yes
81	"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	Yes
82	Hello. I would just like some information about something that happened to me and my friends when we were young teenagers. I tried to use google to get information but it was confusing and not specific towards my situation. I'm using a throwaway since I don't want this attached to my main profile. I think this is the correct sub for my questions. Our interactions were during 2008. We lived in Ohio and John lived in South Carolina.   He met my friend Julie over Xbox online chat. John was friends with Julie's older brother and she was using her brothers account. He said he was 21 and she said she was 15 (she was really 13) he talked to her and they developed a romantic relationship. Flirting and talking to each other and all that. Julie introduced us to him so we could get to know him. Sarah was 14 with over protective parents, and she felt uneasy and unsure about him. I was 14 and wanted to get to know him and make sure he was ok. As I got to know him I would ask him questions and advice about growing up and boys and sex.  I still have some copies of some of our chats over gmail but most of our messaging was over aim. I accidentally revealed Julie was actually 13. He was upset about it and didn't want to talk to her anymore, but eventually got over it and continued to talk to us. Over time our messaging got more dirty and we would talk on the phone as well. I know he was romantically dating my friend and I'm a shitty person for getting flirty and intimate with him. Eventually he taught me how to have phone sex. At the end of one of the early sessions he said if I told anyone he'd kill me. I freaked out a little but he said he was only joking. We had phone sex regularly. I still have some of the chats on my gmail were I was talking about me moaning and him liking it. We even talked about that when he could finally come up to see Julie about the possibility of him and I having sex.  He stopped having phone sex abruptly with me. He said he was feeling guilty about having phone sex with me while being in a relationship with Julie. I've always wondered if he started having phone sex with her and was just done with me, but I never asked her about it. I've never told Julie about any of this. We've lost touch but we're still friends on Facebook, I figured I might ask her about it since we're not close friends anymore so I wouldn't have to worry about loosing anything with her lol.  Eventually our families found out we were talking to strangers on the internet. The three of us got in a lot of trouble over it. I told my family I was talking to him to make sure he was a nice guy and wasn't going to hurt Julie. I never mentioned the sexual conversations or the phone sex to them and denied that anything like that ever happened. The guy we were talking to ended up blocking us.  I don't know if I have any options right now. I'm not too affected by it, just kind of disturbed and disgusted. I know this definitely probably helped to promote my promiscuity as a teenager, but other stuff happened when I was as an even younger child so that probably helped to encourage my promiscuity too, but that's a different fucked up story lol.  Mostly I'm concerned if he did anything to Julie but I can just talk to her about it. My biggest concern is if he would do something like this again to someone else.  I have a handful of chats from my gmail account, I never delete anything. I've also had the same cell phone number since I was 13 so maybe phone records can be reviewed.  I don't really think I can press charges. I'm just worried about him doing it again to someone else.  I know Julie's older brother was talking to Johns younger sister for a while as well, even after our families found out about John. I know he was in a really terrible car accident a couple of years before he talked to us, and he showed us an article about it and it had the name he gave us, so I'm pretty sure he never lied about his name. I know he was becoming a Christian and I think he was involved or going to a Christian school. I think he said he was going to write a book about his accident and his relationship with god. Do you think I should report what happened? Who would I report it to? Would they even be able to find evidence against him or find him? I know I have 2 chats from 2008 about us talking and planning on having phone sex.  What do you guys think?	Yes
83	"I was blackout drunk. The girl said nothing happened. Ex-father-in-law said he saw sex. I fought the case for a year. Assistant DA said they were going to bring in an expert to say the girl had ""Stolkholm syndrome"" and felt the need to defend me since she had a history of sexual abuse. Lawyer advised I take a plea for a county year and 5 years felony probation with the requirement that I ""p.c. 290 register while on probation."" That's a direct quote from my minute orders. I finished my probation, without incident and am still stuck on the registration. My lawyer called my charge a wobbler. This was all in California. Is there anything I can do?"	Yes
84	So I was out at 1am with friends, and I had 2 oz of weed in my bag. Cops were called by the neighbor, they showed up detained us and kept me bc of my weed I also had a scale but they gave it back. I'm 16 this is my first offense. What's going to happen at court ?	Yes
85	My daughter, who is 16, rather foolishly allowed a guy to tie her up, tickle her, and videotape the whole thing, in return for $100. This guy has a business of some sort, but I can't tell if it's legitimate.  He has a business card but no website or anything, and this videotaping took place at his apartment.    I found out about this and called the number on the business card and spoke to someone.  At first the guy who answered was polite, and said that our permission was not needed because the video is not for public release.  But when I asked him to delete the video, he refused, and then hung up on me.    Is this considered producing child porn?  She was clothed (barely) but this was obviously sexual in nature.  Can I get him in trouble somehow?  I don't want other young girls to be victimized by this kind of abuse.    This is in California.	Yes
86	Last July I was sentenced to two years supervised probation, an alcohol awareness class, and 100 hours of community service. Since then I have completed my hours and class. My probation officer said I am able, after the one year mark, to reappear in front of my judge to have my charges dropped. Although it is not a guarantee that the judge will agree to do so. I do not want to hire an attorney and put myself in (more of) a financial hole based on chance. Any advice or experiences that may help me as I go forward besides dress nice, be polite?  TLDR: Reappearing in court to have probation dropped, need advice on appearing in court by myself in front of judge.	Yes
87	In 2013 my boyfriend  was working at a gas station. They were short handed and he was the only one working in the store and it was quite busy. He wasn't paying close enough attention to an ID and ended up selling cigarettes to a minor that was a few months from being of legal age in a sting. Obviously we expected a ticket and probably for him to lose his job which did happen but he also ended up being charged with a misdemeanor and the charge was endangering a minor. His lawyer told him that basically he can never get this expunged and its been hindering his search for better paying jobs. He only has a job right now because he knew someone in the company and they let him explain the charge. He feels like anytime someone sees it they automatically think hes a child abuser and bad person. Is there anyway to make this go away at some point or will he be stuck with it forever?	Yes
88	So I met a girl through kik messenger. Turned out she lived like a couple streets over from me. We talked for a couple days about what she's into, and she said she was really into like fantasy forced stuff. Through talking to her she agreed she wanted me to come over and have sex. So she told me when to come over, said she would be in her room and to come in the back door, which was clearly unlocked and opened just like she told me (have kik messages to prove). I go in and go in her room and sit down on the bed, it was dark so I had grabbed her leg accidentally not being able to see, and she starts freaking out and runs into the living room. I walk in there and ask her what is wrong with her, she proceeds to punch me in the head, and I just left out of the front door and walked home. I'm assuming she called the cops, in which case what can I do? I didn't harm her or touch her wrongly, and I have the messages to prove she told me to come over and everything. What should I do? Also, I started to think that what if it wasn't her that was messaging me. I am pretty sure it was, but I have the messages and pictures of her telling me exactly what she wanted with consent to everything. How should I go about this? I haven't been contacted by police in any way. Should I go to them?	Yes
89	After I was rear ended I was assaulted badly, as was my then a minor girlfriend, by the other driver. The officer who handled the situation charged me with harassment (violation) for claims that I shoved the guy, and he was not charged with assault on either account. The officer also did not include witness information for several people (including 2 vehicles with multiple people who let me sit in their car after I was beaten), only 2 workers from a nearby business who claimed I stopped short causing the accident (accident photos show otherwise, which the officer refused to look at and did not take a statement from me at the hospital).  My attorney sent a FOIL letter and something else to the police requesting the 911 call (my girlfriend called immediately after the accident and stayed on the phone until the police arrived 10 minutes later, through me and her being assaulted, drivers stopping to help us, etc.)  The department responded saying they will not release the tapes without a subpoena.   From what my lawyer explained, due to something called Brady Material, and the Freedom of Information Act, those tapes should have been handed over, especially since they would help prove my innocence and go against the police report.   Suffolk County, NY	Yes
90	Roommate flew into a rage this evening about a lamp I broke and wound up punching me three times in the face. I did not return any strikes, he proceeded to call the cops.   I did not stick around for the police to arrive for the reason below, which is why I need advice.  I've been effectively homeless for the last 2 months, crashing on couches and paying people a pittance with no lease etc. I've spread the love across a number of couches so no one friend gets too sick of me. Being homeless is the result of me having been kicked out of previous living quarters during an event for which I am now on unsupervised probation.  The only condition of my probation is to notify them of address changes... Well they've been so frequent and entirely unofficial that I am technically in violation of my probation. Thus why I didn't stick around for the cops.  Having reached a safe location for the evening I was able to examine myself further and I probably have a broken nose, but have no insurance or funds for medical attention (and refuse to use the ER for shit like this, I'm not dying). I would absolutely like to file charges however I suspect I'm fucked on being able to do so because of the afforementioned probation issue.  Help please?	Yes
91	I'm the victim here, I have not acquired a lawyer yet. I just discovered more info for the prosecution to use in my favor but the trial date is probably in the next few weeks. How likely am I able to postpone the trial? Thanks in advance.	Yes
92	I have these neighbors who have 6 dogs and 4 cats. Over double the legal limit for both animals and every time I go over and when I'm at my house I can see and hear them being beaten and abused. What are my options? Do I call animal control? What are my boundaries legally as far as helping/ protecting theses animals? Pls help!	Yes
93	In S.E.Hinton's novel The Outsiders, Johnny stabs Bob to death, but Bob was trying to drown Ponyboy in a fountain. I'm wondering if Johnny can be spared punishment because he was trying to save another person's life.	Yes
94	So i was out the other night with a couple friends and not so wisely decided to bang out a couple doughnuts in an empty parking lot. Shortly after a cop rolled up and wrote me up for reckless driving. I am not sure weather or not i should hire a lawyer to fight this and court or what the cost would be to do so. Any help would be great, -Ryan	Yes
95	I'm more curious than looking to aid in their dispute. The total of the reversed charges hits around $8,500. He's apparently claimed to two of them that his PayPal was hacked and someone stole over $100k from him, but went silent soon after that and has now deleted his Facebook account. PayPal seems to be working with my members, but they're claiming that even if they get their money back, they want to see charges filed. I can't say I disagree with them, someone like that should feel some kind of repercussions.	Yes
96	I'm hoping this will be coherent but my head is still kind of spinning so we'll see.   My brother(M21) and his fiancé(F26) have twin boys (6 months). They are not married, they rent an apartment together. He is sole earner, she stays home with the kids. He is an alcoholic, he's textbook abusive (gas lighting, emotional abuse and two weeks ago he pushed her around enough to leave bruises) and it has come to light he's been cheating for who knows how long.   My SIL (for lack of a better term) is at a loss of what to do. She's at her mother's with the kids, but apparently there is nothing legally stopping my brother from forcefully taking the kids and going to NJ. SIL is concerned for the kids safety, my brother consistently drives drunk. She has photo evidence of the bruises he left, the cheating, the horrible things he says to her. But she doesn't have the money to retain a lawyer. And he has grandparents who are well off and have paid his way out of trouble for 21 years. He keeps threatening her that if she leaves, she'll never see the boys again and that his grandparents will pay for the best lawyer to destroy her.   Please help me find resources for her. What options does she have? Will she lose her kids to someone so toxic and harmful?	Yes
97	Hey everyone, I was recently accepted into a neuroscience PhD program and I'm concerned about an upcoming background check. Around 5 years ago I was arrested with two felony counts of possession of a controlled substance. However, I was never convicted of anything and the case was dropped. During the application process, I correctly answered no when I was asked if I had ever been convicted of a crime. I never had arrest record expunged and I'm concerned that my offer will be removed due to being arrested. I'm hoping since I was never convicted of anything that they won't care, but I can't help but worry. I've already notified my current employer that I'm leaving and signed a lease on an apartment in the city I would be going to school in. If my admission offer gets pulled I will be screwed and have no idea what I would do. I'm wondering if I should preemptively explain my situation and how I've dealt with it would be of any benefit. I've also never been in trouble before or since.  Any advice or related anecdotes would be greatly appreciated. Also, I'd rather not post my location or where I would be attending school due to privacy issues. Thanks.	Yes
98	"Hello. Last night, someone broke into my vehicle and stole about $380 cash, a $300 check, two debit cards and two credit cards along with my social security number as well (I had it in my car because I had just taken it for verification purposes at school the night before). They used all the cards, and due to them making online purchases (with shipping to their home), and video surveillance at the restaurants they went (license plate number and faces) and I have a ton of proof that I am going to be handing over to the police. I suppose my question is, I want to recover this money, but the police straight up said ""it is US Government property and might as well be gone"". I want to recover, obviously. Do I need to file a civil suit after the criminal charges? Is this petty theft, or larceny? All in all, they had spent about $600 on the cards plus everything else mentioned. Do I need to lawyer up to due someone? I had no idea where else to ask"	Yes
99	My friend recently got into a little legal trouble when he was drunk. He is required to take Random Enhanced BA (breath analysis) testing. His question was if there is a difference in the substances they test for in a regular BA test, and if there is a possibility that he would be randomly tested for something else. He wants to avoid further legal trouble so if anyone has any further information on the matter, it would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
100	So this is a bit of a shit storm my  gf got me into. As stated above we got into an argument and the cops were called. my gf is an alcoholic, and started to tell the cops about how i hit her in the past even though these were very false allegations. now i wasn't talked to or even approached by the police. she signed a waiver stating she didn't want to have me arrested. we received a letter in the mail yesterday from the local police dept trying to get her to contact a detective to gather evidence against me to get a warrant for a crime i didn't commit. she said she would call them and let them know she didn't want to press charges or anything against me. should i lawyer up? can a case be built against me if i wasn't even talked to that night and my gf doesn't want to pursue it?	Yes
101	Can a screenshotted snapchat of a little bit of weed (like maybe an 8th) be enough for police to come do a search? I have been threatened by an ex and I would really like to know if this is possible. He says he will report the photo to the police.	Yes
102	She has a psychiatrist, therapist, and will be taken to a mental hospital soon. She wants to know if she can be required to give the name/s of her rapist and if she can be punished for not doing so. She lives in Ohio.	Yes
103	I have a friend that I visit once a month. He has a developmental disability and lives with his parents. I was his Personal Support Worker a couple of years ago. Now I just go over to check on him and hang out. He's 21 years old. We live in Oregon.  The situation in question is that his parents have cameras all over their house. That's cool with me. Parents raising kids with disabilities are super protective and want to keep their kids safe. However, they recently moved my friend's living space to their old office. It's a pretty sweet setup. However, the camera that was in the office was never moved out of there when he moved into the office.  He pays rent from money that he gets from the state and his job. So that's HIS space. I'm not sure that the camera is turned on. But, is it okay for them to check in on him like that? That's his space. They do not have guardianship of him. He is their son but he is an adult renter and, disability or not, he has access to the same human rights as anyone else.  As his parents, I'm sure they have many excuses (if the camera is, in fact, turned on) to check in on their son. But my basic questions are: Is it okay for them to watch him remotely from the cameras? Is this something that should be reported to our local CDDP?  Thanks for your time!	Yes
104	I have been granted a temporary order of protection against an individual who is borderline delusional and 100% stalking me. The day before I changed my phone number, he sent me 89 texts alone (not counting Facebook messages, e-mails) and this person was also calling my home and cell phones from blocked/anonymous numbers.  I've changed the numbers and subscribed to TrapCall to prevent more anonymous calls, and had my phone company block his phone number and all numbers I know to be associated with him. A few weeks ago, I set my phone to automatically reject all calls with blocked called ID...the problem is, only the ones I answered showed up on my phone bill and those that did show up, are listed as restricted/withheld. The hearing to make the protective/no contact order permanent is scheduled for August 15... is there anyway to obtain this person's phone records to do it?  Also, this individual put a tracking app on my phone and has been monitoring every text, call and google search I make for who knows how long...except of course I can't prove it was him. This is so frustrating. The burden of proof should NOT be on the victim. Just looking for any suggestions or ideas that might help me prove to the judge why the order should be permanent. Thanks.	Yes
105	Hi all, got arrested for possession of marijuana under 50g. I requested discovery including the dash cam footage, (what they sent me isnt even video from my arrest, it's of some other traffic stop that isn't me) and of course lab results. I am hoping that the lab results will take a long time to come back and eventually the court will be pressed to dismiss the case.  It is actually a significant prejudice to me having to take off of work for the morning only court and drive 1.5 hours away to this courthouse.  In addition to all this, I also received a ticket in the mail for possession of CDS in a vehicle, signed 34 days after the initial arrest. It is my understanding that there is a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic violations , therefore I am submitting a motion to dismiss that ticket.   I am representing myself pro se, and would like to know basically how long is reasonable enough to wait for lab results before I ask for dismissal, and is there in fact a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic tickets?   Thank you all in advanced!	Yes
106	I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday.   So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably.   She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony.   Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers.   That sparked a heated argument.   Long story short;   *Sshe got in the car with her kids  * I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers   * She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety  * I stand in front of the car as I call the police  * She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way  * I jumped on the hood  * She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably   * She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me  * Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures    .................  This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed.   Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?  What charges can I have against her?  I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.	Yes
107	Does anyone have any information on what it's like to be the victim when OSI investigates a sexual assault?  I admitted to having been sexually assaulted at AFROTC LEAD in front of my Field Training Officer (FTO). Unbeknownst to me, FTOs  are mandatory reporters. Also, because I am a cadet, my report was considered unrestricted (cadets aren't eligible for restricted reports). I was able to talk to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, and my investigation will take place at my local base rather than Maxwell, AL, and I was told that I can apply to have a Special Victims' Counsel present, but other than that, I don't really know what will happen.   I don't have any rape kits or previous police reports on file. Can OSI make me give them information (especially the name of the person who assaulted me). Can the interview/subpoena people who I have shared the name of my rapist with? I'm a college student and I really don't want to have to undergo legal proceedings. Especially not for something like this. I dramatically altered my life to avoid contact with this guy, and don't want to have to face him in this investigation.   Also, although this is a military investigation, as a cadet, I am contracted, but I believe I'm IRR. Will I continue to have my civilian rights?	Yes
108	My friend was/is on probation for a DWI. He had a month left and he got violated because he tested positive for alcohol twice in a row.  He is currently in county jail and they haven't given him a court date yet. He's been there almost a week. My question is how long can they make him stay and can they sentence him with a full prison sentence even if he paid his restitution and has been on probation for 5 1/2 years.   We reside in New York State.	Yes
109	I'm a 36 year old man.  I live in Massachusetts.    A video went viral recently in a town adjacent mine that showed a group of minors assaulting another group of minors (all about 15).  The aggressors were larger and threw the smaller group to the ground and hit / kicked them while down.  The group being attacked offered no resistance.    As an adult, can I intervene?  Can I pull the aggressors off?  If I'm shoved / hit / kicked, can I fight back?    If I do fight, will I be charged?  If so, would it be child abuse?  If so, could I lose my children (5 y/o twins)?  I know this is a very situation dependent question, but in general, where do you all stand?    Can you intervene?    Would you intervene?  Should you intervene?	Yes
110	I recently got caught with 5 tabs of acid and got a court citation. What should I expect when I go to court and what should I expect to receive as a punishment. I live and got caught in Vermont	Yes
111	Ok, I'm 18 and was being dropped off at my truck yesterday but got caught in heavy rain. Since my friend was dropping me off we decided to smoke a bowl while we waited for the rain to die down. So after about 5 minutes, the rain still hasn't let up and were literally just talking in his car. A cop with flashlight knocks on his window, and says he smells weed. At first we said I was just getting out and about to be on my way, but he cut us off and said give me all the weed in the car or I arrest you both. We both complied and gave it to him (maybe a gram between us).We told them he had all of the bud, but there's other things like grinders and bong. So we get out and stand in the rain while they search the car and go d nothing else. He pats us down and says look out for something in the mail. I asked if it was a fine or a court date or what and he said it's a fine. My question is, will it be like a citation where I can just go pay it and that be the end of it, or will it be court date for a charge, with the fine as punishment for that charge? I'm just trying to gauge how big of a deal this is	Yes
112	Does anybody know if they are not allowed to have pages such as Facebook? I ask because my bio father who I refuse to have contact with is harassing me on Facebook. I am constantly having to block a new page of his. If he is not allowed to have these pages I am more than happy to report it to his probation officer. But seeing as I don't know the correct legal information I as of yet have just been blocking him. Every few months or so I'm having to block him to continue having no contact with him like I have continuously told him I do not want. I have minor children that I want him having nothing to do with.	Yes
113	"Good afternoon. I am a family friend of a disabled person who is in a bit of a pickle, and I'm wondering if you can point me to relevant information on how to proceed.    Quite a mouthful: My family friend has cognitive disabilities that are evident. He went to the mall on a day trip, where a third party salesman at a kiosk talked him into buying more than 1500 dollars worth of gift cards (rather than using his card or cash, which raises alarms since gift cards are notorious liasons for fraud) which were then used to purchase a multitude of accessories, two phones, and a new line of service. A new account was set up under his name. The kiosk entered their own email into his account though, he was not told his username or how to access it, and the security questions were not asked. The store must have put random information in, because when trying to access his account with common answers he gives to those questions, they are all wrong. I believe this was purposeful as the incorrect info made it very difficult to access the account or petition for a refund.   When he arrived home and this was all discovered, the phones and accessories were returned in full with ample time left on their return conditions.   He took back everything to the same kiosk and was told to expect a ""corporate check"" in a few weeks to his home address (we don't know if the address they have is correct, since the information on the account is not accessable due of the incorrect info filled in by the kiosk salesman...) Unfortunately when he returned these products, they handed him one return reciept which was folded- it shows only the return of the accessories, totalling about 185 dollars. The phones he returned are NOT listed on this, and this was not found out until later. They kept his orginal purchase reciept when he made the return.   It has been 2 months and no refund has been received, no corporate contact will speak with us or confirm that they have the reciept of this phone purchase in their system. They refer us only the the kiosk. The third party kiosk has not returned our calls. I am starting to worry that he was the victim of opportunistic fraud and that this is not a civil case.   So, what do you think of all this? Should we pursue civil action/arbitration over the untimely refund, or does this sound like a criminal matter to involve police in? We are unsure what to do and are very unsettled. Thank you!"	Yes
114	Late Saturday night my downstairs neighbors called the police on my husband and I for arguing (the walls are thin here), we did not answer the door because the neighbors call the cops constantly over the most minor things like doing dishes, watching tv, walking around at night and so on, every time we HAVE answered the door in the past the officers simply tell us they got an anonymous complaint for noise, and that they couldn't hear anything, then they leave.  We stopped answering the door quite a while ago, because it's just an annoyance.  However when the police officers arrived Saturday night they MIGHT have heard my husband raising his voice, but we weren't in need of any sort of police assistance, it was just an argument, so we did not answer the door.  Anyway, today (Monday) I got a knock on my door in the morning while I was still in bed, then again at 6:00 PM, both times an officer not in uniform, but with a badge, had a clipboard with paperwork. The 2nd time I did try to answer the door but the officer was already leaving.  My question is this, what could they possibly want?  Could this be related to blatantly not answering the door on Saturday night over a noise complaint?  Or is this possibly a subpoena they are trying to serve on an unrelated case (last year someone attacked me and destroyed some of my property and he's still going through pre-trials)  Either way, I haven't gotten anything in the mail.  I'm just wondering what could be going on.  It's too late for me to call the district attorney's office to ask if this is about the court case I'm a victim in, and I'm scared it might not be about that and might be about that stupid argument my husband and I got into Saturday night....  Anxiety is eating me up about this.	Yes
115	I accepted a small gift from a vendor that provides resources to the public company I work for with the gift being worth about $5. This was an informal chance meeting where the vendor was throwing a mixer and I recognized them, we talked for a bit and they then gave me that gift which I took without even thinking about it. Apparently someone reported this to my company because HR is now calling me in for multiple sessions of intense questioning. I have no authority at my job, I'm just a lower level cog with nobody under me and no purchasing power.   Am I looking at jail-time or a felony? That's what they hinted at in the meetings.	Yes
116	Hello there, so for some time now I have been aware that my older brother (28) has opened up credit card accounts in my name using my social security number. I'm not sure how he could have done that, but in the past he had forged my dad's signature and spent $20k on a credit card opened up in my dad's name. I am 24 years old and live with my parents and occasionally I check my credit report because of student loans. I made an account with credit karma before my brother started the fraud, so that is really the only proof of my own identity. Great Lakes Student Borrower services doesn't even use my name tied with my social security, it is my brother's name now.   I tried confronting him about this two years ago and he has accused me of being on drugs and denied it all. I am pretty much 100 percent sure he is committing fraud against me, and the closer I get to finishing school and thinking about living on my own, the more I realize how screwed I am because of this identity fraud. I am a resident of the State of Wisconsin, my brother is now living in the State of Hawaii and I am suspect that he has also taken out a mortgage using my identity as well, any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
117	"Long story short I got a vandalism charge, and went back the next day to pay the owner for the damage.  It was exactly 250 and the arresting officer ""added"" additional damages to get a felony arrest so it was originally vandalism over 500.  I didn't realize until I got my background check that it is incorrect and has been on my record this entire time.  So that makes me think the amount that I paid my probation was incorrect as well.  What steps can I take to getting this fixed and correcting it to a ""misdemeanor"" which is what it should have been in the first place."	Yes
118	I was pulled over yesterday while on my way to work. I had just lit a cigarette and I guess I was swerving a little bit while trying to light it. It was my first cigarette of the day so I had a pretty strong buzz from it. Usually I don't get much of a buzz but that morning I overslept and was late so I hadn't had breakfast and had only woken up about 15 minutes prior. The officer asked why I was swerving and I told him it was because I was looking at my lighter while trying to light it and told him that I guess it had given me a small buzz. At that point I had no buzz but he told me to get out of the car. He made me do all the things that you'd expect if you were driving drunk and I know I had absolutely no problem doing them but he claimed that I was stumbling and having trouble and arrested me anyway.  At this point I just got home and I'm wondering if any of this could possibly stick? I've never heard of being charged for DWI for nicotine. Is this even possible? What do I even do now?	Yes
119	"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, and it's very long, but I'll give it a shot. Disclaimer: I already know I made poor choices and deserved what I got. Just asking for advice.   I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know).   Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be  a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point.   We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to  get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open.  I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?  Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.  Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did? I was terrified out of my mind..you can't just drive off with someone against their will. Or can you?"	Yes
120	I'm living in Indiana. My girlfriend was on seekingarrangements and she met up with this investment banker who said he was making 500k a year and was going to pay her $500 to meet him at a hotel. At the hotel, she gets a bad feeling about him and says that never mind she doesn't want to go through with it. He hadn't paid her anything yet. He got all angry then saying she wasted his time and had to at least suck his dick. He was going to let her leave. So she pulled a gun on him and he was scared and gave her the money. She blocked him on seekingarrangement but he had her number so he texted her and found her address and facebook and is threatening to come over to her house and report her to the police and tell them that he robbed her. But really, can he even do that since what he was doing is against the law too.	Yes
121	My wife caught my 14 year old nephew molesting my 4 year old daughter last night. They were camping, and the kids were in a tent together.   They were naked and he was on top of her. My daughter said that he has been touching her, and that this is not the first time.   They are on their way to the children's hospital now. My wife said my daughter's labia is red, and that she says it hurts and hurts when she pees.   I am out of the damn country, on business.   I am curious to know what will potentially happen to my nephew. I want him to have consequences, but would prefer he get therapy or something.   I can't find much on a google search, it just looks like he will be charged with sexual assault and face a possibility of 10 years in jail.	Yes
122	"Hello. This sort of thing never happens to me when I'm out so I'm just looking for advice/info.  My friends and I were out at a bar last night, one friend and I were a bit drunk and being stupid, there was a cup of plastic forks/knives on the table and we spilled it over (admittedly this was immature and stupid on my end but I would have cleaned it up). As we do this a bartender walks up to my friend and grabs his shirt and demands he comes with him. So I interjected and said no don't go with him. Then another bartender comes up and physically slams me to the ground, then straddles on top of me for over a half hour. Meanwhile he is aggressively pulling my left arm over my throat and choking me, so I try to fight back and get him off me. He's also laughing at me and saying things like ""you're a faggot. You can't do shit. No one is going to help you"". Then my cell phone falls out of my pocket and another worker walks over, picks it up and takes it away somewhere.  Eventually after a half hour of struggling they let me up and leave, and I had to argue with multiple workers to give me my property back. The guys wouldn't give me their names of course.  I woke up today with a large bruise on my right arm, my left rotator cuff is killing me, and my neck is red.  They could have easily asked us to leave or thrown me out the door, but instead they brought me close to the back of the restaurant and assaulted me.   Can businesses/bars do this to customers? Do I have any legal action I can take? Multiple of my friends witnessed and are willing to testify.   Thanks so much. This was ridiculous."	Yes
123	So I know someone who's dad is a sex offender, they were charged under [THIS](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(5rtlyta3leraxlz35gqsryem))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-750-520c) law. I know they were mentally incompetent. So does this mean the person they raped was between 13 and 16? I don't know if Im reading this right.	Yes
124	"Good morning all,  I've never been a big believer in ghosts. I believe in the afterlife, but not ghosts.  About a year ago I saw a post on Craigslist looking for a ""Supernatural tester"" to come to a womans house and test if it was haunted. She said she required some evidence of legitimacy to be hired. So I printed out a license that stated I was licensed to ""Ghoul Inspect"" by the United Paranormal Hunting Association(UPHA). Technically, this is true. But I had started UPHA about an hour after I saw the CL posting. So I licensed myself.   Anyway, I went to the (obviously not) ""haunted house"" and looked around. I said that there were no ghosts and only took half of what she offered(She offered $300 so I took $150). I figured this was a win/win/win in a kind of scumbag way but at the same time the girl said the other people who emailed wanted $900 and she *was going to pay it*. Plus she would have been told they were real.  Anyway, so I realized how amazing this is for money, so I did it to other people, all while making the operation look more and more legitimate.   At my best after bringing in two friends to help, I made $1700 from 12 people in a single week for about 10 hours worth of work.   Anyway so this is one of the two cases that worries me.   The first is this:  So about 3 months ago I met this Super Atheist and she lived with an older lady(Her aunt). Her aunt was quite wealthy(they own a local business in a ritzy part of Maine, you'd know it if you lived there) and she had inherited it. The aunt basically bankrolls this young girl. The Aunt was convinced she was being haunted by a ghost, but she didn't know who(though she had a few ideas which I won't divulge because of privacy). So the younger girl(Sara) wouldn't agree to call the more expensive ""paranormal investigators"" but called me because I charge $150 for initial investigations, and that was worth it to put the issue to rest.   So I went there, and here is the thing, I said the house *was* haunted. I needed the return business. I'm not proud, but I did some bad things. I moved items when they were in the bathroom, at one point I took a recorder and stuck it in her ACHV unit to make screaming/moaning noises. All in all, I'm a terrible person and I admit that.   Anyway, the woman passed and I went over to the house of Sara and said how sorry I am.  But Sara was now convinced that the house was haunted. I know how bad this is because this girl is an atheist with a near ivy-league degree in a STEM Field. My practice *really* fucked her up.   Not knowing what to do, I doubled down.   I did just about the worst thing I'd ever done and I took the spare key to the house she gave me and I paid a man to wait in the basement when she came home and then act as scary as possible(he also stole a painting, but I didn't tell him to do that). I thought he would just like pound the walls and then I could say we caught him and the ghost is gone, your aunt is at peace etc etc etc.  Instead this fucking idiot straight up ran after making some screaming noises in the basement and the *GIRL WAS HOME*. I mean he ran out of the basement, and she was him! She got scared out of her mind and then called me.  So I ditched it. I ended the whole practice, changed my number, etc. The ""address"" was just a PO box so I stopped paying for it.  That concerns me but it's on the backburner.  The second one is what worries me.  So after a few weeks had passed I got the service going on the DL and some girl said she needed help. Yadda yadda yadda, I did the standard procedure while mentioning that her daughter might be experiencing some hauntings.  This stupid bitch went out and paid for a $4,900 unofficial exorcism by an unlicensed priest!  So I don't know what to do. What if she comes after me? I never said to do that! Am I in the legal right here? Do I double down and endorse the exorcism?"	Yes
125	So I am wanted for a pretty serious crime, like probably the first or second biggest one. There is a international warrant for my arrest. I want to look at my options with a lawyer and see what the best way to approach this is. Say I meet up with one, and tell him my situation, can he tell the police.. Lets say I dont pick him, can he call the police and say hes in this state.. etc.	Yes
126	Is there any ways I can fight this in court? They didnt find any actual pot but the pipe itself was dirty. Does that actually count as possession of marijuana in virginia? And if I Wasnt distributing the bowl to anyone and only had it for personal use, what would the correct charge and penalty be? Having trouble finding this information online.  I was given Asap and a 500$ fine but if theres any way I can get this reverted to a different charge and a lesser fine that would be really helpful.	Yes
127	(VA) My friend let her boyfriend stay the night. She didn't know earlier that day he had committed a crime by going to his ex and stealing her things, hitting his ex, and so on. She also didn't know he had a preexisting record. A few days later he had to turn himself in. She was wondering if she would be in trouble for letting him stay the night? Could she be called in as a witness?	Yes
128	Hi legaladvice,  Last night I was out with friends and drank a bit too much. Called for an Uber car, a driver pulled up to the spot we were waiting at and claimed he was from Uber.  I gave him my address and he claimed the ride would be $75 when it should have only been $25 max. He agreed to $25 and asked for my debit card and runs it through his limo company's app, asking me to sign. I did not sign. I wake up this morning to a charge for $75. Ive already called my bank and explained that:  1) I was overcharged 2) I did not agree to $75  3) If there is a signature, it is not mine.  Ive already started the dispute process. Will they side with me?	Yes
129	"I intend to apply for my FID license in the near future. However I am in a bit of a pickle with question 5 on the application (**Have you ever been arrested or appeared in court as a defendant for any criminal offense**). I was arrested four years ago when I was 16. My understanding is that the case was CWOF and ultimately dismissed. I don't remember many specific details regarding this as it was a very complicated and stressful time in my life. The only paperwork I was able to dig up regarding the case was a form regarding pre-trial probation. I would like to be as truthful as possible on the license application but I simply do not have as much information regarding this as I'd like.  **Do I even need to include these specifics? The form only asks for ""dates, circumstances, and location"". Does this include every court date relevant to this arrest?** As I recall there were several. **Where would I get this information (arrest date+charges, court dates+other info)?**  On a slightly different but related note I was also in juvenile court earlier in my life because of a CHINS petition related to school truancy. My understanding is that this is not relevant because I was not a defendant for a criminal offense but I'd like to clarify that."	Yes
130	Hello Reddit. I wanted to see if someone could give me some steps to follow to begin work on expunging my felony record in Wyoming? I was charged with delivering a schedule 3 substance and also conspiracy about 15 years ago. I received 2 yrs probation (completed with no issue) for the charges and have not even had a speeding ticket since! I am a totally different person now with a great paying job and a family of 4 that I support. I want to put this behind me for good and would like to be able to vote or have a gun to protect my family if needed. I looked it up and it seems that in Wyoming I would not be disqualified from expungement with my charges but I do not know the first step in getting started. Of course I could start calling lawyers but I thought I would check here first to see if there is anything I can do on my own to save that expense. I am now living in a different state (thank god!) that is far away from there so I can’t just stroll into the local courthouse for help. Thanks in advance for any tips!	Yes
131	Okay so I had my identity stolen from me and there was a welsfargo bank account open in my name and everything. I got the paper work and there are signatures with my name on the fraud check cashed and the fraudulent account opened . but the signatures arnt how I sign my name. And the account is negative $1800 what legal ground do I have	Yes
132	Hello all, I received a PI in the Travis county area in Texas and have yet to even go to court for the misdemeanor. I have no blemishes on my record and wish to expunge the misdemeanor ASAP. However I have no idea how to go about it or what to even say when I walk in the court room in a few days. All advice is welcome, thank you!	Yes
133	New York here. Ill just state the whole situation, so on July 3rd, officer caught me &amp; friend urinating behind a car by the beach (no bathrooms nearby). We talk to him at the car and asks us for our ID, I stupidly give him my fake ID name as i am under  the legal drinking age. He starts to type in info and i realize how stupid that was so i give him my real info. Officer cuffs me &amp; pats me down (was never read rights?) and driven back to station . I was charged with PL 245.01 (exposure of a person), was told likely an ACD for ~6mo.  Just a few questions, is it recommended to get a lawyer for this or is it something i could handle? i only ask because in my position a lawyer would be hard to afford. Am i entitled to a court appointed defender/lawyer or anything of the sorts? also if the only charge was the exposure of a person is a judge able to see anything reguarding the fake ID.  Any help is appreciated &amp; sorry for the wall of text guys, just bugging out seeing as my court date is the 17th and trying to figure out what the next move is.	Yes
134	I have a friend who has a probation violation warrant out. He skipped out of dwai probation 3 years ago because his life was unstable. This was his first offense. Since then he's kept a steady job almost 2 years, started taking college courses and kept a stable apartment. He's ready to turn himself in and deal with the consequences. His goal is to get bail. Go to court. Hopefully be reinstated. Then comply with all probation rules and complete it. Any advice on to go about that? He has a lawyer who offered a flat rate of 2,000 for help. But he can't afford that and makes too much to qualify for a public defender.	Yes
135	When I was homeless, I left my vape out on the window ledge. And after coming back from being scammed by a fake landlord my neighbour was peeping through the fence at me. He had my vape and he turned it on and a vape cloud formed and he was coughing.  Afterwards a signal went off and people surrounded the garden ( either he was trying to scare me. Or he called police in claiming I was trying to attack him, or a mafia. Cameras were popping up in the hedge and I could hear a helicopter and things spraying and trying to shock us.  I've tried reporting this to the police but there's no evidence. The vape cost me £120 and because he is an old man the police would beleive him over me and people would also beleive him over me and my family and parents down beleive me where it happend.  Is there anything I can actually do about this?	Yes
136	"Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos.   He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes

138	I gave my friend money to lend and believed her story. Today, I thought I was dropping her off to see her mother, but I drove her to pick up heroin from her drug dealer. I had no idea this was happening, and I'm scared and worried for the child. The grandparents are likely to get CPS and the police involved.   I just would like to know what to expect from my end; will I be called in to give information or have to testify in court, if it happens? What is the process involving opiate addiction and pregnancy? Will I get in trouble?  Thanks.	Yes
139	So i met this girl at a club in Berlin and we instantly hit it off. I invited her to take a drink with me at the bar, she agreed and we drank the first sip together at the bar. She then introduced me to her brother, who was 15 years old, and all three of us started dancing. She started holding my hand and moving me closer to her. So i moved and she started dancing dirty with me. After a while i kissed her on the forehead and she just went mad, she took my to another area and we started kissing. She then just suddenly stop and told me she needs to look for her brother. I said okay and thought nothing of it. I returned to the dance floor and started dancing, and she then just found me, came up to me and started kissing me. I thought okay she must have found her brother and told him something so we went to the bathroom and started having sex, she gave me various sexual acts and never once said, implied, nor showed that she was not consenting to this, and told me explicitly to put it in. After we finished i went to take a drink and came back to check up on her. I found her still naked with vomit all over her. I went in cleaned and dressed her up and found her brother to take her home. After a couple of days i got arrested and now accused of a rape charge. She claims that i drugged her drink and went in on her in the bathroom and she started pushing me way and shouting at me. None of which has happened! I dont know anyone who was in the club so i dont have any witnesses who could testify that we were just kissing with her full consent. This is a nightmare i am living and could ruin my whole life. Just the accusation of rape has serious repercussions. What can i do to prove she was consenting, and how can i move forward ? Please help me r/legaladvice	Yes
140	Hello please help if you can! My fiancé now 27 got into an altercation with his child's mother when he was 19 and because of that they gave him a felony and made him register as an predatory offender for 10 years. Years have gone by and all has been fine. 6 months ago he got his first dui. They put him on probation for two years. In bad luck he recently became homeless and did not have a valid address for two months. The officer called him and told him to check in yesterday because they haven't heard from him since may. So he went in today and they arrested him. Now they are charging him with a felony and his court is in 48 hours (Thursday). We can't afford a lawyer, already told the people he was homeless. I am so scared what's going to happen! We are in the state of Minnesota. Please give advice or help I am so worried!!! -Gypsy	Yes
141	Hello everyone. I have a friend, she is 17. She lives in a Muslim household that greatly restricts her freedom. She is not allowed to leave the house for anything but work or school. She's had a history of self-harm, eating disorder, and various mental illness. Her parents have actively berated her for these issues, saying 'you're a disgrace to this family' 'you ruined our lives' etc. She's gotten in trouble for sneaking out and smoking cigarettes, sure, not right, but the punishment was a closed hand beating every time. She was caught trying to sneak out last night, and in a weird trance, told her mother everything she's done. She admitted to not believing in God, having multiple boyfriends (which is not allowed), and still smoking.    Now, her father, who is a pilot, is away for now, and she wants to get out before he comes home. There's been multiple instances of the mother having to stand between her and the father to stop further harm being done to her. Her life is genuinely in danger, as not believing in God is about the worst thing she could've said.   What should be done here? She wants to run away and call the police, will they help? Or will they send her back, as she has no markings from any previous beatings. Any other course of action to take here? Sorry if this isn't the right sub.	Yes
142	Like the title states when I was 19 I was an escort for about a year. I was groomed into it by a man I met online. Tony. When I met him I was under the impression he wanted to be my sugar daddy. Instead I was greeted by him and a couple of his girls at a nice hotel. One girl in particular was the star of the show. We were all taken care of by her. Her name was Mo. They promised up to 1,000$ a day for my services. I didn't have a choice I had nothing. We were forced to see up to 8 guys in a single day. Then cut our profit with Tony.  However eventually I came to my senses, took my cash and cut ties. It was incredibly corrupt. They remained bitter at me, sending the occasional threatening message. Very petty nothing worth worrying about. He had my real information such as my email &amp; full name.   Cut to about a year later and a former client sends me a news article. Seems Tony got greedy and started his own service. Except he had really fucked up. He was a third striker caught with an underage girl. Mo lured her in so she was also caught and they went to jail. I was completely removed from their life when they made these choices. Cut to three days ago. I get an email from a detective. He knows my full name. He wants to speak to me immediately. Wants to know everything I know. What the heck do I do!!! I'm terrified.	Yes
143	I am engaged to a prisoner who is being held at a detention center in Maryland. He is currently awaiting trial. For a number of reasons, we would like to be married as soon as possible.  I do have an appointment with a lawyer of my own later this week but wanted to see if anyone could advise if our plans would result in a valid marriage.  I have gotten a family member ordained online already. Our plan is for me to pick up the marriage license, and after the 2 day waiting period, have the ordained family member pronounce us married during a visit.  Would this wedding be considered valid? There is a chapel and he can put in a request, but we prefer to do this as outlined above.  Thanks for any insight you can offer.	Yes
144	The Title says it all. I know I could find this info by doing some digging, but I'm extremely lazy. A friend of mine wants to know for whatever reason. he lives in Colorado but goes to school here with me in Louisiana. I know that it's probably not legal in either state, but if it's not what would the penalties be? Misdemeanor, Felony? And what would the fines look like, etc.	Yes
145	So back in Feb 2017 I was very stupid and drove after drinking. I have a lawyer and he has looked at the video and everything and says that while the stop may be challenged that if I loose then I have to go through the trial and I could lose more because I was clearly drunk in the video. I've reviewed the evidence myself and I agree with him completely.  I am mostly just concerned about the First Offenders Program in general. I live in MD and never plan to drink or drive again. I don't mind doing the classes, or getting the evaluations, or joining AA because I was wrong and I could have really hurt someone or myself.  I am just wondering how this is going to look on my record.	Yes
146	"So, I'm scared, as you can tell by the title. Why? I live in Idaho and they're very strict with their laws containing marijuana. I was driving home from work at 12am, on a Sunday and was extremely tired. Someone (I wasn't paying much attention to anyone following me as I was just trying to get home and go to sleep) was following me home and called me in as a DUI because I was swerving on the road. I get home and get ready to snuggle in my bed from a long 8 hour shift when I hear a knock on the door. Now, I live with my parents so the first thing I did was run to my parents room and tell them there was someone knocking on our door but i told them it didn't sound as if it was a cop. (I thought it was our neighbor.) My parents go to the door and they ask for me. I come to the door and they flash a flashlight at me and ask if I am drinking or have been drinking. I reply ""no, I just got off work and I'm tired"" they ask me a couple other questions and then finally told me that they knew I wasn't under the influence. They didn't give me a sobriety test either. I explained that I was tired from a long shift which caused me to swerve on the road. THIS IS WHERE IT WENT DOWN. He asked for my drivers license and walked to my car with me. I opened my door and he immediately says my car reeks of marijuana. I act somewhat dumb knowing I had some from a previous incident. He asks if he can search my car (me being dumb, let's him search) he finds a little purse with a bag of marijuana (a gram or less) and my grinder (which I bought at a 18+ tabacoo shop.) Also, I'm 18 if that helps with anything. He then says he won't arrest me as it's minor and he has better things to do. He understood that I was a good kid and said he hopes to see me in a few years with a badge on and promised that he wouldn't judge me for this. I'm going to school for criminal justice (yes, I know. Stupid discussion making on my part. I already know and have already knocked myself down for it. All I can do is learn from this.) I have nothing on my adult record (I had diversion when I was 15 for alcohol but finished the program.) He then wrote me a citation for possession of marijuana and possession of phara. There was also a date on the citation as to when I need to call the clerk of justice to schedule a court date. I'm so scared as I've already mentioned. I want to be a detective/profiler and I'm currently going to school for criminal justice as my major and psychology as my minor. I work two jobs and also volunteer for my community to help better my experience when I want to apply for a future job. Just have a couple questions I feel I need answered to relive my stress/anxiety I'm having. Some you may or may not know the answers to but if you've had previous experience with these charges, your experience and knowledge would be very appreciated. What should I expect at my court date? I'm going to plea guilty (I can't afford a lawyer and I really just don't think it'll help me in the long run.) Would it be considered my second offense since I got diversion when I was 15? Or would it be considered my first offense as I'm now an ""adult?"" Should I be taking online or in person drug and alcohol classes to be proactive about my charges before I appear in court? Would that look good to the judge or be a waste of time and money? Will I go to jail? (Super scared about this.) Since it's my first adult offense, could it play out that I go to court and he/she just issues me a fine to pay and I move on with my life? (I know that's very unlikely but I'm just trying to hope for a light in this darkness.) Would I likely be going on unsupervised probation or supervised probation for these charges? I was also going to bring any further information that would show I'm not just some stoner who doesn't do anything with their life like - my two scholarships I recently received my senior year of high school, a copy of my diploma showing I graduated high school, my top scholar reward I received from my school, proof of my high GPA? It could mean nothing to him or her but would it help me in any factor? Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm nervous, scared, and ashamed. I don't need to hear that I made a mistake. I'm very aware and won't be repeating this mistake ever again. I talked to a couple people at my school and they said it won't effect my schooling. I know it's just marijuana but it's my career that I'm scared for. It wasn't worth it. My future/career is so much more important. Thank you for taking the time to read. I hope it made some sense. I'm nervously typing."	Yes
147	"For ease, I will describe what I understand to be true as fact. I'm happy to clarify anything that seems unlikely, my information comes from various sources including the subject.   A transient (T) was falsely arrested a few months ago. She was already on probation for multiple minor charges (i.e. drunk in public), when she was shopping at a local store and had an altercation with an employee. The police were called, they looked for a reason to arrest her, and the store clerk said T spit on her. T is adamant that any spit that may have come out was accidental because she was talking loudly.   After some time trying to meet probation requirements, T was eventually picked up for missing a court date and has been in jail awaiting trial for months. Her Public Defender was going to take it to trial because the DA wouldn't budge and wanted to throw the book at her, the PD thought that was dumb. For background: T is mentally ill, physically disabled, has cognitive impairments, TBI, has been living on the streets for a decade, in and out of jail for minor offenses and drugs but nothing serious.   T has court this morning, and I found out late last week that it is for sentencing. I spoke to T (who is not always the most reliable source, but tends to be honest with me), and her PD convinced her to plea no contest, otherwise they were going to give her a year and a half because ""the judge doesn't want a trial."" Her PD also told her she'd seen surveillance video, which does *not* show the store clerk reacting as though she'd been spat on.  I'm concerned T doesn't understand that pleading no contest to something she was falsely arrested for means she won't be able to potentially recover damages from the false arrest (she had been trying really hard at that point and there had been some improvement, and she was *on her way to therapy* when this incident happened). I want to send an email to her PD before the sentencing to express my concerns that T isn't fully mentally competent and that she doesn't understand the implications here. I have about an hour.  Also, I know this kind of plea coercion is common, but I hope I don't sound too naive when I say I don't like it being used on a vulnerable member of the population. She has literally no resources in life, it was all too easy for a retail clerk to get annoyed that her authority wasn't respected and have this person incarcerated for months for it, and the police actively helped.   Question is: Anything specific I should/shouldn't say in this letter?"	Yes
148	Last night I got hit with a possession and paraphernalia citation. I'm in Missouri so their new decriminalization law of marijuana keeps the fine to only $25 but that's not all I am worried about.   I was sitting at my buddies house waiting for him to come home, he was taking longer than usual so I had been sitting there for a solid 20 minutes or so and then some cops pull up. They tell me one of the neighbors called about a suspicious car (which is BS because I have had this car for 3 years and am at this buddies house at a minimum of once a week, I am 100% sure they have seen my car on multiple occasions)   I wasn't smoking, not even a cig, my car was off and I was just browsing Reddit. When the cop started to talk to me he noticed a blunt on my floorboard. They of course confiscated everything, but they were very nice about it, probably understanding it was just coincidence and I wasn't even doing anything.   I ended up getting a citation for possession and paraphernalia and my court date is in October. Now what I'm really worried about is the fact I want to be a firefighter, I'm already certified but I'm worried about getting hired somewhere now. I haven't been smoking very long, and was going to quit once I started taking some more classes in the fall. Is there any way I can keep this off my record? It would pretty much destroy my whole plan in life if I can't be a firefighter, I've been training and taking classes for it since high school.   Any help or suggestions would be great, my buddy said I should get a lawyer to try and keep it off my record, but I don't know if that would actually work, and I don't have tons of spare cash lying around for one. Thank you.	Yes
149	"My rap sheet consists of 1 DUI, which most companies I want to work at don't consider to be a disqualification. I got a job offer at my dream company and now I have to wait on the background check. I've seen a report from a background check company before and it has all ""gory details"" of the court case, including aggravating factors that were ultimately ignored. Can a background check company use all that info against me or can they only report on the fact that I have a *Gross Misdemeanor - Driving Under the Influence, 1st Offense*."	Yes
150	My mom suffers from bipolar manic depression. My wife and I went to go stay with her 7 years ago. She threatened to call 911 on me when she was having a manic episode. I called 911 to get them to come take her back to the hospital to get her some help. She lied to the police and told them they pulled her hair. My wife told them she didn't see me do that. They took me to jail anyway. I plead no contest to get out of jail because I was pretty ignorant at the time and had my ability to purchase a firearm prohibited. I still can't afford a lawyer. What should I do to get the false conviction off my record and restore my 2nd Ammendment right to purchase own and carry a firearm. I want to be able to defend my family and myself in an emergency. Please help. Thanks	Yes
151	"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."	Yes
152	Hi I'm 15 years old and three days ago received a citation for a curfew violation. I snuck out with two other friends and we did fireworks illegally at a neighborhood lake. When we accidentally exploded a firework that was supposed to be thrown underwater we ran far away into another neighborhood. On our way home a civilian started to follow us. We asked a neighbor for help because we were concerned and did not know what the suspicious car wanted. The cops came and witnesses reported us 'Trying to open car doors' (complete lie) we made it clear that we were just walking home. The neighbor that we asked for help happened to be apart of H.O.A and someone took pictures of us doing fireworks. So the cops knew we did fireworks but since I was not in possession of them I did not get a ticket. (My friend had the fireworks and ran before the cops came)   So I thought that I could just go and pay the fine but it turns out I actually have to go to court. My court date is a little while from now and I'm very worried. This is my first bad encounter with the police and do not know what to do. I'm afraid to answer if the judge asks what was I doing and I say fireworks he will charge me the maximum fine ($500)   What do I say or do? I just want to say that I was walking home. (Which I was) and not mention the fireworks. But I'm worried someone sent them the pictures. Please help.	Yes
153	Hello! So my girlfriend has received a traffic citation on Friday from an apparently hit and run accident on June 18th. It's a misdemeanor failure to stop property damage citation with no insurance/registration(She has proof of both)  She is very unsure of this whole deal, I'm just trying to find some answers to help ease her uncertainty. I know the basics of never talk to police, get a lawyer etc. but I don't have much knowledge and feel bad I can't help more.  She is claiming not to remember any accident, or damage to her car. I believe there may be a scratch on her mirror that's about 2cm but she says it's been there before.   Anyways I'm wondering what to tell her to do besides getting/talking to lawyers, what's the worst case scenario outcome, no criminal record, first offense, one speeding ticket 6 years ago etc. and since there is only the failure to stop property damage citation(well no insurance and registration C/I's that she has proof of so no biggie), does that mean it's just the only accusation we have to worry about? Reckless/careless driving or other things at a later date from this incident isn't a concern right?    Just want to give her some clarity on everything and what she's facing, thanks so much. Let me know if you need anymore info.	Yes
154	So I will keep this brief. Bought cigs for a friend since she is between paychecks. She told me I would have to buy them as her license was expired and the place we were at has legitimately given her shit for expired license before. She can not get her license renewed until she passes some court mandated course or whatever. I dont have all the details.   Anyways long story short. I Buy them for her and a cop sees me hand them to her after buying them. He checks her ID, sees the date, and then tells her that it is expired and that he would need a valid ID.   She says that is all she has and that I was driving. Cop looks at me and takes my license. He goes into his car and comes back out with a ticket for me to sign. Buying cigs for a minor...   The date clearly says born in 94 on her license but because its expired he apparently can ignore this?   Is there an easy way I can get this dismissed? I do not have the money for a lawyer as I recently had to pay for hernia surgery and I am tapped till the end of the year.   Can I get her to take her birth cert, SS card, and expired license with me up to the courthouse?	Yes
155	So, I went on a date last week that ended up with me and the girl making out in my car. She had stated that she didn't want to have sex and I agreed. We made it pretty heavily for about twenty minutes and she started pulling on her clothes and said she wanted to go inside. I said okay and she kissed me and told me to text her when she got home. I got home and texted her and she responded hours later saying that she thought I was disgusting and never wanted to see me again. I just had a missed call from the police saying they wanted to talk to me about the incident. I have never been involved with the police ever. What do I do?	Yes
156	It's just the morning after and I'm still a bit shaken over this, but not entirely sure which steps to take.  Last night my bf and I got into a fight over something trivial (he's currently staying with me while he sublets his apartment, until our new lease starts - yes I signed a lease with him).   During the argument I told him that I needed space and couldn't talk to him about this right now- I just wanted to be alone. He ended up locking me out of my room because I stupidly left the key inside and he took and hid my phone as well. When I was finally able to open the door he wouldn't let me through the doorway and ended up shoving me to the ground twice.  At some point- it's all a blur now, I make it past him and grab keys/phone and leave to take a walk.  I was on the phone with my best friend for the entirety of the walk, about 15 min. When I get back to the apt the front door is ajar, and my bedroom is locked. It took a while to open it because the lock had been damaged- when I finally got it open my entire room was trashed. There are several minor damages to the room, and after inventory my computer and a few other possessions (of low value) are missing.  I called the police and filed a report, can pick it up today and see if any charges can be pressed. They advised a restraining order (he's also known to be violent and had been in the past).  I'm at a friend's house now, as he still has copies of the apartment key. All of this puts me in a financial mess- we were signed to live together at the end of the month, obviously that's not happening but I'm signed onto that lease and have nowhere to go after 8/31.  What other actions can I take? Any hopes of getting my computer back or suing for damages?  TL;DR- got in a argument with bf, left him alone in apt, returned to find room trashed and computer stolen (and he put his hands on me).	Yes
157	I was in a car accident a few weeks ago after buying a gram from a dealer.  The cops showed up to help despite both of the cars begin drivable, none of the airbags deployed, and only my car sustained damage.  The accident was my fault, just to be completely transparent. I was also not under the influence of any drugs.  One of the officers said he smelled marijuana in my car and told me he wouldn't bust me if I gave it to him.  I told him I didn't have any but gave in and gave him the gram of weed.  They then asked me to help him bust the dealer who sold me it so that they wouldn't charge me with a misdemeanor which I did, however, I was under the impression it would be a one time thing. He said I wouldn't want a misdemeanor so I should help him bust the dealer. I did that once and was just called back to do it again although I was told it would only be once.  This occurred in my old home town which is an hour or two away. I'm starting school soon and don't have much money so I can't afford to get up there with gas and tolls. I was wondering if I am obligated to do this again or what my rights are within this situation.	Yes
158	Looking to understand the route to go here - My brother was stopped at a DUI checkpoint less than half a mile from a bar where he had only had 2 beers. He had beer in his mouth when they breathalyzed because of the proximity to the bar, so he blew a higher BAC than was accurate (though still very low) and the cop charged him with a DUI misdemeanor and made him spend the night in jail with no priors. He is looking to bring the charge down to zero and keep his record clean. He has gotten mixed info on whether to use a private or public attorney, with the argument for public being that his case is straight forward. He has one year left in grad school so is concerned about a mark on his record impacting his job prospects, but is also cash-strapped from school. Looking for advice on best way to approach this, thanks!!	Yes
159	Can someone help me find a warrant? I have called the jails. The only thing I have is the Warrant or Case Number.	Yes
160	[TL;DR I have an assumed bench warrant out for my arrest because I failed to show up for an out of state court summons. I was offered a chance to pay a fine after I emailed the Colorado DA but couldn't afford it at the time. Now that I'm wanting to go back to Co, I need to figure out if I even have a bench warrant or anything to pay]  I'm from California and have (had?) a bench warrant out for an unfortunate event that I was ticketed for in Breckenridge, Colorado. I got the the ticket about six years ago and have never taken care of it because I thought I would never be going back to Co.. that is, until a month ago. I was just curious if bench warrants expire after a certain amount of time? I'd like to get this taken care but was curious to know if there'd be anything to even take care of any more. I googled whether or not b.w's expire and I read that after 180 days they fall off, is this true? IF they don't, I'd like to take care of it and was wondering what the best way to do that would be.   For the backstory: A close friend and I were snowboarding and were riding down a groomed trail when we (stupidly) got the urge to ride down an unmarked section. There was a big gap in the boundary line so we veered off and started down some back country. It wasn't anything insane, just a densely packed forested area with some pretty heavy powder. We ended up going a long way down and basically got stuck as there were no trails or roads at the bottom and going all the way back up in heavy boots was impossible because of how deep the snow was. Finally got a hold of ski patrol who managed to find us from a service road which was literally about 100 feet away.. just couldn't see it from our vantage point (face palm of the century). Shouldn't have happened to begin with though and I certainly learned my lesson.  Ski patrol and police were obviously not very enthused with our decision and we were promptly issued with a summons for a court date set for a few months later. I ended up sending an email to the DA asking if there was anything that could be done so that I didn't have to go all the way back to Colorado and he basically extended an opportunity to just pay a fine (somewhere around $400 I believe). However, I was young and didn't have that kind of money at the time and after a while, just decided to not pay it as I chalked it up to not ever having to go back to Colorado again. Now that I actually want to, I'm worried that I could get arrested on the off-chance I get my id checked. Regardless, I'd like to handle things now that I can afford to pay the fine (if that would still even be an option).  Apologies about the novel, just wanted to be clear. Format might also be messed up because of mobile	Yes
161	Background: Months of stalking &amp; bedroom peeping that resulted in a 6 month criminal ordeal in which I was the victim witness. I got a harassment prevention order. Criminal charges were dismissed due to prosecution making a clerical error. Currently, there are no active criminal charges, he's not on probation, all I have is the HPO. It was a traumatizing ordeal.  The other day I legally obtained physical(ish) proof that he recently went behind my house (not on property) while I was home, within 50 yds of me (HPO definition), and was in a place where you can see directly into my bedroom windows! Be clear, this was no accident- he went to the window peeping spot and turned around. I desperately don't want to trigger another criminal offense, go to court, etc. I'm trying to move out of state in six weeks and can't be another victim witness.   I was reading my HPO and it says that he can't contact me- but says nothing about me contacting him. Is this something that I can do to tell him to stay away? It would be a carefully worded e-mail (no harassment, want to explain the 50 yd radius and tell him to stay out of it in case he forgot). I'm not sure if I will do it, but just wanted to know if it's legal given the circumstances.  Can I get in trouble for doing that?	Yes
162	"Is it normal for a California court to fudge up your records?   I was supposed to have 2 previous arrests ""dismissed"" via expungement and well, they never did I guess. It took me being denied a really good job 3 years later to figure this out too.   I have the court documents that say my charges have here by been dismissed but my DOJ record is saying something different. What do I do? Do I have any sort of recourse against the court house for not getting that job. (I'm sure I don't, I'm just pretty broken up about it)  Thanks Legal Advice!"	Yes

164	The text basically sums it up. My mom received a call about rewards points and things pertaining to a car my dad has never owned. The account was under his name. My mom suspects my older brother could be using my dad's information to open up accounts. However, there really is no tangible proof that my brother is the one doing this, but he is known for needing money quite often. He and his wife are living above their means in a house they cannot afford, and they both have had lots of car troubles. My grandmother has had to bail him out after he took out payday loans in the past.  Anyway, other than advising my dad to contact the credit bureaus and a lawyer, is there anything else that can be done to find out who is doing this (whether it is my brother or someone else) and how to mitigate the damage?	Yes
165	They are not answering their phones.  I have the title so it's still technically my car and if they won't pay for it, then would I be able to report to the police that they have stolen it?    Or would I get in trouble for that? I mean technically if you are supposed to pay for something but then u don't it is stealing.	Yes
166	"Police saw I had a fake or otherwise not mine, parking pass one day while I wasn't with my car. Long story short They found me a week later in my car about to leave it on the street in a 2hour parking. I didn't give it to them but I may have given them enough information to meet the low standard of probable cause. The officer wanted to meet with me later in the week so I could hand him the pass and, ""aren't in any trouble just want the pass"". I talked to two criminal attorneys that said to not meet or give up the pass to this guy. My thing is, during the initial talk I gave him my license to check and my cell phone #. If he does end up trying to call me my idea is to not answer. Not that the problem will necessarily go away but I don't want to give any more information to this guy. Thoughts?   If i get a criminal complaint, will be hiring a lawyer for the clerk hearing for sure."	Yes
167	We've been in the process of moving out for about a week now. Our house is just about empty. Yestersay, our neighbors came over to help up move the heavier furniture. In our living room, on a desk that's still there, I had a wooden stand with a large foot long dagger on it. I know for a fact the dagger was still there at the time. My father bought this dagger for me from a flea market when I was a little kid, and it is very sentimental to me. We've searched our house and what little is left in it, and we've just finished searching our new home in case someone had packed and moved it but forgot, but the knife is nowhere to be seen. This points to one of my neighbors having stolen it. If this is true, what kind of legal action can I pursue  in trying to get my property back?	Yes
168	"Throw away for super obvious reasons. TLDR: Dr. groped and propositioned me and. now won't send medical records to new doctors.     I saw this doctor for almost 7 years without major issue, he was always a bit flirty but in the last few months he had made some ""jokes"" that made it obvious he was getting a little out there. During  my last visit during the first week of June he asked to view my scars from a skin removal and breast augmentation. This made sense because all these years later I still have nylon sutures that very painfully come to the surface and breakthrough the skin.   This part is super hard to type out, idk why but I can't get it out of my head, can't sleep, can't stop thinking about it.    He repeatedly rubbed his hands around the scar from my lower body lift and then closed the room door and asked to see the scars on my breasts. I was not aware anyone else should be in the room so please don't yell at me about it. He then proceeded to rub his hands all over my breast ""feeling for sutures"" and after about 30 seconds I started totally freaking out because it was going where there weren't any. Then he proceeded to ask me repeatedly if I would ""play"" and if I liked to play, how he was a boob guy and an old man like him was just happy to touch them. I completely shut down as a human and said no I'm happily married and my scars weren't bothering me, pulled my bra back up and shirt back down. He then kept making comments about how I was probably grossed out and would tell my husband, I think I was in complete shock and I just needed to leave that room asap so I made a comment about no big deal I just need to run home to pick up my kid so I needed to get going. I knew I needed to find a new Dr right away and should officially tell someone but I was so ashamed, so embarrassed that this could happen to me and that I didn't handle it by yelling for someone to come in the room.. I just had no idea what to do.     So a few days later I'm sitting there watching the news and I see he was arrested for sexually assaulting another patient. It turns  It he's been doing stuff like that for awhile.  I have 2 new doctors that have changed my quality of life tremendously in less than a month as far as changing nearly every medication and actually checking my vitals. Previous Dr. checked  maybe twice in 6 years. Now the issue is his office will not send my medical records to the new doctors despite several requests and my signing all the documents for it to happen.   I don't know what to do. Should I still go file a police report about what he did to me ? How can I obtain my medical records if his office won't send them to my new doctors after almost 7 weeks of requesting them?   I'm a hot mess, I can't get it out of my head and I feel disgusting, depressed and ashamed of myself for not speaking up right away.   Thank you for wading through to the bottom of my post and for any advice in the right direction."	Yes

170	"My ex who I have been friends with is dating someone new. She tried to befriend me a year ago and I was nice to her. She gave me a bunch of clothes she didn't want and then much later asked for them back but since they were mine I gave them away. She's now saying I stole from her.   My ex gave me 1600 dollars a year ago when my family had a huge rough patch and he and I have no contract of this and he knows I'll pay him back as I earn it but now the new girlfriend is stating she can get me for 1600 dollars.  She's been sending me messages for a year and I've repeatedly asked her to stop and she doesn't. Sometimes I would respond but when I realized she was harassing me I told her to stop and asked my Ex to ask her to quit.   Two days ago I asked my ex a question through text and he ignored me and then I got a text from the girlfriend threatening me. I texted my ex very angrily stating I can't believe he would let someone else talk for him instead of just answering me. It was a low point of very angry texts but not threats. The next day he responds to me like nothing happened.   Now the new girlfriend is rep steely threatening me with her aunt who is a lawyer stating she has ""stuff I stole from her"" and my exes 1600 dollars I owe plus emotional damages that she could put against me. I've been in tears all day wondering if I'm going to end up in jail or with charges. I don't have records of all the harassing messages she sent over the last year because I gave a new phone so it seems like their case could be in their favor since I can't prove how she was harassing me. I have no idea what to do. My family says to ignore her and that she has nothing against me. Please help."	Yes
171	"Hi, I apologize if this is the wrong place to post. I just don't know where else to put this. At the beginning of this year, I posted on r/gonewild for fun. My inbox got flooded with messages, and one of them was a man promising me a very large sum of money in exchange for sexual pictures/videos with my face in them. He said he would pay up at the end of a predetermined amount of months. I agreed because I was naive and pretty strapped for cash.   The whole arrangement started getting very demanding as soon as I entered it. What was supposed to be like a video once a week and some pictures throughout the day turned into demands to know where I was at all times and watching me over Skype while I slept. I thought he was controlling but sweet because he seemed to open up to me sometimes. So when I stopped responding to his messages out of stress, I assumed he would be a little upset, but not go as far as to distribute the images/videos I had sent him. He messaged me a few times but stopped saying anything to me soon after.   Well, today I opened up my r/gonewild account to some interesting messages and posts. (He had my r/gonewild password.) First, he posted some of the photos I had sent to him, though luckily without face. (However, they had very identifiable backgrounds.) Second, he had been messaging potential other ""sugar babies"" from my account as a way to verify his ""authenticity"", and had been sending them screenshots of ""my"" PayPal transaction with him (which, obviously, never occurred.) Right now, other than thanking the high heavens that I didn't go through with this obviously very scammy arrangement, I am scared that he is going to start posting photos of me on the internet. Not just on Reddit, but whatever other message boards people use for this kind of stuff.   What can I do to stop him? I think I pieced together enough information to know his real identity. I know his name (I think) and the state he lives in (Georgia), as well as his approximate age. First, I'm gonna try to talk to him human-to-human, and tell him to knock it off, but obviously this isn't someone that can be trusted. Could I report him for financial fraud (the name on the PayPal account isn't his, and I highly doubt he has been paying all these girls) or revenge porn? I need to operate very carefully as he has hundreds of nude images of me with face.   Thank you and please let me know if this isn't the appropriate place for this!"	Yes
172	"So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I'm in a relationship with this person. So yeh this is your typical, revenge porn or nonconsensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes

174	"Hello, here is my situation.   I was at a public beach on the 4th of July in Massachusetts. I was drinking with friends, and we noticed a few cops had appeared on the beach. Naturally, we shied away from said cops as we were already away from our stuff. One of our group members was not with us, and she was near all of the bags, especially mine. She was apparently questioned about the alcohol and such, and they dumped beers out of my bag. They did not stop at the beers, and searched through my entire bag, finding my wallet. They then searched my wallet and found my fake ID. I returned a few minutes later after the police had left, and was told all of this by the friend who had been questioned. Now, a week later, I receive a notice in the mail calling upon me to appear at a hearing in august to defend myself against these charges. The charges were being in possession of a fake ID, and some miscellanious charge that is specific to my municipality and that I figure I need to call in to ask for it to be identified. Was it legal for them to search my wallet? I was under the impression that police require consent or a warrant to search someone's property. I was not even present and therefore not complicit with their search.   To add to all of this, I turned 21 on the 5th......... and although that does not take away from the legal implications of this charge, there is an added ""fuck you"" factor because of that fact."	Yes
175	10 years ago I traveled to a far away state I didn't live in and was caught with a small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia. Of course the court date for the charge was months after I was caught, and by that time I had already returned to my home state. I was also very poor at the time and could afford neither a lawyer, court fees and fines, or the money it would have cost to travel back to the state. Over the years I had forgotten about it, but now I have remembered and I am wondering what will happen if I hire a lawyer to deal with the charges. Lets say I hire a lawyer and go to court to deal with the charge. When they convict me, how will that conviction look on my record? Will it show up as a conviction in 2017? How will this impact background checks for jobs? I know most checks only look to see convictions that have have occurred in the past 5/7/10/etc years. Will the fact that I waited this long to deal with it make it look like a crime that was recently committed, and hurt my chances to pass background checks? I have had background checks done since I was originally charged with possession, and had the warrant issued against me, but these never showed up on any of the checks.	Yes
176	My neighbor has been stalking me and threatening me.  I was granted a TRO today, and we go to court next week to extend it.  I have video evidence of several of the incidents.  The only problem is that when the videos save, for some reason the time stamps do not save with them.  I have a couple where they match up to still shots, which do keep their time stamps.  But most are just the video with no time stamps.  Is that going to be a problem in court?  Is there anything else I can do to prepare?  Also, should I get a copy of the related police reports, or will the court already have access to those?	Yes
177	The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	Yes
178	A friend of mine got caught sending a lot of grams of Molly through the mail .he doesn't know if the website or the person he was getting it for set him up .  He's ready to flee the country . Is there any of options for minimal jail time or to get out of it he can take ? From PA please need advice asap	Yes
179	(I'm going to apologize for this wall of text, but I really need to get this out there. We need help ,and I can't find anywhere else on reddit to ask these questions.)  I'm in need of some serious help here. I'm 23 and out of the house, but I have sisters back at home. We were all adopted. To give you some back story: I have 2 other sisters, 17 and 18. They live in NJ while I'm in Ohio. Yesterday they visited and while we were alone, my 18 year old sister said she needed to speak with me. Long story short, she had confirmed my long-term suspicion: my father is a creep, and is sexually harassing her, to put it lightly. I've been *slightly* suspicious for a while now, after he made some off-handed remarks to me and a couple incidents of inappropriate touching. I gave him the benefit of the doubt with the touching; I always just assumed it was an accident when it happened. It turns out that he had been making the very same comments to her, only it and the touching has gotten more extreme to the point where she is petrified of being alone with him in the house.   That being said, my obvious first reaction is to get her out of the house. I have an apartment with my SO and we are both willing to have her here. Getting her here isn't too much of an issue. We do have a problem though: her bank account. I don't remember the details, but she said that the *only* way she is able to withdraw money is with our parents present until she's 21. We're afraid that, since dad has control over the account, he will withdraw all of her money. Yes, he would do that to her. Is there any way around that policy? Can we talk to the bank and explain the situation and can they make an exception based off that? Also, since she is 18, there obviously isn't a problem with where she goes. But like I said before, my other sister is 17. If I got her out of the house and dad got angry, could I be arrested for kidnapping? I just want all my bases covered.   And here's a second thing: what do we do about HIM? My sister has done what she can, I think. She has contacted the police on a few ocassions. They brought him in for questioning, but nothing came of it. The problem is that our father uses his clout of being an ex-police officer of 20 years to get him by in this situation. It doesn't help that my sister has had a habit of over reactions and exaggerations (this is obviously not one of them). It seems that local law enforcement will do nothing major for her now. There's also the fact that she's tried to bring this up to our mother. As I said in the title, no one, not even our mother, believes her. Dad is smart, and always makes sure that his creepiness can be masked to look like something completely innocent. Understandably, mom has always given him the benefit of the doubt (along with everyone else), despite warning signs that even she is aware of (ex: dad sometimes watches things like documentaries of crimes of women being raped (seriously dad, what the fuck). Mom tells him repeatedly to turn those things off. She doesn't seem to put 2 and 2 together). That being said...what the hell am I supposed to do about this? Is there nothing that can be done? Will he never be punished for this?  This is how it's starting to look to me, and I can't believe it.   If anyone has any answers, or even just advice, please tell me. I'm coming to my wit's end.	Yes
180	So I posted on Craigslist looking for women or couples who will let me jerk off in their panties/thongs (yes, I'm weird).  A guy emailed me about it, but when I asked if he would ask for or if he had his girl's permission this is what he said:  She wouldn't be into it. But she won't find out either. I've cum in her panties many times and put them back in her drawer. She's never known.  I've even used her when she's passed out drunk and cum on her face. She never knew.   Is there a way to report this? If so, how do I do it and is there a way to do it anonymously?  Will I have to talk to the police myself, or can I just submit the emails?  I'm kind of freaked out right now, and would like to avoid doing this publicly because I'm kind of embarrassed about my craigslist post/fetish...  All I have is his email address and the messages.  I have not yet responded to that last email	Yes
181	I'm currently living in Los Angeles, and I started chatting with someone that I met through a dating app. I stupidly sent them nudes of myself and now they are threatening to send them to everyone of my Facebook friends including my family. I sent the messages through Kik, so I know I could report them for abuse and state the exact reason and let them look at the messages, but I'm afraid they'd only get banned then just send the pictures because they would figure I reported them. I honestly have no idea what to do right now.	Yes
182	My dad was arrested last year in Fulton County, Georgia on a theft by taking misdemeanor. He found a phone and took it home to wait for someone to call to return it, but he forgot about for, left it in the car and the cops tracked it down. My dad gave the phone to the cops when they camped out in our neighborhood, but was arrested and taken to the Atlanta jail. My mom had to pay his $2970 bail to get him out the following morning and was told he will be receiving notice of a court date within three months. This happened two years ago and we are still waiting on a court date notification in the mail. Is this the normal process? Do we just have to wait? I read online about a 1 year statue of limitations on theft charges in Georgia to be charged, but I don't know if this applies to my dad. Since a year passed, can he still be charged or has he already been charged? We have a card that says to call the state court clerk after 3 months if we do not receive a court notification so we called three months after his arrest and they told us to continue to wait. Should we call back to get an update or will they tell us the same thing?	Yes
183	So I was granted an expungement for a dismissed charge from 7 years ago the first week of June 2017. I've been delaying an application with the school system fearing it hasn't cleared all databases. How long does it typically take for granted expungements to clear all databases and when will a background check that is ran on me show up clear?	Yes
184	I'm so flustered right now, and trying to type on mobile. Apologies for incoherences or confusion, I just have no idea what to do.   So, as far as I know the Bureau of Narcotics Investigation and Drug Control officers visited my home this afternoon while I was at work. My wife is a stay at home mom, 4 kids whom were all always with grandparents by some stroke of luck. They confiscated 24 plants that have been growing for a few weeks. They said they had pictures of my wife and I watering them. She took all the blame and said I had nothing to do with it, attempting to compartmentalize the damage. She also told them she was growing for someone else, so now they're pressuring her to flip on someone. Problem is, that's a lie. It was all personal because we have zero connections right now. I wish she would have just asked for a lawyer, but what's done is done. They also confiscated our paraphernalia, a couple pips, bongs, grinder, etc.   I'm worried about her going to jail. Neither of us have anything on our records, but I'm hearing PA had mandatory sentencing. I need to get her a lawyer, but I'm also barely surviving on my current income. The fines will ruin us if the lawyer fees don't first. And the fact she would be a felon means most of her career options are impossible (she got her MBA while raising kids).   I just want to leave the state for greener pastures, but I we have to deal with this. Who do I contact, what do I do? Any advice is appreciated.    Sincerely Yours, Sobbing and Sorry Pot Growers in PA	Yes
185	"Note: I have a public lawyer, so I will try and be brief. This is in the state of Massachusetts.  Simply put, I've been charged with multiple counts of child rape. A child has claimed that they were raped and molested over the course of a few years by me (unsure of details). There is no physical or forensic evidence available, so it's the alleged victims word versus mine.  One of the only defenses I can think of (since I cannot prove I didn't do something) is a friend of mine who is related to the alleged victim. This friend of mine knows I've never been alone with the alleged victim and is willing to testify. Also, the biological mother of the alleged victim has a few mental disorders, I just don't know what exactly.  **I'm conflicted on these two points below;**  **1)** Proof beyond reasonable doubt is needed for a conviction, which seems impossible in this case.  **2)** I did some reading and came across a passage that stated if there is no ""logical explanation"" for the alleged victim to lie about the assault, then the defendant should be presumed guilty.  **Question:** Should I be worrying? Should I attempt or accept a plea bargain? If so, what can be considered a good plea bargain since I'm looking at maximum penalty of life in prison, despite not committing the crime?  Thanks in advance."	Yes
186	"I am in the process of completing drug court. I have no priors before this. I understand that when I finish, the charges will get dismissed. But in the meantime, it required a guilty plea. Does that mean I've been convicted but sentencing has been put off? Or are the charges still in ""limbo"" so-to-speak?  I have [read about it online](https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/alabama-employers-may-no-longer-consider-certain-criminal-records) but it's talking about getting records expunged and the only mention of drug court is ""after successful completion of drug court.""  In the meantime, will my charges show up as a conviction on a background check? Can I pay to run a background check on myself and which ones do employers use in this area?  When I accepted the plea, my attorney explained some things of the plea agreement but wasn't sure the answer to this question. I haven't seen him since my plea date in court."	Yes
187	Seeking some legal advice as well as wondering what to expect for my case.   Im 23, and I was arrested when I was 18 for possession of a controlled substance (one Xanax, a felony) in the state of Florida. I made bail, and didn't show up for my court date. A year and a half later, I turned myself in and three months later was released on probation. I violated my probation a month later and moved across state lines out of fear of going back to jail. This was almost four years ago, and I feel like it's time to go home and deal with my problem. I was a different person back then, and since I've been gone, I've had zero encounters with police and have been a productive member of society, got married, and became a chef. I'm wondering what to expect..   Is my best option to get a lawyer? What is that gonna cost me? I have some money saved, but only around $1,000. Is that enough? I'm hoping since I've completely turned my life around and it's been four years that a lawyer could get it thrown out, or at least get me off with probation/little to no jail time. I support my wife and myself and she wouldn't be able to make ends meet without me around. What should I do? How effective would a lawyer be in my situation? This is my only legal trouble as an adult, I got in trouble when I was 16 but had it dismissed. Any advice is greatly appreciated.   Thanks!	Yes
188	A few days ago me and a friend got citations for possession of alcohol on a public beach in NJ. We had one empty can out, in a cup, which apparently is reason enough to get this. When the cop took us to his car, he wrote down my name incorrectly, and also the address where I live is wrong (but the town is right), as is my phone number. My DOB, however is correct (I am 20 but we didn't get tagged with MIPs). My friend's info is entirely correct except for his last name, which is off by one letter (but his address, etc is correct).   Do I show up to the court summons on the ticket? It says that failure to appear may result in a warrant being issued for my arrest. However, no such person with the name on the ticket exists (the first and last names are off by one letter). Will they be able to find me? What do I do?	Yes
189	An officer came to my home to speak to me after I specifically told him on the phone that I wanted to speak to him the following day instead of the day that he called me. When we spoke he asked me a broad question to which I replied yes. He took that as an admission of guilt and said I was guilty to everything. Now a police report is going to be filed. Everything was in person, I never wrote a statement and there is no real solid evidence against me besides that I'm a suspect. This is about a texting harassment case.  Basically my question is what will be in this police report? Will he say I'm guilty even though I answered a broad question?  Montgomery County-MD	Yes
190	Hi, I'm new to legal advice and being in trouble in general, so please let me know if I'm missing anything.  First things first, I'm going to turn myself in obviously, I'm going to have my lawyer set up a time to do that.  About 5 years ago, my drug addict father showed up at my mom's house, after I hadn't seen him for over a year. In my opinion, he was messed up on prescription painkillers when he arrived. He was parked in the driveway, I yelled at him to leave, we yelled at each other. He tried to open the car door and I closed it back on him. I ran inside, called my mom, and he backed out of the driveway, called the cops and said I was threatening him. We were the only two people present. Honesty, I have no idea what I said to him. I was 20 at the time, and pretty upset that my abusive father showed up at my house without warning. The police arrived, assessed the situation, and told me something about how in domestic cases they usually arrest someone no matter what, but that my father wasn't going to sign a complaint and they told him to not come back to the property. The next day, apparently he called the police to sign a complaint. A warrant was issued for my arrest at the time, for misdemeanor domestic abuse  Here's where it gets fucked. I was never notified I had a warrant. Nobody ever showed up at my house. I never got a letter in the mail. I've had my ID ran by multiple police departments, including the one wanting to arrest me now (never in trouble or any other charges ever, just verbal warnings), applied for jobs, school, new passport, left the country and went through customs, etc ect. Nothing ever came up, so I had no idea.  About a year after that, my father passed away because his liver failed, due to the ridiculous amount of prescription pills and alcohol he was consuming.  Cut to just now. The police called me, saying they were going through old warrants and needed me to turn myself in. They explained that they tried to have the state's attorney quash the warrant, but the attorney refused. I'm not walking into the police station without a lawyer obviously.   What the hell happens next? The cops are saying that they'll transport me to court, I get booked, and then the bond court will PROBABLY throw it out. I don't believe them at all. I have bail/bond money, but I'm just afraid as fuck of jail.	Yes
191	I'm unsure if there would be any drawbacks of just paying the ticket as I was not given a court date. A lawyer explained that I can plea not guilty, show up to community court, and be able to do community services and it will be cleared from my record. I'm not sure how true it is so I need all the info and advice I can get. I heard it can affect my financial aid too which I'm mostly worried about	Yes
192	So I have an account on plenty of fish and I met a girl on there who was claiming to be 19, I'm 21 so I messaged her. We exchanged numbers and she started texting me. Eventually she started sending me nudes and speaking to me sexually she also asked for some and I sent one. We had planned on meeting up but then she told me she was actually 17 but we could have sex. I replied that we absolutely could not do anything like that and immediately deleted all the pictures she sent me along with all other messages and her number. I also reported her account to POF. She would message me occasionally after that but would get one word answers and communications eventually ceased. Then I get a call from her dad saying he saw all the messages and he's going to have me arrested. So I explain the situation which he should already know if he really had the messages. Now he's telling me that if I don't pay him $500 he's going to report me to the police. I don't know what to do. I don't have $500. Please help.	Yes
193	I met my girlfriend in high school and we've been together for about a year now. Before she dated me she dated somebody else who had problems. They broke up because he physically abused her and cheated on her.  A while back, I want to say about four or five months ago, he began stalking her. Circumstance had it set that while they were dating, he activated some kind of software on her phone and was able to completely bug her. Anyone's voice or location could be visible/audible when in the vicinity of this phone. He used it to track her down and try god-knows-what. He hit her one time while I was at work. There was a police report and all this and that, and an emergency restraining order.   This is really only the spark-notes of it. There was a lot more going on. A lot of nights I went without sleep and jumping at every creek and bump in the night. Since then, however, (As far as we know) this bug as been disabled and we got her a new phone for the time being.  Recently, this phone broke and, after wiping her old phone clean (New iCloud account, all this Apple jargon that I can't decipher being an android man) she switched back to it. We're planning on moving here soon so getting these luxuries aren't primarily on our minds.  Now, since having been switched back to Phone A, this stalking continues. She lives with me now and we're planning to move out of state, so I feel like I have a better grasp on her safety. Still, these texts come and go of this stalker begging to see her, come drop off old memorabilia, just one last talk, etc etc. Through chance(?) he's ran into her while running errands, and threats of macing out of self defense were thrown around. He often texts me trying to get under my skin, but beyond that he's afraid of me and rightly so. My blood is boiling typing this out. Again the long nights of no sleep and investigating every minor sound and dog bark continue. I feel like I'm driving myself nuts. I always keep an ear out for any movement, vibration, whatever in this house. Thankfully she stays with good friends or my mother while I'm at work.  I'm scared and angry. What do we do?  Throwaway, because hey. This stalker scrambles for our social media at every chance.	Yes
194	"About 3 years ago I got a warrant for shoplifting at a Walmart for about 300 dollars worth of things.  It's a long story, i was on tour with a band, I made some mistakes, I'll go with the general ""young n dumb"" excuse...  Anyway, I got out of being taken to jail to be held for my court date because the cop was being lazy.  He lets me go with a court date ticket.  This is in Riverside, California.  I grew up in and am currently in Chicago.  I was back in Chicago within days.  I never went to the court date and nothing has ever happened really.  I am not a band person, this would be the only thing on my record so I kind of just want to take care of it before it stings me to hard (?).  Everyone tells me to ""lawyer up"" which I assume I'll have to do to take care of this, but does anyone have any idea what I may have to go through?  Will I end up doing time?  Can I negotiate/turn myself in?  Will I have to put my life in Chicago on hold to take care of this?  How much would it cost me?  It's a world of worry and having never been in trouble with the law really I'm in the dark.  Any input appreciated!"	Yes
195	Mom and i recently found out my father (divored) has been molesting my sisters but they hid it for years because they didnt want to lose their dad. We tried to report him but they sent cops and cps to our mom trying to charge her for it  because there's no proof against him. Also, my sisters said they found child porn on his phone but they didnt mention it to cops because they were telling them theyll go to a foster home.  How can we report him for that instead? My sisters dont see him no more	Yes
196	My parents and I were recently involved into an armed robbery (two young thugs followed us from the casino after they saw my dad winning some money. They did not shoot us, but one of them threatened us with an actual handgun) and got a notification from the county detective that they got arrested few days ago. I am glad that these stupid thugs, as they committed armed robbery few more times before they got arrested, are caught and will serve their sentences. However, I am concerned whether my family would be able to get the money back or not. They stole approximately 4,000-5,000 dollars in total and threw away all of our wallets and my mom's backpack right after they robbed us.   PS. How much jail time would they have to serve if they were arrested for multiple cases of an armed robbery? I have been hearing a lot of different stories, from 5 years to even 20 years. I am pretty sure they cannot afford to have a lawyer.	Yes
197	"I want to make this short so people will read this and give me advice, cause I've never been in this much trouble before.  I'm a 19 y/o male college student, and I was arrested a week ago while sitting in my car in a neighborhood near my house (I was alone). Cops searched my car and found my mason jar, which contained:  - ~14 grams of marijuana (in two different bags)  - A pea-sized amount of wax (hashish), with a paperclip  - A grinder  - 3 packs of rolling papers  - A small bag of tobacco  - A paintbrush that smelled of marijuana (I used it to clean my grinder)  I stupidly lied to my arresting officer when he initially asked if I had drugs in the car, they searched my car with probable cause, and after that I was cooperative. The cop asked ""why did you lie to me?"" then said ""Nevermind you don't have to answer that"" so I never admitted to having knowledge of the marijuana (not that it matters.. I was my car).  Also, I had not been smoking that day, and the officers knew that (they let me drive my car home after they booked me), so DUI isn't an issue.  I was charged with a misdemeanor. I have already hired a lawyer, and he contacted my arresting officer, and the officer agreed to bring it down to a disorderly conduct. But, my lawyer said I was going to have trouble getting the District Attorney to agree to that due to the amount and the wax/rolling papers.  Any advice or sympathy would be much appreciated, this is my first brush with the law and it's really scary. Thank you in advance!!"	Yes
198	"In PA - I have a co worker who books travel arrangements for employees. Person is a full time employee w our company. On the side, my co-worker owns a travel agency. He collects commission from the rooms/flights he books at my job. He has contracts made out to his business's name, uses his company's ID # on all hotel reservations... To get extra money.   Does this have legal ramifications or is it a company by company decision? I always thought ""double dipping"" is illegal, but maybe it is an ethical situation decided by the company."	Yes
199	How can I be treated as if I'm on probation, have to report every 2 weeks, and take random drug tests, If I haven't even been convicted of a crime or sentenced probation?  Also does an adac assessment count as a drug test? My probation officer said in court under oath that I received and failed a drug test, when in fact I've never received one and could have passed one at any point. When I asked him about it he said that since I said I had smoked weed in my adac assessment it's the same thing. I call bullshit. If he commited perjury by saying I failed a drug test, I'd really need/like to know.	Yes
200	"I just found 2 disconcertingly large marijuana plants growing hidden in a grove on the outskirts of my property where I rarely venture. I didn't plant them, and I have absolutely no idea how they got here. I know for a fact they weren't here in March.  Who do I talk to? Do I just tell the police and hope they believe me when I say I don't know how they got there? Or do I just destroy them myself? They're big enough that I'm afraid the police might think ""there's no way he didn't know these were here""  What do I do?"	Yes
201	Pulled over yesterday and told I was swerving. I was not drunk, but was pretty tired because it was the end of a long drive. I had a major panic attack during the field sobriety tests, I was shaking too hard to stand, and when the officer did the visual test I almost passed out from locking my legs. There is no way I passed those tests. The attack passed by the 3rd test (balance test) which I was able to do fine, but I was not allowed to retake the previous two.   Officer thought I was on some kind of narcotic, and brought me into the station. The did take a urine sample, which I'm positive will come back clean, I don't do drugs. I did have a few beers earlier that afternoon but this stop happened over 4 hours after I had drinks, and I did not have enough to even get buzzed. I did tell the officer when I had the drinks, and complied with all testing and requests, and I was incredibly polite through the whole ordeal.  This is my first OBI, I have no priors, and I have already spoken to a lawyer and have things in motion to meet before my arraignment hearing. What should I be expecting to happen here? Is it normal for a first time offense to be downgraded into a reckless driving charge? Should I expect the book to get thrown at me and to receive the manditory 72 hours in jail? These questions will obviously be asked to my lawyer, but I was hoping to hear some positives to this before going in because I'm freaking out right now.	Yes
202	This happened during the weekend, I had less than 1 gram of cocaine in my car, it was under my car seat and sometime during the drive it rolled out from under the seat. A cop pulled me over for a tail light not working and when he came to my window he noticed it, asked me to step out and then called for backup and searched my car and found it. I got arrested for possession of CDS and charged with a 3rd degree felony. I was released immediately as it was my first offense. I have received the court date for this Friday and I am not sure what to do. I am in US on a work visa, and have recently applied for an extension. I am scared on what to do, I have no experience in any legal matter and I am not sure on what the process will be. I really need advice on what to expect and how to prepare. I looked for lawyers online and made appointments with them, I searched online about first time offenses for possession it all looks so confusing, I have read about PTI(pre-trial intervention) and conditional suspended sentences, it says that if I can get either of those, the arrest records and can be expunged. Is it something I should bring it up with a lawyer ? Is it possible to get those sentences. I never did coke before ever, and I bought it just because I was curious and wanted to try it. I have no history of any arrests or any priors for that facet. Will I be jailed? will I be deported ? Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
203	I've been on probation for the last three years. I got caught with a fair amount of weed a couple years ago and got put on 2 years deferred adjudication. I violated once last year, but got re-instated with one year added. Today I saw my probation which he said would be the last time. So my question is will I go before my judge before I'm off or what exactly happens now. My official off date is August 22.	Yes
204	So, my friend and I were driving pretty late last night. We had a long car ride, so he brought pot with him, and I shrugged it off. We hit a highway that had quite a few cars pulled over, so I was obeying all speed laws. Approaching a steady green light, I was riding my brakes a bit in the event it turned yellow before I got there (as to not get pulled over for running a red light). Turns out, one of my brake light was out. He had the grinder in my passenger side door pocket, which the officer then saw when I was giving my license and registration.   My car was then searched, and to my horror, I had my overnight bag tossed in my trunk which I meant to take out of my car before I left, but was in such a rush to leave and forgot to take it out. (I live walking distance from where I stayed the night before, I was being lazy and instead of walking three flights up to my apartment, I tossed it in my trunk to go walk and do other errands--- I never intended to drive). The cop read me my rights and asked me if that stuff was mine. I told him yes out of nervousness.   I'm 22 years old. About to graduate college (early for my program). I do community service regularly already. I'm planning on applying to graduate programs this fall for a PhD. I've had zero encounters with the law prior.   What do I do from here? The cops told me I could hire a lawyer or speak to the prosecutor myself on my first appearance. I was planning on applying for jobs as well this March, which I will all be background checked for. How is this going to affect background checks? Grad school applications? My life in general? How much are lawyer fees going to cost (on average) if I go that route? I have ~10 days until my first appearance.   Thanks in advance.	Yes
205	I know someone who works at Walmart. They were fired for violating the patriot act according to Walmart. My Friend who I will name Bob(23)  is the Walmart worker. Bob's friend Stu is 16. Stu's dad wanted to send him some money but couldn't because he isn't 18. Instead Stu's dad sends the money to Bob, Bob then signs for the wired money while on break (isn't the issue). Stu also signs the wire transfer. Walmart then fires Bob for violating the Patriot Act and alleges money laundering. Stu was using the money to buy something at the store. Did Bob violate the patriot act?	Yes
206	Hello,  I live in the great state of Colorado, where you can get high legally in more ways than one!  Unfortunately that was not always the case, and in 2009 I received a possession charge.  It's really messing with my job (background checks) and would like to see what options I have.  It seems expunging would only work if I was under 18 (alas I was over 18 at the time) so I think my only option is to 'seal' the record.  I tried to talk to a few lawyers about this, even paid one... the result was just more confusion.  I tried talking to the assistant DA, they were not very helpful either.  It seems I need to wait 10 years, then file a bunch of paperwork, pay some money, and then the state will tell me if the record can be sealed or not...?  Can someone please help me understand the process for getting this sealed?    Thanks!!	Yes
207	I received a ticket for urinating in public in Fullerton, ca at about 2:30 am after all the bars closed and nowhere to relieve myself. The ticket was marked as a misdemeanor.   I understand that it is mostly at the discretion of the prosecutor and that I should seek an attorney. I'm worried that I won't be able to get the ticket reduced to an infraction because I have a DUI on record from almost three years ago.	Yes
208	Throwaway for obvious reasons.   TLDR at end.   Was arrested late may 2017 in Santa Barbara County , CA for 2 misdemeanor drug possession charges. One read 'Possession of controlled substance' and the other 'Possession of controlled substance without prescription'.   Got Court tomorrow and wondering what I should expect for an outcome. Private lawyer.   The two substances were (1) SINGLE LSD TAB and ~15 KLONOPIN 2MG PILLS (prescription benzo).   The way I was arrested tells as follows -   Sitting in car looking up food store location with my buddy. Im in driver he is passenger. We have a single tall open beer can in the center front cup holder. I have my LSD, KLONOPIN and a bag of MAGIC MUSHROOMS in the side compartment of the front driver door. We are apparently illegally parked / pulled off to the side of the road in a residential area. Keys are in ignition, engine running. It is late, between 12-1am at this point.    A cop knocks on the window and asks what we are doing, we proceed to tell him we are looking for a directions. He then sees the open beer can in the car and tells us to step out of the car. Asks to search and I say yes. Finds all drugs and asks who they are. Tell him my buddy left them there. He arrests me on the spot for having them in the car on drivers side. Spend night in jail (~14 hours), and get out and move on.   What should I expect as a reasonable outcome w my private lawyer? This is my first time offense , I've never previously been arrested. Is there any specific way I should handle myself in court? Also, why didnt the officer charge me for the magic mushrooms/ open beer? I was being very nice and cooperative during the entire time, maybe that helped?  TL;DR  I got arrested in SB, CA for possession of controlled sub and possession of controlled sub no prescrip. First time offense with a private lawyer. What can I expect at my court date tomorrow?	Yes
209	This happened a year ago, but right after it happened, I moved from New Jersey to Michigan, and next week I will be living in Ontario. I recently got a subpoena in the mail to appear for the case. It's not against me, it's state VS the guy, but I'm just going to be there as a witness. I will be 8 months pregnant during the time of the court date and I won't be able to travel, especially since I don't think I will be able to travel to the States while my citizenship paperwork is being processed in Canada. I've tried contacting the detective a few times but haven't heard anything back yet, my next step is to call the court house even though the subpoena specifically says to just contact the detective. Is there any way they can try to force me to go considering my circumstances?	Yes
210	When serving paperwork of a Notice of Court Hearing to a defendant in the case for a temporary restraining order, it must be done in person.   What happens if the individual has been elusive after numerous attempts? I am aware of the residence, yet the person is never there.   Can Substitute Service and Due Dilligence forms be used in this instance, or is hand-delivery the ONLY option? I would leave the docs with another adult at the residence.  The docs are: CH-100, CH-109, and CH-110.	Yes
211	Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	Yes
212	"So I met this guy when I was 17 (a couple months away form 18). He essentially groomed me and offered me xanax and alcohol and a place to stay when I was homeless. We got very intoxicated and passed out and when I regained consciousness is when the video takes place. I didn't know that I had this video in my possession and uncovered it when I was trying to clear space off my laptop. The video depicts the following:  &gt; Both of us are naked. We're playing around with my new camera phone and seeing how long it will take video. I am acting like a drunk 17 year old. Both of us are clearly identifiable in the video. There isn't any sexual intercourse in the video however I do reference sex with him and at one point in the video I say ""I am 17 and you are 27. I did not consent to this and you are making child porn."" From the video it looks like I was holding the phone most of the time excepting the couple times he tries to grab it and film me naked. It also appears as though he might be taking pictures or recording simultaneously on his phone.   Later on in our relationship I found a hard drive with a BUNCH of pornographic pictures and highly sexual conversations with people that he had never had relationships with. It was very clear he was suffering from a sexual addiction. Our initial contact led to a two-ish year ""relationship"" that ended in him abandoning me the day before my birthday. During this time he was highly abusive about my appearance and weight. We moved to the outer banks and lived there, away from my family, friends, or any acquaintances. When he abandoned me he managed to pack up all of our valuable possessions while he sent me a couple hours away to get my nails done for my birthday and then moved cross-country to California with his business partner without notice. This included walking out on our recently co-signed car which he purchased using the entirety of my savings. I was left with a large number of animals to care for including reptiles, fish, dogs, and cats. Immediately and with precision he  1. cancelled all our joint accounts 2. blocked me on all social media 3. set up a forwarding address 4. blocked my phone number 5. gave notice to the landlord that *both* of us would be moving out immediately  It was obviously premeditated.  Even after he left he started talking to me again a few months later. He initiated sexual exchanges over skype and email pictures (because he refused to text me). He played games and led me along emotionally and then ask for a bunch of nudes. He would even mention the idea of coming back and ""visiting."" He later went on to get caught masturbating at work (by no intent of mine) while sending it to me and ceased communication after he was fired.  To this day I haven't really been in a position to take any action against him and for years I've been too emotional traumatized to see the situation clearly. When I found the video and watched it I was disgusted by how childish and intoxicated I was and am moved to take action. I feel violated, lied to, and really this event has turned my life upside down. My credit is still destroyed by the repossession and have daily anxiety.  I'm ready to take action against him. I feel like I was a minor who was very intentionally groomed. Where do I start? I currently reside in Oregon and he is located in California (I have a last known address and I can track him down). Can I report him to the police where the video was taken and will they likely take any action? I was 17 and underage (although within a couple months of 18) but clearly was groomed, given substances, and taken advantage of by a much older individual. We are both married now, this isn't a revenge thing. I don't want anything except for him to accept some kind of consequence for his wrongdoings. Thank you."	Yes
213	"Long and short of it is I come from a very small town.  On top of issues with the department I have going back to when I was a little girl (they mishandled my sexual assault/abuse case that or another case of corruption I'll never know)  Since school got out there's been an obvious up-tick in noise around the neighborhood.  Oddly last year wasn't bad.  This year it's non stop atv's and dirtbikes, drinking, and yelling about ""teeners"" from the front steps at 1-3 am every morning.  I called to report noise two days ago.  dispatch asked , ""When you say yelling do you mean partying and having a good time?""  I said, ""if you're asking if they're fighting no but it's 1 am and they lit fireworks off outside my two daughters windows.  He sighed and said ok, ""you wanna talk to the deputy?""  I said ""no I wanna go back to bed"" he said ""ok deputy is in route.""    Deputy never showed.  I know because the fireworks continued and every time my daughters came back to my room freaked out and tired.   (it's worth mention that I have two years worth of video showing the same officer going to the same house in our cul-de-sac and staying for 45 mins to an hour a couple times a week.  They are no stranger to this home)    Last night we had 7-15 rounds fired in the center of town from a fairly loud gun.  They shot from 1-1:30 then 1:40-2 they took a break and resumed shooting until 3 am.  I lost count of rounds after that.  Police never showed up to that either.   Rewind over the last six months.  My brother in law is a crackhead.  (No joke) My MIL passed away almost 3 years ago.  Out of her passing we ended up taking the house as the sister was engaged in a lease and crackhead wouldn't pay the bills.  We let him stay in the house for two months until the eviction letter came and we had to take over.  So in lieu of house their sister said give him the truck.   He's never changed the title, never put tabs on or insured the vehicle.  It is still registered to his late mothers name.    this is where the corruption comes in.  He's been pulled over multiple times.  6 in the last 9 months to be exact.  over the course of three years?... countless. Every time up until recently he's called my husband to come pick him and the truck up.  He's caught driving with a suspended license (from not paying child support, has been suspended since shortly before their mom died)   The first couple times the hub went and got him.  The third time he asked the officer, ""Why don't you impound the vehicle and throw him in jail?""  (line of thinking is maybe he'll have a chance to sober up)  The officer called in a female officer for ""back-up"" and she informed him that they all know their mom died so they know he's going through a hard time.  Just take the vehicle and him home.   He was pulled over again two weeks ago.  Still suspended ,still unpaid fines.  Police still won't impound the vehicle.  We just got a letter from the DMV here under MIL's name saying that tabs and new plates were due this year.    My husband said we should take that letter up to the DMV and tell them the vehicle is scrapped.    There is so much more into the corruption than just this piddly stuff however I don't know how much they can actually watch/read.   My mom works fairly closely with police in her public position a couple of them have gone as far as telling her how they investigate.  That they can read through facebook messages without permission (legal I guess)  so I didn't want to ask her how to report as I really don't want a ""Walking Tall"" thing to go down.    How do I go about bringing a corruption charge against the police?  These things seem very minor I'm sure but as I said I have far more proof's I'm just not sure what I should do with it. (video, pictures, recorded conversations, multiple attempts on my end to contact said department)  Located MN   Thanks for any advice in advanced.  I'm going to work now and will check back on break.  And for clarification I don't have it out for police, all in all I generally get a long with them.  My grandma was a federal officer for 15 years.  I just have no tolerance for anyone who doesn't uphold the law, or rather, feels they ARE the law."	Yes
214	"Hi all,  I'm a freshman at Penn State, and I was just cited for underage drinking yesterday. I went to a party off campus, and had a bit too much to drink. I got back to my dorm room fine, and I wasn't being disorderly/causing any problems with anyone. I basically just stumbled back to my dorm and was ready to go to sleep.  However, I wasn't handling the alcohol very well and began to puke into my dorm's trash can. My roommate walks in on me puking and is panicking because he has never dealt with an intoxicated person before. He calls the RA because he was concerned for my health, and the RA calls 911.  A cop arrives at my dorm and starts asking me questions. He asks me how much I had to drink, and I told him I had a few beers. He then asks me questions like ""What's the month/date"", ""Who's the President of the United States"", and what state I was in. I answered all of the questions correctly, and I was being pretty compliant the entire time. I tell him my home phone number and he calls my parents.  He tells my parents that I was drinking underage and that he was going to send a citation to their address (not my dorm). He didn't leave me with a citation or any other documents at my dorm. I'm 17, so legally not an adult yet.  The EMS later arrive and take my blood pressure, heart rate, all that stuff. Everything was fine and they left. No one ever breathalyzed me.   Basically, I'm really worried about what happens next. I have to meet with a university administrator about my underage now and complete an alcohol program run by the university. But I'm more worried about what shows up on my record now. Is there anything I can do to get it off my record? I'm supposed to be starting ROTC in the fall, and something like this on my record can apparently be really bad for that. I've wanted to serve in the military for so long and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity before I even start."	Yes
215	So last night my friend and I were riding home from a concert and were pulled over for speeding. Both my friend and I had sobered up to drive home, so we were not really worried about any DUI or alcohol charges. My friend stated immediately that this was a rental vehicle only he was authorized to drive, and that even if I had to drive I could not. The officer breathalyzed my friend and he was under the limit to continue driving home. The officer proceeds to breathalyze me and apparentely I still had alcohol in my system. Why I was even questioned is confusing to me considering I was only a passenger and had brought no suspicion. So my friend got a speeding ticket and I received an underage for literately sitting in a vehicle driving home. Worth noting this is my second underage charge, even though I participated in a program to have the charge reduced to a disorderly conduct. I also turn 21 in about 20 days so this is a huge and unexpected incovenience. I plan on speaking to an attorney tomorrow regarding this issue, but for now do I have enough to build a case and try to fight this charge? I really do feel wronged and that I should have never been questioned.   Thank you for your help.	Yes
216	I live in Vancouver, BC. Isn't it a crime to post a fake Craigslist ad with my contact info.? If so, how do I go about making sure he gets arrested and convicted of this crime?	Yes
217	Hi Reddit! So I'm in high school and today my friend told me that she was sexually assaulted last night. The events of the night go as follows. She was drunk at a party and she needed a place to crash. A guy (the rapist) offered his place. She went over and was pretty much blacking out at this point. He gave her the bed and left her be for a bit. Later that night, assuming she wouldn't be able to remember, he took off her clothes and forced him to give him a handjob. How does she seek legal recourse for his actions????	Yes
218	Tomorrow I have a court date for a petty larceny charge. I've already been arraigned and this will be My second court date. My lawyer called me up this morning and told me he won't be able to be there tomorrow, and to show up and ask for an adjournment and he said the judge will have no issue granting this.  Is there anything I should worry about regarding this?	Yes
219	I'd like to take care of my warrant from June 2016. The warrant is for failure to appear for a violation of probation for not showing up to probation (I'm on probation in a county 7 +hours away).   I was convicted of domestic battery and sentenced to:  60 days in jail  3 years probation  52 weekly classes  Restitution  Probation would have expired April 2017, but it has been revoked since June 2016. I believe that would make it 10 months left.   Classes were finished October 2015, but I still owe most of the restitution.   What kind of time am I looking at and what's the best way to minimize that?  Is it more likely they will entirely revoke probation and I serve out the max one year minus 60 days served?  Or is it possible to avoid/minimize jail time and get off probation if I pay entire restition balance?   Also, I'm 7+ hours north of Ventura. Is there a way to hire an attorney to appear 977 for my mandatory appearance ? The protective order expired in April 2017.   Thanks for the advice!	Yes
220	To start ... this isn't easy. It took me several days to gather the nerves to post this... please be forgiving. I'm a stupid teenager...   In October of 2016 I met a very friendly foreign exchange student. She came from southern Beijing and we really hit it off. She had never had a long term relationship and we dated until January. I was her first boyfriend, and it was her first year in America. We basically met the week she arrived. Eventually we broke up she was mean at times and it was hard for me to keep going. By march I had to go to the hospital. It was later said I had hepatitis b.   This girl comes from a region of China where many people are born with or contract this disease at a young age. They may be immune to its affects but they are carriers themselves. I've tried to hold many conversations with this person and she has stated that there is nothing wrong with her and that I was sick with strep most likely .... she's not the brightest. I still have her on Snapchat. Ever since I broke up with her she will snap herself with other presumably lovers. To spite me.   I know she's having sex, and I know she's most likely spreading disease. Is there anything I can do to stop her? I truly believe she is harming society.	Yes
221	My grandpa who doesn't speak english and never opened an account without my parents and uncles received a mail saying he had to pay 5.5k to a known bank nationwide. We called today and was able to let them know about his situation and told us that someone opened an account and credit card under his name. They are currently investigating this issue.  What I need help is preventing the culprit from opening other bank accounts (he may have opened other accounts still) cause he probably had my grandpas ssn.	Yes
222	"This is a long one:   My boyfriend (of 5 years) &amp; I went down to Miami to vacation with my sister and her husband. Our last weekend night there we decided to have a good time. We went to a few dance clubs and met up with 2 friends we had met in our hotel. My sister &amp; her SO decide to leave, but the other 4 of us stay back. After the club closed the one girl calls a Lyft to get us back to our hotel. The lyft driver some how convinced us we needed one more drink and that we should check out this 24/7 strip joint. We're all quite drunk and we're on vacation so we say hell lets do it.   We get there and drinks / entrance everything is so expensive, but non-the-less we decide to stay. I go to the bathroom and when I come out my boyfriend is no where to be found. He's a stand up guy, a hard worker, and never would have gone to this joint had it not been for me (oops). Anyways, I'm frantically looking for him, but this place is HUGE with multiple stories and various rooms, I cannot find him for a good half hour. Finally I see a stripper walking him somewhere while holding his hand. I run up to them and say what in the world is going on. Anyways, I bolt out, he tried to run after me, but I leave the club. Not thinking clearly, I'm drunk, hes totally wasted, &amp;  also it is 7am. He runs after me but I'm already in my own Lyft going to the hotel.   I finally crash, but wake up around 10 am realizing he never came in. My heart drops, he could be anywhere or dead! I call and text yet get no reply (only to find out that the club had seen all my calls and put his phone on do not disturb!!). I try to call the club (which like I said was 24/7) yet all I could get was automated message saying ""all circuits are busy please try your call again later"". I decide to go back and look for him because the alcohol has faded away and I genuinely was worried for his safety. I get there around 1030/11 am and see him completely passed out face down on a couch, hes not even remotely conscious. He should have never even been served anymore alcohol! The manager and a worker try to give him water but hes just slumped over and cannot even open his eyes. The manager told me he spent 2k on a private room and that he signed off  on it. The poor guy couldn't even spell his name, let alone sign off on anything. He has absolutely zero recollection of what happened and we're an honest couple so he would tell me the truth. I take him back to the hotel room and he passes out until 7pm that evening.  Once he wakes up we try to piece together what happened and decide to enjoy our last evening since its our last night. 2k is a lot of money, but it wasn't the end up the world.  This all happened between 7am-1030am on Sunday morning. Flash forward to Wednesday, and we find that multiple cards have been charged for a total of  over 7k!!! Plus cash was taken out from his bank account. There are no receipts proving anything, and the manager himself had said it was only 2k he spent. We called our credit cards and filled them in so they're going to do an investigation, but we have no idea where to go from here. I called the club and they won't do anything until we sign off on a form, which we don't feel comfortable doing because they obviously are scammers. We've since found this place has reviews online that similar things have happened to many other people. Some people claim they may have even been drugged, which honestly he very well could have been. I've never in 5 years have seem him in the state he was in when I went to pick him up that morning. It was pretty terrifying.  It seems to us after talking things over, that he was absolutely taken advantage of, and quite frankly robbed. This club is well known, so they must have video footage. With me being a witness picking him up I feel we may have some grounds to stand on to get at least SOME money back. We're just nervous to move anything forward, because from what it sounds this club has done some very shady things in the past.  We're just looking for any and all legal advice anyone can give.  What are our rights and how should we handle this? Do we contact the police? Should we fill out this affidavit from the strip club? We really have no idea what the protocol is, and no matter what there is no way he signed off on this many charges. They would have needed his signature over 8 times! The manager told me he had only signed once. So how are there this many charges?  The club will not give us any answers, and we're considering going to a lawyer, so we would appreciate any help we could get! Thanks!  TLDR; went to miami, drunkenly go to 24/7 strip club, lose boyfriend (who is 27 &amp; has never went to a strip club before), come back to said club frantically worried at 1030am, find boyfriend passed out on couch totally drugged/intoxicated, manager tells me he spent 2k, yet he was not even coherent enough to tell me his name, come back from vacation and multiple charges have been made on multiple cards for over 7k. We definitely got majorly scammed &amp; taken advantage of. We want to know what we can legally do.   Thanks everyone!   I don't want any negative or rude comments, we already feel bad enough as it is. We never go to strip clubs, and after doing much research I've found this is a common scam, and we're just looking for any guidance."	Yes
223	I live in Ontario, Canada.  My sibling has hereditary back problems and gets massage therapy or something to help with it, but this requires a doctor's note/prescription or something (I'm honestly not certain of the details). They have mentioned to me how my school's insurance covers a good chunk of the cost if I were to try it out, so I said sure and asked my doctor for a note as well, which was very willingly given to me. I never ended up using it, so my sibling took the note and used it for themselves. They then asked my mother for my student number and made an account under my name on my school's insurance website or whatever to claim back some of the money they spent on the massage stuff, without my knowledge or consent (I heard about this through my mother). I'm pretty sure this is insurance fraud and identity theft; please correct me if I am wrong. What can I do? How can I stop them from doing more of this?	Yes
224	I'm from Toronto.  i just found out that someone from Pennsylvania is dating a minor(16) even though he is 23.  I have texts between me and the 16yo, between the 16yo and the 23yo, and between the 16yo and others, as evidence.  This is obviously wrong, disgusting, and unlawful contact with a minor.  How can I report it to the police in McAdoo, PA?	Yes
225	I am a victim of armed robbery that happened few weeks ago and tried my best to provide all the information that I could recall (their height, accent, color of the vehicle). Unfortunately, there is no physical evidence except the cameras on highway since it was very late and those as*ho**s covered their face with a scarf.  Borough detectives called me yesterday and they said they were able to find the vehicle and its owner that match with the descriptions that I gave. They said the vehicle's owner was once arrested for attempted burglary and the vehicle was actually following us. However, they told me that arresting the suspects and bringing them to the county jail/borough police station would be difficult tasks since they do not have an enough physical evidence. Isn't it possible to investigate the possible culprits if the detectives are confident enough? I am afraid that they will end up not getting arrested since I am pretty confident that the culprits ended up discarding all the evidences (wallets and a backpack) so that they can find a loophole to be exonerated, if they get caught.	Yes
226	A while back I was arrested for public intoxication and possession of marijuana. I have court in the morning and have no idea the outcome. I'm only 18 and have no idea how these things go. Should I plead guilty and just accept the consequences or not guilty so I can try and get an attorney? And if I don't end up with an attorney would they give me one? How does this work?	Yes
227	A legal adult I know is growing two marijuana plants for their own personal use in the house they are staying at. This grower does not own the home, nor are they in any tenancy relationship with the owner. The owner of this home is allowing them to live there as they know this person is not capable of being out on their own from lack of independence and some mental issues. The owner of the home is aware of the plants and is not fond of them, but is naive to the possible ramifications of allowing this to continue. I visited the home and could smell the marijuana upon approaching the door. I talked to the owners and they are not happy with the smell and liability, but feel helpless in this case for many reasons. It really is a messed up situation and I want to make sure the grower and home owners are aware of the possible legal ramifications if they are caught because they haven't researched it or been informed. I feel they, at the very least, need to understand what they are risking by continuing this behavior. I know that growing marijuana is not legal in Ohio for any reason, but I am having difficulty pinning down the possible charges that could occur and their penalties, could someone give me an idea of what they are looking at here?	Yes
228	Who is guilty? Two brothers, one 36, one 26, live in their father's home with their mother who is ill with cancer. The two are not amicable. Great deal of bad blood. 26 claims history of violence at hands of 36.  They take turns occupying shared spaces in the home. 36 goes to work to make private income. Family income provided by the father. 26 stays at home caring for ill mother. 36 returns to house in the middle of the day. This is not typical. 26 doesn't want 36 in the house. Feels it's his time to occupy spaces. 36 just want to prepare for business trip. 26 grabs a skillet, stands at the entrance, and blocks 36 from entering house. He warns 36 not to enter. 36 comes in anyway toward 26 punching. 26 weakly swings skillet no injuries. 36 knocks skillet away. 26 jumps on 36 and bites chest and arm. 26 clings to 36s back. Fight pauses, they talk about issues. 36 gets fed up and strangles 26 with hands until he passes out. 26 calls cops. Report filed. 26 leaves home later that night to live on streets. 36 remains at home.	Yes
229	My friend was on felony probation for theft. They were arrested for a DWI a few months back and bonded out. Never heard about it again until while reporting, another officer said there was a warrant for his arrest.  1. a lot of the info I saw online was talking about violation of probation and such. Are we past that point? We don't know that his PO knows he was arrested (they are unreachable 100% of the time and are constantly changing).  2. If it is considered VOP, what are the odds that he will be jailed until court hearing? The odds that he will get significant jail time instead of reinstatement or added charges?  As of right now he doesn't have a GA lawyer, and he's convinced if he takes a public defender he will definitely get jail time. The maximum is 10 years I think, eligible for parole after 3-4.	Yes
230	"I am looking for advice on how to proceed with this situation. I've been living in my apartment for 4 years now and we just signed on for a 5th (and final) year. Now while living here I've accepted the trade off where the rent is cheap but the landlord and management company are terrible. We've had plenty of run in's and the landlord is very unprofessional/shady.   Recently I decided to install a security camera in my apartment and it only took 2 days to catch the maintenance man entering our apartment without notice (nobody was home). He is in our apartment for around 5 minutes and ends up leaving with our plunger (this is clearly visible on the recording). The whole incident was not captured on camera (only a few short videos) but I do see him emerge from the hallway where the bedrooms are (so if all he needed was a plunger there would be no reason for him to be back there). We didn't find anything else missing but we can't be sure he didn't take something else. It's been 48 hours since this incident and they still have not notified us of the entry and the plunger is still missing.   Both in our lease and and Chicago RLTO (Resident Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, section 5-12-050) it states that they must give 48 hours prior notice for entrance for regular repairs. There are 2 reasons they are allowed to enter without notice. One is ""in case of emergency"" the second is ""For practical necessity where repairs or maintenance elsewhere in the building unexpectedly require such access;"". The second stipulation is the one I'm worried that they will claim. I actually know the neighbors upstairs who recently moved out and they mentioned to me their toilet being broken. So my understanding is the maintenance man was probably doing repairs in that apartment, needed a plunger, and took ours.  For both of those stipulations if they enter without notice they need to notify us of the entry within 48 hours which that time period has just passed and we haven't heard a word.  How should I proceed? The tricky thing is that the year lease just started (this happened on literally day one of the new lease), and I do want to live here (ideally would like to not have to search for a new place). So if I decided to pursue criminal theft charges...it would be a long 11 months of dealing with the landlord. What do you guys think?"	Yes
231	"So I pled ""no contest"" to a shoplifting charge I received after a night out drinking with buddies 3 hours away. I appeared in magistrate court and the judge cut the fine to $1 not including court cost, which I paid on the spot, but also had to pay $50 in resitutions to Sheetz. I wasn't given any information on how to do that when I was at the courthouse and haven't received any mail about it. What do I do? The magistrate judge said it wouldn't be difficult to get the charge expunged and wanted me to follow through with it quickly since I'm a medical student and this can affect my residency. How do I pay the restitutions? And is it necessary to have them paid by the time I file for expungement?"	Yes
232	So I was working at my dad's perfume store yesterday so he can take a day off. And I don't have that much experience, I occasionally fill in whenever he needs to take a day off for something. So yesterday I thought it was my lucky day cause I had two groups of people come in and buy nearly 500$ worth of items each but with credit cards. Now once again I don't have that much experience with this type of work. I just sold them the stuff but the procedure was the same as with any other group of people buying multiple items. Show them multiple stuff, bargain, and eventually they buy the stuff. I entered the price on the machine, they put in the card, they put in the pin, they signed the receipt and it was the end of that. Turns out both groups used stolen cards. So I get a call from my brother today saying both cards were stolen and we might not get the money for the stuff. But I pretty much followed the procedure I was told to, its just I don't know why we wouldn't get the money back.	Yes
233	"Tuesday around 2:30 AM a couple friends and I were leaving a bar. I knew I was drunk and shouldn't drive, but this isn't about me justifying myself. Well, I was heading from one parking lot to the other across the street to take my friends back to their cars, where someone would have taken me home or I would have Uber'd (more on that later). I turned left on a road where I didn't know there was a median, crossed the street, got to my destination, but before I could pull into the lot I had lights on me. Since I already knew I was driving on the wrong side of the road like an idiot, I figured that's what I was being pulled over for. It was. However I just left the bar, I had 3 (and a half) beers between 10:30 PM and 2:30 AM, so I'm sure I smelled, or my non-driver smashed passenger did. Officer has me do field sobriety tests, I probably failed, but while under the impression my sentence would he lighter if I blew, I consented and went along with it.  Blew a 0.121, arrested, and I was allowed to leave the station with my stepdad.  Totally cool with paying the fines and the 90 day suspension and even the classes as I know I shouldn't have been driving drunk, even if it was just to cross the street. Got off lucky that no one was hurt, I acknowledge that. The important part for me is when my court date came, the judge told me I was being charged with 2 counts of DUI, one for driving and one for blowing over the limit, meaning my first offense is counted as my second. He said I'm facing something like 180 days in jail/10k fine/1 year suspension. I wasn't even in the car for 5 minutes. Sidenote: my breaks are broken and I was driving my brother's car. How big of an issue is this? (Again, I know I shouldn't have, even to cross the street, but honest to God I was JUST crossing the street, I was not driving home. I was on the wrong side of the road, so me getting pulled over is justifiable, I just didn't think it through. I would have gotten pulled over sober because I'm just stupid.) Though it's not my place to say, is that ""fair""? I have an attorney who I can hopefully afford, but I can't meet with him until Friday. I just need some peace of mind, and knowing how much trouble I'm in could definitely help me prepare mentally."	Yes
234	it's a really long and complex ordeal i'm going through and it's been a long day. Basically would they have a case, what could happen to me, etc.   longer version is way overly complicated and I don't think all of those details matter for just the bare bones advice I'm asking for.   so the details I feel are important are  1) She does not want any of that to happen 2) She is 18 and is still my girlfriend  really about it. I don't know what exactly to do. my brother (not a laywer at all) insists that they can't actually do anything because who the hell would prosecute me over something like this  but I'm still unsure of what to do. I just want a happy life with her.	Yes
235	I carry a small pocket knife daily and i would like to know if i could get in legal trouble if i get in a situation where i absolutely have to defend myself while carrying said knife. Say i would only punch and/or kick, not using the knife at all. Would i get in trouble ?	Yes
236	"I was caught smoking marijuana in a park with 5 other people a few weeks ago by the police. They took our ID's and looked us up to see if we had clean records which we all did. They were nice and just told us to never return to the park because the people in the neighborhood were getting fed up of the amount of teenagers who come there to smoke weed. They said they were giving us warnings and it would appear on something called our ""drivers abstract"". Im not really sure what that is? Will it affect me when it come to employment or something?"	Yes
237	"Hi there, First time posting here and I'm hoping that it's helpful to my understanding of the system and what the circumstances mean. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible.  Location: CT and NY -CT is where the crime is taking place, NY is where the person responsible lives. Summary: An independent contractor, working for our company in the service industry, has been and continues to plan and execute the theft of at least $25,000. That amount is what we know of so far but it keeps getting larger. He's accepting and reporting (on weekly reports) that money is coming in (to make us think it's being collected and placed into the right account). In reality, he's having clients make out checks to him personally and depositing them into his own bank account. He's also accepting cash from clients for things that aren't being reported and further, he has clients paying for services without reporting that they exist. Again, in total that theft amounts at least $25,000.  The real question: Okay so we spoke to some police officers in CT and they said that once the warrant is out (which will take 4-6 week) they will contact the police in NY and see if they will also issue a warrant. Now, let's say there is a warrant out in CT and NY BUT they also said that they won't actually go and bring him into custody...Huh? There's an unbelievable amount of evidence we've compiled that should be more than enough to go out and bring this person in but what it seems that we're being told is ""he's basically free to be until he makes a mistake."" How can this be correct? I understand that some CT police don't want to go all the way to NY to arrest this person but, what if he's in the state? What if he happens to be in the same town? Will they take a call that says ""Here he is?"" The answer seems to be no, and my mind also seems to be blown that a criminal isn't being brought it and put through our legal system. I don't even know what the charges would be but maybe - grand larceny, fraud, damage to a business, forgery, like what would it take to mobilize and bring this person to justice? Are we just stuck with a warrant waiting for him to get pulled over for running a stop sign? There has to be an easier, more efficient, and just way to have him answer for his transgressions. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"	Yes
238	I'm a minor in Virginia and a few months back I got caught with a guy I met off of Grindr who I was trying to buy meth from. At Juvenile and Domestics court, I was told he took the plea deal and everything was done and if they needed me, they would call me back. I just got a different subpoena today for circuit court. Between the time I thought everything was over with and the subpoena for circuit court I have traded pictures with other guys and hooked up with other guys as well.  I currently don't have any charges on me and was considered a victim in the case. Is it possible for them to place charges on me for hooking up with other guys without telling them my age?	Yes
239	Hello! In 2013, a friend was arrested for marijuana possession in New Jersey. This particular Police Department likes to post all drug related arrests on their FaceBook page. Well, here we are 4 years later, the charges were “Conditionally Discharged”, and this post is still up, and out there trackable with a quick Google search. My question, is there any way to have them remove this post? My friend is trying to get out of retail, and apply for a desk job, where they will likely Google their name. We have not yet contacted the department to have it down; I wanted to check here for the best ‘strategy’. Isn’t it time to move on from the past? Do the crime, pay the time, and move on. This one post may prevent someone from moving on with their life, and I don’t like the thought of that. Any chance they will be sympathetic without involving a lawyer?  I appreciate any help you can offer!	Yes
240	Hi all, I am not directly involved, the guy was an ex from 15 years ago who went to jail for a terrible thing against his now ex wife, got out on a technicality, initiated contact with me and over a 6 month period threatened repeatedly to harm her family. I was asked to submit the proof by a mutual friend to police and I did. Ex wife got restraining order and seeking a harassment charge. He did 3 months in jail waiting on trial, and was released last week as trial date was pushed back into next month. His sentencing guidelines for the new charge are 1-3 months of jail time, credit time served. Confirmed with prosecutor's office, that there will be no jail time and they can offer me NO protection order, nothing. Basically they just want me to testify so they can slap him with a felony that will prohibit his job search and he can put blame on me.   I have a baby, no time off work, no reliable transportation to cross a mountain pass to GET to this trial 4 hours away... this is all so irritating. Should I be getting a lawyer to try to get out of this? CAN I get out of this? They have no ability to skype, legal assistant says they want witnesses present to jury can read body language.... I feel like Im being used here for nothing and they cant protect me and I just need some advice man. Can I get out of this?	Yes
241	"Hi, I have a question regarding FBI background checks.    I am applying for a job at a mortgage company and I would be required to take something called ""Safe Act exam"".  For this, an FBI background check will be done and I believe you cannot have a felony within the past 7 years.   2 years ago I was in court and pled guilty to a felony charge of burglary.  Though the crime happened when I was under 18 and it is sealed.    Would this felony show up on an FBI background check despite being sealed?  Am I wasting my time even applying for the job I am applying for?  Thanks in advance for answers"	Yes
242	I have gotten a ticket in the past and just paid it online. With a citation it just tells me to appear in court but doesn't have a fee. What exactly happens when you appear in court? And could I just sign the back and mail it in, even though there isn't a fine/money order to mail with it? Also whats the difference between pleading guilty and no contest?	Yes
243	So my friend is currently in a holding cell awaiting court at 1:30, she was caught with 3.7 grams of Molly, an ounce of shrooms, 3 ecastcy pills and under 30 grams of weed. My questions are, will I be able to post bail for her? Since it's her first offense can she get an ibond? What can I do to make sure she doesn't land in jail?	Yes
244	"Asking on behalf of a friend who doesn't really know what to do and is so shell shocked by the situation they don't seem to be thinking straight. I'll give the facts as they have been told to me.  I'll start out by saying all of these events have occurred and this friend has never been and has yet to be officially charged of any crime.    -A friend has been accused of sex with a minor, but neither the name of the accuser, the accuser's parents or the prosecutor have been given to this friend or their lawyer.  -Event supposedly took place in a different city while on a trip with family and SO. -The police came to their home to investigate this accusation and arrested said friend.  -During the raid, the police took the xbox, the modem and computer, did not take the hard drive or various flash drives that were within plain sight. -Friend has been required to check in weekly with their police department. -Friend was not required to give up his passport. -Friend has alibi for the time this event was supposed to have taken place, however a time line was established where they went to the store and was not with family or SO for a small period of time. This was told to the police by SO.  -Friend is not currently working, though there appears to be no reason not to.  -Police contacted friend's boss and told them that what the friend is accused of and recommended they be terminated. -Friend has no internet or cell phone access- not sure if personal choice or mandated. -Due to ""Lack of evidence"" Friend was informed that the case has been ""Postponed indefinitely"" however, they haven't had clear confirmation that they don't need to check in every week, so they still are and Friend's SO received a phone call yesterday by investigators asking for more information on the statement they gave at time of arrest. -Friend and SO had an upcoming trip planned and were told they could probably check in remotely, but no clear instruction given on how or that it was OK. Trip has since been cancelled.  -Friend is STILL not working and now lives with this hanging over them.   My question is: What sort of things should their lawyer be fighting for on their behalf? Don't they have the right to know who the accused is or at least the accused's representative? Can the lawyer file for something or ANYTHING to free them from the oppression of this uncertainty hanging over their head? Can they have this wrapped up or thrown out or something so that my friend can at least move forward and live a fairly normal life? From my point of view, it appears that their lawyer has done literally nothing and said there is nothing they can do.""  Furthermore, as all believe this case to be untrue, and indeed lack of evidence seems to support this, how can friend strike back or stand up for themselves so as to minimize damage to their character and reputation within the community?  I am of the belief that my friend needs a new lawyer, I would like to advise them to get a new one, but wanted to see if anyone could tell me how their lawyer is failing them first."	Yes
245	Basically, some guys put trays under my rear wheels and I did 2 donuts in an abandoned parking lot with no cars. Some employees of a nearby store watched and apparently called the cops. I got charged with a disorderly, should I plead guilty or not guilty? It was a car meet with a LOT of other cars, who says the employees could pick out my car in particular? There was only 2-3 witnesses from the store.	Yes
246	My uncle was a landscaper. He was working for someone that owns a family business company. They were working on a  yard and he needed to get something from the back of the truck. While he was standing behind the parked truck someone under the influence drove by and struck him . That was at 2pm yesterday. He was pronounced dead at the hospital around 3pm that day. His wife and children are obviously distraught. The man that hit him has prior d.u.i convictions. A couple of months ago my dad (his brother) passed away. My uncle was generous enough to help put in thousands for my dads funeral but with doing that his family is left with little to no money for my uncles funeral and other expenses. If the guy driving doesn't have a legal license or isn't insured are they at a loss? Is there any legal action they should try to take?	Yes
247	My girlfriend went out to a casino this past Saturday night with a group of work friends. Apparently one of the guys in the group was annoyed at my girlfriend for getting cigarette smoke in his face. According to her, he grabbed her by the back of her neck and slammed her down onto the sidewalk. She came home with nasty gashes on her face and forehead. She's asleep at the moment, but as far as I know police were not called and she declined medical attention. An employee of the casino had her sign some sort of waiver which I'm assuming said she wouldn't bring legal action against the casino.   I have no interest in bringing action against the casino but in the morning I'm going to see if she will file a police report against the guy that did this to her. I also believe that the casino will have video surveillance of the incident as well as a copy of the waiver she signed. Will we need to file with the police who have jurisdiction over the area the casino was in? Looking for any advice on how to proceed...  Thank you	Yes
248	Location Vic/ Australia  I received a caution/ drug diversion for possession/ being under the influence of LSD along with a caution for possession of a air rifle last year (I'm young and stupid, that's a cop out but that's the truth).   I'm currently trying to apply for a working visa for Canada and for jobs. They ask about previous convictions and cautions including driving offences. I understand it's in my best interest to be truthful but I also know it could ruin my chances to mention these offences.   What I want to know is will they show up on a background check for my visa? I was told by police they wouldn't show up on police records checks for work as they are only cautions but I don't know if the visa application is more in depth.   Tl;dr received cautions in aus, will they show up on visa application for Canada?	Yes
249	"This isn't anything dark, miss communication with someone on the phone who didn't like what I was saying so things turned to others and he must've reported it to the police, at this point in time I have no idea if he did or not. The police left phone mails asking to speak with me ""urgently"" do I need to report back to them or should I just see what it is regarding."	Yes
250	Recently my sister's friend confronted her ex, and father of her child, and he made claims about wanting to kill my sister, strangling his other children, and made a bunch of other threatening comments. Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney.  Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?	Yes
251	I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up. He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.  Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car. He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point... I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt. I also have a text message from a couple weeks ago where he threatens to fight me if I ever talk to him or if he sees me with the girl he was dating (neither of these things have happened but it is still a credible threat).  I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor. I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes. Will they take me in for my warrant? Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted? Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order? Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing. I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.  My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school. Is this a good plan?  Thank you	Yes
252	I am posting this for someone, and I am unsure if the details provided or 100% accurate as well. They are how ever close to the truth.    Around this time last year a young man (I will call him person A) was killed in a hit run by another (I will call him person b) young man in my hometown while person a was walking home from work late at night. Person b then removed person A's body from underneath his car, moved his body away from the side of the road and sped off.   As the days followed he had help from his dad with cleaning his car, and then hid his vehicle at his uncles business. Person A is now out on a $50,000 personal bond, and has court dates coming up  Is there anything I can do to help her?    https://imgur.com/gallery/yz5b0	Yes
253	Hello reddit. Yesterday someone had posted a redirect link to a drive on mega on 4chan with spanish video files with cp in the title of each. When translated they were words like little boy. I reported them since they seemed like cp but there was no way to confirm without downloading, and i did not want to download it.   There is good news and bad news. The good news is that the link is removed but the problem is that after I reported I found out that it was a UK based service. I am not sure what to do now as I am an American. Thanks for helping.	Yes
254	tldr; Someone came into my apt 3 separate times this week and stole varying amounts of candy each time. Apartment may have same locks and key for various units.  Kansas City, MO.  First off, let me start off with how my apartment building works. This is a fob entry building and you need a fob to get off any floor except the lobby. Which is why I believe it to be someone that lives in the building, namely my neighbor.  I have a roommate and we live in a small 2BR/2BA with a small entry way and living room. It's 6 regular steps to our living room, 14 to the kitchen, 15 and 17 to our rooms. I just want to show you how small it is. I came home Sunday from a 1 month trip visiting home while my roommate stayed here by herself. We have a candy bowl that I put candy in for guests and for ourselves.   I come home and see it's half full. Two days later, it's completely empty except for two pieces of candy. I ask my roommate what she did with it all, that's a lot of candy. She said she didn't touch it and her bf didn't touch it. We're both kind of freaked out but think it's stupid that anyone would come in and steal candy and nothing else. I chalk it up to a memory lapse or maybe I have carbon monoxide poisoning and did it, etc etc. I still called the front desk to let them know it was happening and refilled the candy bowl with reese's cups and hershey's kisses. I also talked to my next door neighbor and asked if he saw or heard anything recently. He said no, sorry, and closed the door. We just used a door jammer where even if unlocked, the door cannot be forced in. My 200lb brother couldn't even bust through it. I locked the doors and door jammed it every night until Thursday night, when I completely forgot to jam it.   I wake up Friday morning to go to work and all the bright, orange reese's are gone. I freak out, wake up my roommate and tell her to stop fucking with me cause it's not funny anymore. She told me she was awake all night until 5am, there's no way someone came in. Then she asked me if I woke up around 3am and I said no. She had heard someone in the living room/kitchen but thought it was me getting a snack. We call the front desk again and I head off to work around 9am.   My roommate heads off to work around 1pm and I got home around 3:30pm. Once again, the candy jar is completely empty except for the first two pieces they left the first time they stole our candy. So now they've escalated to daytime stealing. That is where I am left off night. Nothing has happened over the weekend. I called the police to report it over the phone but they want to physically come out and do a report. I went out of town and wasn't able to do it and my roommate worked all weekend. We also don't want to spook the thief because I really want to catch who is doing this. It's really freaking creepy and psychotic to just come in someones home to steal candy, just to fuck with us.   I believe it is the teenage boy because he is only 13, can't drive, and is on summer break. He also isn't the sweetest kid ever. I've seen him throw things and yelling racist obscenities at street walkers for no reason (we share the same window wall).  I had believed that perhaps someone has a masterkey or were picking our locks but my roommate actually talked to a tenant on our floor. The tenant said that when she first moved in, her key worked on three other units. I have already contacted the owner of my unit and let him know what was up and that he needs to come change my locks.  So, my problem is two part: this must be some sort of negligence/ security issue to have same lock for multiple units and how do I go about get this thief in jail or juvie. I am afraid that he will escalate from petty stealing to something worse. I don't want anyone else caught up in this after I move out. I am already hoping to do a stakeout tonight with my gopro recording as well as sleeping in the living room.   Thanks for sticking with the story and I apologize for my terrible writing. Any advice would be great, thanks!	Yes
255	"TLDR; my lawyer is advising me to bring the money I'm accused of stealing to my preliminary hearing to avoid heavy charges and plea to a summary offense.   The city police have followed through and charged me with theft. I met with my lawyer yesterday and he advised me to think about bringing the $150 (I'm being wrongfully accused of taking) to my court hearing next week. He said that even though I'm innocent, ""throwing money at something sometimes makes it go away""..He says that all the prosecutor needs to prove at my preliminary hearing is that I was in Warren at the time of the incident. That my presence in my hometown is damning enough for a judge to assume they have enough evidence to go to trial. And that if I AM convicted, I'll be seeing 2 years of probation and a HUGE fine-FOR A CRIME I NEVER COMMITTED. I'm so scared and confused. I'm not sure a jury WOULD find me innocent or not. Maybe I feel that way bc I'm scared out of my mind... He said if I bring the $150, that I would be facing a summary offense, and a small fine instead of facing jail time or probation. He says that sometimes even though we're innocent, the criminal justice system finds us guilty anyway. Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated!"	Yes
256	I'll keep this vague, to prevent doxxing.   So let's say, my Dad is a local business owner and he's being bullied by a lot of people in my hometown for basically nothing - cutting ~~good~~ the best deals with people the next town over. People are whiney babies but that's besides the point. Now, people get bored of attacking him with false accusations, so they start coming after me with some heavy stuff. Now let's say a local news anchor calls me up and let's me know that they're about to do a story on some pretty bad things that I may or may not have done, and want to see if I would like to comment.   To nip this all in the bud, I dump everything I have to prove them wrong but now it looks like what they were saying was actually maybe not entirely completely false, so I might have maybe kind have proven a little bit of what they were saying true.   Theoretically, if you supply evidence to your own crime, you can essentially plead the 5th and then they can't use that evidence so you're golden right?	Yes
257	I want to say first that my boyfriend is in reality capable of consent. He understands sex and is able to know what he wants and doesn't want. I am only asking about what the law is. He's a 25 year old man and is capable of having sex like anyone else.  He has schizophrenia and is diagnosed with an intellectual disability. It's a milder case of ID and mostly pertains to memory loss and difficulty understanding things. His schizophrenia is medicated but he still has delusions about magical things. However, he is able to function in daily life well.  My question is, what is the legal status of our relationship? If someone wanted to ruin my life, could they report me for statutory rape because he is mentally disabled?	Yes
258	So, this is a throw away account just in case because this deals with insurance, and I know little about it.  I posted in r/insurance and r/personalfinance too as I was referred.  A couple nights ago I was working an ON shift, and I typically park my car across in a lot that our company is allowed to use. This is downtown in a big city. Me, being a moron, left my spare set of keys and a spare debit card hidden in the center console. My shift ended somewhere around 7 am, and that's when I noticed my car was missing. Where it had been was replaced with a large pile of shattered window.     I called the police, and filed a police report. Then my dad (he handles the insurance and I pay him for it) filed a claim with our insurance guy. We have pretty good coverage, but the police have to search for the car for up to 14 days before the claim is considered I believe. Given the car was bought for about 7k, but certainly not nearly as valuable anymore, and there were things of value I could replace easily through insurance, I was not entirely upset.  Today, I was reviewing the cameras at my work out of curiosity. I noticed that my car started and took off at 330. I went backward in time and saw two people staring at it, looking around, and approach it at about 315. Their full faces are on camera, a little blurred, but identifying. The car window getting smashed was too dark to see, but there are companies with cameras next door.     What I would like to know is what would be my best option from here.    I can:    A. Report the footage to the officer.   B. Gather more footage and take my time.   C. Let the suits in Washington figure this out.    I do not want to do anything very illegal and obviously not commit insurance fraud, but I also would like to know my best decision financially.   I appreciate any and all advice.	Yes
259	Last night, I was out with my coworkers. We were supposed to meet at a manager's house for dinner, so I accompanied him to his house to make dinner for the group. Most ended up not coming, one did. We had been drinking before and during dinner. I had been driving coworkers, but as the night wore on I was not fit to drive and thought it would be a good idea to stay the night.  When we were alone, he forced himself on me despite me saying no, clearly, in many ways, more than once. I did not fight him. I was drunk, and scared.  Here's the issue: I am completing probation from a DV arrest. My abusive boyfriend called the police on me during a fight, I was arrested. I have completed a year of probation and my record is due to be expunged within the month. My court-appointed counselor advised me not to make a report, due to my record. She said I am unlikely to be taken seriously.   I am no longer on probation, I am allowed to drink, and I wasn't drunk enough to not know what was going on. I remember everything. He raped me, and I feel as though I have no recourse.  It is worth mentioning that while I am his employee, I am serving out my two weeks notice and will not be an employee past the 20th of this month.  What should I do? What can I do? I have been advised by that court-appointed counselor (who I have stayed in contact with because I like and trust her) to talk to him about what happened and proceed from there, depending on whether he gets defensive or not.  I am currently in the ER waiting on a rape kit, so I have at least some evidence to protect me in case this goes from bad to worse.   Thank you for reading.	Yes
260	Location is Alaska. My friend is 17, his brother is 20. Two nights ago they got drunk and his brother beat the shit out of him multiple times. Brother would let him walk away, then go beat him up again. My friend eventually got away, went home and got his AR15. He then spent an hour or so hunting his brother, chasing him around town and shooting at him when he saw him. He chased him through the woods behind my house, heard him unload 40-60 rounds at his brother. He was blackout drunk so he missed every time. Troopers came in yesterday, couldn't find my friend so they left. He's still hiding out. What will he be charged with? Attempted murder and evading arrest? How long will he get when he's caught?	Yes
261	So yeah.. last night i got the worst luck ever when me and a couple of frienda got caught smoking marijuana... I live in Sweden and it was my first time offense.  I was planning on traveling through asia in a couple of months. Starting in thailand. Which countries will i have a hard time getting in to? Thailand? Malaysia? Bali?   I appriciate the help and i feel so empty right now...  Best Regards	Yes
262	I got into a fight at school with this girl. We had an argument and on that day, she posted on Facebook that she's was going to fight me the next day. Someone screenshot it and send it to me. Well the next day, at lunch, she was putting her hair up in a ponytail when she saw me. When the bell rung, I was walking my friend to her class when I saw her looking at me. She made it seem like she was just walking past me but I saw her friend watching and I knew she was going to throw the first punch. I was ready and she came at me. Well the police was going to charge me with an assault until I told him the whole story and showed him the screenshot of her threatening me. So I have a court day and it says crime/Traff misdemeanor. Never fought in high school. I think she was 17. No major injuries on both of us. I didn't get charged with an assault, got charged with disorderly conduct.	Yes
263	Got six months probation for a DUI. Stayed out of trouble mostly, but as a result of severe mental illness and a little bit of laziness, I didn't do all the requirements on time. I told my PO I was having problems with the conditions and I got a notice from the judge that I had a probation violation hearing ordered. I didn't start my community service until after the hearing was ordered and didn't finish it until after my probation was scheduled to end. I didn't enroll in a DUI school until afterwards too, and while I've now done that - they didn't have an opening until after the date of the hearing. Also they said I didn't do the vehicle immobilization, but I have paperwork saying I sold the car almost immediately (which I told them before).   So, technically all I have to do is finish the DUI class. How much am I screwed considering I've done most of the terms now, if not just incredibly late?   Will the judge likely close the case, extend my probation, or give me jail time? I have no prior criminal history. But I don't really have an excuse and I'm not sure what I could say in my defense.   Also - I'm unemployed. I've heard some say employment is a condition for probation, but I was never told that and can't find much on it. Will that hurt me too?  Thanks.	Yes
264	My girlfriend with a mental condition (schizophrenia) has a friend who constantly makes her feel bad until she sends a sexually explicit image to her. If she doesn't respond to him (he lives in New York) then he berates her and curses at her.    This past day there were over 45 missed calls from him while we were spending time together. I didn't know she was doing this until she told me he was yelling again because she hadn't answered today, and I finally snapped and called him out on it. He eluded to having the images which led to my learning she had been doing this, and then spoke of how he got annoyed and mad at how she didn't send these images so he got mad. Today was the first day I learned of this. Once she learned I knew about what she did for him she cut herself so deeply she was in the ER and the other guy was unapologetic at his actions. I'm not sure if this has any legal grounds. Would it be helpful to call the police and report this? We are both 20 so are rather inexperienced. Apologies if this is written badly. I'm a mess.	Yes
265	Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	Yes
266	update from-  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6cog03/local_deputy_sheriff_not_abiding_by_us/  North Carolina § 14-223.  Resisting officers. If any person shall willfully and unlawfully resist, delay or obstruct a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge a duty of his office, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. (1889, c. 51, s. 1; Rev., s. 3700; C.S., s. 4378; 1969, c. 1224, s. 1; 1993, c. 539, s. 136; 1994, Ex. Sess., c. 24, s. 14(c).)  So since the charge, I have met with a Lawyer, who told me he could get the charges dropped without ever going to court. He has a sheet/waiver to sign that pretty much said I was okay with him going to court on my behalf but didn't want me to sign it as I already stated, he said it would never make it to court. Well, weeks have passed and I have not heard from him. I emailed him a few documents (Eagle Scout certificate, etc) that could help demonstrate my character. He never emailed back and my court date was today at 9 AM EST. I still haven't heard from him should I be worried? Also just a note- the lawyer was highly recommended by many people I know, as well as he had great reviews online.	Yes
267	So there is a company that called my work and asked for the maintenance guy's name. Then they sent us a huge $1,000 order of light bulbs and claimed that our maintenance guy ordered them.  We contacted the company and told them that we didn't order them and they needed to arrange to have them picked up or shipped back.  They were extremely rude, literally screaming that we ordered them and we had to pay for them. We of course refuse and tell them to stop contacting us.  A few months go by and then they send us a new invoice for only the freight to ship them back, $200. Again I contact them and tell them that we are not paying and they can have the product picked up or arrange to have it shipped back at their cost.  They refused and now I've received a letter from a collections agency for the $200.  They are complete scumbags, I looked them up on the Better Business Bureau and there are ~20 complaints about them running this exact same scam on other businesses.  I was content to ignore their requests for payment but now I don't want us to suffer any consequences for this being sent to collections.  What should I do?	Yes
268	Hey all, ill keep this short. Cop pulled me over today, suspected pot in my car, I complied and cooperated fully. They searched my car and found a one hitter, as well as the roach to a joint. The officer threw the roach on the ground, and took the one hitter. He let me off with a warning. Are there any long lasting repercussions for insurance, criminal record, possible summons in the mail, etc? Im 23 and live in minnesota.	Yes
269	"here is an update to anyone who is curious link (here) [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6mckz3/girlfriend_had_her_butt_grabed_by_a_mcdonalds/]. So today we filed a police report, the officer said that they would not go for any sexual battery type charge but rather a class C misdemeanor assault charge. That is honestly fine by me, i just want some form of punishment for ""Tyrone"" so he knows that it's not okay to grab women who don't want to be grabbed. They said they would review the tapes and im hoping to god that the cameras caught it, there is two cameras in the lobby but this was over at the drink station so they might not be able to see the physical contact that occurred. I also called the Mcdonalds corporate office and the lady seemed very understanding and polite and said that her supervisor would launch an investigation and review the tapes and contact the Franchise owner immediately. I told her that the police were already investigating and all that happened. We have no interest in sueing mcdonalds or the guy who did this, i just want him to maybe get a fine and lose his job.With that said i am tempted to call the DA's office once he is charged with the Class C assult to see if they could possibly bump it up to class B or something. Feel free to give any advice or ask questions, once this is all over i will post a final update."	Yes
270	"This is a very long story but I will try to make it as simple as possible.   My husband is being asked to speak to a detective in a case against his brother ""Joe"".  We don't live near Joe, but another sibling does and is on Joe side saying that everything his ex-wife is saying is untrue.  Basically Joe is accused of molesting his five year old daughter. Supposedly, according to his ex-wife he has already lost custody of his daughter, but the court hasn't decided what will happen to their son.   When my husband was a little boy Joe molested him, and even though that's all in the past now, Joe's ex-wife is asking my husband to speak to a detective about it because she thinks it could help her case.  The problem is we don't know who's telling the truth. Joe says the court didn't take his daughter away, that it's a pending investigation, and his daughter was coached to say the things she did. According to his ex-wife she's worried that he'll molest their son too, but because he isn't  a named victim at this time the court might not take away parental visits.  My husband's having a hard time deciding what to do, because if Joe's ex-wife is telling the truth he wants to help protect his nephew. But if Joe is telling the truth he doesn't want to ruin his life. Also, if my husband makes a statement this will definitely divided the family as obviously everyone seems to believe Joe.  My question is if there's anyway that we can know, since we don't live near them, what actual evidence there are in the case. If my husband speaks to detective is he legally allowed to lie to my husband about the case?  Joe is a known liar... but his ex-wife can be cunning.  Is it possible that my husband's statement would really hold so much value?  Please help."	Yes
271	Hello, I'm 25 and I met a 16 year old who desires sexual relations. While I know the age of consent in Indiana is 16, I want to recognize the legal complexities of the matter. Please advise me on how to best chart this course and what I should avoid.	Yes
272	She's got BPD and bipolar with mental trauma from being molested as a toddler by her parents, and she's recently been put on new meds which caused all sorts of psychosis and delusions until they kicked in.  Three years ago, her 8 year old nephew was staying the night with her and bugging the he'll out of her. She put half a MG of klonopin in his drink so he would go to sleep. Her new meds are making her feel guilty for all her past wrongs, but she told her therapist about this and was told it has to be reported to the hotline on Monday.   We're in Arkansas, what can we expect? She's on disability and her mental health can't handle jail. I'm freaking out, she's calm.   During a bout of mania she told her sister, the boy's mother, a few weeks ago when she went to the hospital to try to be checked into behavioural health while her meds were asjusting. The mother didn't press charges, and those doctors didn't report it. What is going to happen? It's not like there's proof, and maybe the statute is up?	Yes
273	"We're in Minnesota, USA. My husband had a piece of equipment worth $10,000 stolen from our vehicle in the parking lot of our apartment building. We have cameras facing where our vehicle was parked, and we have an open police report, but our apartment landlords are refusing to look over the tapes because, ""we don't have a two-hour time frame of the crime."" We have a 6-hour window from parking and realizing the car was burglarized, but that isn't good enough for them. They won't let us review the tapes ourselves, and the officers don't really care about a petty theft case unless the office can see someone with the piece of equipment (it's rather large).   Is there any sort of legal action we can pursue to get our landlord to review the tapes?"	Yes
274	My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	Yes
275	"I was charged with attempted larceny in a building. A 1 year misdemeanor. The prosecutor has said if I do not tale their plea at my pre trial they will make it a larceny in a building charge, a 4 year felony, the charge stems from accusations of me stealing a phone. The only evidence is the police report and the witness testimony from a nurse and a doctor. In neither of the testimonies do they say they saw me take anything, it is all assumption because ""i was the only one in the room"".  At the same time my lawyer is advising me not to take the plea deal because i would then have to lie and say I did take the phone, but at the same time im not gonna face a felony charge for taking it to trial.  Any advice would be great, thanks."	Yes
276	"I dated a man for a little over a year. We lived together for the last 4 months. My cat died under unusual circumstances after ongoing ""illness"" and the autopsy revealed she died from physical trauma when he was home alone with her. Putting all the pieces together I believe he had been abusing her (the ""illness"") then crushed her to death. Otherwise our relationship was full of red flags and signs that he was an abusive psychopath. Abuse, stalking, harassment...I block his number and he uses another to contact me, I repeat the block he repeats the new number. I tried to break things off a dozen times and then he would do the stalking and harassment and manipulation and out of fear I would get back together with him. But no more now that he killed my cat. I could very well be his next victim. I believe he may have killed my cat because one time we broke up I told his mom the true nature of our relationship and about the bad things he had done to me.  I'm staying with my mom now and filing a TPO tomorrow along with animal cruelty charges. He knows where I live, work, workout, hang out, my schedule, all that. I'm so afraid he's going to come after me or send someone else after me. His family is connected to a drug cartel and he has done drug trafficking with them. I want to move but I'm afraid he'll still find me. When we were together he bragged about how easy it was to find my address online. My state is one of the 12 that doesn't have an address confidentiality program. I don't want to live my whole life in fear. I don't know what to do because I am certain he will try to get revenge on me at some point. What do I do?"	Yes
277	I'm pretty sure it happened when I just turned 16...  it's still on my record as a misdemeanor. How do I go about getting this off?	Yes
278	I have my court date coming up for getting pulled over with weed in my car. I was arrested and I got out on a PR bond. I'm not really sure what to expect or what I should plea. Any suggestions?	Yes
279	My mother is a realtor. Last year she plead guilty to several criminal charges unrelated to real estate, but her other business. She is currently serving in a probation program for 3 years for those crimes.  Now Real Estate Commission is trying to suspend/revoke her license with possible fines, given that she plead guilty to these crimes (demonstrating poor conduct, dishonesty, etc.), and that she failed to notify them within 30 days (she didn't know she had to do this, and sent the info immediately after getting notice). They are requesting admission/denial of allegations, upon which they will determine if there's any validity to the disputes to warrant a trial. If not, there will be a hearing where we can provide witnesses/evidence which will decide the final penalty/sanction.   Obviously the best scenario is avoiding any trial, and having as minimal penalty/sanction/fines as possible. My mother's previous business closed down, she declared bankruptcy and is 64 years old, so financially she has no money - Being a realtor was how she was making ends meet, so this will be a huge blow. That said, we had a consultation with a lawyer and he's quoting a very high retainer fee and billing rate, which we can barely afford.   Question is: Is it worth it to call the Commission case office directly, before hiring the lawyer, to get an idea of what the possible penalty/sanctions/fines could be in the first place? The lawyer said if we hired him, the first thing he would do is call the Commission to do exactly this, so we're wondering if we can just ask ourselves?   Our rationale for this is if the penalty/sanctions/fines are actually not that bad, we can avoid wasting money on a lawyer. [I've read through actual outcomes of real estate license cases ('disciplinary actions') as they're all online, and it seems like for people who committed crimes unrelated to real estate, and are already serving in a probation program, the penalty/sanctions/fines aren't that bad...] On the other hand, we can confirm that the Commission is considering a harsh penalty and high fines, in which case, we can just go ahead and hire a lawyer to help get them reduced. I'd like to know if asking the Commission about this is a good idea or one that could bite us in the ass?  TL;DR - mother is realtor and might have her license suspended/revoked for crimes unrelated to real estate. Fines may also be imposed. Mother has no money (bankrupt) and 64 years old, so losing license will be devastating. At the same time, potential Lawyer is asking for very high fee. Wondering if we can call Real Estate Commission case officer directly to get an idea of possible sanctions and fines the have in mind, and go from there, OR if this is a dumb idea and we should just hire lawyer.     Thanks in advance for your help.	Yes
280	Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
281	Am I under any legal trouble? From my understanding, I'm 21 with no authority over her, within 4 years, and the AoC is 16. We've been talking for 2 weeks and I told my family and they are strongly implying I'm going to face criminal charges.	Yes
282	"The State placed a restraining order on her to me about a year ago. During this year we have decided to ignore the order and remain living with each other.   I found out that she was cheating last week and the police got called from a third party, basically trying to ""help me"" and get her out of my house. She was arrested and released the next day.  On Friday 8/11, she kept calling me while I was at work because I changed the locks to the front door and she wanted to get in and get clothes, etc. I told her I wouldn't leave work. She said if I didn't come back immediately, she would come down to my job and make a scene. She said she would tell my boss about me stealing random items (I work in a grocery store).  I ended up driving back and had the police informed that I wanted a civil standby for her to get her things. They didn't show up immediately and she was screaming on the street, so to help my neighbors not hear any more I opened the front door. The police showed up and arrested her for being within 500 feet. She was released Monday.  I just want to know what I can do about her personal belongings. Can I carefully put them in boxes, not breaking any of them? And put them in the corner of my house so I don't see her things everywhere I look?  She is pregnant too, about 7 weeks. She told me that she will terminate it, but then jokingly said she should keep it so she can get child support from me. I told her if she were to have my child that I would take her to court the minute it was born and prove how unfit of a mother she is and take the child.  I don't have money for a lawyer but realize this might be the only route. Does r/legaladvice have any advice for me prior to contacting a lawyer?   I really appreciate it."	Yes
283	"A friend of mine and I found ourselves where we were locked on my roof one night, both intoxicated and being very loud.  The cops ended up being called on us and to make a long story short the police had to kick down the front door to let us out.  My friend immediately was tackled and arrested due to the fact that when the police tried to grab his arm he pulled away and this was considered resisting arrest.  When it came to me I said minimal to the police, mostly, ""I would like a lawyer.""  The part of the police report that pertains to me is as follows, ""Officer ******* spoke with the second male and asked him for his identification. The male reused and indicated that he wanted an attorney.  Officer ****** advised him that he was not under arrest that he just needed to identify him.  The male again indicated that he wanted an attorney.  Officer ******* then placed the male in handcuffs, the male then identified himself as **** ********. Officer ****** advised Mr. ******** that he was not under arresst but was being detained during the course of the investigation and that if he cooperated he would be released. Mr. ******** stated ""screw you, I want a lawyer"".""    I recently received this summons in the mail with a disorderly conduct charge. My court date is in a couple weeks and I am wondering if it would be worth getting a lawyer or if there is anything else I should be doing to help myself in the situation. Any advice is appreciated."	Yes
284	"I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.    My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?  What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?"	Yes
285	"This is a long shot but I was curious if there's anything wrong about a police officer turning his camera off while searching someone's car after a stop.   The way it went down as he says is he got pulled over for running a stop sign, the guy started to smell the weed then had asked if he could search the car. Before searching he told my roommate that he is a ""good cop"" for turning the camera off as he searched.   I was lead to believe cops weren't allowed to turn their cameras off, is that not true? If it's true, is there anything he can do about that or is he pretty much just screwed?"	Yes
286	I wasnt there but 2 of my very close friends were arrested last night for possession of marijuana. What happened was my first 2 friends drove back into this neighborhood with no houses built yet, just places for them to be built. The first car saw them and let them know, and then when the 2nd car with 4 people stopped at the stop sign within view of the cops they turned their lights out and back on (not 100% what happened here.) After they turned the cops flip their lights on and they come to the vehicle, make everyone roll down their windows and take their id's and proceed to detain them and then go on to search the car, find a bag of weed in one friends bag as well as  a bong, lighter, etc and the other one who had no weed only a scale and possibly lighters/rolling papers. The 2 who owned the bags (1 was the car owner) were taken into the police car and arrested and we found that they were charged with possession of marijuana under 2oz and are currently on bail for $500 a piece. They released my other 2 friends who were in the car with them and they were able to take the car. We are going to talk to a lawyer asap and try to get them out of there as well. Is there any way they can get out of this considering they had no probable cause and never asked to search the vehicle. This is in Montgomery County, Tx, US.	Yes
287	I know limited details about this, my friend was contacted by her uncle, he asked for a place to stay. He violated a probation in washington state, and had a warrant issued as a result. He came to Minnesota as he has a lot of extended family. He reached out to my friend asking for a place to stay, and she agreed.  Is letting him stay at her apartment illegal?  What sort of legal trouble could she face?  If they find him at her place what will happen to her?  Im trying to convince her its incredibly stupid to let him stay there, apparently he had federal marshalls show up at his home in washington, but he had already fled the state, so it seems pretty serious. Do marshall normally show up looking for someone over a probation violation, or is it possible he's commited a more serious crime and lying to my friend?	Yes
288	So my other post is on here but I'll cut to the chase now. My ex has a RO against me and I found a video on my google drive that was connected to my old phone of her sexually assaulting and raping me in my sleep. I called the police and they are having an officer call me back. She took the footage on my phone while i was asleep. I can't get in trouble for having this footage can I? Should I not report? Please help. The officer should be calling me any minute.	Yes
289	I was arrested for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, but I was caught with both plant matter and concentrate (dismeanor amounts), along with 3 pieces of paraphernalia (3 packs of rolling papers). As a result, I had multiple charges for these different items. Is it likely that the judge will drop the redundant charges or will I face harsher consequences for these different illegal items?	Yes
290	For background information, my friend and i are both 17 going to be 18 soon.  To start the story off my friend and i were smoking a blunt on the side of the road when a cop pulled up behind us and walked to the door. After making eye contact with the officer he opened my door (drivers side) and asked us to get out and put us against the wall. After that we were patted down and put into the cop car. About 2 more cop cars came and they started searching my vehicle where they found about 2 grams of weed. When suddenly the officer pulled out 3/4ths of an Ecstasy pill and asked me to identify what it was. We were eventually taken to the local station where they filled out the paperwork and than after about 6 hours transported to downtown. my friend and i were both charged with the marijuana but i was charged with controlled substance on top of that. This is my first offense of any kind. But, on the police report they stated that when the police were patting us down they found weed on us which isn't true. The only thing on me was my wallet and my friend had nothing on him at all. They also stated that we were going door to door selling weed, that they found the X pill in a pill bottle with my name on it which also is not true. There was a pill bottle with my name on it but it had marijuana in it. they also stated that when we went to the local station we were being questioned by detectives the whole time but in reality we were put into singular cells and chained up the entirety of the time there. if i'm being completely honest i really am unsure of what's gong to happen. Is my life over? Is it even possible for me to have an ending that will be relatively okay? Also, I'm enrolled in an EMT program for this upcoming senior year and we have to do a background check and i suppose that's over for me? i appreciate whatever advice you can give.	Yes
291	Hey! If your reading I thank you so much because I need to clear something up in my mind. So I basically shoplifted a few months ago, at sears (ik it's dumb) in April. The police were called as there're policy states. Anyways the police interviewed me and decided not to charge me. They took my info down (DOB,Adress,name) my concern is whether if it would show up any check for any type of employment in the future for event if they didnt charge me (police encounter)! Am I good?	Yes
292	The police officer blatantly lied in the police report and if I can locate the victim, I can prove it. The victim (a store clerk) didn't even speak English but the police report has sentences of things I supposedly said to him, including a death threat which I never made. If I can locate that store clerk and have him verify  1. he didn't understand what I was saying 2. as such, he didn't understand a death threat I never made 3. he was not scared for his life based on that death threat   then: 4. i'm not guilty of criminal threats, which is what i plead guilty to.  How to do that I don't know. I've emailed several lawyers and none respond. I imagine this doesn't fit within the confines of their usual churning out plea bargain framework so they don't want to bother with it.   Thanks for any help.	Yes
293	I exchanged nude photos with a girl online, her profile listed that she was 20 years old. After exchanging photos she said she was 16, I immediately stopped talking to her, she told her father, her father has threatened legal action. What is the precedent for something like this?	Yes
294	"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
295	"(PH) So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I was in a relationship with this person. So yeah this is your typical, revenge porn or non-consensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.  I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
296	"About a month ago, my brother was arrested for stalking and peeping.  Today, he received a letter notifying him that the police department has a warrant for his arrest for ""entering without permission"", and he must contact the court to see what he needs to do.  The letter explicitly states that this is separate from the charges from a month ago.  Isn't it a bit odd that this was not included in the arrest from a month ago?"	Yes
297	Hi all,  I met with an escort at a hotel she was residing in. I went to her room and she met me in a towel, as I requested, and then she kissed me following me entering the room. She asked for her money and I told her I had none. She then proceeded to kick me out. As I was driving away she texted me my licence plate and told me she would call the police. I told her I would contact the hotel she was staying in and she told me to kiss goodbye to my car.  Any legal advice?  Extra Info: I texted her the day before asking for a 30min meet. I intended to meet her at this point. In the morning she didnt reply and I assumed it was off, it was only an hour before she confirmed. I requested a certain outfit from her but I didn't intend to carry out any services because I felt I was doing something wrong, so I brought no money. I do not know what brought me to her residence.  Truthfully guys, I'm kinda scared of this getting out and she has my licence plate for my car.  - I am new to this sub, so please help me if I have made a mistake anywhere, thank you.	Yes
298	"Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...  Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.  So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.  Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".  But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.  I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.  I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself. All I could picture were the pictures she used to send me. So without getting into detail, I got into my first fight. I regret in a way now, I didn't think I could go so far....  Tl:DR; Beat the shit out of a girls abusive boyfriend, no weapons involved. Definitely broke some bones. I am not proud of it believe me, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. I just want to know what to expect if he presses charges...   By the way, if the story is unnecessary let me know and I'll remove it, thank you."	Yes
299	Texas.  I have a bank account which was opened when I was 18 with my mother and step-father being co-signatures (big mistake). This means they have full access to my bank account. I used the account to deposit social security checks that I collected in my fathers name since he died. I'm told that I was eligible for the checks (around ~1800 each month) as long as I am in school full time. Since I graduated High School last month I don't believe I will see another one even though I am attending a 4-year University in the fall. If anybody can confirm this that would be great because my parents haven't given me a lot of details.  Anyway the checks had my name on it since I turned 18 and I endorsed them when depositing them into my account. I was told that the money would be used to pay for college, but I always knew that my mom took out a little each month to pay for general expenses. However I recently gained access to online banking (which they didn't allow me to view) where I have found out that they have taken a lot more than they said they had been. I found over 3,000 dollars in withdraws at an ATM in a casino...  Let me repeat that. They have withdrew over $3,000 dollars from my college savings account and used the money for gambling. I am beyond mad.  I also found over $9,000 has been transferred from the savings account into their general checking account. All of this has occurred in the 12 months since I turned 18 meaning that every dime that was even in the account was 100% mine since I received it as an adult with my name on the check. I realize the difficulties that pose in the situation since my parents are co-signatures on the account and therefore have the same right to the money as I do...  I confronted them yesterday and they acted offended that I question what they are doing with my money (!) and attempted to kick me out of the house. My mom is 100% convinced she is justified in taking my money and spending it on gambling and is completely outraged that I would object otherwise. My mom is a narc and my step-dad is just a dick who hates me. I see no way in getting them to pay back the money they took from me.  Ultimately, I understand that legally I probably don't have grounds to sue. Nor do I intend on suing my parents. If possible, I would like to get a lawyer to compose a document indicating that I believe they owe me this money and they should pay me otherwise I will take it to court. This would let them know that I am very serious about the matter because otherwise they will just ignore me.  I have since closed my accounts at that bank and withdrew all the money I had available.  What is upsetting is that this money was the only savings I had for college since my parents have refused to save their money for my college (they can't even keep their fingers out of money I saved). They will certainly offer me no financial assistance while in college so I am forced to take out $100k in loans to attend college. Side note: if I declare emancipation will that open me up for need-based financial aid considering my income is 0?  Anyway, thank you for reading this far. I am stuck in a very difficult situation and afraid I cannot reason with my parents. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
300	I was caught on private property by police officers as I was exiting with other people I did not know. (popular spot for kids to hang out) There was signage on the property and an empty police car. I had assumed at the time of entering the property that there was a cop inside the car since the windows were tinted and he would have informed me that I should not be there but it turns out the car was empty. The police informed us to never come back and they claimed to have taken our cars' license plates and we may see a trespassing summons in the mail. No one gave any information, nor were they asked by the cops for it.  If they didn't personally take my information and just read plates, could I still be sent a summons? I am not the person the car is registered to and there would be no way to prove who was on the property since no information was taken.  Thank you	Yes
301	You own a product and something breaks on it. You go out and buy a new one and replace the part that's broke with the new one. You return the product to get your money back. Is this consider stealing? If not is this illegal?	Yes
302	I know there may be other factors involved that could determine the outcome of something like this. But any general information would be helpful. This is about a persons s/o, I'm based in Medina, Ohio.	Yes
303	Uh hello guys, so this very crooked media group is talking about my son doing some things that they claim are illegal and he didn't do these things, but he just posted some content on twitter that says he did do these things. Now I know some very big lawyers, the best lawyers, let me tell you. I don't know, but people are telling me all sorts of things. I have so many people working on this, the best people, but you can never have too many of the best people.  What is collusion? Let's say a member of a not low-level US campaign, you know, offered to throw out some nasty regulations in exchange for some TRUTH about crooked Hil... about another candidate. Would that be not legal?	Yes
304	I’ve been doing some research and learned that felons ( and those convicted of lower level crimes ) have been turned away at the Canadian border.  I’d like to visit Canada ( Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, etc. ) but I’d like to figure out process of gaining entry first before wasting my time and being turned away at the border.  As far as my criminal history is concerned, 16 year’s ago I was charged and convicted of withholding information ie. not snitching.  This was a federal charge.  I haven’t had any issues with obtaining employment.  I was able to get into college and get my degree as well.    I’m not much for making excuses and letting life hold me back.  That being said, I do like to be proactive and be prepared and that’s why I’m posting about this on this sub.  So, what can I do to be have a chance at being allowed entry into Canada as a visitor/tourist/sightseer?  Will I need legal representation?	Yes
305	My friend was accused of sexual assault and she never used the words no, stop or anything of a similar sense to convey she did not wish to continue. It was oral and hands if that makes a difference. She is spreading around that he raped her and he is scared that he will get sent to jail. He was 15 at the time of the alleged assault and is currently 17. Live in canada. What can he do to protect himself or legally go after her without ruining his life.	Yes
306	So recently I got a DUI and the lawyer was able to get me an agreement on a suspended imposition. This is only in a couple of states, South Dakota and Missouri I believe. Well my question is, will I still be found guilty under the courts judgement or convicted?	Yes
307	My roommate got caught with so an eighth of marijuana while getting pulled over the other day, he was about to get his medical card this next week. He so far hasn't been charged but was taken to the police station. If he gets put on probation can he still get a medical card without any issues? I saw that the supreme court here passed a law saying that probation can't stop medical patients (http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/04/07/medical-marijuana-arizona-supreme-court/25416337/) but I can't seem to get anything about getting the card after being caught by the police.   Can anyone help me out on this?	Yes
308	Long story short my brother got charged with a class 4 felony possession, and a handful of misdemeanors. Was out on bond, kept using heroin, ended up getting arrested with another class 4 possession and another handful of misdemeanors. He is likely going to have a public defender. Do you think he will serve time? (This is Will county in Illinois)	Yes
309	I was arrested in Big Bend in May (Federal checkpoint) for possession of less than a half ounce of marijuana. After being fingerprinted, photographed and waiting in the cell for two hours, I was released. The judge didn't accept the case, they said. No charges were filed, no citations were issued. I signed no documents and was not asked to reappear at a future date. Without asking too many questions, I got the hell out of there.  &amp;nbsp;  Naturally, I became very concerned for my record, and looked into getting the record expunged. I called several lawyers, both in my city of residence, as well as a few in west Texas.  &amp;nbsp;  However, before I got far, none of them could even find the arrest in the system. I figured at least the court/county that denied my case would have record of it, but they didn't. I also checked the DMV database ($3 fee), and it brought up nothing.  &amp;nbsp;  Can someone explain to me why this might be?	Yes
310	My exact location is NYC, but I'm just wondering in general, is there anything illegal about the content of r/sanctionedsuicide?  I stumbled upon it from a comment thread, and I feel very uneasy about it.  Especially underage folks writing out potential suicide notes, and, presumably, adults giving them advice on painless methods or telling them that they support their decision.  I fully understand that people can make their own decisions, but the Michelle Carter case comes to mind with some of the comments.  I obviously know nothing about the law when it comes to this, but I'm just curious.  Thanks.	Yes
311	I had been caught buying mushrooms months ago. I was handcuffed but the detective who had arrested me told me that the incident would be in his notes but due to the fact that they were looking for a serial rapist (that just so happened to fit my description) and that it was my first offense I would be let go. Yesterday two cops came to my door, showed me a warrant for my arrest and took me to jail. I was realeased on bail 18 hours after arrest. At the time I thought that it kind of made sense but now that I've had time to think about it I don't really understand why it took them that long to arrest me. I gave the detective my number and everything but I never received a call or a letter about having to appear in court but all of a sudden there's a warrant for my arrest? I just need some advice because this is my first (and hopefully last) run in with the law.	Yes
312	I live in an extremely small town, and apparently I've pissed off the wrong people. Now I can't leave my house without a bunch of people following me and even trying to beat me up and possibly kill or disfigure me permanently.    Is there any legal recourse I can take, I know all their faces but not all their names. I'm pretty nervous.	Yes
313	This is my first time posting to Reddit at all, so bear with me. I took a number of topless photos when I was younger. They were for my own personal use only, and although I shared them in limited capacity, I didn't think much of it (I was in my early 20s and stupid.) The first incident happened in early 2014, and my photos for put on a revenge porn site (if you don't know what those are, you can research them, they're pretty horrible.) I paid money to have them taken down by a DOA site that specializes in that sort of thing, and for 3 years I heard and saw nothing. Now whoever is posting them is back, they used my name and information and pictures on the site fetlife. I had them removed there by the site immediately. Now today I have been informed that someone posted my stuff on Craigslist. No contact info was apparently given (I'm hearing of this one thru a friend) but it was deleted soon after without my intervention.   My question is this. What would be the best action for me? This is a huge invasion of my privacy, and I'm scared. Whoever posts these things makes it seem like I'm into hardcore rape fantasy and noncon, and I feel like my life is in danger from this, considering they put my real name, city in which I live, and updated pictures of me that they gleaned from Facebook (I have it set to completely private but they just grabbed my profile pic I assume.) I would like to take some sort of legal action but I also know that it's incredibly hard to do so.   Tl;dr I'm being repeatedly doxxed with my own pictures and I'm terrified and I want to figure out what to do. I don't know who is doing this, it's not an ex as I have good relationships with all of them. It's someone who just doesn't like me because it's always the same info they use and the same nasty descriptions. Help?!	Yes
314	So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them.   For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.  I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?  My business is in Pennsylvania and they are located in New York.   Thanks for your assistance.	Yes
315	I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended license, and completely spaced the court date. I'm fairly certain that means I will now have a bench warrant for failure to appear, in addition to having to take care of my original charge.   I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker.   I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next? I take care of a parent and kid so it would be really bad to go to jail. (Otherwise I'd just bit the bullet and go for a short period.)   TL;DR: What's the best bet for getting my warrant cleared, without spending time in jail, and can I do it on my own? How likely (approximately) is it that I'll get arrested if I go in on my own?	Yes
316	"Hey,  When I was 14 in 2003 I met a 24 year old man online whom I later found out I had a girlfriend. We started a sexual relationship in 2003 after I had turned 15, this happened a dozen times or more, and included everything barring penetrative sex, ending November 2004.  He told me he loved me, that he'd leave his partner for me, was my source of counsel and support while I was going through problems at home including going to live in foster care.  I know that at this time, the legal age of consent was 14 in Canada, and that this was ""upgraded"" to 16 in 2008 when I was 19, 4 years after the contact ended.  Are there any exceptions to this rule? I know there is a law that nullifies the age of consent law if he was in a position of authority, but he wasn't my baseball coach, nor was he a teacher. I have pretty in depth diary entries from that time to provide proof of my emotional state, and some verbatim copy and paste AIM messages between him and I.   Are you aware of any cases in Canadian criminal court where something like this was allowed to go ahead?  I would just take a walk down to my local police station and speak to a detective, but I live aboard now and am back in the city where this happened for 2 weeks in a few months, so any conversations I've had with detectives over the phone have been very hypothetical, but they've encouraged me to come down.  I appreciate all you can offer me in way of legal advice is a guide, as well as hypothetical. Regardless of what happens, I will of course still go to the station to give a statement and submit my evidence so that the detectives and attorneys can make a decision, but I'm sure you can imagine that being thousands of miles away, unable to speak to someone now, I am quite anxious.  Any advice is fully appreciated."	Yes
317	A friend of mine is upset that I chose my current boyfriend over him. I am 17 in a state where the age of consent is 18. My boyfriend is over 18.  If everyone else denies it, what does my friend need to prove it?	Yes
318	I'm 20 and am expecting to go to trial. I had to get a police report in before I could have my car get towed after my collision in which I took a breathilizer and managed 2 points below a dwi (0.06). I have to show up in court in a month.  So now I'm wondering what first steps I should take before the court case's consequences such as getting my license suspended, getting a restricted license etc.	Yes
319	"Today I was pulled over.  When the vehicle came to a stop I cracked the window to about 1/2in, enough to hear the officer's commands and hand over my identification.  The officer approached my driver's window and stood there.  Said nothing, then opened my driver's door.  I was flabbergasted, I asked him what right he had to open my door.  He replied, ""You didn't put the window down.""   As I see it, if I had something illegal in the door of my car, he would not have known about it until he opened the door.  Which seems to me like an illegal search.  Could someone weigh in on this?"	Yes
320	"I realize that this is probably a lost cause, but whatever.  For context, my girlfriends brother, called Eric for this story, works in a family-owned restaurant in a mountain town in Colorado. My GF, called Jane for this story, was going to the town to meet up with her brother, as they hardly ever see each other. He is 27, Jane is 17. Eric has been working in a restaurant to finance his wedding to his fiancé, Jordan (fake name). He also works in ski patrol during the winter and does odd jobs around the town during the summer.  The incident began when Jane arrived in town. Jane and Jordan were waiting outside the restaurant for Eric to get off his shift, and both of them go inside to ask Eric how long he has remaining in his shift before he's off. Jane goes to wait outside while Jordan talks to the manager. Jordan comes back outside, apparently looking really creeped out and distraught. Jane asks what happened, Jordan says the manager asked how old Jane was, saying ""what is she? 19? 20?"" Jordan relies and says, ""no, she's 17, why?""  The manager responds with ""well when she's wearing shorts like that she might as well be 20. She's got an ass like a 20 year old"" and then made a gesture where he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and inserted his other index finger into the hole repeatedly. (This is obviously a sex gesture).  It should be noted here that the manager of the restaurant is not the owner, and is a 42 year old man.   Jane and Jordan wait for Eric to get off work, and when he does, they tell him of the situation. Eric replies with ""I'm going to fucking beat his ass."" (Eric is very protective of Jane. For the first 6 months of our relationship, our dates were always me and Jane… and Eric. Were like brother now though.)   Jane and Jordan tried to hold him back from going into the restaurant, but they're small girls while Eric is 6'4"" 250 lbs of pure muscle. He walked back into the restaurant, and Jane and Jordan followed him. He asked the manager what he said about his sister, and he, strangely, told Eric exactly what he said, with gesture and all, and added at the end ""she's a dirty little girl, isn't she Eric?"" And winked after the last question.  Eric uppercutted the manager so hard he left the floor briefly before hitting the ground. The manger was driven to the hospital by Eric, and has a concussion, a broken cheekbone, and brief amnesia.  I should say now that this is all 2nd hand. I didn't witness any of this, but Jane and Jordan saw all of it and relayed it to me.  Is there anything they can do to keep Eric out of jail and not bankrupt him/the entire family? Thanks all!"	Yes
321	Dunno what's really pertinent here but I have a record in two states living in a third. I'm a pretty stable schizo with two jobs and a BA. I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb. I received ~$200 pair of tickets for operating w/o insurance and driving on a suspended registration. I paid the tickets well ahead of deadline but came home to find info staying that a bench warrant was put out on me but apparently according to the clerk's website I'm good. So what's the deal with this type of situation. I'm not even clear on if these are simple tickets misdemeanors or whatever (WI).	Yes
322	**Only serious replies please, I know I screwed up**  Hello,   I was caught leaving a mall holding a $300 item. I desperately need advice.   One of my relatives needed to have repair done on an item at the Apple store. The wait time was about 2 hours. We submitted our information and decided to wait. I wanted headphones for myself and my husband. I took one pair, did not get caught and decided to wait in the queue to pay for the 2nd pair. While waiting I needed to go to the bathroom and I was in line to ask how much longer the wait. During that point I had a bit of an accident since my bladder is weak after giving birth recently. I was standing right by the exit and I was embarrassed. I decided to go to my car quickly, but I did not put down the item I planned on paying for. Prior to any of this I told my relative I need to go to the bathroom and I was checking on the queue before leaving. When the the leak first started I thought it might be a gush of blood since I am postpartum then I realized it was urine. I left the store holding the item.. I realized I had the item in hand and I didn't know if I should go back or not with urine dripping down my leg. I was embarrassed and decided I will get my extra clothing, come back, and act like I was there the whole time. I'm sorry for the TMI.   Outside the mall I was apprehended by a man dressed in casual clothes saying I was shoplifting, I told him and showed him the urine and a puddle was starting to form under me. I explained it was an error on my part but I was going to the car and planned to return which I know sounds bogus.. I gave him the item and said he could follow me to my car. I explained I was panicking about my situation. He started to get forceful and I resisted. There was no real proof he was security or anyone at that point.. despite that I still tried to explain myself and remain civil. I tried to get away from him. He caught up and put handcuffs on me and people in security outfits came at that point. I was arrested and taken to the local police department. It was written as at 4th degree for prosecution. This is my first offense and I am 36 years old with children. I was told this can get downgraded to the lower courts and etc. I'm not sure what to do at this point because I'm sure they can see on the footage I took the other item too.. I was not charged for it.	Yes
323	"A friend of mine ""borrowed"" my car without my permission, meaning he stole my keys and took my car to run an errand, but later returned both.  Is there legal action that could be taken?  The state this occurred in is Georgia."	Yes
324	"Hey everyone, this is happening right now, but this is all the information I have.  So I was in the military, I was recently discharged and now have a pretty good job which I dont want to disclose for obvious reasons. A female military member I served with is trying to claim I sexually assaulted her so she can get money from disability for PTSD.  What is my best course of action right now? I thought we were friends and for one this is very hurtful, but I will not sit idly by and be made into a sex offender for someone elses personal gain. This ""happened/happening"" in texas, I am in california. Thank you. I hope this isnt too hard to follow I am literally shaking."	Yes
325	"Happened in Utah, USA.  To begin, yes I learned my lesson. Won't be happening again.   Basically what happened is, at night my SO and I decided to drive out to a seemingly secluded place. We found a parking lot for a hiking trail that was empty. We did the deed, and then as we were putting clothes back on an officer approached the car.   We decided the best plan of action was to come clean. And so we did.   He asked us both basic questions (""Are you here on your own free will, did you consent to the activities taken place"") and looked at both of our IDs.  Then he just came back and said ""yeah, just find a better place to do this next time, go home tonight."" He didn't say ""you're under arrest"" either.   No alcohol was involved. We are both adults.   Am I off the hook? Was I unknowingly charged with anything? He didn't mention anything like an arrest or a citation or anything like that. Did he jus need our IDs to confirm our birthdays or are we going to get citations?  I feel like I'm kinda off the hook but I can never be too sure.   Thanks in advance."	Yes
326	Hi r/legaladvice,  When I was 11 y/o I moved to Aurora, Colorado from my home country in Europe. When I was 12, I found a friend in the neighborhood (let's call him Sean, 15 y/o at this point) through my brother (let's call him Edward, 10 y/o at this point) and started hanging out with him. I was culture-shocked and very shy, so I latched on to Sean as my only friend outside of my 4 brothers. Within the first year of hanging out with him, both Edward and I were bullied by him nearly constantly because of a plethora of things 'wrong' or 'weird' about us, usually to reinforce how he was better than us. This escalated to forcing us to get into fights with him, he'd tell us it was what normal kids did, and we'd go along. Since he was so much older than us, he'd just end up beating us up, then laughing and calling us names. Edward quickly got sick of Sean and after failed attempts to talk with him about his attitude, stopped hanging out with us. I was happy when he stopped, because I hated listening to him cry at night about his weight, Sean's favorite part to pick about him. I knew this was the right thing to do, but I kept hanging out with Sean because I felt like he was sad as an only child, and it was my duty to be his friend.  This is when everything Sean used to do started to escalate. Verbal abuse got worse, play-fighting grew into routine punches in my gut, and more things started to develop. As an example, while playing runescape at his house, I started talking with a friend from my childhood. Sean added him without me knowing, and started talking with him. The next day, he showed me screenshots of what my friend had said about me during their conversation on Skype, about how I was oversensitive, annoying, the such. He refused to show me his side of anything he said, and told me I had no friends other than him and that no one loved me, that I was lucky he put up with me. He also found out through my old 'friend' a long-time crush I had been holding, pulled up a photo of her on Facebook and continuously mocked me for liking a girl, telling me no girl'd ever love me, etc.  Later on came the worst parts of my time with him. He'd make fun of me for not knowing about sex or watching porn at 12-13 y/o, so he occasionally would bring it up on his phone and make me watch it, regardless of how many times I'd say no or try to walk away. Then, he would take off his pants and masturbate in front of me, then ejaculate on his couch in the basement, or on the walls. Several times I would run away from him through his house while he was peeing, until he'd corner me and pee on me while laughing. During sleepovers, I wouldn't be given blankets and would try to fit myself on the carpet where there weren't stains from his many ejaculations. Through continuous grooming, he forced me to pull down my pants, and would mock me. A couple of times, he slapped my genital while laughing about it.  There are so, so many more things that happened. He'd lock me in the bathroom, turn off the lights and hold the door because he knew I was terrified to be in there. He'd quickly cover up any of my brothers coming to hang out with us, even would hang up my skype calls from his basement with them. He'd come to my house and very respectfully chat with my parents and ask if I was able to hang out today, my parents were always very impressed by him. Several times while I was home alone, I would hear the door ring and run to hide under my brother's beds. I would hear him come around the house to try every door and look through the windows, then leave. I was constantly terrified of him.  Around two years after the worse of this started, my family moved to Parker, Colorado (30m drive) because of work. By this time, Sean was around 18 y/o. I burned every bridge of communication I had with him, finally being able to escape him without having to face him. Around a year after moving, he came unannounced to my house and asked my parents for me. My parents yelled at me for hiding in the basement when my 'best friend' was here to see me. He came back a few times after that, but I gave him the least amount of attention I could everytime he'd come, and he ended up leaving me alone. I haven't talked to him since.  I'm now nearly 20, and bought myself 6 therapy sessions a few months ago, which has helped a ton with how to cope with PTSD, and many other mental problems I deal with daily. For the record, I Do have a girlfriend! Of 2 years who pushed and supported me to get therapy, and has helped me so much through this. I have a dream job out of college and am finally tasting life again. My therapist strongly believes Sean might be a psychopath, and through experience thinks Sean may have abused other people before, after, or is abusing someone now. He brought up the idea of legal action to me, and I'm trying to find out more about it. I'd like to do something against Sean, because I want him to be finally be responsible for something, and pay for the wrong he did. I don't want anyone else to be abused by him, and feel like I could be the starting stone to make more people come out about him.  So my questions are these:  - What are my next steps, and what am I expecting (should this be a lawsuit, or trying to get him registered as a sex offender? I'm not sure how this works)? - As a greencard holder in the U.S., what can or can't I do? - Am I at risk to somekind of a turn-around in legal actions by him once this starts?  Thanks for reading this far! I'm very open to answering Any question about him, myself, or anything that happened.  Thank you so much for helping.	Yes
327	A while back I was experimenting with drugs and got into a situation where I got arrested for public intoxication and possession of marijuana. I live in Mississippi and am 18 years old. I have never faced such charges before and am just wondering what the possible outcomes could be? Fines, jail time, or even probation? I'm worried that it will carry jail time and can't find any information on these.	Yes
328	I pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia and reckless driving in 2015 in North Dakota. Misdemeanor A and C respectively.   Today i received  mail from the court judge saying I got deferred imposition of the  sentences and my case has been dismissed, and records sealed.    If an employer asks if I've ever had a conviction should I say no? Do i  need to explain all this in my future interviews?	Yes
329	Hello everyone I am 28 years old and when I was 17/18 I had a troubled youth and was arrested on 4 different occasions resulting in 7 charges.  All convictions were for 5 misdemeanors and 2 violations.       For the violations and 3 of the misdemeanors I was given youthful offender I believe.  For the other misdemeanors I believe my record has been sealed / expunged.       I got my life straightened out and I went back to school eventually and just received my masters degree.  I have been offered a position which will require a background check.  On the application it asks if I have ever been convicted of an offense that HASN'T been expunged/sealed or given youthful offender status.  I answered NO here as I believe my records are sealed and given youthful offender.      Honestly i'm not sure what the background check will show up.  These charges happened so long ago and I believe the records have been sealed as part of my plea agreements, but I cant be certain. I submitted a free background check on myself however I may not receive the results in time.       My question is what should I do in this situation?  Tell the employer about my past criminal history before I accept the official offer?  Or should I just not admit to it and hope my records have been sealed?	Yes
330	"Need advice due to conflicting info from fam/friends, also /r/personalfinance didn't like my post tagged with Employment.    I am of the opinion that since my former incarceration info is sealed that I may now maintain complete assurances that I have never been convicted of a crime or having been arrested. Anyone who Google searches may find old data, which is why some are telling me I should ""own up"" and be truthful if confronted about these in an interview. This is tantamount to waiving my rights which I think is a horrible idea.  Would an employer not be in gross violation of civil rights act and fair credit reporting act if it was even brought up in an interview?? How would I address this topic strongly and respectfully if confronted?  Wouldn't equal protection also mean my expungement would also apply to an employer for any other state in USA?  I am looking at my first few interviews soon since fully cleaning up my record and also earning my bachelors and I don't want to deal with nonsense."	Yes
331	"So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.  However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.  My question is, if Steve does not receive the TV (which is seeming incredibly likely) is there ANYTHING I can do legally? Is theft by deception even a crime in PA? I don't know if Jay and Sean are their real names even, but I have ""Sean""'s phone number and the text message where it was laid out that we were meeting up to exchange the money for the TV. And they can obviously check to see that Steve has not received the TV in the jail. It's just extra complicated bc everything between Jay and Steve and Steve and I was verbal obviously."	Yes
332	When I was 16, I thought I was in an online 'relationship' with a 35 year old. I was in a bad place - I was lonely and sheltered. And he gave me lots of attention. I gave him naked pictures and videos to satisfy him. This went on for 3 years (met him online at 15, broke up at 18).   When we broke up, he texted me to tell me he'd released all my photos/videos. I told him I'm calling the police. He got cold feet and said he was only angry, and had done nothing. He revealed he had kids and would focus on them and leave me alone. Of course, he didn't stick to this - he continued to fuck with me, telling me I'd ruined his life etc. He was prone to obsessive anger. I became afraid, as I was just beginning my life.   I changed my name, my number and deleted all online profiles. I'm in my twenties now. I slowly came out of that shell and made a LinkedIn and Facebook. I forgot about him.  He found me again. I know it's him. He has the same patterns in typing and habit.  I got a text from a stranger (again in the middle of the night, asking me how I was. They gave a bogus name. So I said I was a Tom from another town. He apologised and left me alone.  The next night, he messages asking 'how wasn't your graduation tom?'. Which is too coincidental. I ask who it is - he replies that he knows who I really am, and tells me my actual name. He says I'm doing his head in, and God help me when he sees me. And that we will meet soon.  He doesn't respond to other messages.   Now I'm scared. I want to go to the police, but I'm afraid to set him off. He's been following me for 5 years. And I have little evidence of his grooming as I had to delete it all.  All I have are the threatening messages. And a picture of his face and dick. I don't have the pictures I sent him.  This guy has worked in law and he terrifies me. He has it in for me. I changed my name once, and went into hiding. I don't want to live in fear again. I just made something of myself...I'm just beginning my career. And I have these naked pictures hanging on a thread..  Can you please advise on what I ought to do?  **TLDR: I was groomed online at age 16-18 years old, by a man in his 30s. I do not have evidence of this, due to very intrusive parents and a will to move on. I changed my name and moved to a different city. The man was very obsessive, and has stalked me for 5 years, without my knowing. I know this as a stranger has made contact, displaying very similar patterns to the groomer. He is also very angry, and has threatened to hurt me. I am incredibly scared. I don't know what to do, as he has a huge stash of my naked pictures and videos. I am afraid he may release them if I trigger him. Please help**	Yes
333	"So ever since I got hired at this job there has been an issue with a co-worker and there is a long list let me just start   #1: complains about every thing I do. If it's not my music it's about the way I work and he goes to tell our boss and I get either yelled at or asked to turn of my music  #2: I was playing my music loud enough that I can here it in my area but walks over to my area and complains that my music is too vulgar and it offends him and his religion(Islam) I was listening to wu tang clan and the song had nothing to do with Muslims or middle eastern countries but claims that the words ""mother fucking nigga"" offends him and proceeded to yell it across the shop which in turn offended me because he's not African American I am that pissed me off  #3: I was working on a tire and proceeded to bitch about the way I work and how I'm inconsiderate to my other co workers and that I'm a lazy fat fuck   I just wanna know when it's legal to punch someone in the mouth to make them shut the fuck up and my boss won't help me either btw because the employee make the company more money than I do slightly and has tenure there. Please someone just tell me I can punch him in the mouth because I'm heated and this is the last fucking straw"	Yes
334	"So there is a guy who for this story i will call ""Tyrone"" who grabed my girlfriend (19F) as she was at the drinkstation at Mcdonalds. She and i used to work there and Tyrone was an aquantence, but without warning today he grabed her, im wondering what we should do. I am going to try my best to get her to file a police report but aside from that what should we do? I belive that it was caught on tape because there is a camera over that area. The people who own this Mcdonalds have covered for an employee in the past who was accused of sexual harassment, so we are not expecting much sympathy from them. I am willing to hire a lawyer for an hour or two to send a threatening letter to the owners, ideally i would like for this guy (he might be a minor, like 16,17,18) to face criminal charges and to lose his job. If you have any questions please let me know, sorry if this is not well put together i am just upset right now."	Yes
335	I'm a 21 y/o male from SD just for reference. So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through. Anything at all will help thanks.  (Also sorry for formatting and grammar issues I'm on mobile)	Yes
336	My gf works in hospitality, she closed out her drawer and made her drop into the safe at work which then got stuck and did not make it into the safe. After she had left her coworker came and stole the envelope out of the safe. They have cameras and caught him on camera doing this. He is denying it and will be taking a lie detector test. The owner of the business told her that if he doesn't fess up she will be responsible for paying him back. Im trying to figure out what we need to do. Apparently this is a problem with the safe and she has always made sure to check to make sure her drops made it into the safe, apparently this time is got stuck on the side and she did not notice it when checking and thought it made into the safe. I'm just worried that if he does not fess up etc that they will try to hold her paycheck, it was around one thousand dollars stolen and she does not have the money to pay them back.	Yes
337	My sister's husband is a sketchy man. He is wildly wealthy and his publicly stated occupation makes no sense. In interpersonal interactions he is a pathological liar. I know through the family grape vine that he and his brothers were under investigation by the FBI as of 2016 for something to do with receiving moneygrams from a certain tropical country (I am totally naive as to what they were doing, money laundering??).  Anyway, none of it has ever affected me until yesterday. My brother-in-law, whom I have no contact with beyond family functions, sent me a text message telling me to go to walmart and pick up a moneygram that he set up in my name (without my permission or awareness) at Walmart from said tropical country. I of course refused, also in text message, and backed-up the conversation to my computer.  I talked to a trusted older friend who suggested I contact the FBI about what happened. I did and, over the phone, relayed my understanding of the situation, the text messages received and the one I sent, and my brother-in-law's name and phone number as well as my name and address (when asked for it).  I have no idea what will happen next or to what degree the information I provided is of interest to the FBI. My question is, even though I am in no way associated with this man or his business and myself have nothing more serious than a single parking ticket on my record, in any potential legal jeopardy and should I talk to some kind of legal counsel about the possibilities?  Thank you very much for your time, this has been a nightmare turn of events for me and the family.	Yes

From what I can tell there was a 60 month sentence and a 60 day sentence laid down to be served concurrently on 6/12. However the defendant was released from custody on the 14th and remains out. Then it seems on the 21st the case continues in some way. The probation seems to have been terminated unsuccessfully instead of revoked which I understand to be two different things, correct? Then where does the 60 months come from? Also what is ""pay or appear"" exactly?   Any help is greatly appreciated on the admittedly limited information I've provided."	Yes
339	I was just released from conuty jail in Monroe, MI for these charves. They took my blood test, which I agreed to, before I came in. I'm very scared and not sure what to so next. This is my first offense and I have no other criminal record. What can I expect to come of this on my court date? Am I going to jail?	Yes
340	I stole 2 packs of 9volt batteries, got caught, now i'm doing the Crime Accountability Program. This will cost me a total of $425.00USD but i avoid police and nothing will show up on my record.   My question is, since I was told i won't go to jail for this even if cops are called, if it would be cheaper to go to court and plead guilty? The fine is only $75.00, but the fee from C.A.P is $350.00. What should I do? I feel like a complete dumbass over this. No idea what I was even thinking.	Yes
341	"I got my 2 years green card through marriage to Citizen, and it is expiring on August. I need to apply for the 10 years green card soon.  I will participate a diversion program, and my immigration lawyer is modifying the contract for immigration reason.  The lawyer said : “It means that you are not saying the facts are right UNLESS you break the agreement. Its lawyer terms, but in immigration it makes a HUGE difference” I attach the original and the modified diversion, and want to see if anyone can check it for me and I have a few questions regarding the diversion contract Original: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m9cgzuw4t3pkp73/AACQ5aRktPbq5Ayn9DyIop-Xa?dl=0   Modified part: STIPULATION OF FACTS STIPULATION UPON VIOLATION OF FACTS: Defendant stipulates that he/she is the individual named in the complaint, and that the offense(s) charged occurred within the city limits of Lenexa, Kansas.

342	I have a petty misdemeanor for shoplifting in New Mexico from 4 years ago. I left the state without dealing with it and now I'm living in Colorado. I finally have my shit together and I want to resolve this but have no idea what I'm doing. I looked into it and obviously I have a warrant for not appearing in court. I talked to a criminal lawyer in Albuquerque and he would charge 1000 to represent me and would first file a motion to quash the warrant.   So I'm wondering if this would be my best option or is there some way I can deal with this myself without having to get an attorney? Maybe a public defender? I'd like to not have this on my record but I'm mainly worried about this warrant. I'm currently trying to find an apartment in Colorado and I feel like this is definitely going to cause problems when I start applying. As it is I don't have very much money so paying an attorney 1000 on top of whatever other costs I'll have is going to be hard. Should I call the Albuquerque court house and try to deal with this myself or will that just make things worse? Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.	Yes
343	Throwaway, first time posting here. I'm really paranoid right now because my sister (13) first of all, got caught shoplifting a couple months ago along with my other sibling. They have to do community service and stuff, and go to these appointments with their case worker. At their last appointment my sis made a suicidal joke and admitted to self harming. She was admitted to the hospital, the psychiatric ward I think, again. She had already been to a psychiatric ward about a year ago after she admitted to having suicidal thoughts at a doctor's check up. My mom grabbed some clothes from home to bring her, and in the pocket of one of my sister's jackets there was weed. She hasn't smoked for a couple months now as far as I know, but I guess she still had it laying around. The staff said they will ask my sister about it tomorrow.    I'm just really worried that since this will be her second offence, and idk how much weed there was, she might go to juvy or something. I have no idea what usually happens in this case, is there a possibility she (my mom I guess) will just be fined and my sis gets slapped with more community service? We really can't afford a fine anyway but it'd be better than juvy. I hope just having at least an idea of what might happen will ease my mind. Thanks in advance.	Yes
344	"My ex-husband was ordered 3 years ago during our divorce to pay child support. Before I get a bunch of hate PMs -- I work, I didn't ask to keep the kid more. He didn't want more time. I don't enjoy never having any time to myself and always having to do everything on my own. It sucks, ok. I would gladly pay him the $350 he is required to pay me a month to get any sort of break on healthcare, child care, or even not having to use every single vacation day of work for a sick day or because school is out. Do you know how great it would be to just have to pay $350 a month for all child related expenses. It would all be worth $350 because that is nothing compared to the cost of a kid. I spent $100 on shoes the other day. Shoes. He needed shoes for school and water shoes for water activities and nice required shoes    for graduation. I swear to god I just bought him shoes 3 months ago that don't fit now. So before you come at me with the collecting child support shame just think for a second about how much it costs you to live and double that. Double all your costs. It isn't easy on one income. It isn't easy on two incomes.   My problem is my super pissed ex-husband who sees him kids the last weekend of every month likes to make it uncomfortable or hard to get my child support. In the last year, he has stuck the check in an actually bucket of slop, he has stuck it in a zip lock baggie of dog shit, he has taped it to my roof, he has tried to get me to play an elaborate scavenger hunt, he has driven to my son's elementary school on a day that isn't his custody day and stuck in my son's backpack and not told anyone and when I asked him where it was he has said "" guess where?"" which lead to an elaborate search of the house and two days of a guessing game (it was well hidden in a tiny pocket in the backpack and my son had no idea his dad even put anything in there, he has buried it in my back yard with my son's help, he has hand delivered to my HR department at work with ""for the bitch"" on the envelope, paid me cash in all $1, he has threatened to pay me in change (which he has not done yet), and he has written me 350 different checks for $1 each.   It is always something and it is getting old. I have not accept checks before (the ones covered in things) and he has eventually written me new ones after giving him a hard time.   I am exhausted. This is annoying. He doesn't work a consistent job so often times a garnishment would be hard. He always pays on time without hesitation but this is insane.   How much of this do I have to put up with? Is this just something I have to deal with for the next 11 years?"	No
345	Hi there, this is really sad and scary, but I think we've reached a point where we would no longer be helping our kids or ourselves to continue living together, and our goal will need to be divorce for everyone's happiness. That said, before I talk to my wife about this and we formalize a plan, I am looking for some advice about things I need to pay attention to to ensure equitable treatment around custody and financial wellbeing should things ever get to a contested divorce or otherwise acrimonious.  Children: My wife and I have child together (2) and a stepchild (7) (she is bio mom). We are on good terms with the father and he sees his child on weekend days.   Finances: We have separate accounts. My wife holds over $30K in debt on various cards and student loans. I have a few thousand debt on a line of credit. My name is on all the house papers and mortgage etc., hers was left off at time of purchase because we couldn't qualify for the mortgage with her debt. I can't see either one of us being able to hold onto the house if we divorce, we will need to sell it.  My fears are specific--that my wife will go on an out of control spending/gambling spree (she has a historic gambling problem) during a year of separation. She gets bitter and grudgey and this clouds her thinking when she is angry. Or, that my wife will play some unbeknownst to me card that allows her full custody of our child.   Any advice about steps to take before, during, or after discussions of separation would be appreciated.	No
346	Super simple verbal agreement: $290 every 2 weeks. If he wanted to move out, no problem as long as you paid for your last days and gave a weeks notice. He goes to vacation in Europe for two weeks and decides the first day that he's going to quit his job to become a pro chef at a Michelin star restaurant in Europe and he's not coming back. Only he said he was going to wire me money before he decided to leave the counrty and it's 3 weeks late now and his crap is still in my house. What can I do with it? Just put it out on the front yard or something? I don't want to go to jail for stealing his crap and I really don't want his stuff. I'm not a scumbag like him. So how far can I take this legally without going to jail? I don't want to harbour his crap and I'm not going out of my way to contact his parents. There's a really nice stolen skateboard here that he claims he stole from a small shop in Miami when he was on acid, only it happened almost a year ago. Do the cops still care almost a year later? I figure the least I could do is put all his crap out on the front porch in dirty old boxes and make him think I let it get rained on in the Florida summer rain the 3 weeks he was in Europe. This guy deserves a lot worse than to lose his stuff. He drives around with a huge dent in his stupid honda fit because he was speeding too close to a man's small children while he was driving close enough for the dad to kick a dent in his car. He brings gross girls into my house that message me asking if I want to buy pills and shed fake eyelashes all over the house. He brags to me about packing tackle boxes of $10 dollar lures at Walmart and stealing them. He makes fun of me for shopping at the publix grocery store down the street instead of driving 25 minutes across town to shop at whole foods when the dude is a closet McDonald's eater. What I'm saying is, I want to end this friendship with a bang. What can I do with this scumbags stuff? (Without getting arrested)	No
347	An apartment complex in Atlanta, GA emailed me offering me a room, I replied yes within an hour and a half, they acknowledged my response and confirmed. Now they're claiming they have no record of this and that their is no room for me. Do I have a legal case here? I rejected other sublease offers because of this, and have nowhere to go now with college starting in less than a month.	No
348	"I have my court date set for this Monday against my ex (the defendant/respondent) to set ""parental responsibilities"" (I.e. Custody) over our two year old daughter. I'm asking the court for full decision making powers, as well as for her to live with me, and have her mother see her every other weekend, as well as a weekly, non-overnight visit.  She currently resides with her mother. I work full time, she works part time. It has been my family that has taken care of my daughter when we are both at work, where she also spends time with her cousins that are around her age. There has been some neglect on the mother's side for her care, such as not packing supplies in the diaper bag, not bathing her for days or even up to a week, not changing her diaper and bringing her with a bad diaper rash.. etc.   I'm looking for advice as to how I should prepare myself for this hearing. I've never dealt with anything like this, so I'm a bit unfamiliar with the process. I've talked to an attorney and they believe I have a strong case, but I'm just looking for further advice as to how I should structure my arguments and what I should focus on during my testimony, as well as resources that will aid me such as evidence, affidavits, witnesses, and such.   Thank you for your help."	No
349	In December I bought a new house in a new neighborhood.  I received a copy of the CC&amp;Rs that made no mention of restrictions to street parking (in front of your house).  Yesterday, everyone received an email with an updated CC&amp;R document that among other things added the following restrictions...  &gt; Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall park and store Vehicles owned or in use  by such Lot Owner, tenant or occupant, either in the driveway or garage  appurtenant to the Lot owned and/or occupied by them.   &gt;Guests, invitees and licensees of any Int Owner, tenant or occupant shall likewise  park Vehicles in the driveway or garage appurtenant to such Lot Owner, tenant or  occupant's Lot.   &gt;Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall submit written request to  the ACC for permissible street parking to accommodate guests no less than  seventy-two (72) hours prior to any planned event, and as soon as reasonably  possible for unplanned events such as funeral visitation for example.   &gt;Any vehicle observed in violation of any part of these Rules and Regulations  whether continuously or within twenty-four (24) hours of the first observed  violation, shall be considered a continuation of the previous violation and thus, be  subject to the Enforcement provisions herein.  I wasn't aware that changes to the CC&amp;Rs could be made without a vote, but apparently the neighborhood hasn't been turned over to the HOA, and the developer can change them on whim until such time.  My three questions are, can the developer really change the CC&amp;Rs at will until the development is turned over to the HOA?  Can the HOA enforce parking rules on city owned streets?  What recourse do I have as a homeowner if I receive a fine from the HOA?  Thanks in advance for any feedback or advice.	No
350	"Tl;DR: My girlfriend's neighbor (and his partner) have been the source of many complaints in my building. He threatened her at 2AM in the morning, and my girlfriend does not feel safe. While she was hoping the management company would let her break her lease and help her with moving expenses, the company is in fact making her pay 2 months of rent as a condition to breaking the lease. Anything she can do?  -------  At roughly 1:50am in the morning, a tenant from my girlfriend's building, where I was spending the night, began pounding on our front door, shouting profanity-laced threats. He had come to the door, at this unseemly hour, to loudly and baselessly assert that the litter from our cat had caused his partner, with whom he shares an apartment, to contract toxoplasmosis.  Some examples from his nearly 15-minute tirade: ""Open this door, go ahead call the police, I don't care, I'll bang on this door until 8 in the morning;""  ""you little piece of shit, you pretend to be such a good person but I know who you really are;"" ""you bitch;"" ""you and your boyfriend broke into my apartment, I have you on camera;"" ""you are conspiring with the landlord to kill us."" In addition, he claimed to have run a background check on her and proceeded to state her name in full, including middle name, in an effort to sound menacing.   We remained silent during the course of this incident, and did not open or even approach the door. After about an hour, we called 911 with the intention of filing an official police report. In the interim, we texted the building's super who was the one who initially suggested we call the police. After another 30-45 minutes had passed, we received a return call from the police. They apologized for the delay and said that due to a robbery nearby they were unable to come to building at that time. No report was made as a result, since, we were told, reports cannot be made over the phone. However, we plan on filing one as early as tomorrow.   My girlfriend is terrified and simply no longer feels safe at her apartment. She feels as though she cannot safely and comfortably return, so she must abruptly find another place to live. Unfortunately, the management company has not only refused to cover the cost of her moving expenses and possible brokerage fees, but said she must stay until Sept. 1 or else be charged 2 months rent, due to a 60-day notice clause in her lease.   These tenants have continually caused problems in the building. A few months ago a crowd of by-standers gathered in front of the building because the tenants were quarreling so viciously that they thought someone was getting murdered. One observer even had a nightstick on him in the event that he had to personally intervene. Additionally, the tenant in question had once before confronted my girlfriend to ask whether she had broken into his apartment. Though he was calmer and more accommodating then, the same delusional, conspiratorial ranting was present.   My girlfriend is incredibly distraught over this. She has done nothing wrong. She has been a model tenant, paying her rent on time, respecting her neighbors and otherwise doing nothing to disturb the peace. She is a young woman living alone and should not be made to feel unsafe or threatened in her own apartment, nor be forced to shell out thousands of dollars to find another apartment due to the failure on the building owners' part to effectively handle their problematic tenants."

351	We have owned this 2br house in Independence, MO (KC) for 10 yrs and bought it for $57k. Both our names are on the mortgage. it appraises for about that right now and we owe $20k on it. She is BK in the state of Nevada and is now telling me that I need to talk to her Trustee who won't answer my calls. The ex told me this morning that I have til friday to figure something out.   Can I just sell it? or is that fraud? Can they foreclose or sell it out from under me? It's my understanding the trustee basically handles all her BK payments or whatever. I'm lost here. I just want to make the best decision I can.   Thanks in advance for your help.	No
352	This is in Florida.  I just moved into an apartment. It is the same apartment complex I was already living in, but another building. My old apartment had no issues with bugs. The current apartment has a cockroach problem. I've seen 5 already on my first day and 3 on my second day. I noticed there is a giant tree right near the property and cockroaches on the stairs. I asked to install a weather strip under the door because there wasn't one. I thought that would take care of the problem but it hasn't. A neighbor told me the person below me is a hoarder and that may be an issue, but the management told me they can't come in from another apartment.   Anyway, my point is, what are my legal rights here and how much time do I have to exercise them and how do I exercise them? I am going to write them an email stating the problem and requesting pest control come to spray and management come to inspect, seal off wherever they're coming from. If that fails, am I within my legal rights to end the lease?   Thanks!	No
353	How long does a restraining order take to get filed? I am accused of cyberstalking and harassing via text message. Theoretically, if my ex girlfriend were to have decided to get a restraining order against me, how long would it take to file? Would the police knock on my door the next day? Would it take weeks? I'm in no accusation of domestic violence or stalking her physically. It's only following her on social media and texting her. How long?	No

355	I recently got my first speeding ticket and called the courthouse from the county I got pulled over in to ask some questions about how and when to pay for it, and the guy on the phone said the biggest mistake people make is not attempting to reduce their speeding ticket fines. Especially if it's their first offense. He was super nice and gave me some advice about writing a letter to the judge. So I was like yeah sure I'll give it a shot.  Some websites say don't admit fault, and some websites say to apologize in the letter. Apologizing is admitting fault.. so what do I do?	No
356	My dogs got into my neighbors yard and now she is claiming they did $300 of damages. I fixed the fence already and she's still asking for more money. Can I just ignore her or can I get in trouble with law?	No
357	Knowing my family, they wouldn't respect my last wishes. So I'm wondering if, legally, there's a way to make sure I don't have a funeral when I die? Maybe leaving a will? If so, how would I go about doing that and what would be the cheapest option?  Even $100 would be difficult for me to come up with.	No
358	My parked motorcycle was totaled  by a woman last year on July 17th, and the insurance company didn't cut me a check until September 6th. I agreed by phone to the number quoted by the agent and he said he would also be paying the estimate and storage fees at the garage so I could pick the bike up. The check was smaller than the number he originally quoted me (he didn't say on the phone that various deductions would be made), I later saw he greatly undervalued the bike (didn't account for almost $5K in after market parts), and he only paid the $200 estimate but not the $1000 storage fee. I'm still in dispute with the woman's insurance company over the remaining balance.   My question is- seeing as (I've been told) it's the law here that I'm owed loss of use on my vehicle from when it is disabled until I receive a check, but the check didn't reflect the correct value the bike OR to have it released from the garage, am I still only entitled to the cost of a comparable rental between those two dates?	No
359	"Hi Reddit! Thanks in advance for the help.  I am attempting to move out of an apartment that I currently live in in San Mateo, California. I alerted the landlord that I will be leaving yesterday, and he responded that I should have given 30 days notice as per the contract.   The 30 days notice before leaving (with a yearlong lease with a set end date) clause was not in the original contract. However, the landlord sent a notice 31 days ago which reads,   *""Dear Valued residents, Thank you for your concerned residency. Your rental agreement is about to expire and we would like to extend the offer for you to sign a new lease. Because of management changes, it is necessary for you to sign a new contract with us, even if you will be remaining on a month to month agreement. Below you will find your best available option to renew, as well as the rate for choosing a month to month agreement. New rental rates begin August 1, 2017.   Option I: 12 MO $2400   OPTION II : Month to month $2880   *If you do not respond to this notice by July 30, 2017, your rent will change per the month to month amount listed above. It is necessary for you to sign a new contract even if you are deciding to go month to month. If you are intending to move, please remember a written 30 day notice to vacate is required. So don't wait and renew today. Turn in the bottom portion of this letter to the Leasing Office and we will email your new lease paperwork to you. "" *   So I will alert them today that I will NOT be moving to a month to month lease. However, i am forced to break the 30-day notice rule. The only penalty stated on the original contract is that if I break the contract, they may choose to evict me within three days (which is fine, since the lease is up on the 31st.)  Is there anything I should know or do?  Thanks so much for reading."	No
360	So I live in Chicago and am currently renting from a condo owner out who lives in Florida. The building I live in is managed by a property management company, but we don't pay through them at all and they refuse to answer all phone calls about even the simplest requests. They have a policy that a dog can't be over 25 lbs.  My GF just rescued a great dane/retriever mix who is 3 years and very mild mannered (75lbs). Our maintenance guy said there is no way we can keep her and have to get rid of her asap. Is there any way around us having to get rid of her?   TLDR GF adopted a dog that is much larger than the policy of prop. mgmt company allows, however we don't have any affiliation with prop. mgmt company, IE not renting through them.	No
361	"However yesterday they called me and asked me for my account and transit number because ""They are not in the check that you gave us""   Now I assure you I gave a legit check in fact it was from the same stack that I gave to them the last new car I bought.  I think they lost my void check. What do I do in my situation? Is it safe to have a lost check out there? Does the dealership have any standing to make me replace void check?   What if I catch them in a lie and they verbally admit they lost my check and lied about the no account number stuff. (Canada is 1 party consent I double checked)   Should I just send in another check?"	No
362	We live in a more remote region of Canada that has a full sized hospital. Our family doctor routinely cancels appointments on us and wait times to see them are upwards of 6-8 weeks. My wife was victim of a massive infection after the birth of our child that was apparently very easily treated had she been seen 3 months after the birth as intended. Her doctor cancelled and rescheduled every 3 months for a full year, causing the infection to grow to the point where she was bleeding for a month straight.  Our doctors have cancelled and rescheduled almost every single appointment we've made for the last 2 years often resulting in wait times of 2-18 months to be seen for potentially time sensitive issues.  I was told to wait 2 months to see my family doctor for surgery follow up while I was actively bleeding from my jewels. Do we have any kind of legal recourse here? We're tired of getting constantly dicked around by the terrible healthcare services here.  Do we have any recourse? Is there anything we can do short of contacting elected representatives who are actively slashing healthcare budgets in our province and likely not to care about this anyways?	No
363	"So I received a parking citation at 12:30 AM for parking in a residential neighborhood without a permit. I'm guessing there were no pictures taken as it was pitch black out. The person who issued the ticket put the wrong license plate, and wrote that the VIN is ""not readable"". I checked the status of my ticket online and put in my actual license plate and nothing showed up, however I can access it with the citation number. Should I wait this out and hope for no further consequences or should I just pay it?"	No
364	"Per our lease, rent is due on the first and late after the fifth. We pay rent with SSDI on the third of each month, without exception. We've never paid late. On the second of each month, everyone gets a ""Notice to Quit"" on their door, not just us. Landlord says it's normal business procedure and refuses to stop, but I've rented for decades and have never encountered this before. It's insulting and intimidating, and it feels like harassment. Is it legal?"	No
365	"I live in southern Ontario, Canada.  I have a very good landlord, I have been with him since 2013, and he offered me a great apartment at a great price, and he has been great since the day I called him. (I was being abused at my former apartment, and he waived my first months rent, at the first place I moved into, he offered it immediately, when I said I was staying at a shelter due to a bad relationship, had the government cover last months, even after they rejected my application, and he has always helped me. They are amazing)  He offered me a nice apartment in August, 2014, at a discount, because he hadn't finished a building promised for September. I had a friend move in, he allowed it, and said I was her ""landlord"", and he explained that she was to pay me, and follow his lease.   Everything was fine. Then she started shorting me rent. $100 a month. She stole my AC remote (worth $100) because she said the place was ""too hot"". (She keeps it at 70 F, its too fucking cold, I pay hydro. So, I called my landlord, he told me to throw the breaker, as I was home all day, and freezing. So she came home, and I got the remote back, locked it in my room, and she bitched the place was ""on fire"") That's one example.   I'm a welder. 70 F is still too damn cold. My apartment, she pays  no utilities. She is to pay half rent, $350. She hasn't paid me a cent over $300, but that was after I loaned her $400, she paid me back $50 for 8 months. She has not paid me rent on at least 6 occasions. I was in school. That's a shitload of money for me.  So, the tipping point. She brought home a feral cat from her farm. She was pregnant, the cat. No non-fixed cats in the apartment, PERIOD, on the lease. She did not tell me about the cat until she let it loose. My cat, who has been there for  3 years, kept getting attacked, lost weight, and got fleas. Bad.  The cat had 5 kittens. They all died. She blamed me. They had fleas, terribly. I told her to get the cat OUT, after my cat was attacked. I flea treated my cat, but she was infested, miserable, and hiding, the poor thing. She refused to buy cat food, since ""you never buy food, or litter"". (I buy food and litter every. fucking. time.) and I was waiting on a refund, and was in overdraft.   I said ""Can you pick up a $6 bag of cat food?"" ""No"" ""I'm waiting for a REFUND"" ""No, you're irresponsible. I ALWAYS buy food."" She had brought half a bag for her cat. And wouldn't give mine any. So I borrowed money from a loan place, to feed my cat. And get litter. She stole the food, fed her cat, used my litter.. I closed and locked my door, she flipped out because I took the AC remote and it was ""too hot at 75 degrees"". So she cleaned her hair mess in the bathroom with my towels. And then swept her mess into my room, again.  I hate confrontation. Then her cat had kittens. They were cute, fun. Then they started dying. They were infested with fleas. She told me I killed them, because I closed my door (to keep my cat safe from hers, her cat left the kittens to fight with mine) and her cat moved the kittens onto her bed, and she rolled over and killed one.  That's my fault. I locked the cat out of my room, so the cat had nowhere ""safe to move the kittens"" so, she moved them onto her bed, and then she rolled onto it, therefore, I was at fault, because the cat couldn't ""protect them in my room.""  The fight started. I told her to get the fuck out. Get the cat out. She said she had to get 60 days notice. I said, no, you owe me around $4000 in rent, get out. I was so sickened by the poor, 2 week old, dead kittens, I was about ready to lose it. So I went to my landlords office.  I came back, and saw her driving her friends truck (she hasn't got a vehicle of her own) and there were 5 dead kittens scattered around the apartment. I cried, and threw up, and took them to the vet next door. I searched for my cat, afraid she took her for revenge.  My landlord told her to kick her out, she had no rights, if I told her to leave in 10 minutes, if she wasn't out, to call the police. He showed me my rights, she signed nothing, she had none. I've looked online, this is true.  So I have been sick for a week from the kittens. The vet was so angry. She let me cry and told me the fleas killed the kittens. The mother cat is at the roommates farm. She threw out a blanket my grandma made me (she passed in 2009) and I saw it.. she ruined 2 sets of new towels, cleaning her hair out of the shower. She sweeps her mess into my room.   She has ruined my pots and pans, not cleaning them. She said there was a note saying the apartment smelled, that someone was contacting my landlord. She refused to give it to me. I'm the only one on the lease, so she stole my private mail. I sign her rent cheques for Ontario Works, but she changes the amount.  So. She brought in a flea ridden cat, my cat almost died. It cost $200 to get her flea clean. I spent 6 hours cleaning the apartment for the fumigators to come in tomorrow to get rid of everything. She refused to come clean her room, so I threw everything useless out, found some of my stuff (camera, phone) and took pics.   I told her to clean her shit tonight, she told me she had more important stuff to do, and to fuck off.   So I'm writing down all the legal stuff, because she thinks I OWE her money (she says she overpays.. Half of the lease + hydro + cable is NOT $250/mo.. plus she flips on me if I have no money.. Oh, sorry!! I'm a student, on ODSP, and my tenant isn't PAYING ME)  So, legally.. can I evict her? My landlord says yes. Call 911. This is abuse. Literally. She's fucking psycho, and has no responsibility. She refuses to take fault. Everything is someone elses fault. She has no job, she lost her horse farm, because ""the owners a bitch and won't repair shit"" Uh. You won't pay her, therefore, why should she?  She was evicted, and then attempted suicide. Well, texted me until I woke up, found her note. So I called OPP, she had called her friends. I went to my parents (where I am now, until I can take my cat back home) for Mother's Day. She lost it on me. Sorry, I don't do attention seeking suicide ""attempts"". I'm not picking you up at the hospital, you do the suicide thing every time you don't get your way. You're 53. I did that once, when I was 17. (I'm schizophrenic, in remission) I learned its fucking stupid to pull that shit. Manipulative, self centered.  She told me how I'd fail at life.. but now I'm a certified welder. I made $20/hr a week out of school. So she'd fuck up my room.  So. She owes me several grand, she nearly killed my cat. She killed 5 kittens, and left them all over the apartment, and blamed me. She thinks she's a saviour, a gift to people. She thinks everyone is out to fuck her over, that she can do no wrong.  Sorry. This is long.  How do I bill her for what she's destroyed in my apartment? The bills she owes, the rent she owes, and make sure I get it? Do I file for small claims court?  Help! I suck at law. Someone, get this psycho out of my life. This is insane, and I've been through ECT, and I'm fucking schizophrenic. This tops that. I'm in remission. My landlord is on my side, but I hate bugging him, he just had a kid, and he's SO busy."	No
366	I recently was signed power of attorney to sell a house that my grandmother left to her remaining children in her will. The arrangement was for the house to be sold immediately and the money divided between the three remaining sisters. After what has been almost a year, my aunt who was left with power of attorney has done nothing to settle the issue by carrying out my grandmothers will. After pleading with my aunt she agreed to sign over power of attorney so i can sell the house. Of the three remaining children who are entitled to a piece of what the house sells for one does not want the house to be sold. This being the case she has gone to the property broken the locks on the house and her daughter moved in to claim the house for her own. A week before power of attorney was signed over to me i went to the house with a officer and requested that she leave. The officers told me there was nothing that i could do unless i had power over the decisions to be made in selling the house. I was told to leave and escorted off premises. Now that i have power of attorney and spoken to a lawyer. I have been told that i would need to give two weeks notice of eviction and bring along the proper paper work. I have the deed, will, and Power of attorney over all decisions made from this point forward. I dont know what my next steps should be? I Live in San Antonio Texas and am 21 years old and not well versed on these issues. My main concern is that they destroy the house in the time they have to evict. The main reasoned iam worried about it is because they are known to pour quick cement down the drains and ruin the utilities before they move out. I need to write a eviction notice but dont know were to start. If anyone could give me some advice i would greatly appreciate it.	No
367	Posted in r/personalfinance originally   Not sure if best place to post, but have found help on this sub-Reddit before   My grandfather passed away this weekend and I have been off work since. My partner went to work on Monday but came home early and has since taken Tuesday and Wednesday off as well. Partially as she is upset and partially to support me.  Now, the thing is she has been temping at a company the past few weeks (in the uk) and she has been called this morning to be told she is no longer wanted as she is 'unreliable'   To me this seems wholly unfair, as she is taking compassionate leave, and if she had been asked to go in, she would have.  My question is, is this right? Is there anything that can be done here?	No
368	I went no contact with my mother about 6 months ago after years of dealing with her violent alcoholism, her undermining my choices as a parent, her blatant favoritism and targeting of my children, and the straw that broke the camel's back, her running a background check on my SO in an attempt to persuade me to break up with him. I just received a certified letter from her asking me to contact her to set up visitation for her and my children. It didn't explicitly say anything about her taking further steps, but it seems like that's the direction she's trying to move. If she does take me to court for visitation what sort of information would be pertinent to document? Are her chances of winning high? (We live in Nevada) I can get several character witnesses on my side if I need to. I'm just not sure if I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thanks in advance for any advice. ETA- should I respond to her letter and reiterate my stance on her visiting the children?	No
369	Like the title says, landlord sold the place (duplex) and while she says that we won't have to sign a new contract because ours is still valid she keeps insisting to not sign another one if the new landlord steps forward with one. Is the contract I signed with the previous landlord still valid through my term of lease (through end of 2018) or does the new landlord have the right to say our contract is invalid and force us to sign a new one? This is in Missouri if that makes a difference. Thanks!	No
370	"I'm in Virginia.  My ex and I purchased a car together in 2008. We broke up in 2011. No divorce, because we weren't legally married, but we agreed that my ex would keep the car and pay for it. Both of our names were on the loan, which put both of our names on the title.   Due to the following circumstances, my name remains on the title. I want to get it off the title and my ex - who wants no contact with me - told me that I have to take care of it. This is an issue because my ex doesn't pay his car tax (he owes three years' worth), and the state of VA could come after me for it since I'm listed on the title. And the kicker: The tax bills come to me since my name is the first one on the title. I text photos of the bills to my ex and he acknowledges them. (I have all the texts in my phone.) He told me that his therapist told him not to talk to me, so that means I have to handle this. (Yes, I'm angry.)  The circumstances:  1. My ex paid off the loan in 2014, but the credit union is still holding the car title because he owes them money for a defaulted credit card.  2. I declared bankruptcy in 2012, the year after we split, which discharged my responsibility for the loan. My ex told me that I could no longer talk to the bank about the loan since my bankruptcy placed it into collections and he was the owner of the loan.  3. In 2014, my bankruptcy lawyer arranged for the bank to allow me and my ex to sign the title and pay them $12.50 to get my name removed. My ex said he would do it but ultimately didn't.  4. In the meantime, my ex has not contacted the bank about the debt or the car title.  How can I get the title from the bank? My understanding is that I have ownership but not possession of the vehicle. Do I have standing to contact the bank? Should I try to work through a lawyer? The last time I contacted a lawyer, he was baffled by my case and recommended that I gather DMV paperwork to show my ownership to have him write a ""strongly worded"" letter to the bank. Is this the best option?"	No
371	Hi there! I'm seeking advice. My husband, sister, and I are applying together to rent a condo. All three of us have great credit history, and our combined income is well over 3x the rent. My husband and I have good rental history. However, my sister is currently in her first living arrangement not with my parents. She's living with my friend-- whose original roommate picked up and moved to Germany a few months into their lease-- as a subtenant. However, I just found out that my sister and friend never made her subtenancy official. Their lease explicitly forbids subletters without written permission from the landlord.  Wtf am I supposed to put on our current condo application? What kind of legal trouble could she and my friend get in? How do I represent my sister's situation on our condo application without falsifying information? Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. :)	No
372	I drove less than a mile to the store, I drove past a downed stop sign (it was literally on the ground because somebody else hit it) and was struck by another car. Nobody was hurt, we were going fairly slow. Damage to my car was worse, he had a scuffed/slightly dented fender. My window was shattered and the door was pushed in.   I freaked out because I know I'm not supposed to be on the road and I saw the sign I drove passed. I said sorry, claimed responsibility and we took pictures.  He seemed nice and agreed not to involve the police, assuming that I'd get into trouble. Said he had no interest in taking advantage of me, however it was a company car and somebody has to pay.   I'm confused, my parents are in the hospital because my mom got injured from something unrelated. I have no idea what to do.   I don't have money, I am disabled and subsist off of SSI. What the hell do I do? My friend guessed it would cost around 1100-1500 for repairs. I have a trashbag on my window.   Why don't I have insurance/license? Long story nobody cares. Why did I risk driving without them? Well, I'm a fucking idiot apparently.   What do I do?	No
373	Located in San Francisco, CA  I am one of three tenants on a lease that ran for 12 months and then converted to month-to-month back in July.  One roommate has moved out and gave the landlord and us 30 days written notice.  We've been advertising the room everywhere but haven't found a replacement yet. I'm panicking about paying rent on February 1st. My remaining roommate says departing roommate is liable until someone else moves in. Departing roommate says he gave 30 days notice and that's all that was necessary.  All three of our names are on the lease agreement. Can one roommate give 30 days notice and release himself from his portion of the liability, even though all three names are on the lease? I've reached out to the landlord but would like to hear from this group as well.	No
374	"The matter is important, and only came to my attention a couple of hours ago. I made a promise not to tell anyone, but I do not feel it is a promise I can keep. I require advice of a legal nature, and I hope Reddit can help.  The individuals in this story will be thus: L, nine year-old boy. R, five year-old girl. They share a mother with different fathers. E, the mother. H, the mother's current boyfriend and father of R. C, who is E's ex-husband and L's father.  It was explained to me during dinner earlier that L and R were caught engaging in sexual activity together at the home belonging to parents of C. This activity included things, as explained to me, such as ""Kiss me down there with your tongue"" and ""Do what you want with me, baby"". Stories appear to differ as to whether they were unclothed, clothed, or partially clothed. After some questioning, it was revealed that they had been doing this for some time. Kissing each other regularly, with L sometimes sticking R's hand down his pants. He has apparently also tried once to put his mother's, E, hand down his pants as well. E says it is possible, though it is not sure, that he touched her in the middle of the night when she was laying in R's bed and when discovering it was E instead of R, inquired where R was. L was made to call E by his father and apologize for what he had done, while R sat in the back of the car with her head down and ears covered by her hands. Stories appear to differ between who was initiating with whom, with some indicating L and some indicating R.  This is not the first time this has happened. Some time ago, perhaps a year or two, L and R were caught playing ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" at the home of C's parents. As the story was told to me, they were naked and R was ""bouncing"" on L while he was laying on the bed. She made references to ""taking care of him"" after he ""came home from work"". I was disturbed then, but I was eventually convinced that it was a case of kids playing doctor and it wouldn't happen again. Apparently, it has been happening again a lot.  The general motivation of the other parties in this situation, and those few who are privy to it, seems to be trying to figure out the ""who"" and ""why"" of it. L seems to be getting accused the most, being as he is the older. My motivation, and this is why I feel I cannot keep my confidence as I promised, is that both children are potentially victims. At the very least, one child has behavioral issues that need to be addressed immediately and one child needs victim support, whoever may fit which role. I was never sexually abused, but I have lived a life plagued with depression, suicidal thoughts, and self-loathing due to years of emotional and physical abuse that were never treated. I know the damage that caused me. I know the scars I carry.  My immediate advice was that E should get both children to a child psychologist as soon as possible. I am well aware that acting out in this matter is often a sign that a child has been molested, or has been exposed to sexual displays which are inappropriate for their age. It is possible they are both victims of child molestation. E seemed inclined to debate me on this, citing on reasons for which I come here to seek advice. Her stance, as well as H's and C's, seems to be ""We'll talk to them and this won't happen again"". Aside from the fact that was the plan the first time, if they are being sexually abused by another person this does nothing to solve that issue. I don't want L and R, whom I love very dearly, to grow up damaged as I did. I don't want them to hate themselves the way I have. I cannot live with myself by remaining silent on this.  My questions, then, are as follows. I would appreciate any advice that can be given.  1) E currently lives with H. C lives with his current wife and their two teenaged children. C's parents live just up the road from him, and regularly babysit the children. My sister is scared that, once CPS becomes involved, her children will be removed from her custody. I informed her that CPS would only do so if they could demonstrate that her custody was dangerous to the children's well-being, which I do not think is the case for E nor H. Even if they were temporarily removed, I have no doubt whatsoever that she will be cleared. Also of concern is the presence of D, a three year-old boy, son of H and E. Assuming what I have explained here is true, and assuming H and E are guilty of no wrong-doing, how likely is it that the children will be removed from the custody of H and E?  2) Assuming that it is discovered that one of the children is identified as the initiator and no signs of abuse by other family/friends/etc is present. Would L or R face criminal charges? Would L be more likely to face charges, since he is the older of the two? If one is initiating, and the cause is solely some sort of behavioral problem, I do not want the party to face criminal charges. I understand such things are outside of my control. Therapy is obviously needed, but I also want to make sure I know of potential consequences before I act. I cite issues of underage teenagers sending nude pictures to each other and finding themselves charged with possessing/distributing child pornography. I want them to get help, I don't want their lives ruined. I know that sounds awful to say, and believe me when I say I feel awful, but I honestly don't know what to do here. I'm afraid acting for what I feel might be right may just cause an avalanche of wrongs.  3) Who should this be reported to? My goal is to convince E to take L and R to a child psychologist, as I feel that will make this process much easier for everyone involved than if I initiate it. If she refuses, then I will do so because I cannot stand idle while this goes on. The State Police? CPS? My primary concern is making sure the children get the help they so desperately, and obviously, need more than anything else. I don't want to pile trauma onto trauma.  4) Assuming I am the one to report this instead of E. Am I liable for civil suit? It may seem ridiculous to ask, and obviously such liability would not stop me from reporting this, but I am currently unemployed. I have no money, and currently live with my father who is on Social Security. Neither of us could afford an attorney. If this blows up and goes horribly badly, could fault be brought back to me? Are there steps I need to take to ensure myself and my father are protected after the children are seen to? What kind of attorney would handle such a matter? Suppose E reports it, could C and/or his family take civil action against her? It sounds stupid, but I see a lot of stupid posts on this forum about what people sue for or are sued for.  This post probably seems all over the place, and I certainly feel all over the place. When the situation was explained to me, I felt quite calm and withdrawn from the matter. But after I left dinner and came home, this awful fear and dread has just been building in me and I know it's going to eat me alive soon. While I'm here trying to figure out how to handle this, two kids are hurting and I love everyone involved. I want them to be protected, cared for, and taught how to heal. I want them to have the tools to be healthy that I didn't get. I can't live the rest of my life knowing I sat by while their scars got deeper and more numerous. The thought of anyone hurting them fills me with such rage, but I am trying to fighting down the emotional aspects for now. I want to act in the best of interest of L and R. How can I best do that? Thank you for any advice.  I hope none of you ever have to deal with anything like this."	No
375	"So I live on a property where my lot, neighbor 1's 2 lots, and neighbor 2's 2 lots are all part of a restricted covenant. According to the restricted covenant, none of us are permitted to have animals besides the usual household pets. (Quote from restricted covenant: ""No animals or livestock of any description shall be housed or quartered on the premises, except the usual household pets in reasonable number, will be permitted to be kept on any lot."")  Regardless, they have chickens and roosters. The chickens and roosters are on their property but are physically closer my house than they are theirs. This means I hear them ALL THE TIME. Now, these people are total a-holes. I went and spoke to them earlier and as I approached the end of my property to speak to them, I saw one of the chickens had actually flown into my yard. Had my dogs been outside it would not have ended pretty. My yard is fenced in and m dogs do not leave my property  What can I do to enforce the restricted covenant to keep them from having these disturbing chickens anymore? They are a noise disturbance, getting in my yard as I had been suspecting, and in violation of the restricted covenant."	No

377	I live in California.  I lived with 4 other guys and my girlfriend lived in my room. Only me and the 4 guys were in a contract with the landlord, not my girlfriend.  We agreed on the set price for each person at the beginning of the year (my girlfriend didn't pay and the other tenants didn't ask her to).   The day before the final month, one guy said he wasn't going to be paying rent and was moving out. He said my girlfriend should pay his rent since she has been living in my room for free. He ends up slowly moving stuff out and staying at the house about half the time anyways. He didn't pick up his final belongings until the last day when everyone moved out.   My girlfriend ended up fronting $200 and I $100.  I had been the person collecting the money from the roommates and paying the landlord each month. That means I also got the security deposit back from the landlord minus cleaning fees.   Am I legally able to keep his portion of the security deposit since he didn't pay me his last month of rent?  He is filling out a claim and is threatening to sue me if I don't give him his deposit back.	No
378	For several years I had a relationship with an abusive man. He never hit me but he threw things at me and was verbally abusive. I always wondered if he would graduate to hitting me. I found out he was recently arrested for domestic violence. I have no proof of his behavior because I deleted everything, however, I want to let the prosecutor know that this was not an isolated incident as he is probably saying.   Is there any benefit to me contacting the prosecution when I have nothing to prove what I am saying is true?	No
379	"I recently signed a contract for a new construction home expected to close in December 2017.   The financing section of the contract states ""If buyer intends to use a lender other than designated lender, buyer shall cause said lender to execute an ""outside lender addundum"" within seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract, one the form prepared by seller, and buyer shall provide seller and escrow holder with a copy thereof within such seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract.""  Does this mean after 72 hours, I am stuck with the designated lender and can't shop around for a mortgage with different lenders?"	No
380	I need to write a complete last will and testament for a college assignment. I have a simple will I wrote by hand but it is barebones. I know it doesn't cover everything and my professor wants this will to be complete. Are there any actually free templates out on the internet? Any tips at all?	No
381	Don't know if this is the right sub but here goes...  Started renting a property September 2016, moved in and there was mould in the bath, food from the last tenants still in the fridge and even some of the lights weren't working. The house wasn't even cleaned before we moved in and was handed over in the most vile state. We took photos of everything obviously and when it came to moving out (A week ago) we didn't really bother to deep clean the house since throughout the year he practically ignored us and hardly ever repaired anything when we needed it. (One shower didn't work most of the year)   He now is ignoring all of our calls and this is when it get's interesting he is actually a barrister (prosecutor) and he is trying to take all of our deposit.  He might be taking us to court :(  Any help would be appreciated	No
382	(Ohio, USA). Despite being a minor, does the kid have any rights or privileges after the divorce is said and done? i.e. can they decline going to the opposite parents house, choose whose house they want to be at, etc.	No
383	My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	No
384	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
385	"This is a non contested divorce, we no longer live together and here shortly I will be moving to the opposite end of the country. She refused to sign the papers earlier and now I was wondering is my presence in front of a Judge (in the jurisdiction of where we previously lived) still necessary?  Her excuse (via text message) was, ""I refuse to sign the papers until you find somebody who loves you."" In other words, to be manipulative."	No
386	Does the natural life span of the carpet used count for anything? Carpet normally last 5-7 years and I feel as if they are just using me to pay to replace it. That charged near $1500 dollars for the carpet replacement of a 800 sq ft apartment in a average sized city in Oregon.   They failed to acknowledge my 300 dollar cat deposit I signed for and paid as well when they charged me.  I PAID a 750 dollar deposit I PAID a 300 dollar pet deposit  That are charging me 1500 and only taking in account our deposit not the pet deposit That seem to have conveniently forgot that.    Is there anything I can do in this situation to make stop them from charging is the full amount?	No
387	My landlord contracted someone to replace the roof on the house I am living in. There has been leak in my feeling for about 2 months, which I brought to their attention  As of today a section of the roof collapse and broke a large number of my items in the house, like my furniture.  The landlord is saying that I have to take the situation up with the contractors who are preparing the roof. My question is, is this valid? Also there is now a large hole in my room open to the outside elements. Do I have any options? Does this fall under the habitability section of tenant rights?  I am speaking with a tenant right lawyer tomorrow, but I am trying to get a plan straightened  put as soon as possible	No
388	Hi, I am not entirely sure where to post this but I have a question about insurance.  6 years ago when I was a drinking alcoholic (since in recovery, 4 years sober!) I got a DUI. My insurance rates have been high because of this. I was recently married and my mother suggested I get my car fully insured under my husbands name and the rate would go down. We called and it would, by about $2500 a year, even at completely full and comprehensive coverage.  But is this legal? Does the car technically have to be insured by the primary driver or is it different because we are married? The car is under my name, but we can always transfer it.  His agent said it should be fine but I feel like if it were that easy everyone would do it... Does anyone have any advice on this?	No
389	About a month ago our landlord moved an ex felon in the upstairs apartment from us. Since then we have made numerous noise complaints and the police have been out five times. There are def undercover cops watching the house now.  Our landlord told this big dude that we can call the cops whenever we want. We have sent him a text saying he made the place unsafe for us and are moving out. He told my wife that he is going to sue for the remaining rent owed (like 4 months)  Does he have a case at all?	No
390	This is (was) a 1999 luxury car, lien was paid off in 2004.  Trading it in and title nowhere to be found.   Searching lien holder on google barely shows it ever existed, how to get replacement title?	No
391	Hello community. I live in NY, Queens. The woman I rent from is so cheap that she and her son are trying to evict me for 9 months now, so that they can take advantage of the crazy rising prices in my neighborhood. They gave me a rent stabilized lease and now they claim that the building is not rent stabilized, while they forced me into month-to-month tenancy by refusing to renew my lease twice (that is, they asked for a raise twice already). First they tried to scare me for months (cutting my internet cable outside my window at 2 am, while the son is the only person who has this access, cursing by the mother, turning off my heat in December), so I took them to court first for harassment. They tried to do it the legal way after this, so I closed the harassment case to focus my resources on the eviction case after they served me with a 30-days notice back in December. My lawyer managed to get the case dismissed twice already because they can't even hire and pay a proper lawyer, this meaning that he always messed up with the correct paperwork and documentation. Now they are trying for a third time and I'm determined to report them to IRS because they are declaring 4 units while they receive income from 8. They never gave me a receipt, but I pay with check every single time, so I have proof of payment. I don't want to damage them but obviously they want to cause me damage, so I'm seriously thinking of doing this. My question is, can they be in Housing Court trying to evict me if and while the IRS investigates them?  Thank you for reading this, I'd appreciate any insight and information you have to share!	No
392	Hello! My four friends and I rented a house for the past school year.  We moved out on May 14th. We still have not received our security deposits back from the landlord because he just told us one of our friends didn't pay rent for the spring semester yet. We confronted the friend and he said the landlord was right and he'll send it in asap (which he did). This was about 2 weeks ago. We still have not received the deposits back and have not heard from the landlord. Is he allowed to withhold ALL of our deposits for one person not paying their rent?	No
393	I am about to purchase 18 acres of land in Kentucky and have already been living there for 2 months. We are preparing to move our horses to our new property and while building some fence I am realizing that our neighbor (the sellers brother) has some pasture fenced in that is definitely our property. Also it appears that his whole driveway falls within our property. I could care less about the driveway as he needs it but I will eventually want my part of the pasture. He also has horses and his property is only an acre so he definitely needs what he has fenced for now but I am worried he may have a claim to it since he is using it. Would it be possible for him to claim adverse possession or use another law to claim that land even though the property is changing hands? I don't have the funds to survey the property but I do have a copy of the deed and will be finding the exact property lines this weekend to confirm exactly what is on my side of the line. Any help would be appreciated.	No
394	Never doing those shifts again which amount to about $4 per hour and required I essentially lived at the doggy day care (there was a bed downstairs to sleep on) for the duration of the time. They initally told me that this payment is counted as 'salary' even though I was told upon being hired that I was paid/hour as minimum wage.  I've worked under the table before but have never been this unfairly compensated. Am I right in thinking they are blatantly violating the law?	No
395	My roommates and I have lived in a San Francisco apartment for 2 years now and our lease expires on the 31st. California legally requires that landlords are allowed 30-days notice of tenants moving out, and so we gave them notice on July 18th, so we would pay a prorated fee on our lease for Aug 1st thru Aug 18th. We emailed the leasing office, that has acted as an intermediary between us and the unit owner, on July 18th that we were officially giving notice that we were moving out, to which they responded:  &gt;OK.  I will let the owner know that you will be leaving.  I will also let our inspection staff know so that they can do a final walk thru.  You can be there with the inspector, or you can leave your keys in the unit before leaving and they can inspect after you leave.   Later that day, the leasing office emailed us again saying:  &gt;This means you are obligated through August 18, 2017 (30 days from today's notice).  Let me know if you have any questions!!  So we figured the timeline was set, and the 30 day clock started from there. However, today, on July 20th, the leasing office emailed us saying:  &gt;The landlord is asking that you three sign a letter indicating that you will be moving and when.  Could you please do so and return to me?  This seemed like an innocuous enough request and we agreed we'd get it to them sometime this week, but then they followed up by saying:  &gt;I believe the landlord will start the 30 clock the day she receives your letter and may hold you to rent payment through the 30th day.  So if that is actually the case, we are suddenly on the hook for an additional 2 days of rent, which for us, in San Francisco, is still a substantial amount of money. Is this legitimate? Can I protest this? The leasing office had already told us that they would tell the unit owners about our notice on the 18th AND then sent a followup email explicitly stating Aug 18th was the final date of our financial obligation to them. What are our options here?	No
396	Situation: My mother and I hired a self-employed mechanic to replace the motor of my car '03 Impala back in May of this year ('17). He constantly delayed finishing the repair and then told us just last week that it was completed and we could come get it. When we arrived at the house we could  see visible damage to the front two fenders (dents in the middle over the tires). I also noticed that the driver side window no longer had window tint. I looked inside the cab of the vehicle to see that the radio plate ($299) was missing. I went to the other side of the car to see that the passenger side door appeared to be tampered with on the top of the frame. Then I checked the back seat and opened up the trunk (the car battery is dead) and see that the subwoofers and amplifier are both missing as well. We asked the mechanics son about it as he (the mechanic) is on his way home. Apparently the car was broken into before it got it the mechanics custody and they replaced the driver side window. They never notified us of it or let us know they filed a police report. We're waiting for updates on the issue from the mechanic but I'm wanting to know if there's anything we can do other than do a claim with our renters insurance.   Thanks for your time!	No
397	My parents decided they wanted to move closer to their youngest grandkids. Before getting a realtor they asked their neighbors if anyone wanted to buy. One of their neighbors (let's call them the Smith's) was very interested. Due to some financing issues on the Smith's part, the moving dates were agreed upon fairly suddenly. Since my parents were building a house, they had to rent until the house will be done. They asked the Smith's if they could store some tools and other things in the outbuildings. The Smith's said it was fine. There was no length of time discussed, but the Smith's knew my parents were building, and that the house would likely not be finished until the end of summer.   My parents discussed storage with my sister, and found they were able to store some stuff in my sister's outbuildings. They made arrangements with the Smith's to get some of their items. When they got there, there were some areas blocked off that my parents had items stored in. They also found some big items missing (lumber, copper wire, etc). The Smith's claimed to know nothing. My parents packed up bins that were stored there that had tools and other items, along with the last of the machinery and brought it to my sister's house. When going through the bins, my dad found almost all of the more expensive tools he had stored in them were now gone (routers, heat  guns, etc). Again, the neighbors claim no knowledge. The latest, that had my mom in tears, when they tried to pick up my mom's garden art and planters, they're also missing. Many of these items were given by family over the years, and are irreplaceable.  A few points... -the house my parents sold is in the middle of nowhere. They lived there 20 years and never had anything stolen. -we've known the neighbors for many years. There have been a few issues here and there, but nothing to suggest they'd behave like this.  Is there anything we can do to get my parents stuff back (or replacement value)? Many of the items my parents were planning on using to work on their house. Any suggestions are welcome.	No
398	i live in an apartment with my sister, and a new HOA took over the complex (there was not one before). they're saying my sister has to fix certain things, can no longer own pets, etc. Do they really have the power to do that since the lease was signed completely independent of the HOA? do they have any real legal power if a contract hasn't been signed with them?	No
399	I have been out of the country for a few years. I'm one owner of five of a commercial yard. We are legally tenants in common. Two of the owners have been operating their business on the property and have covered the entire area with their inventory and refuse to move it. They often prevent access to the property to myself or my agents. In the past they have accused another owner of theft had him arrested.  What is the best way to deal with this? Is there any way we can force a sale? Alternatively, can we force them to demarcate the property into 5 equal shares?	No
400	"I currently attend a University in Oklahoma and I have been living in the same rent house since last June--a little over a year now. My ""landlord"" owns a popular local bar near campus and is known to be very wealthy and very friendly. A couple of my friends worked for my landlord a while back and had to go pick up a couple items from one of this guy's ""storage houses."" They asked him (my current landlord) if they could move into the house and live there, to which he obliged on the condition that they signed a lease and did not mess with his stuff he was storing in the garage. Fast forward a few months and he had only asked for rent payment for the first few months and never did for the rest of their lease.   The June after their lease ended (and they moved out) my new roommates and I tried to contact him to set up a meeting time to sign a lease, however, he bailed last second and told us he would call us when we was ready, but that we could go ahead and move in. We waited all summer and he never called us about a lease so we've been living here for over a year now. He never asks for rent and we just pay the bills. We know that he knows we live here because he still sends us letters reminding us to keep the thermostat up over winter break and the lawn service still comes every other week. Moreover, he never brings up the house or our living situation when we go to his bar.   I guess what I'm asking is, what exactly are my rights? I've hypothesized that he's using this house either as some sort of tax write-off so he doesn't really care or that we just scored the deal of a lifetime. I figured I'd ask because with the Fall semester coming up, I'm extremely stressed that he'll come kicking down the door out of nowhere and I'll be having to move out in the middle of the semester."	No
401	"Need a little bit of legal advice. The company I was working for has been in the process of paying me back freelancer invoices back when I was under a 1099 a while ago. During that time period I had gone full-time with them and I was receiving a weekly paycheck.  Back in January/December, the company moved from one state to another and the owner was trying to make that change reflect in our taxes that are taken out as New Hampshire's is lower. There were a few pay periods that were missed, but then I resumed getting new ones again and was told that I would be reimbursed for those that I had not received during the transition, along with the original freelance checks. (At this point some of you may be wondering, why didn't you leave or take action at that point or earlier? Well, this industry is notorious for not paying people, but it is also difficult to find a position like the one that I was in, so I felt like it was the best opportunity and the reputation and experience to me at the time was worth it. I was also fresh out of school at the time.)  During my final 2 weeks which was a few months ago, 2 of the checks that they had written to pay me back for the original missed pay periods had bounced. Also, during those 2 weeks I didn't receive an automatic deposit, so I approached my employer about it. They basically said that they had a lot less money to pay me than they thought and that it wasn't fair for me to continue to work there while I wasn't getting paid.  I'm not really privy to the behind the scenes accounting, but I can't imagine they're particularly good at it. My employer wrote up a document to basically say that they were suspending payment for a while and verbally said that they would look to get me paid back within 4 weeks. Verbally, they said that want to bring me back on full-time again once the work picks up. Its been about 2 months, and I have received a replacement check for one of those missed pay periods, but I haven't received word on when I will be expecting more.  Basically, I'm trying to figure out what sort of legal power/ability I have under my control between the freelancer checks, the full-time missed pay periods, the bounced checks, and the sudden suspension of employment even though I was under contract. I'm definitely tired of waiting around and even though I would hate to break off the relationship with this company, money is more important to me at this point. If they are legitimately ""out of money"" I understand that they can only do so much to pay me back, but they lacked the foresight to deal with that preemptively and allowed me to work without receiving payments. I also feel like they are doing what they can to pay me back, as I have received one of the replacement checks, so I'm not sure if that changes anything from a legal perspective."	No
402	My girlfriend and I are getting married in the next month. We moved the wedding up almost a year because of her grand fathers health.  My question is, could I find quick prenups online that would hold up or do I need to go though a lawyer? Any other advice appreciated.   Before anyone asks, she knows a prenup is a stipulation to our marriage. She knows I have considerable assets and q business I want to protect in the event of divorce. I witnessed my father go though a brutal multi million dollar divorce after 20 years of marriage and don't want to go though that.	No
403	This just happened. I rent a single room in a house, and have a lease agreement.  About a week ago, my landlady asked if I could temporarily move up to the attic (which is a finished, but very small space) so her son could stay in this room (which is a spacious, nice room) for a few weeks while he visits. I was a little taken aback, and told her no. I thought that was the end of it.  I came home from work today to find maybe a third of my possessions packed up in cardboard boxes, and sitting outside the door. She was out at the time, and still is out. I just brought the boxes back in and unpacked them. Nothing broken, but I'm very uncomfortable.  My agreement requires 48-hours notice if she wants to enter the room for any reason.  I'm not sure where to go from here, aside from searching for a different housing option immediately. Do I have legal recourse? It feels like she's trying to forcibly evict me.	No
404	I am renting the basement of my two-flat to an elderly woman. She is frail and often needs help from her long time friend(1st floor tenant) to care for her. Recently, I've been starting to smell urine more often. What kind of recourse do I have in this matter? What would be the most gentle way of address this issue? Thanks in advance.	No
405	For context, my friend turned 18 at the end of October 2016. This drama didn't begin until well after that, around March 2017.   Her mother and step-father are not nice people, nor are they particularly intelligent (I'm putting this very, *very* lightly). For years, she's been told by doctors that she has both depression and anxiety (unmedicated until a couple weeks ago), but due to religious reasons/political differences, her mother insisted she be tested for autism. So she was, and the results came back saying that she has provisional aspergers; this means that she showed some symptoms, but those could just be byproducts of her unmedicated depression/anxiety combo. Her mother does not seem to grasp this at all, and insists that she 100% has autism, treating her as if she's a young child.   During a certain event a month ago (far too long to explain here, as it goes too far off topic), police were intervening, and her mother was howling about how she had paperwork proving that my friend cannot make her own decisions (we were trying to pick her up to take her to a comedy show), so she cannot decide to leave with her friends, and threatened to press charges on us for attempted kidnapping. She merely showed the cops the paper that diagnosed my friend with provisional aspergers and the cops had her go home with her parents, no other arguments permitted.   However, after chatting with someone this week whose parents/younger brother have actually gone through the process of gaining legal guardianship over someone 18+ years old, it came to my attention that her mother might be lying, or that she's forged some documents. We're not sure. I've done some light digging (some of which was very confusing to read), and it seems that, on the basic level, certain paperwork needed to be submitted, court dates needed to be set up/attended, and above all else, my friend should have been informed that all of this was happening (if it actually was). She received no notice whatsoever of anything like this.   So my big question here is: Is it AT ALL possible that her mother was able to sneakily obtain the legal stuff necessary with ZERO consent or knowledge from my friend, since she is not a minor? (And a second less pressing question, which you can ignore if you want since it's not the main focus: Are there any important things we should keep in mind if her mother presses this further, or if there's a confrontation over it?)	No
406	"Hi /r/legaladvice. Sorry for the incoming wall of text, I'm trying to be as thorough as possible because I'm really at a loss for what to do here.  As the title states, I signed a lease for a new apartment on July 31st. I was given a Move In Condition Report in addition to my rental agreement, which had to be filled out, signed, and returned within one week.   I should mention that on the Move In Condition Report I received from the landlord, there is a note right above the tenant signature line that states ""Tenant agrees that if property is not left in same clean condition as stated above, a minimum $250.00 cleaning fee will be deducted from the security deposit. Please make sure you deep clean the unit before you return the keys. Deep clean all appliances, bathrooms, ceiling fans, fixtures, sliding doors, window treatments, etc."".   Upon my inspection of the property in an effort to fill this report out, I noticed that the property was clearly not given to me in the condition they expected me to leave it in. There were dead bugs in nearly every room of the apartment, including in the kitchen cabinets and drawers &amp; bathroom vanities. The refrigerator and microwave both had dead bugs inside of them. Some windows had what looked to be years' worth of dust and dead bugs on the sills/tops of the windows. The showers and tubs still had hair/grime from the previous tenant, etc. I took pictures of some of the worst items and contacted the landlord the following morning.  I spoke with her on the phone and informed her that I was uncomfortable signing the report with this note on it, because the unit was obviously not deep cleaned on my move-in date. She told me to note what I saw on the form, sign it &amp; they would fix and clean everything while I was out of town (I had already planned to leave town from August 3rd through August 9th). I received a text from her on 8/05 saying that everything was taken care of, the place looked great now &amp; I should be satisfied upon my return. She also said she would send me a new Move In Condition Report to fill out, which she never did.  When I returned to the unit on August 9th, most broken items had been fixed, but the unit still did not appear to have been cleaned to the standards they mentioned on their own form. My landlord was leaving town herself from 8/06 to 8/14, and I did not want to call and bother her on her vacation, so my girlfriend and I decided to clean the place ourselves. I would have preferred to hire professional cleaners and deduct the cost from the next month's rent (a reasonable solution, in my mind), but our current lease is ending soon and we did not have the time to waste going back and forth with the landlord over this.  I took more photos before we cleaned. We cleaned for hours and hours and finally got the place to a point that we were happy with. This afternoon I wrote my landlord an e-mail summarizing what had happened since I returned to town. I told her which items were fixed, which were still broken, and then mentioned everything we had to clean &amp; attached the pictures. I did not make any demands in my e-mail to her, I simply informed her of the situation and ended by saying ""Despite this, I am very excited about moving into the unit now that it is clean. Hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement on how to handle this issue and move forward from here. I look forward to hearing your thoughts after you have had a chance to read this e-mail &amp; see the attached pictures.""  Her response back to me was not at all what I expected. I'll quote most of the e-mail here (only redacting some possibly identifying info): &gt;I am still on vacation but I wanted to take a moment and reply to your email and decide the way forward.  I have to say I was quite surprised with your overall dissatisfaction with the apartment. I was personally there until very late the night before my trip to make sure everything was up to standard.  Great effort was put in to make it even better than the first time. For you to say that it looks the same is almost insulting, as I know and can vouch for that almost everything on your checklist was done.  It's not a new apartment with new appliances and accessories so some movement and wear and tear is expected. I...have managed hundreds (of units) for big companies and never have I had someone be so unhappy with a unit that I have handed in the condition this was left a few days ago. If you needed to take the day off to clean then that was another level of perfection that you need.  From this business relationship so far, I can see that you are not happy and will most likely be difficult to be satisfied.  For this reason and after speaking with the owner, we think it is best that you find another place that is up to your standards. I apologize if this was a waste of your time and for the owner but I think this is probably not going to work out.   The owner will refund the money you have paid him in full and we will find another renter who will be happy with the place as is.  I have not responded to her e-mail as of yet. I have a rental agreement signed by both parties which mentions nothing about the lessor terminating the agreement, other than them being allowed to evict for illegal activities. I paid over $4,300 to move in (first, last and security deposit), plus a $250 application fee to the association. If I agree to her proposal, I'm assuming the entire $4k will be refunded as she mentions in her e-mail, but I doubt if the application fees will be refundable. I also spent money on cleaning supplies and to copy keys, and spent lots of time cleaning.  With the way she responded to what I thought was a simple request of wanting to move into a place that did not have dead bugs and someone else's dirt all over the place, I don't think I want to stay here, even if I do have the legal right to. But, if I do agree to her proposal, I'm essentially paying nearly $300 for the privilege of cleaning someone else's apartment, and I'm still stuck with trying to find a place to live in the next week (current lease ends on the 20th). What are my rights here? Is it worth talking to a lawyer? Or should I just agree to her proposal, and move on?   Thanks in advance if anyone actually reads this entire thing and cares to comment!"	No
407	"Forgive me if this isn't an appropriate subreddit for this subject.  My grandfather passed three months ago, leaving a will that split the inheritance between his three daughters. He had $100,000 in checking and savings accounts, a house on 80 acres of land probably only worth about $150,000, and shares of stock worth another $90,000. He happened to tell my mother, sister, and I that the shares of stock were to be split between us, the two granddaughters. He happened to not mention this to his other two daughters, my aunts, one of whom is the executor, and it isn't in the will.  Regardless, everybody has agreed that we two granddaughters will get this money to honor his wishes, though my eldest aunt, the executor, believes that this will be extremely difficult. She has declined to hire a lawyer for help, and lives on the other side of the country. She seems to be showing signs of early dementia, and has difficulties performing the simplest of tasks, including filling out simple forms. We can't directly help her, because she is so far away, and she refuses to ""waste"" money on a lawyer, though she is blowing thousands of dollars a month (it has been three months so far) because the enormous lawn needs to be maintained at nearly $200/week, and utilities are still on because she hasn't turned them off, property taxes are ridiculous, and the stock and property values have been declining steadily.   My mother and other non-executor aunt are frustrated, but at this point would rather give up the money than deal with their sister or bother with legal counsel. My sister and I are frustrated and could really use the money, but believe we have no legal recourse because we aren't formally in the will.  She is making zero progress on the estate and it is wasting money and preventing us from getting our inheritance. Is there anything my sister and I can do?   Additional info: Aunt lives in Arizona. Estate and sister are in NY. I am in Washington."	No
408	"Hello all,  We are a new clothing company based out of Phoenix AZ. We are in a very early stages of creating this business so I wanted to cover everything to make sure what I am printing is legal. Our shirts have sayings such as ""Kill ____ ____"". The blank spaces are the names of certain people such as politicians and celebrities. I wanted to see if I can legally print and sell shirts with this type of wording on them. ""Kill"" Murder"" and other violent terms. I know it sounds weird but I have made a couple and have people tell me how much they love them all the time. If you could help me out, that would be great."	No
409	"I have started a contractor business in Oregon. I purchased a fixer home and have put approximately 40k in personal funds to renovate the inside area of the home excluding the corner of the home I plan on using as a home office. I have jobs lined up and want to use the profits to finish renovating the outside of the home and home office area and then use the home as a ""show house"" when clients want to see examples of work they can expect or want to see an idea in person.  Before I consult a tax attorney I wanted to get feedback from this sub.   Am I doing anything obviously illegal or inadvisable by using profits from the business to renovate my primary residence if I plan on running the business from my residence and using it as a ""showcase home"". I am the co-owner, and the other owner is helping me renovate. I also plan to refinance the home in a few months and take a home equity line of credit to purchase equipment to be used by the business from other jobs."	No
410	I just found out that my husband has been having a year long affair with multiple women.   I am a stay at home mother and full time student with two kids (6 and 1.5). I have not worked in over 6 years.   My husband and I own a house together, though it is primarily in his name as he has income. I am, however, in the paperwork showing that I also own the home.   I feel so lost. I never wanted to be in this position and I have been busting my ass to finish my degree to make sure I could provide for myself if need be. So I guess my question is - now what? How can I protect myself and my children? What kind of government assistance is there for women like me? How much of his paycheck will go towards child support? We live in Texas, and he makes roughly $45k before taxes.   He's my best friend, I'm not out to be vindictive, I'm just trying to get by while I finish my Bachelor's.	No
411	Hi r/legaladvice,   I'm considering forming a travel management company in New York State, helping individuals and possibly small businesses research, plan, and book travel arrangements (air, hotel, ground transport, activities, etc).  Instead of being viewed as a full blown travel agency, I prefer to position myself as a consultant/assistant and would essentially be booking these arrangements direct with the suppliers (airlines, hotels, etc) on behalf of the client.   I plan on getting errors &amp; omissions insurance, as well as forming an LLC to protect my personal assets, and also have the clients sign a credit card authorization form or something of the like when I go to book for them. My question is, do I need some sort of legal terms and conditions that my clients have to agree to before making arrangements for them?  Any advice or info is appreciated, and let me know if more info is needed.   Thanks so much!	No
412	"I've had custody of my niece for 3 years. My sister was involved in a horrific car accident and sustained a brain injury to her right frontal lobe (regressed in mental age to a teenager). She developed a crippling heroin addiction and I eventually took custody of my niece.  My sister got pregnant 3 times within a 4 year timeframe and lost 2 children due to her addiction. My sister had recently ""got clean"" although she's still taking suboxone regularly with an infant at home. We had to block her number because she kept calling and cussing at my niece/her daughter when she didn't hear what she wanted. We've blocked her number, but now she's sending letters without return addresses.   I want to adopt my niece, but I don't think my sister well simply relinquish her rights. How hard of a fight am I up against? Any insight or advice is appreciated."	No
413	Father has been absent to child for 4 years and living in another province but he resently was court ordered to pay child support. Well  he wants something to do with child now and i have refused due to the fact we have a new family now, the child knows only her step father as her father(hes been around since the child was 2) and 2 little sisters she loves very much, not to mention but she also has my in laws who spoil her and treat her like thier own blood. Well the bio dad wants full custody, what are the chances of that happening? Would a judge give him full custody and let him leave the province with her? Any lawa in place i can use to stop that from happening? Its been four years, does he not forefit his rights to her? Could it be considered abandoment even though she has been with me?	No
414	I am 32 years old in Las Vegas, Nevada, and I saw my birth certificate for the first time when obtaining a new Real ID. While my parents are married now, they weren't married when I was born, and the father field is blank on the form.   I did some research, and I found that the certificate can be amended to add him. However, it's not something I want to bring up if there's no benefit to it.  Some information I found online indicated I would not be entitled to social security benefits if he were to pass away, which I'm not worried about.  What are some other consequences of him not being listed on my birth certificate?	No
415	I'm getting ready to file for divorce in Arizona after six years. We agree on everything, already live apart, are friendly, have no children, and the only asset is the house we purchased and own together. I'm keeping the house, and she will file a quit claim deed sometime after the divorce when I'm able to access some funds to give her half of the equity.   I'm going to file the petition, and she is going to complete an Acceptance of Service. We then plan on filing a Consent Decree after the 60 day waiting period. My question is, how do we handle the Response? If she files one, it seems the court automatically schedules an Early Resolution Conference. If she doesn't file, I have to request default which looks to add an additional 4-6 weeks to the process. Is there some other option, or is it one or the other?	No
416	Hello,  I'm a current college student who has been searching for off-campus housing because housing on campus has exorbitant prices. For example, the lowest you can find within a 5 block radius of my college campus is $800 per month. And that is if you are really lucky.   In the past few months, I was in contact with a mutual friend of mine who told me he needed a roommate. According to my friend who is friends with him he is a good guy and he seemed like one too. The apartment looked solid when I went over there, was only 7 blocks away, and only $650 a month which is very very cheap. However I told him I needed a 6 month lease because I was going to go abroad after 6 months, so that ended our discussion since the apartment was only a 1 year lease. I was going to have to settle with my school housing which allowed 6 month leases but instead was at minimum $900 per month while having less space and more rules to adhere to.  However that mutual friend soon contacted me again and said that while he did find a roommate, he was also going to go away for next year and would be spending the year elsewhere (away from our college). He offered me to take his spot and assured me the roommate was a quality guy and willing to take over my 6 month lease. We met up all together at dinner and  everyone got along and I thought that this was a really good deal. I soon after talked with the landowner to confirm whether this was possible (having my lease be 6 months and be transferred at the end of it to my roommate) and she told me that while it would be fine to transfer the lease after 6 months, they would not be making a new contract/lease for it and that I would simply have to get permission from my roommate to transfer the lease to him and they could go ahead with transferring the lease once my stay is up.  So this sounds all fine and dandy, but I realize that I literally have no leverage if someone decides to screw me over.  If my roommate turns out to be negligent or even worse an asshole, he could just refuse to take the transfer and I would be stuck with having to pay over 4k for a place I cannot stay. Or even the landowner could do the same and refuse the transfer. I do have messages from both saying that they would both agree to do it (text message from roommate saying he's cool with it and e-mail from landowner saying there should be no problem doing this) but I know this probably has no real weight.  For reference the lease is a shared lease and has us responsible for a shared cost. However we sign two separate leases (I don't quite get how this works but both our names are on both leases with the total apartment cost of $1300).   So r/legaladvice, is this too risky or am I just being paranoid? I understand sometimes you have to just deal with these risks (especially as a college student renter) but I've been burned before by a roommate who just left without paying the rest of his lease and I was responsible to pay it off. Not sure if relevant but for what it's worth both of us are independents (both over the age of 24) and are non-traditional students.   Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.	No
417	"Hey guys, I need your help as I am super frustrated and losing my patience with my apartment complex.  I am currently living in an apartment complex in Florida. They recently came in to install ""updates"" to my apartment. The current one involved an upgrade to my kitchen. After they finished their install, the garbage disposal ceased to work. I assume it had to do with the install as it stopped working the day they finished the work. I submitted a service request soon thereafter along with another one for an exterior light outside my apartment that is out and leaves the hallway pitch black. A week went by with no response. I placed another request for the same services. Another week went by without a response.  I decided to email the front office staff through the portal we use to communicate/pay rent etc. with a letter regarding my disappointment with the lack of communication on their part and expressing my dissatisfaction. No response but the following day they sent out a maintenance worker to check out and I assume fix the problem. He came in and took a look and said, it seems to be an electrical issue and he'd need to come back the following day with his supervisor but that he would fix the exterior light now.   It's been 4 days and no one has shown up and my exterior light is now flickering but still not at all well enough to see leaving my wife, dog, and I stumbling around in the dark where there is a set of stairs we need to go down. And the dishwasher now has a puddle of water at the bottom that won't drain.   They even had the audacity to send me an email saying the service request was completed. My wife went in and talked to them Saturday showing them all the emails and request we put in as well as pictures of what's happening. They said they would send someone out Monday to fix it. But with all the nothing they've done, I have lost all faith in them to complete it in a timely manner.  What can I do to get them to actually complete the requests. What are my options legally if any?   tl;dr: Apartment complex ignoring all requests for servicing a maintenance issue caused by their work done in my apartment and now appliance is deemed unusable and hallway outside leading to staircase is left pitch black and dangerous. What are my legal options to get them to complete the requests?  Thanks for the support. I just want to walk down my stairs with light and not have an unusable dishwasher."	No
418	Hi!  Our wedding is being held out of state in TN in a few months. We would like our friend to officiate the ceremony. I have read that some online ordinations aren't being accepted (Universal Life Church). We plan to use AMM, but was hoping to get a legal opinion as to if this would be valid.   AMM lists the legal info for solomizing a marriage on their website:  https://theamm.org/minister-licensing/tennessee/  Any help is appreciated. Thanks!	No
419	So, my car was stolen earlier this week and was found in a parking lot last night (completely trashed, very likely totaled). In it was a sentimental item (wristwatch from a deceased relative) and some important paperwork containing sensitive personal information (SSN, bank and investment account info, etc.). Both are gone... the watch isn't really replaceable given the sentimental aspect, and the aftermath of the loss of that paperwork has/will cost me thousands of dollars between money being frozen and unable to move and so forth.   Speaking with the detective handling the investigation this morning, I asked about pressing charges if they find a suspect and he explained that DNA and/or prints don't stand on their own... if (*if*) he finds a suspect he'll basically need to get a confession out of them to pursue anything, at which point the state will press charges automatically regardless of my feelings on the matter.   So my question is, considering the items that were in the vehicle and... you know, them stealing the car in the first place... if a suspect is found by DNA or print matches, is that enough to build a civil suit on even if it isn't enough for a criminal case?	No
420	"Going to try to make a long, complicated story short.  I had a brother, will call him ""Luke"", and his wife whom I'll call ""Lois"". Luke and Lois have been together since they were in middle school, and have had a long, happy relationship that resulted in their marriage. For years, they tried to build a family, and due to his low sperm count were unable to. Luke died in a car accident over a year ago, which devastated Lois.   Lois approached me recently, telling me that she and Luke had tried really hard to get pregnant, and were about to try fertility treatments. They had allegedly discussed the idea of asking me to provide sperm in case Luke wasn't able to. Lois says she still wants to have a baby, and wants it to be as close to being Luke's as possible... That's where I come in.   Lois wants me to be the baby's father. She says she wants nothing else from me, just the sperm.   Lois and I discussed this with my parents. They both seem really eager to get this done. You see, I never want kids of my own. I hate kids, and I hate relationships/women in general, so I'll likely never get married or have my own family. If I don't do this, our family's bloodline ends, and Lois will never have a baby related to Luke.   We haven't ironed out the details legally, and would like to know if it's possible to sign all my parental rights over to Lois, and if I can avoid mandatory child support and visitation. Again, I don't want to be involved in the child's life, and neither does Lois. Lois stated the child never needs to know that I am the father either if I desire it.  So any help/advice on this front would be great. I'm leaning towards doing it, mostly to help my parents and Lois out. State is New Jersey."	No
421	How bad of legal penalties would I face if I changed the locks and didn't let my partner back in the house? We are both on the lease but he is abusive and I'm afraid of him, and I am totally fine with paying him back his half of the security deposit and all of his stuff. But I need time, at least for the money part. I'd have to find another tenant to take his room, charge them the larger portion of the rent, and contribute the difference to him as a monthly payment. I'm willing to do this but I don't know if I have any way that I can, legally.  I can't say where I am, as I don't want him to find out about this post. USA though.	No
422	So I live in an apartment with 2 other people, the past 2 weeks we've had a small bee problem thats progressively gotten worse. All 3 of us have contacted maintenance multiple times but nothing's been done. We've gone through about 12 cans of wasp/ bee spray. They get in through a hole in the frame in our kitchen window we'll wake up to about 20-30 dead bees on our window every other day. Can we withhold our rent until something is done about this?	No
423	I purchased the home in 2013. The home was built in 1993. The property that my home is sitting on is a vacant lot that is still owned by the original contractor for this subdivision. There are so HOA or  anything like that it's just a little neighborhood.   Anyways, the property that my home is sitting on is up for sale. I can't afford to buy it. My other neighbor is who brought this up to me. He was going to buy the property and had it surveyed, decided it wasn't worth the headache, and backed out. When I purchased my home in 2013 I was a first time home buyer and had no idea what to do. I listened to my real estate agent and my mortgage officer. I followed every step and did everything they asked. Nobody asked me to survey what I was purchasing before I purchased it, or I would have know about this then.   Why I'm concerned: I was about to list my home for sell and I this this will be a problem.   Am I liable? Could I be compensated?   Thanks	No
424	I have full custody (legal and physical) in this situation, and my ex has monitored visitation. I won child support through the court as the CSSD was never able to verify my ex's income. Recently my ex filed to open a new case with the CSSD, and I'm unsure if that's even possible nor do I understand the intention of that. So I guess my question is, if there is already a support order through the court, will the CSSD even bother with this?   Thanks in advance!	No
425	We live in Kentucky and my wife got a DUI / OVI in Ohio. We have multiple kids around the toddler age. I have documented proof of infidelity via messages from a former partner of hers. We both have college degrees. Neither of us have criminal records (except for her recent DUI). My wife does have an alcohol issue, but it's never been treated nor documented in any formal way (minus the DUI). I will more than likely file for a divorce. Do I stand a chance of gaining full custody of my kids? What's a best case scenario?	No

427	Hello,  My buddies and I are moving into a new apartment on July 15. We've already paid $2700 as a holding deposit and will pay another $5400 on the 15th to cover first and last months rent. Up until this point, we were lead to believe that the first month's rent we pay on the 15th would cover us until the end of August. My friend says he remembers her explicitly stating that.  However, now a few days before we move in the landlord sent an email stating that she expects us to pay a pro-rated amount for the half of July we are spending in the apartment. We can't recall this ever being mentioned in the lease (we all read it at the time of signing and we are trying to obtain a copy of now to confirm). Nor has she ever mentioned it to us. This pro-rated amount is also unspecified.  Is there anything we can do, or are we just shit out of luck? Thanks for taking the time to read this.	No
428	So, if I was living in 2 bedroom 1 room apartment with a couple. They have one room I have room and we split the rent three ways. Well one of the couple moved out, but is still on the lease. Now they want me to pay a half of the rent instead of a third, even though the one that moved didn't get removed off the lease. They are saying it's my responsibility to pay half now since the other person isn't living here, but they are still on the lease so is it my responsibility?	No
429	The original CC&amp;R's were recorded on 6/9/11 and stated that control of the HOA would be transferred to the homeowners when 67% of the lots were sold or after three years.  I purchased my home in May 2014 and my building was the last building the developer attempted to build (the original plans included many more units).  According to the CC&amp;R's, the three years had lapsed and HOA control should have been transferred to the owners in June 2014.  Later in November 2014 an amendment was filed to change the conditions of control to remove the time period entirely and change the 67% of lots sold to 100%.  Again, this amendment was filed months after control should have been transferred since the original three years were over.  Sometime in 2015 or 2016, a large majority of the undeveloped land was sold to another developer but a small lot in the back of the area was retained by the original developer.  Nothing has happened to that lot since 2011 and there are no plans to do anything with that lot.  According to the amended CC&amp;R's, homeowners cannot get control of the HOA until that lot is sold.  Also, this lot is in a terrible location.  It borders a light rail track and is mostly undesirable (would make a nice area for a city park though).   What does the developer gain by sitting on the undeveloped lot and retaining control of the HOA?  Can a developer arbitrarily change major parts of the CC&amp;R's without homeowner approval?  Is there anyway to enforce the original CC&amp;R's since the amendment was filed after a crucial date?  Is there any recourse to homeowners to get control, if the amendment is valid, since the developer is just sitting on a small piece of land?  Thanks for your help!	No
430	I'm 20 years old and I've never seen my social security card and passport. My parents keep them in a safe deposit box at the bank. I have reason to believe that my parents will not permit me to retrieve them. What options are available to me if they decline to give me my identification?	No
431	I'm a new small business in Pennsylvania and tenant that was transferred ownership of an existing business franchise. We discovered building maintenance using our private internet business network for the separate apartment residences above, building security cameras and keypad entry for tenants. Can I face eviction for cutting off lessors unauthorized use of our business internet?  After discovering the internet use I cut them off because it was causing massive malware and email problems which shut our business down intermittently over a period of two weeks or more as our corporate representative was setting up our store, and it stopped after blocking their IP address through our service provider router software.  I contacted maintenance via text message of my findings with a photo of the unknown cabling on our network, which lied to me about my finding, saying it was only for power until I finally asked a series of questions (because it didn't make sense) and he finally admitted that it was for internet use and claims he had an verbal agreement (not in lease) with the previous owner and after following up on that claim, the owner never would have agreed to internet use. It turns out they were connected to our network switch 3-4 years prior without consent of previous owner, and used our service as new owners for a period of about 30 days.  Since then they've harassed, retaliated and stonewalled us by not maintaining the building, physically and verbally threatened us inside our business space twice and police reports have been made.  The first time the mainentance came in without notification and got in my face in front of my customers, who saw what was happening and responded by getting up to defend me, claiming we were now using the buildings electricity to power our network equipment.  The second time we called a formal meeting between property manager and maintenance to discuss responsibilities of both parties as new tenants and clarification as we are riding out the existing lease on the previous owners personal guarantee and landlords and franchise consent. The maintenance manager nearly came across the counter at me in anger and called me out to fight in the street. The property manager asked maintenance to leave the meeting afterwards. I called the police a few hours later after calming down. Ultimately, we agreed to put the equipment in our space to stop use of building electricity. We made arrangements hired IT service and requested equipment move from our service provider to relocate the equipment to our space.  Service provider was able to do their move and the IT services later that day was locked out of the area and not allowed to finish which left network cabling running on the high-traffic floor which creates a trip hazard which property manager admits in an email that should suffice and doesn't need to be bothered anymore. We tried all avenues to bring this matter to a close; IT services was told that we are not the tenant and never returned their calls or email requests; Previous owner was not able to reason with property manager; our attorney who is a customer called on our behalf; city police also called maintenance from our storefront and nothing will make them comply.  The property manager has high level position (we assume managing partner of building) with a large commercial real estate company who is responsible for that individuals brokerage license. This individual has a web page with many accreditations, but after following up on many of them we've discovered that we couldn't even file a complaint with the realtors associations because there was no current licences under that name. Also we've discovered that our rent checks are deposited to an entirely different account number and name than the LLC on the lease. The building maintenance and property manager are clearly in a relationship, but not openly, which is possibly a conflict of interest among the other ethical violations we've experience from this property manager and staff.  The property manager is now trying to get me to sign an assumption of lease after 6 months of us taking over the lease and the previous owner did notify her of the business transfer, introducing us partners as new business owners. We pay our monthly rent on time, are for responsible in the lease, among other things, for an HVAC unit with a value of about $10,000 however we are afraid they won't let our HVAC technician in to service the unit since they refused to let the IT technicians finish the job that was at their request. We only want to run our new business and are happy with the location and didn't want to disrupt the relationship with the property manager and maintenance.	No
432	"My neighbors are driving me insane. They're this married couple with a newborn baby. Ever since they brought home the kid, they've become the worst sort of busybodies.   I invite my friends over to jam at my house at 3am because we all work crazy hours and we just want to chill and listen to music. It happens a few times a week. When it does, our neighbors called the police. I know it's them because the cops told me after I asked repeatedly who it was. I talked to them about it and they told me that the loud music bothers them and their baby. That's bullshit.  I accidentally hit their mailbox with my car backing up. This freaked the wife out. She came out, and screamed bloody murder at me. I cursed at her which I know I shouldn't have done but I was pissed. I offered to pay for the mailbox but she told me to ""fuck off"". The next day, she and her husband asked if I could pay for the mailbox then I told *them* to ""fuck off"".  Ever since then they've been harassing me. They stand in front of my house, glaring. I've asked police for help but they tell me they can't do anything because they are on the sidewalk. I mysteriously got dog poop on my lawn which I think was their doing. They don't have a dog but their friends bring their dogs over.   I threw a huge block party on Monday night, and they got angry about the noise and the fact I had some friends park their cars in their driveway. They threatened to call the police but the cops never showed up. Next day, they said they would get a restraining order on me.  Can they do that? If they do, can I get kicked out of my house? Is it possible that I can get one first? What else can I do to help get them out of my hair?"	No

434	"Hi guys. I have a lot of questions. Thank your for being well versed in insane minutiae. I did a lot of googling about this and found only bits and pieces of answers    **Scenario**   I am a toddler teacher at a daycare with about 70 employees and two locations, NAEYC accredited. Our location is in a very old building. Today we came in to find that the storage facility connected to the designated break area (they share a door) is undergoing asbestos abatement. All proper signage, warnings, and info packets posted. The room was blocked off with a sheet of plastic and some plywood. None of the employees were alerted, nor were the families. We were also not offered alternative locations to eat lunch. This break room stores all of the food for the children, as well as all cleaning supplies, classroom supplies, extra toys, eating utensils, and a fridge where the employees store lunch and some snacks for children are stored. My boss claims the owner of the building told her to ""keep kids out of the break area because work is being done"" but that asbestos was not mentioned.     **Action sequence**   I am on the playground with my children speaking to another toddler teacher. I ask her if my boss is informing the families and she isn't sure. I indicate that I'm going to let them know that they should keep their children out of the designated area, as they are often in there. My boss's sister (this is it's own problem obviously) hears this and immediately texts my boss. Boss storms onto the playground, interrogating me about why I would want to tell parents about these ""chemicals"" and saying I don't know what I'm talking about, etc etc. When I immediately agreed that i would keep it to myself if she so wished, she continued. She said I just like to caused trouble, that I was a gossip, immature, strange thing like that. I mostly ignored her as I was with my kids, and holding one of them. At the end of her ranting she asked me ""Why do you even come here every day?"" I just kind of gave her a blank stare because that question made no sense to me. I reminded her that I'm putting in my two weeks notice on Friday (going to grad school) and She tells me I'm not needed and I should leave that afternoon and not return. So, humiliated and devastated, i did.  *Note: When I say boss, I refer to our assistant director, as our director is out of town. That's why i was waiting to give my notice, as the Director would return friday. The AD indicated that she was in communication with the director the whole time. I have had no luck contacting the director.*   **Questions**    *1* Does a landlord have any obligation to tell the tenants when asbestos removal is being done? Is the presence of children relevant?   *2* Does my boss have an obligation to let employees know that this work is being done? Does she have an obligation to tell the parents?   *3* Does the landlord have the responsibility of having the air tested for asbestos levels after removal?    *3* Is there anything shady about her reasoning for firing me? I understand at will and all that, but does the safety concern change anything?    *4* Will I be able to collect unemployment from them?    *5* Will I find myself in legal trouble if (now that I am no longer an employee there) I let the parents I know/have contact with that there is asbestos work going on?    I know this is a lot so I truly thank you for reading and considering. I am so lost right now and sadly no amount of googling is bringing me solid answers to these questions. Any help or insight would be incredibly appreciated. And if there are legal issues that may arise that I was unaware of, please let me know! This is turned my life right upside down. Help.  **tldr**: Asbestos abatement being done in a daycare, no one was told it was happening. I found out halfway thru the day when my coworker asked what all the cancer signs are about. Boss/acting boss fires me (allegedly with permission from real boss) for indicating that I wanted to tell the parents of the children who attend the daycare."	No
435	I've lived in my current apartment for about 6-7 years now, and management has changed hands a number of times. Over the last year a new company came in, and set up security cameras in all the common areas, including the building entrances and exits.  I never really had any issue with this, but now I've been handed a lease renewal to sign, and I see that there's a photography release clause in there. I can't copy &amp; paste from the source, so I'm summarizing, but if necessary I can transcribe it.  Basically it says they can use any image from any of the cameras in the building for any reason, and they don't have to notify you or compensate you.  Now, I'm sure they're not going to take a top-down photo of my fat ass staggering back through the lobby from the pub and use it in their next publicity campaign or anything, but it just seems absurdly invasive to me all the same.   Are they allowed to do this? It would be ok-(ish) if I could avoid the camera areas, but residents literally can't, they're in all the building entrances.	No
436	My apartment and the rest in the building specifies that tenants may not allow smoking on premises.  Typically, how should this be interpreted? Is the premises the interior or does it include the balcony? Does it also include the common areas?  Also, what can I do as a tenant if a landlord won't enforce this? I've read that breathing problems MIGHT be considered a disability that he would have to accommodate, but is not smoking near my front door or within however many feet of my balcony even a reasonable accommodation to request? And if another tenant is already not following the rules and is smoking inside, would getting proof of a need for accommodation from my doctor even be worthwhile? (Meaning, can he be required to take steps to actually enforce policy or just have the policy? Such as eviction.)  Thanks in advance!	No
437	"I have been divorced for many years.  During the divorce I was ordered to pay my ex $300 a month and he was ordered to refinance and take my name off of the house and loan.  After an extended time of him not doing this I contacted my lawyer and asked why do I keep having to pay and he hasn't done anything he was ordered to do... after me nudging the attorney he finally let the judge know and the nudge put a ""Stay"" on my part of the order where I used to pay the $300 a month.  Years later and he (my ex) still hasn't done anything.  Does this mean years from now if he finally takes care of this I'm going to have to start paying him again while living on Social Security retirement or is there a time limit for someone to complete what a judge has ordered.   Needless to say I did not want to contact my attorney from years past he was worthless and I learned later he doesn't do divorces but only doors court cases for marijuana rights."	No
438	I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	No
439	"Recently started a part time side job at a small music store. ( 3 months in, 2 days a week).   Employer/owner hasn't had me fill out a W-4. Paychecks have listed normal tax reductions. For what ever reason, I forgot to mention the form. It didn't cross my mind until today when he asked me for my social security number for his ""Tax Guy"".   I'm curious as to what should, needs and can happen in this case? Where has the tax money listed in the pay stub been going or logged as?   I don't have time for issues to occur. I don't need the job, just side cash I can play with. Is this reason to quit if he does not truthfully comply?"	No
440	My sister runs a semi popular African American natural hair blog and instagram. She interviewed with a hair company in order to join their sponsorship program, which would require her to post images of her using their products on her instagram in exchange for monthly free products. After going through the interview process she was informed several weeks later that she had not gotten into the program. Flash forward to today, I am scrolling through my Facebook page and see that this company has posted one of her pictures taken from her instagram without permission. Are companies allowed to Take images from instagram without giving any sort of compensation or obtaining permission from the owner?	No
441	So, as the title says, I believe there is black mold in my apartment in the shower. There was a crack above the shower when I moved in, but it is my first time renting and I didn't think anything of it, thinking it was cosmetic and desperately needing a place to live. I noticed that the water from upstairs was leaking through the crack one day. As my lease has progressed the splotches that surround the crack have gotten darker brownish/blackish, as well as the one drop ceiling tile getting more water damaged. I have pictures that show the progress of the shower getting worse. A few months ago my landlord verbally told me that someone would be out to look at it, and it has never happened. What is my best course of action here?	No
442	"I know next to nothing regarding land lord laws. My (ex)roommate (hereby RM) and I rent a house from a close family member of mine. A lease has been signed. RM has been late with rent before but has eventually paid it back. RM and I work together, it sounds like work may use this as a reason for termination, and for good reason. I am not really looking to get into the nitty gritty of RM's legal issues as they don't really concern me. RM's nonpayment of the current month is an issue. Luckily my family member has another potential tenant lined up after I get back from a 2-week vacation at the end of the month. I really am curious about the eviction process or if we can just ""break RM's lease"" for some other reason that wouldn't involve any legal dealings like eviction. Really not looking to burn bridges/fuck up RM's life beyond getting RM out of my life, for good reason.   RM's property is still inside of my house so I haven't changed the locks yet. I have bought new locks and garage door receivers for the appropriate time. RM still owes $400 for the current month of rent and is 6 days late on it as of right now. RM was arrested less than 24 hrs ago for a felony charge and may be gone for awhile. Do I need to send RM written notice if I intend to break the lease for nonpayment? How do I do that if RM is in jail and I can't physically talk to RM for a week or so? I know there are appropriate ways of doing this and I don't want to make any mistakes where RM can sue me for holding onto his property or anything like that.    Also, I have someone watching the house while I am gone and everything is insured if he chooses to break in after locks are changed. The first thing I did when I heard RM was going to jail was getting new locks.   First time posting (ever)  on this sub so hopefully, no rules were broken.  TL;DR: Roommate is in jail, owes me rent in a family (my family) owned property. I just want him out. How do I do so without breaking any laws or giving him any channels of legal recourse."	No
443	I know it was fucked up what I did but I did it. So I work in my dads business (I dropped out of college but am working my way back currently). There's a regular who is married, we would make small talk here and there and we eventually exchanged snapchats. Anyway she vented to me about her marriage, all the problems with it.  Short story is we started seeing each other and having sex. This went on for a few months until we were caught in a parking lot together. To make it easier to understand our families are both from cultural/traditional backgrounds, so word about our affair spread quick.  Her husband has threatened to kick my ass, gave my dad's business negative reviews on google saying they hire people who fuck other guys wives. His family started harassing me/ talking shit about me on social media. I started ignoring it as it died down but the husband wouldn't stop this shit, he hates me I get it. I did apologize.  Anyway he came into the store once and started making personal remarks to me, I had enough so I told him I didn't regret any of it. We're both from religious backgrounds and everybody knows about our affair now. I feel like I'm being blamed more than his wife and I'm tired of it. I made a mistake. I've lost friends over this and my family is angry with me. I just want people to get off my back and get this dude to leave me alone already.	No
444	The floor is quite thin. It sucks that he can hear me when I even just walk to the bathroom. Should I charge him to buy me a carpet in order to alleviate the phone dropping? Should I buy a carpet? Or is it my responsibility to avoid dropping my phone if it slips out of my hand sometimes.	No
445	"In August, I will be moving into an apartment with some friends near the University we attend. The move-in packet that we all recently received states that move in day is August 15th but first months rent is due in full on the 1st. They also said that no early move ins requests will be considered and they will not prorate the rent. I emailed them today asking why we cannot use the apartment during that time (which is not a big deal to me since classes don't start till the following week and I have work where I live till the 11th) and whether that two weeks of rent will be put towards anything. They said that they will be working of renovations and doing walkthroughs with former tenants during that period and that the money will go toward the ""1st month of the 12 month equal installment plan that make up [our] whole rent"". My mother and her coworker, who are both former apartment mangers, have stated that it is illegal in the state of Texas for a landlord to charge for a period where the tenant is unable to access or use the property. Is this correct and if so what can I use to quote (preferably a state law) when I reply back? Neither my parents nor my roommates parents are too excited for paying on an apartment that we cannot use.  My parents have an on call attorney that I do have access to but I would prefer to use that as little as possible. So, it would be a great help if I could get some help finding some exact statute that I could use.  Thanks to everyone in advance."	No
446	So I had a home loan that was sold to Nationstar mortgage (about to be Mr. Cooper &lt;&lt;weird name).  Escrow was paid and had no trouble the first year.  So I get a notice in the mail today stating they'll provide insurance because my coverage lapsed.  After talking with Esurance and them both stating one or the other did not notify each other, my premium is up $400 a year due to the lapse.  Is there any legal protection for me as this rate increase is all on the mortgage company's fault I believe.	No
447	Today I found out Cigna denied part of my FMLA paperwork for a small error on the form that my doctor made.   The doctor failed to include two days I have missed from work in his date range for my intermittent leave for Migraine.   When I spoke with Cigna about this they stated that I can get a second chance, but only because I live in Washington State. Washington State has its own FMLA law. If I lived in a state without secondary protection, Cigna states that they would not reconsider if my doctor corrects the form.   Cigna never called me to inform me of the error on the form, and just denied my claim.   When I brought this up, they told me that they aren’t allowed to call. They also said that the law as written allows them to deny a claim and not reconsider it.   When I asked them where in the law it says they can do this, they mentioned that sections 825.306 and 825.307 of the 1993 FMLA pertain. She stated that it reads that the employer cannot call the doctor to question items on the form.   This section was obviously intended to protect the employee from the employer unscrupulously contacting doctors trying to prevent the leave from being approved under the law, Cigna is trying to make it about them.   I want to get this information out there. People living in states without secondary approval could lose their jobs because of stuff like this. People in desperate situations and in poor health could lose their jobs and their ability to pay for their insurance and their ability to receive care because of this policy by Cigna.   Upon research I read something about a 7 day cure period, and I think my situation applies.   What can I do? I feel like this company is taking advantage of people and it makes me sick.	No
448	"Can anyone help me out? What legal action should I take?  I co-founded a business in 2013 in freshman year of college with a friend of mine where girls step on insects. We usually sold our stuff using xxxfetish-media, which is a good place to sell bug crush and femdom content. I used their official OCMB forums to help figure out what people liked best when I started out. Early that year I saw a legit filesharing website (we'll call it fetishare) where people made accounts to trade videos and got points for it, so I figured that it'd be a good way to spread my store's name around. Well soon after that I found out from the admin on the OCMB forums that they were spying on customers, farming IPs from 'known pirate websites, and in some cases placing malware to track people. I figured I'd stop using the fetishare site and just sell normally.   Well last year in June when I was waiting for a payout from them, I didn't get it and started wondering why it didn't hit my bank account. I contacted them but the customer service wasn't good at fixing it. I eventually got a response saying: 'Your account has been suspended for copyright violations'. So basically I got locked out of my store for something that happened three years ago. Notice I said 'locked out' and not 'closed down'. My store is still up. People can still buy from it and they can make money from it while giving none to me. They don't respond to any of my emails either, except for one when I ask for how I can restore access to my store they said: ""We will for forgive this if you sign a statement saying you will never again share videos.'   I made about $41k/yr from that store. In hiatus/hibernation mode with no updates it at least made $10k from last year to now. I'm owed money, and this isn't right. They're not only hurting me, but other producers by banning customers left and right from being able to buy and lowering profits.  Since then I started my own e-commerce store and hosted on Clips4Sale and Kinkbomb instead. However I would still like to know what to do about this.  I live in Alabama.  Any thoughts? Should I take legal action?  - tl;dr: Possible embezzlement with my store on a fetish hub. What do?"	No
449	Hey everyone,   Here's the situation. My mother is recently widowed and I'm unable to get her down into the bay area where I live (she lives 3 hours away from me) so that I can stay with her and look after her. My niece suggested that she could look after my mom but I need to get her over here into CA first. My niece is from the Philippines and I don't know where to start. I'm unsure what Visa she needs, what hoops I need to jump through/she needs to jump through, etc. Any advice or starting point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone! :D	No
450	Hey Reddit, two friends are I are wanting to rent a 3 bedroom apartment for our second year of uni, we've given our last months deposit, and the landlord has given us a copy of a lease to sign, but now has yet to make any motions of negotiation.  He wants us to pay in postdated checks, all provided before we move in. All three tenants must pay under 1 check. (disregarding Ontario's tenancy in common rulings, in which each tenant is only responsible for their share of the rent) so that in his words, anyone who signs the lease is responsible for the full amount of the rent. We have cosigners which he asked for, however he now asks that the checks come from one of the cosigners(parents). He asks this in a secondary email, the lease does not stipulate who the checks are written by, only that they are written and valid)  I'm just trying to figure out if this is on the up and up or not. If we sign the lease and write the checks ourselves, can he refuse them and refuse to rent to us? In that case can he get away with keeping our deposit even though it's his choosing not to rent to us/if someone skips town, who pays for the remainder of the rent?	No
451	hey, so to make this a short long story, my father has never paid child support even though my mother had got it in writing what he was supposed to pay (the amount slips my mind as I was 3 when this all happened and I have lost all the paperwork). but as of now I am of age of majority and still wondering if i have any entitlement to that money. I'm also in Canada, British Columbia. So I guess what I'm asking is where I stand with all this in a legal level, what my options are, what kind of lawyer to look into. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this. Will update with any info as needed.	No
452	Hello Everybody - First and foremost, I sincerely appreciate any and all assistance you can offer.  &amp;nbsp;  TLDR= Wisconsin - Never married, Child is 14, have 50/50 custody/placement, there has been no order for support since 2007 when we amended the custody order for 50/50.  Is my Ex entitled/able to acquire to any of my payout?  &amp;nbsp;   Full Story = Recently discovered I will be getting some money, not Millions but still a life altering amount for my situation(lowish six figures).  My primary question/concern is how best to proceed to ensure that my ex is prevented/limited in her ability to stake any form of claim in the payout I will get.  My goal is to maximize the positive impact this payout can have on my life and my son's life only.  &amp;nbsp;  Basics of it are as outlined in the TLDR, we have had 50/50 custody/placement since I got out of the Military in 2007, she 100% agreed to sharing everything, we developed the current agreement together, without lawyers and both submitted it, judge signed off on it.  We were never married, when the support order was active during my service (03-07) I never missed a single child support payment, voluntarily updated child support every time I received a raise.  We split every cost for him 50/50(I write checks and have paper record of everything), we share all major decisions, we agree/share the same approach when it comes to teaching/disciplining our Son, IE when he's grounded there I ground him here and vice versa, we support each other in that fashion.  Overall I would say my Ex and I have a pretty good co-parenting relationship, I really couldn't ask for more as far as all of that goes.    &amp;nbsp;  My Son has indicated a desire to live with me several times, he has also stated this desire to his Mother.  I would love for him to live with me, that said, I recognize the reason he wants to live with me is because he and I share a lot of the same interests and overall have a ton of fun.  This is largely due to the fact that he is my only child, so he gets 100% of my attention/recreational spending, at his Mother's he is the oldest of 3 children, so gets far less attention and a lot more misc chores due to the larger household.   &amp;nbsp;  I typed all of that out to attempt to help inform your responses, not trying to kill you with a wall of letters.  Regarding finances, she is married, they have probably double the household income that I have, we don't really share our finances but we did include in our court order, neither of us have asked the other about anything for years.  We alternate yearly on claiming my son as a dependent on taxes.  My basic concern is that once she learns about my anticipated payout she will file for child support.  I have performed some basic research, in WI it looks like they utilize a formula for 50/50 situations similar to ours where they analyze the difference between the two parents income.  How does that all relate to taxable lump sum payouts?  I know I probably need to hire an Attorney, there is also the possibility that I will get the payout and she would never even know unless I deviated from my current lifestyle to drastically.  &amp;nbsp;  Thank you again for any and all assistance	No
453	Basically I have a friend who is determined to legally change her name every 5 - 10 years. Her reasons are not nefarious but bizarre. She has already changed her full legal name three times and intends to continue. I think, even though she's not doing it for criminal reasons, that she is opening herself up to problems down the road.  The following is a fictitious example of what kind of name change has occurred:  Lauren Miriam Brown to-&gt; Elizabeth Jadzia Tolson to-&gt; Ava Vivian Grimes	No
454	"A former tenant, a married couple, have filed a restraining order against my father in law, claiming he harassed them by driving past their home. The woman further claimed that she was afraid of him, because he was acting crazy and laughing maniacally.   All of this is so drastically out of character for my FIL, that I believe they filed this out of spite to inconvenience him, or maybe even as a means to another end.   He had to evict them because they stopped paying rent and strung him along with promises of payment and the occasional payment of less than 10% of what they owed. He tried to work with them for about 6 months before he filed for eviction.   They rented two small commercial offices in a small town building. They contested the eviction, but then settled for being granted a few more weeks and in turn agreed to a payment plan, which afaik they have not honored.   When they finally moved out, the places weren't in great shape, but there was nothing obviously malicious.   However, they did claim at that time already towards a deputy, that he had been harassing them by tearing apart their shop sign and screaming at them. I do not believe for a second that he would scream at any person ever, and he probably did not tear apart their sign, because he could produce it intact immediately. But, he had gone there and taken it down when he posted a for-rent sign.   When they found new places, the owners called him for a reference. He is fairly active in the community, and many people know him. He did describe exactly what happened to the owners, and it is fairly likely that they lost their not yet signed lease because of that call.   Now, the restraining order is actually a problem, because it appears that the woman has found a new place within 500ft of his property. So when he goes in to show it, he would be violating the restraining order, if I understand everything correctly. I could also imagine that they're trying to somehow trick him into violating it, just out of revenge, or maybe even to establish a pattern for yet another frivolous suit later. I have personally not met them or witnessed anything, but again, everything they described in the restraining order does not fit at all to his character.   Now, my question is what would be the sensible steps to take?   He wants to go to the DA's office, and ""explain the situation"". I wouldn't think that would really achieve anything. (Though, maybe it would, because he might actually know someone in that office.).  I suggested he let his attorney handle it, who negotiated the payment plan with them. But really, right now he doesn't know how to effectively react, he's running more on instinct, which might just be wasting time."	No
455	I live in Washington. I have bipolar disorder and I had a severe manic episode that started around the 20th of June. On June 28th, I bought a 2013 Subaru WRX STI. I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k.    Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership.   I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price). They took the other route and had their lawyer send an email basically just saying there's no 3 day grace period or anything like that in Washington.   I know I'm definitely knee-deep in shit for this, but does anyone have any suggestions? I'm debating just leaving it there and taking the credit hit from a default. I make pretty good money for my age but I don't want to be stuck with those ridiculous payments. Even just seeing the car gives me anxiety and reminds me of all the bad decisions I made during that manic episode.	No
456	"Looking for advice/a restraining order. This woman has done nothing but torment my wife and my children and constantly enrage me. Wife has said she'd take care of it multiple times, but she still hasn't, years later. Now I do have some idea of the time-frame of the following events, but not all of them. Some of them were last year.  Here's a fun story about my Mother-in-law:  12/2015 It comes out that she's been cheating on her husband for ~3 years with her husband's best friend, it comes out her daughter did the same thing for 4 months. Threatens his life multiple times to everyone who'll listen, for five months lies to everyone around her about the whole situation because of ""what he did to both of them"", comes out that she's still seeing the bf, divorces husband and marries bf so he can get his green-card.  -Multiple times has run up to my wife in the store, immediately berating her over not letting the kids come around anymore. Kids now refer to her as ""scary monster lady who yells a lot"".  -Corners my wife when she goes to pick up the kids at her grandmother's house, again immediately barging into the house screaming at the wife.  -We literally move an hour away, just to be in a different area  where there's ""no chance"" of seeing her or bf ever.  -Wife graduates college, specifically tells friends, family, etc. not to even tell her mother about it, so obviously MIL shows up but hangs around in the back so nobody sees her until halfway through, then nobody tells me because they know exactly how I'd react. Thank god for family, right? Wife breaks down about it later. Great job guys.  8/2/17 0915 Shows up at my front door, knocks, gawks at my daughter, then son as I'm coming out of restroom. Is already almost in her truck by the time I reach the front door. Pulls out in a hurry. Kid says ""why was monster lady here? I thought she couldn't find us anymore.""  She has been told on all of these occasions by my wife and I both to stay away from my family to the point that she knows what we'll say before we say it. She is consistently and actively harassing, stalking and taunting us causing us to have to watch over our shoulders when we go out, as a result not really wanting to go anywhere. Would love for this bullshit to stop and for this bitch to stop getting away with trying to insert herself into our and our kids' lives. It's disgusting and disrespectful and I wish she'd drop dead.  **TL;DR** Need crazy MIL to stay away from my family."	No
457	Hi guys, I just recently purchased a home, and when closing I received a year of home warranty. My air conditioning went out last night, and the heat index is ~106 degrees, and it is 80 degrees in my house.   My wife made a claim today, and the company stated that they are unable to come out until at least Tuesday. I have a 2 year old daughter and the house is far to hot to keep her there that long, but even talking to supervisors, they state that it isn't an emergency type of situation like when you have plumbing issues.  Do I have any grounds to get them to come out quicker, or if we are unable to stay in the house due to the safety of my child, will we have grounds to get compensated for a hotel stay?  I'm about to drive home and I'll answer any questions when I get there. Hopefully someone can tell me what my options are, if any.	No
458	So the title says my STBX and I are getting divorced. There was a domestic incident tonight and I'm filing for a restraining order in the morning. I've read the documents online but I'm still confused on whether or not I need to file for temporary custody of our son separately or if that will be granted with the OFP?  I'm in MN.	No
459	So I have a condition called POTS (posterial orthostatic tacacaridia syndrome) and was just fired from my job because of it. It causes me to pass out when I go from sitting to standing sometimes. It's happened three times at work over the past year and they decided that it's not okay for them to have me around anymore. I am a club volleyball coach and I was wondering if it's legal to fire me over this. I'm unconscious for about 30 min and am still able to work after I wake up. Is there something that can be done? Any response would be appreciated even if it's completely okay for them to do this.	No

462	A friend of mine is a handyman, and a water heater installation went terribly wrong.  More than an hour after install, a clamp blew and 500 gallons of water made it Through half the house.  Here's the issue:  the house is a rental.  The renters were home when it happened, but did not turn the shutoff valve, and when the landlord arrived several hours later, far more damage was done.  Do the renters have any responsibility to mitigate the damages- by turning that shutoff?  The damage could have been minimal had they simply turned it off, but bc they didn't, the subfloor, floor and all insulation must be replaced in about half the house.	No
463	My partner and I are divorcing in San Diego California.  We agreed to go our separate ways, divide our stuff on our own, and just end it.  I moved out and filed the paperwork, and they lawyer-ed up and are now asking for more than agreeing to.  My question is can I, as the petitioner, amend what I am asking for from the court?  There are no children together, or anything too complicated like property or large 401K's.  We make almost the same amount of money, the marriage lasted 2 years.  Just dept and assets acquired during the marrage.  I have an appointment with my own lawyer next week.	No

The sheriff and my ex-wife don't really care much for one another, and it sounds like he's filling her full of bullshit out of spite. She and the husband are still married, and I don't see how she forfeited her claim to her belongings when she moved out. I think the sheriff is full of shit and just being petty.	No
465	I tried to work on a floor at my past rental, but botched it up.  I own up to that.  But the way the landowner/real estate guy is handling problem is the problem. I am in Orange County, NY.  1. Owner isn't close so I have text messages of real estate agent saying he will tell the owner place is in good shape.  He said this twice without checking anything off.  We left keys June 15. 2. Owner says the floors were sanded and stained bad-I admit to-but a week after realtor said all was fine.   3. He had someone try to come and sand and stain floors 4. It has now been fourty days since being out and no deposit minus fixes or detailed sheet saying what needs to be done.  Question: 1. It is later than 21 days, a local law says, either money back or details of repairs is he wrong? 2. Was the owner or realtor supposed to do good walk thru and let me know any fixes, before leaving keys? 3. Does these two wrong doings, if they were, trump the messing of the floor legally? 4. Does the realtor's word, being the agent, mean alot when he said that he will tell the owner place is good? 5. Will my text trail that has all of this in there help me in  a case?  Any advice would be helpful.	No
466	My father has alcohol induced dementia (at least we think). I am 23 he is 61. He was being watched and taken to doctors by his siblings but they want nothing to do with him anymore. He is currently living in the northeast, I live in Virginia, but I think his legal state of residence in California. I think he said a neurologist said he didn't have dementia and a psychologist said he did but he is unreliable. He is incoherent the majority of the time and absolutely should not be driving and probably should not be living alone. He likes to jet around the country to live in all these different places with girlfriends or family and doesn't listen to anyone.   How do I get power of attorney for his legal stuff (he's been divorced from my mom 15 years but they still clown a house and she wants him to sign it over but he doesn't even understand what she wants). I also want to be in charge of him medically in case I want to put him in assisted living or get his license revoked. I'm very confused by what I have read online. Does anyone have basic steps I will need to take? And is it ever possible to force someone into assisted living?	No
467	Im going to try and make this as short as possible. Boy meets girl. Boy gets married. They have a kid after a few months. Boy losses job and place to provide for family. Family moves into girls parents. Parents kick boy out for arguing with wife about finances. Boy leaves to 'make it easier'. Now, how do I go about ruining there lives? Im already going to never allow them to see the grandchild they love so dearly. There is alot of information, If you read this far please ask anything you need to better understand the situation and give me proper assistance.	No
468	"Backstory:  My wife and I made a bad, in-the-moment decision to accept help from her estranged mother back in March, and have been living there, along with our &lt;2 year old daughter. In the meantime, I have gotten a decent paying job and been paying them 400 dollars a month (""More than enough"" when we first started living there.) and attempted to contribute to the well-being of the household in many ways. By all rights, my wife and I have tried to avoid stepping on toes as much as possible and have been as clean in shared areas as possible, but we still got yelled at and complained about.  A couple of nights ago, things came to a head with my mother-in-law and her husband. They got into some form of major fight in front of my wife and daughter (while I was at work), and after the man left, my mother-in-law proceeded to kick my wife and child out at 8PM. They showed up to my workplace while I was on break and I immediately clocked out, and made phone calls to see what I could find out.  Without finding anything out, I went to the house (trailer) and attempted to go in and talk some sense into my mother-in-law, who was drunk and not willing to communicate, consistently saying we were using them and didn't appreciate them, complaining about how we spent our money on stupid things and all manner of other quips that made no sense.   Knowing that these people are the type to steal and sell without regard, I attempted to grab what I could from the trailer and managed to get most of our valuable, expensive items out, but she was yelling at me the entire time, and I lost track of our important papers, and didn't have time to even grab clothes/diapers for our daughter. I contacted the police to see what they could do, and they recommended we give it time, so I am going to contact my mother-in-law again tomorrow, but if that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to go to court over it.  Our clothes and my daughter's birthday gifts are there. I could care less about our bed or TVs or anything else, but we need clothes to wear and other things, which I can't feasibly go through some long, drawn out court process to get.  What can I do if this ""negotiation"" doesn't go well tomorrow? Is it within my rights to just enter the property and get our things, since for all intents and purposes, that was our home, and we even paid up to next month to live there? If I do go to court, what should I expect to go through? What should I bring if I need to meet with an attorney?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for any advice given."	No
469	I found that my child is not my child, the mother and I got married because I thought he was mine, she told me she slept with another guy, but he was sterile. Well 9 months after the baby was born, he doesn't look like me, we're fighting, I take the DNA test, and before I get the results back she moves in with her parents and takes all his things. Turns out he's not mine, we're filing for a divorce based on results of thepaternity, but what do I do to get off the birth certificate. I've called vital records and resources and they say they need a court order to get me off. Is that the same thing I am getting with the divorce? Do i tie it all into the same court case? What do I do? I don't want to pay child support for a kid who is not mine. Also, I know the other guy's name, and where he lives.She doesn't want him to get involved, but I don't want to pay for this kid.	No
470	"I have a plan with a telco company that is akin to mobile device insurance. I get to replace my defective set for a new/refurbished set with a small out-of-pocket charge ($130). The device that I would receive is covered under a 6 months warranty.  5 months in the warranty, said device started malfunctioning. I tried to exercise the warranty but it was out rightly denied on the basis that there is cosmetic damage on the device (small dent).  I disputed this on the basis that no where on the service terms and conditions did it explicitly state that cosmetic damage voids this 6-months warranty.   The warranty clause is as such:   Warranty – You are entitled to a 6 month warranty for each Like Mobile Device against manufacturer malfunctions and defects that starts from the date of delivery of Like Mobile Device. }  They claim that my cosmetic damage is ""against manufacturer malfunctions"" hence my warranty is void. So far I have spoken to two senior managers who have given me the same reasoning.  How should I reply them? Can what they mean be interpreted from that clause?"	No
471	"I am writing this post on behalf of a friend who I know very well and has found himself in a frustrating predicament and is in need of some advice. Background Story: My friend obtained a grant to carry out and complete a Master's dissertation in Chemistry which he has to finish by September or else risk having to pay the grant himself, which he cannot afford.  What Happened: My friend was assigned to a completely new tutor/supervisor, lets call her Dr. Smith for simplicity's sake. This is Dr. Smith's first year working at University and is thus supervising her first two students who she is being abusive against. The problem first started when my friend cordially disagreed with Dr. Smith on how a particular calculation should be worked out - a classical example of a student not agreeing with his teacher and the teacher taking it completely the wrong way (the displacement defense mechanism).  The latter is just the tip of the iceberg, on several occasions she has called my friend 'stupid' to his face (and even his colleague) in an aggressive tone. Her personality is what I would describe as toxic and straight out abusive. It got to a point where my friend had to be careful of everything that he does, says or asks because of a possible tantrum by Dr. Smith. This took a toll on my friend so he approached Dr. Smith and told her that she was being too aggressive and was intimidating him. Once again Dr. Smith took it completely wrong, not only was she completely oblivious to how abusive she has been but she accused my friend of being aggressive, not working hard enough and at times, intimidating her. Now I know my friend really well and if I had to describe him I would say that he's extremely passive, smart and hardworking so her accusations genuinely dumbfounded me. My friend realized that his chat clearly got him nowhere and made things a lot worse. Knowing that he needs Dr. Smith to complete his Master's degree, my friend decided to take the higher road and ""suck up"" to his supervisor so he sent her an apology email, hoping that if he would be the first to reach out and make a compromise to settle their differences Dr. Smith would TRY to do the same. WRONG, she did not even read his email and they got to a point where Dr. Smith kicked him out of the lab and told him that she is not going to work with him anymore. At this point, my friend is not completely screwed as she won't let him complete his dissertation so he setup a meeting with the faculty Dean to explain things to him which was unfruitful as she ended up 'hijacking' his meeting and turn it into a scolding session against him.  With no options left he decided to setup a meeting with the disciplinary board and he explained his case quite well in privacy this time and was quite convincing. Dr. Smith also had a meeting with the board and used my friend's apology email as leverage to falsely prove her point. It seems like the disciplinary board is more inclined to believe Dr. Smith because the apology email demonstrated my friend’s guilt (from their point of view) rather than the fact that he was willing to take the higher road as he is in need off of his tutor (however crazy she is).  My question now is, if the disciplinary board decided to side with Dr. Smith, what else can my friend do or who else should he turn to? The situation that he's in is not only unjust because he's going to be robbed of a Master's degree which he's so close to finishing but also because he will have to pay for the grant that he worked so hard to obtain, all because of a person who has personality issues and is good at hiding it/lie about it during disciplinary meetings. Should he find a legal advisor or attorney considering that he’s broke? Does he stand a chance in tribunal or court? Is taking legal action even worth it?  I apologize for posting such a long post, I did not realize that it was going to be this long and I am sincerely very grateful for any advice whatsoever as none of his friends seem to be able to think of a way to help him, hence why I am here."	No
472	"When the children were born, I tried my best to keep them on track with their developmental milestones given to us by the pediatrician.  When I weened my son off of bottles and breastfeeding at 8 months old and began baby food, the grandparents immediately put a stop to it, insisting he would choke or that the sippy cup would hurt his mouth. They continued giving him bottles against my wishes and those of the doctor to the extent that the doctor dismissed the children from her practice.  Both of my children ended up eating pureed foods and using bottles until they went to preschool.  My son wasn't talking when he was supposed to - around 2 years old - so I signed him up for the Early Learning Coalition Early Intervention Head Start program. Their father insisted I was forcing them to grow up too fast, and that he'd eventually just start talking on his own. After seeing the ""baby school"" as we called it, he relented, and my son was considered a preschooler at 2 years old, in the state school system with a structural and safe environment, and speech therapy. I was ecstatic to see their father agreeing to something finally. It turns out that my son is autistic, and this early intervention has helped him enough that it is barely noticeable.  My daughter was a thumb sucker since the womb. When she was born, be I bought her onesies with hand covers on them, and tried to get her to use a pacifier instead. His family undid it all, insisting that if it kept her calm and happy, let her do it until she grows out if it. (She was a colic baby)  She is now 8 years old, needs her mouth reconstructed so her front upper jaw won't be shaped like her thumb anymore, needs braces to straighten her teeth, and STILL sucks her thumb when she sleeps.  I left when my daughter was 7 months old. I tried to take the children with me, but he took them from me and locked them in the room with his parents. I was forced to leave without them. I tried multiple times to get the children back through the courts - even with evidence of domestic violence - but because he had more money, he kept getting primary custody. I was able to get them back for a year, before any court order was in place, and during that time (they were 3 and 4) I got them off the bottles, potty trained them both, and introduced them to solid foods. Getting them into school and social scenarios was a little harder. While my son had been in ""baby school"" since 2 years old, his grandparents wouldn't let him eat the school lunch, and only packed him a pack of crackers and an applesauce, quoting that he wouldn't eat anything else. (My kids, at the time, would eat anything I gave them)  So as my children grew older, they refused to eat anything they were not already introduced to. They would go as far as to act terrified, cry, and even vomit to justify their fear of new or different things. Even today, while I have had progress over the last few years, they will only eat things such as chicken and rice (their dad's family staple) pizza, macaroni and cheese, or fast food chicken nuggets. They don't like hot dogs, hamburgers, any kind of red meat, had never had any fruits or vegetables, or even candies and chocolate. They don't like chocolate milk or soda or tea. They are robbing themselves of their own childhood - and I don't mind some of these, but this is ridiculous. We have a rule that they have to try one new thing every visit. If they don't like it, they don't have to finish it, but they do have to try it. It's worked so far for so many things, but we're still far from even having begun.  My children have never known the need for physical exertion. They have never been exposed to sports at their dad's. They refuse to ride their bikes or scooters or skateboards. They get tired walking to the mailbox. They claim a box of food is too heavy to carry, they expect me to walk across the room to give them something off of the table in front of them. I don't do it - but someone else does. It took a long time to get my son to understand that he cannot bark at, or give orders to, my mother or myself. My daughter is still learning that she has to do things for herself. They don't know how to open packets of food, tie their shoes, brush their hair, fold their clothes...the list goes on. And they refuse to learn when I try to teach them. Because they're so used to everything coming so easily, or someone else doing it for them, if you try to teach them and they don't get it the first time, they get angry with the task and say they'll never do it again.  My daughter is actually exceptionally intelligent. She is making straight A's in school. I'm trying to skip her a grade and teach her things that are more mentally simulating and challenging, but the moment she is required to put effort into it, she refuses to do it, claiming it's too difficult for her. Turns out the county here doesn't skip grades, but they've agreed to change her educational material regardless. Hopefully, this will help her learn to accept hardships as a challenge and not a stopping point.  The children were never taught how to control their emotions, so when something happens, I have to drop everything, grab their face, tell them, ""don't panic, breathe, look at me and nothing else."" ""The worst thing you can do in a high-stress situation is panic. Now look at this situation, and tell me how you would deduce a solution"" I refuse to let them give up on anything they have the potential to enjoy.  It takes time to get through to them, but I take all the time I'm given to prepare them. I find myself often reminding them, ""as your mother, I am not here to do everything for you. I am here to keep you from harm as I guide you to learn to do these things for yourself. That is my job."" And they begin to understand.  They also learned the concept of money from me. It started with bribes as rewards, then fines as punishments - which I don't personally condone, but it taught them the basics of law and finances. If they messed up, I'd ""ticket"" them, and they'd pay. Suddenly they realised they didn't have enough money to buy another of whatever they broke. They learned that we can't ""just go out and buy another one"" anytime something breaks. So they better care of things. They know now when I do or do not have the money, but they trust me when I tell them I'll get what they ask for when I can afford it - so long as they earned it.  The children often say they do not want to return to my house, because it is too hard for them to be with me, because I teach them sports, budgeting, household chores, cooking, logical deduction, stress management... They say they're only given things to play with at their dad's, and the only real interaction they get is when they are given help with homework and food. They're otherwise left to their own devices and their grandparents will just do whatever keeps them quiet and happy so the kids don't have to do for themselves at all.  But my shining moment was when the children tried to do something they know very well how to do - such as warming up food in the microwave - and their grandparents panicked and took away the chance. When the children realized that they were treated like independent and intelligent people with me, and babies at their father's, they started getting more excited about our visits.   But the issue is, their father considers their attempts to care for themselves as ""rebellion"", and they're punished for it, then the children are told to me angry with me. The children are told I do not love them or want them, that I neglect them so they're forced to learn for themselves. Everything I teach them becomes undone. Their lost money is returned, their broken items replaced, their independence stolen from them. Then they go back to their Xbox, their tablets...they get locked away from the world I'm trying to show them.  Since 2013, my visits have been every other weekend, and 2 weeks out of the summer. During 2014-2015, they were withheld from me for 18 months in violation of that order until September of 2015, and now I'm starting all over again. Every attempt I've made to regain custody has been turned on me, and the courts see nothing wrong with how the children are parented by their father's family. I've been denied custody now 3 times.  So...what can I do?  Sorry this is too long."	No
473	"Michigan  A friend of mine recently let his sister-in-law stay with him and his wife when she showed up beaten by her to be ex husband. She has been there for a few days now and brought her 9 month old dog with her.  While they do want to help her they also want to be careful as she hasn't been the most trustworthy person in the past.  I've browsed around this sub enough to know that they will need to be careful that she doesn't establish residency. I've already told him not to accept any money from her under any circumstances.   What I can't find online is how long does she have to stay before she can claim residency and he would have to evict her? What other conditions besides length of stay and paying ""rent"" could she potentially use to try to claim residency?"	No
474	So I've learned that somewhat recently there have been cases in which plaintiffs have won cases against companies which have websites which are not ADA complaint (sites which are usable by the blind/deaf).  My understanding throughout my career (which was probably false) was that only US Government agencies were required to comply with these rules.  I have heard of many cases in which lawyers have sued small businesses over failing to have wheelchair ramps, elevators, etc. in the past but only recently that website operators and mobile app owners are being sued. I am quite concerned that there could be a liability by simply having a website. What's worse is that it seems the DOJ has not even finalized any regulations on the subject.  How can plaintiffs justify damages by not being able to access free websites? I've never understood how a disabled individual could justify damages for being unable to access a restaurant or other business.	No
475	Its a long, complex and boring story so I'll just stick to the key parts.   I'm going to Cancun next week so I decided to purchase a LifeProof Nuud model.   The lady working at Target installed my case, which I thought was normal at the time, come to find out later she wasn't supposed to do that.   Anyways, I get home and then realize that the case wasn't properly tested for bubbles, or any sort of breech in the case. Also, I realize she installed the case incorrectly so that my Silence/Ringer slider was being crushed by the case.   So of course, I get sketched out, I go to Target the next day, the woman who 'helped' me the day before wasn't there but a group of employees decided to try to take the faulty case off.   Some how, they use too much to the point that my screen was cracked &amp; phone bent. Pretty much destroying it. (Didn't even get the case off.)  Now Target refuses to reimburse me for my iPhone, and I'm not sure what to do.   I'm not very rich at all, the phone was probably the most expensive thing I've owned in the past five years, so buying a new one isn't that simple.   Tl;dr: Target lady installed my new case improperly, other target people try to take and off and destroy it in the process. Target won't pay me for the phone.   P.S, sorry for horrible formatting/spelling. It's about 1 in the morning, and I've pretty exhausted from trying to deal with this.	No
476	My boyfriend and I moved into an apartment last year. My father signed the lease as a tenant because our credit basically sucks.  We have paid the rent on time every single month. We are quiet, clean, and overall excellent tenants. Our lease is up on the 1st. My father and I have since had a falling out and he requested to be removed from the lease. We spoke to the rental office and they said that given our history, it would not be a problem to have only my boyfriend and I on the lease, though we may have to go month to month at a higher rate. Sucks, but fine, no real problem.  According to the renewal letter, we have until tomorrow to let them know if we are moving or signing a new lease, otherwise we automatically convert to month to month. We just got a notice on our door that our tenancy is being immediately terminated at the request of my father and we have until September to get out. We have no desire to move and are prepared to continue paying the rent.   I realize the landlord has the right to terminate the tenancy once we convert to month to month, but our lease isn't up yet. But can one tenant terminate the tenancy for all tenants without permission?   We are meeting with the office tomorrow, but we got the notice right as they closed. Any help and information you can provide before then would be appreciated.  We are in Los Angeles County, CA.	No
477	I am 17. I live in California. I often wear a large butt plug to school because it feels good. A teacher found out I do this, gave me detention, and threatened to call my parents. I did nothing wrong. What do I do?	No
478	I was informed by my landlord that they will be starting a construction project to replace all the windows and outside of the building. This will involve scaffolding and potentially plastic covering the whole side of the building. Their projected time line is six months, but every construction project they have had done has taken significantly longer then planned. I struggle with anxiety (see a doctor, take medication) and the thought of having construction right outside my window for six months (potentially longer) straight is exhausting. My home is the place I go to escape all the noise of the world and relax and they are taking that away. They are going to reduce rent by 25% for all days our windows are covered. We just signed a new year long lease a month ago and were told nothing about this project, if we had know, we absolutely would not have stayed another year. I am wondering if we have any legal recourse to at least not have to pay the lease breaking fee, if we choose to move out. I live in Oregon.	No
479	"I live in Southern California, moved back in with my parents about a year ago with my 2 kids. I am a single parent my oldest does have his father in the birth cert. which he was summoned as well youngest does not.

480	I received an order of protection (harassment, not stay-away) and a court date for family court. I cannot afford a lawyer and the public defender only talks to you when you show up to court. So I don't really know what's happening. I didn't do anything and I don't know what I'm charged with. What are the possible outcomes? Can I be convicted of a misdemeanor or felony in family court?	No
481	So some of you may remember my posts. I'm obv not the best writer so I'll try harder here to make it soft on the eyes. This is a long read but quite interesting. Anyone who can help you may be saving a life. I have no where else to turn and I am miserable ridden with pain and anxiety. Here we go.  My ex was a controlling abuser. Emotionally physically and now sexually she abused me. I was young dumb and in love. When we broke up she was flirting with my step brother heavily, this angered me and I had screen shots of the messaged (she left her insta logged in my phone) and I threatened to show her parents what kinda person she is. She then got a RO against me for the reason of me telling her parents. She lied in the entire thing. Making up abuse and criminal charges against me. i.e. She said I was charged with assault 2 never happened. She said I am a felon( I was a felon about a year ago got in reduced per plea deal, the felony was for selling 2 grams of weed to a friend when I was 18. I live in Oregon too, fuck me right?) anyways the order got granted I tried to fight it, i fucked up and missed court. So I am Unable to fight it.   Before she got the order she mentioned she was going to, so I start to compile evidence, I have so much on her. She would blackmail me with self harm daily, I have a picture where she carved my name into her leg with a knife. I mean it she messed me up with all these games. I find in my google drive a video taken from my phone by her, of her touching me and riding me from a POV style. I am dead asleep obviously in the video. This is rape. This is sexual assault. This isn't the first time She would do this. We would fight and she would try and force sex on to me to make me feel better. I would literally have to fight her off. Cuz I obv didn't want it.   I realize I want to wait till after the restraining order blows over to report the crime. Since it is over due to my incompetence, i feel as if it's a good time to report. I report earlier today to the local PD. No lawyer. No counsel. Just you guys. He says he is going to investigate her for invasion of privacy. I think to my self that this is just the start, and when detectives see the video, they will drop the hammer. The policeman doesn't even wanna see it. He just takes my word and calls her. After his talk with her he's dismissing the case. I swear he probably told her what to say. She even admitted in the video it's her. And when I found the video initially before the RO was served I confronted her about it. I asked why did she have sex with me with no consent you know that's rape right? Or something along the lines. She said I woke up during the video. So it was fine. Which is a lie. The officer told me she said we filmed many of our sexual encounters (not many but some) and we would wake up daily at 2 am to have sex. (Another lie) I was bringing all the money in I needed my sleep.   Another bone in this is that someone is messaging her off a private instagram, telling her that I'm Spreading nude photos of her. (Complete lie and not me doing this I'm not gonna risk violating my RO) I feel it's another ex BF one whom she claimed raped her (she lied about it she went to his house and fucked him a week later while dating me :( ) and he's kinda getting some revenge on her for this. I'm very scared I'm gonna get framed for something I didn't do, I swear the cop was more concerned about this instagram ghost then he was about me. He didn't care to watch my clips, and he hung up on me mid sentence.   I'm shocked everyone. I'm in awe. I have to take Xanax (prescribed) to just sleep. The betrayal is more then I can handle. I'm calling a lawyer Monday morning and seeing what he says. In the meantime any idea from you all? I called just the local PD but I feel the sheriffs will take this much more seriously. After pleading with the officer that I'm a victim and this is rape since it's sex with no consent. He said I shoulda woke up and wasn't on anything. He was just bullshitting me the whole time. From what I remember he said he would leave the case open, and have a detective check it out. Thank god. My light isn't done yet. I wanna get a lawyer asap I am Just low in cash. And since I know I'm not Messaging her, spreading her nudes, or getting anyone else to messaged her, I won't be in trouble I hope. But you never know.   She also says she has some voice recordings from When I found out she was flirting hard with my step bro. I was furious. All I said was that I was gonna ruin her life by telling her parents yadadada I was really angry. Never made threats of violence at all or anything really illegal. Just a little annoyance.   So guys what do I do? Be worried about this instagram ghost? Get a good lawyer? Or get legal aid? Very confused ,scared and alone. The cop treated me like a fucking joke. If the genders were reversed here I'd be rotting in jail as I type this. Any and all comments welcome. I love you all truly. This is a very hard time in my life, and if I don't find the strength I will fall.   PS: if I post something about her, not sexual or anything, on my fb, is that gonna get me in trouble? I really wanna post the pic of my name on her leg. Let everyone see how crazy she is.	No
482	Tx- my husband is telling me that in the next 45 mins he is going to kick me out while pregnant and take off with our son and he does not care that I have nowhere to live and no food which I need to maintain nutrition for our child while in the womb...he says he is going to literally drive me somewhere and kick me out of the car and lock the door. I'm so scared, can I call the cops for this or is this legal for him to do?	No
483	I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical. When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas. A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call  b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her.  Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request. I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper). *Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty.  *She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.” *Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them. *I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored. *I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.) *I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy. *My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic. *My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call. When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy. Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.	No
484	Here are the questions I have so far:  1. I am in a field that has mandatory overtime i.e. if someone does not show up for a shift, the previous shift has to work the next shift and possibly the one after that in emergency situations. How would that work if the strike started during or at the end of my shift?  I could not get a straight answer on this from Googling, and I believe it's illegal for me to not stay if the next person does not show up.  2. I understand that the union may fine me for working during a strike. Would that apply if it was due to mandatory overtime?  3. Is there anything else I should know about strikes in healthcare or in general?	No
485	"My (heterosexual) partner and I do not currently have plans to become legally married, but consider ourselves to be and meet all the NJ legal requirements (listed here http://www.nj.gov/health/forms/reg-d7.pdf) of Domestic Partners -- that is, we have a joint bank account, joint insurance, are one another's life insurance beneficiaries, etc. But everything we find regarding DP in NJ refers to those 62 and older, there doesn't seem to be anything on the books for younger couples.  Is there anything available to us at our age (early-mid 30's), or are we just SoL? Do we even NEED anything official, or do we just declare ourselves ""domestic partners"" to whoever listens and that's that? We just want to make sure we're protected in case of accident, emergency, legal issues, etc etc."	No
486	So it all started one sunday morning when me and my family decided to fly to california. My mom is a relatively frugal woman so she tried to get the cheapest tickets for an airline due to us having 6 members including her in the family. So we go to the airport get passed security and find ourselves boarding the plane she boards first due to her having multiple sclerosis. Then the rest of us board. We get a little confused because we got business seating. Theres first class, business then the regular coach. But there we are literally in the back of the plane with no way to push our seats back. And other people start boarding so were literally stuck there for the ride. After that terrible flight were onto another flight to get to cali. My moms bladder is insanely good thank god. Her having no movement of her legs, it gets quite hard as you can imagine. But on this flight she finds herself needing to use he bathroom and what do you know the bathroom isn't handicap accessible they had to hold up a curtain on both sides of the plane so no one could see her and my dad as she used a basic right. I would curse every sentence but im sure thats probably not allowed. So my mom was utterly humiliated and she wants to sue the airline. My question to you lovely people is should she sue? And would it have to be a class action suite of some kind?	No
487	I think some lawyer would benefited just to follow me around. Seriously. I have a series of bad luck despite of trying to be very positive. Just this week alone: 1. The president of a dumpster company trespasses my property. I complained to his worker previously but have no intention to pursue it. He took pictures and denied that his worker broke the driveway. He's going to call another expert into my property even after I said he's trespassing. I have the before and after drivrway pictures btw. His company worth 1 million and the damage only worth a few hundreds bucks. Lol.. 2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up. 3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out. 4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools..  5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it. I've dealt with many more.. IRS double charge mistake (1 year to resolve), real estate agent knowingly sold a property with many violations (didn't disclose mold, structural, etc and inspector was her brother), etc.  Disclosures: Not sue happy, PhD in science,  just wonder what the heck life at 1 am..	No
488	Is there ever an actual legal distinction between these options when filling out forms, and if so, when? What, if any, consequences are there to marking single instead of divorced?  Three examples:  * I imagine that my massage therapist doesn't really need to know I'm divorced, and even if she'd like to know that, I don't think there are any legal consequences for lying on a medical intake form. * On census forms, it maybe makes sense to mark divorced, since the whole point of a census is to gather demographic information, but while by law I am required to fill out the census, I don't see any avenue by which the census would a) know if I lied or b) be able to do anything about it. * On a credit application, I could see it being fraud if I didn't report legal obligations that reduced my available income (alimony, child support), but some states award 'palimony' and you don't have to have ever been married to owe child support, so as long as I disclosed those obligations, it doesn't seem like lying to check single instead of divorced.  I put [WA] for LocationBot, but this is really a general question and I'd be interested in hearing answers to locations other than the US if it differs. And there is no particular situation I'm in prompting me to ask, it's just a combination of:  * plain curiosity. * I'm really sick of something that happened years ago being considered the fourth-most defining characteristic about me (it's often after full name, birthdate, gender). * pedantic irritation about how it's always a radio button instead of a check list even though I am technically both single because I'm not married and divorced because I used to be married, and if I were to re-marry, I would be both married and divorced and it would still be a radio button, unless by dint of getting re-married I am somehow magically 'un-divorced' in the eyes of the form gods.

489	My apartment is doing some exterior construction on my side of the building. They've been boarding up windows starting at the opposite end of the building, working their way towards my apartment. Yesterday, they boarded up the bedroom window. My apartment only has two windows, both of which are on the same wall. There is only one exit, into the interior hall on the opposite side of the windows. (Crappy MS Paint drawing http://i.imgur.com/5spjBNB.png)  My question is that is it legal to board up the only means emergency exit? I'm guessing the second window will be boarded up next week, completely blocking me into my apartment. Not only is this a huge inconvenience, but it does not seem safe.   Any help is appreciated!	No
490	I apologize in advance for this long post. I'm located in North Carolina and am a student at a public university. When I transferred in, I applied for on-campus housing but was told that due to the extensive wait list I most likely would not get a room. So I looked for an apartment. I met two people who needed another roommate because theirs was moving out. I signed the lease the morning of July 21st, and later that day I got an email from campus housing after 5:00pm notifying me that I had been assigned to on-campus housing. I called the housing office on Monday and was told that all I needed to do was send them a copy of my lease and it would be taken care of. I did so, and heard nothing. I went into the office yesterday to make sure everything was taken care of. The lady at the front desk admitted to me that she looked at the email and forgot about it, admitting that she didn't do her job. I explained the situation and was told that the date on my lease was August 1st, I already knew about my housing assignment and they were going to charge me a $3,000 cancellation fee, half of the entire years rent for half of a dorm room. I explained that since it was a sublease, I was simply added to the lease and I signed it on the 21st. I showed the people in the housing office texts that I had signed the lease on the 21st but they said that they needed something official from the apartment complex. I went to the complex and explained my situation and they printed out an email exchange with their official email on it that proved that I had started the process and signed the lease on the 1st. I took that over to university housing and they said that the cancellation fee would be waived based on this. I went online to cancel my housing and got an email asking for proof that I had already signed the lease by the time that my on-campus housing assignment was available.  At this point I believe I'm being given the run around by the campus housing to get me to pay the fee. Do I need a lawyer to contest this?	No
491	My friend is going through a contentious divorce right now. She has asked me to give a deposition and possibly testify for her. I really want to, but have an underlying concern holding me back.   They both have a history if drug use, and I have smoked pot with both of them in the past. The things she wants me to testify about have nothing to do with drugs, so I guess my question rests with the likelihood that I would be questioned about my own drug use and what the consequences would be. Is it possible that testifying to that could mess up job, adoption, or similar prospects for myself down the line? Also, my friend seems to think I might get drug tested for agreeing to be a witness. Is that right? I really just want a clear understanding of what I'm getting into if I agree to do this.    Do they drug test witnesses in situations like this?	No
492	"I am in the process of gathering information to find an attorney to bring this up with, and I can't figure out what type of firm this fall under.  I am located in Oklahoma, the company I have an issue with is located in Pittsburg, PA, and has servers located in Costa Rica.  The developer in question I believe is also located in the new england area.  The issue involves an online game that has a MLM type incentive structure, you get returns based on the people under you. It also has a vibrant economy that has real world implications as to results of some games/minigames which are promised to be ""fair"" and ""random"".   Issue 1: The lead developer changed the incentive structure and cut the earnings from downstream in half.  He justified this as saying it prevents people trying to steal downstreams by profit sharing, as now he ""automatically"" gives the profit sharing back to the downstream. Even though some people did not profit share and so realized a very real 50% or more cut in income.  Issue 2: Over the past few years the developer has made many statements of things he would ""never do/wont happen"" that were then used to make economic choices, but then he does them a few months/a year later to the economic detriment of those who took actions based on his statements. Given that the lead developer and employees have not changed in this time period, it's felt he's still liable for the contradiction.  Issue 3: The lead developer has made several statements about the fairness/programming of some of the minigames in this game, that are either provably false, or probabilisticaly unlikely to be true, that has similar economic damage. While randomness is hard to prove/disprove, deviations can be shown on results in-game vs an out of game programmed simulation with the same ""rules"".  So my questions are:   1. What type of firm should i be looking for?  Civil litigation? Fraud?    2. What jurisdiction am I looking at/will i need to get a national/out of state firm or is it not an entire waste of time to check in-state consultations first?  Sorry if this just seems so basic, I just don't want to be wasting peoples time barking up the wrong tree. Thank you for the help!"	No
493	My apartment recently received a letter from the water utility company that we were past due and the water was about to be shut off. We were quite confused as we had never paid the water bill in the years that we had lived there and had never had a problem with this before. After reviewing our lease and speaking with our Landlord we have some questions regarding our rights and responsibilities in this situation. Here is a brief rundown of what is going on:  We do not have individual meters going into our apartment building. It is one master meter for a few units.  The property management company changed hands about a year ago. The previous management company was paying the water bill and not billing us.  The new management company paid the past due water bill after this came to light and now wants to charge us for all the water bills retroactively.  The landlord wants to divide the water bill equally between the units since there is no way to determine how much each unit is using individually. I don't like this as I would not want to potentially pay more if my neighbors are using more than me.  In our lease it states that we must pay for all utilities for the unit. However, it does not state anything about splitting the water bill equally between units or how the bills are determined.  The landlord is paying the electric bills for the common area and we are not required to split those bills between the units.  Since nothing is in writing and it is very vague what happens if I pay my part of the bill but my neighbors do not? Can the landlord come after me for the rest of it?  In conclusion, I have no problem with paying my dues, but I don't want to be on the hook for the water that my neighbors are using. What are my rights in this situation? Thanks!	No
494	Hey guys!  I live in Oklahoma, I purchased a car off eBay from a classified ad in New Hampshire. I used PayPal for the deposit $500, and a check for the rest of the $12,000.   The company filed chapter 11, then converted to a chapter 7. I have filed a creditor claim with the NH Bankruptcy court.   Car insurance won't help, not a theft. eBay doesn't protect classified ads. Bank can't help, it isn't considered check fraud. Any advice on getting my money back?	No
495	"I'm not sure if this question is acceptable in this subreddit. So I will ask my question, and if people suggest hiring a lawyer, then I request advice on how to find the right type of lawyer for my situation.   After graduating from college, I spent six months working on a startup which was unsuccessful. Then I began searching for a job, and I put my accomplishments during my startup on my resume. After six months of job searching, I received my first job offer with a company in the same field as my startup, but it's a 3-month consulting agreement. The CTO of the company said if it's a good fit I will be offered a full-time position afterward. I read the consulting agreement and analyzed it with a plagiarism checker. I discovered over 90% of the contract came from two online contracts, and one major difference I found was the removal of a phrase in a statement. To summarize the statement, the online contract says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc, that I develop while performing my services under this agreement"". The contract I received does not have the last phrase so the statement says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc."".  I spoke with the CTO about this, and he said I could make changes to the contract, and they would consider it. At the moment, I had doubt in negotiating and told him I sought a permanent position. So I declined the offer. A week later I regretted not negotiating and asked for another opportunity. He said they might give me another opportunity, but they will be unable to change the wording of the contract. If I sign the contract, is it possible that I will give them rights to all my accomplishments I achieved during my startup?  Let me know if you need additional information. I am on the fence about hiring an attorney/lawyer to help me with my situation, but I would like to get advice from this subreddit first. Thanks."	No
496	In 2012 my mother had went to the hospital due to her lymph nodes under her arms being swollen. Two years later she calls me to say she has Hodgkin's lymphoma. She lives 3 states away, is a drug addict, her exact location is unknown, and probably hasn't gotten proper treatment. The number she had is disconnected, my brother has sent her packages and pictures without any reply. My brother and I haven't heard from her since 2015. It wasn't unusual to go without hearing from her for a few months, but it's been two years. I'm wondering if there is any way to find out if she has passed.	No
497	Location: Pennsylvania, US.  Short version: I want to know whether [this section of my lease](http://imgur.com/a/onNqz) would actually hold up in court, because a lot of my property was damaged as a result of water seeping into my basement room.  Longer version:  I rented out a bedroom in the basement of an old duplex. The duplex and the others in its complex were new acquisitions by the property group that I'm renting from, and are kind of fixer-uppers, to put it nicely. I understand that the property group likely doesn't have the money to fix everything immediately after buying these properties, and have asked little of them in terms of maintenance - I try not to bug them unless something is a big problem.  There are two rooms in the basement, my room and a laundry room. The laundry room leaks whenever someone on the ground floor takes a shower, and that is pretty much the only thing that I asked my landlords to address. They sent someone to try to fix it a couple of times, but to no avail. They also placed a dehumidifier in the laundry room. In contrast, my room surprisingly did not have any moisture problems for much of the year, despite the floor being warped from what looked like water damage (which I noted in my security deposit form). That is, until a month or so ago, when I began to notice that the top of my bed would occasionally feel very slightly damp. I didn't think much of it, and didn't mention it to my landlords; it wasn't a big enough of a problem that I didn't mind living with it for the two months remaining on my lease, and I doubted that they would be able to do anything about it anyway. Fast forward to about a week ago, when I happened to look under my bed, and I discovered that there had formed a pretty significant mold problem. It had infested my bed frame, my mattress, and the bottoms of all of my dressers, as well as some clothes that were in the bottom drawers of the dressers, and some other smaller odds and ends.  I filed a claim with my renter's insurance about a week ago, informed my landlords of the situation, and spoke with the renter's insurance agency again today, and they said that they don't cover that sort of damage, and that generally this sort of thing would be my landlords' responsibility. I looked over my lease, and found [this section](http://imgur.com/a/onNqz) of it that specifically indemnifies them of responsibility for this kind of damage. Is that something that would hold up in court? It seems to me like it shouldn't, since they rented an apartment to me that clearly had had a history of water seepage based on the damage to the floor. I estimate that there's about $1500 in damage to my property, and would very much like to avoid all of that falling on me.  As a follow-up question: I signed another lease with the same property group for another duplex in the same complex for next year starting this month, before all of this started unfolding. It's for another basement room, and I'm worried about the same thing happening. If I discover moisture in the next room, is that enough legal ground to declare the room uninhabitable and get out of the lease?  Thank you very much for your time and expertise.	No
498	Long story short, he has had the same job 2-ish years, has had it set up to be withdrawn from his paycheck automatically, and for some reason it's not deducted in full, and we have had to constantly pay the $6 or some odd low denomination manually as we get notices... This alone is infuriating.  We also receive constant notices from the DMV about his license being revoked due to lack of payment despite not being late and paying in full, monthly.   There seems to be an endless loop of no one to call and miscommunication but it reoccurs monthly or every three months, rinse and repeat. he is at the pint of just paying whatever comes in, and that I can't really get behind. I understand he is just tired of fighting, but really, what should I have him do to sort this out and get these letters, the run around and the miss communication to stop?	No
499	I am wondering whether my partner and I have the right for one of us to be present during an inspection from our landlord. We are only 2.5 months into our year lease and our landlords provided us with written notification that they would be conducting an inspection at 2pm 8/2, when both my partner and I will be at work. The notice they provided was vague as to why an inspection was being conducted. We have recently emailed them about fixing the deadbolt to the outside door to our shared stairwell (which they were alerted to over a month ago) and about installing an AC unit (which was supposed to be done prior to our move-in per the lease) and have not received any response. The combination of the lack of response, failure to fix the deadbolt in a timely manner, and now a notice of inspection is making us feel wary.	No
500	"A little backstory... I Dated this girl i thought i liked for a few months... ended up being a horrible, manipulative, compulsive lying, sending nudes to her other baby while she lived with me, bitch. Had sex a lot unprotected, i know im an idiot. Didnt bother to ask if she was on any BC.. assumed she was cause she already has one kid. At one point she was really pushing to have a kid with me. Its not that im scared of being a father, well yes i kinda am, i just dont want anything to do at all with her. I despise her. I could write 5 more pages about just how awful she is.. so i broke up with her back in late February or early March cant remember exactly. Blocked all communications with her but shes  persistent and emailed me.. she had been saying she was pregnant but of course i didnt believe her since she said she was pregnant while we were dating and had an abortion on a fuckin sunday at planned parenthood.. she obvioulsy thinks im stupid which pisses me off to no end. So she just sent me a few photos basically confirming she is in fact pregnant.. literally makes me sick to my stomach. The fucked up thing is i have no idea where she lives right now.. shes from cali and has friends out there so that'd be my guess but shes saying she lives in florida with her ""friend"".. im so lost, scared,angry idk what to do.. any advice would be great.. ill try to post pics still fairly new to reddit.."

501	We moved into an apartment in the middle of summer and on the second day I received a call from maintainance stating that they knew the AC was broken but they were not sure if the office had let us know but they were working on it. It has not been a week and 3 days and still, no AC. In addition to the AC our screen door is also broken, so air flow has been minimal. We have a upstairs room with a  vaulted ceiling and it has been a miserable sauna. What can I do?	No

503	About a year ago, I moved in with my husband, who already lived at the apartment complex he was at for a year with two other roommates by the time I moved in. We recently got our own place, and just received the final invoice from the old apartment.   Unfortunately, the move out process was a bitch. My husband and I somehow got stuck cleaning not just the entire common room, but both of our roommates rooms after they had all of their shit out (vacuuming, dusting, etc). During this, we noticed our one roommate's carpet had a huge black circle from where he sat at his desk with shoes on. We tried to clean it as best as we could, but it was still pretty bad. Lo and behold, the invoice had a $1000 carpet replacement charge. We're still working on contacting the apartment for more details as to what specifically caused that charge, but I'm anticipating it being having to replace our one roommate's apartment, and subsequently replaced all of the carpeting in the apartment.   If the carpet replacement was due to an irreparable stain in one bedroom, how can the other people go about not getting screwed over financially? While I'm referring to my husband and I as well as our other roomie that didn't cause the stain, I'm especially concerned for us since they'll want to split the cost four ways, meaning my husband and I will have to dish out half of the cost of replacement for another roommate's mess, while he only pays 1/4th of the cost.   I have a post-cleaning video of the common area and our bedroom, where the carpets look just fine, but nothing of the other two roommate's rooms.   I'm not sure how to approach this situation. Any advice would be appreciated!	No
504	Quick question: we received a letter from the real estate company that manages our rental house. It stated that we are responsible for the landscaping of our house per our lease (true) and that we haven't been maintaining it (untrue).    So, since they've warned us about this before and they've been receiving complaints, they're sending out landscape themselves (the week of 7/31, the day after we received the letter) and billing us. The problem is, they haven't warned us, this is literally the first I've ever heard from the guy who wrote the letter.   A tree came down a month or two ago in front of the house, so I'd had an extensive back and forth with the property manager (someone else) and they did have the tree removed. Nothing about this issue was mentioned.   I sent an email yesterday disputing that the  landscaping wasn't being maintained and that we had previously been contacted about this. I told him we weren't going to be financially responsible for landscapers they hire without further (or any) communication.   I'm aware standards for this kind of thing are subjective, but the lawn is mowed every week or two and the hedges and plants are contained if not meticulously manicured. They claimed they've gotten many complaints. Maybe they have, but we haven't gotten any.   So anyway, they clearly sent landscapers out today, less than 24 hours after we got the letter, which is a violation of the lease itself. There was no response to my email.  Any suggestions about my next move? I expect to get a bill from the realty office. I do not intend to pay it.	No
505	I know, I know. We (my boyfriend and I)should have called the police. We took his information and thought that was enough. We called the police and they told us that since we both left there scene there is little we can do now. They informed us that if there is an agreement made on site it becomes a civil matter.  We have pictures of the damage, of him in the driver's seat of a car that doesn't belong to him without a license. We took his information but he didn't take ours.  It seems like this is a fairly common thing to do, just take the other person's information and charge them with the bill, I've done it before. There has to be something we can do in the case of him backing out of this verbal agreement. Any advice is appreciated.	No
506	More info: property and divorce is in TX. Squatters rights are strong here.  Decree was not signed by him, but the judge approved it anyway due to abuse. Language is slightly ambiguous around timeframe to refi. No deed to secure assumption was drawn or filed, but a general warranty deed was.   A criminal and 2 family lawyers have said I am liable  with no option to reclaim the house or force ex to refinance and must wait him out. I am unable to purchase property or be approved for a loan or line of credit for any amount (at least not without APR north of 25 if approved at all) and he has dropped my credit score by 200+ points.   Is there any hope of filing a civil suit for breach of contract, pain and suffering due to damages on my credit history and major life impact, or anything to that effect? I just want to be completely separated from him. I don't even want the house or the money, although if he makes me drag him to court for months I'll fight for it. I've never asked for a dime. Only asked him to sell (and keep the $70K+ profit!) or refinance on his own. He refuses. It's been 7 years.   Help! I'm desperate!!!!	No
507	In 2005 I had a child with my Ex -- things were not very smooth in the custody process. My ex had primary custody of my daughter up until about 2012 when the state removed the children (she had other children with another father later on) from her due to allegations of abuse and neglect.  In 2012 I was granted sole custody and have maintained sole custody since. The child abuse allegations never came to fruition and she ended up getting all her children back aside from my daughter who is now 12 years old.  My daughter has consistently seen a therapist throughout the years and still suffers from PTSD and has on multiple occasions told the therapist about the abuse she endured (mostly at the hand of my Ex's current husband). Every therapist that she has seen (they have changed as we moved from Montana to St. Louis for a year and then again moved to Colorado about 2 years ago -- all work related moves), all agree that it's in the best interest for my daughter to stay in my custody.  There is a parenting plan in place currently that allows for phone contact. These phone conversations tend to last no more than 10-15 seconds as my daughter has no interest or desire to talk to or be with her biological mother, and in fact gets anxiety from having to have any communication at all.  I have now received certified documents showing that her biological mother is filing a motion to amend a final parenting plan that includes giving her full custody of my daughter, as well as seeking attorney fee compensation, with very little visitation granted to me.  My current plans are to get an attorney here in CO and have the case transferred here as she (my daughter) is a resident here, and has not lived in MT (where this all originally started) in almost 4 years.  Anyone with experience in this kind of situation? How high are the chances that the mother gets what she's seeking?  Asking here, because it's going to take some time to speak with an attorney directly as the weekend approaches and I'm hoping to ease my anxiety.  Thanks!	No
508	I could really use some advice. I'm in Texas and am attempting divorce my abusive husband. We have been married for 12 years and have a six year old daughter together. I moved out of our family home 8 or 9 months ago, and have been seeing someone else during that time. In the past he has been physically violent, but I never filed charges as he always showed remorse. I regret that now. He assaulted me when I told him I was leaving and the police were called, but they did not offer to press charges and I did not think to ask. He has assaulted me since then as well as assaulting my current boyfriend. I went and spoke to the D.A.'s office multiple times about getting a protective order (once with a bruise on my body he caused) but they stated that since he and I are still married and we have a kid together they thought it best to deny. I have had to get a criminal trespassing warning for my home, which local officers refused to give for a long time. I have been told by local authorities that I am getting what I deserve for cheating because were still married. My boyfriend pressed charges the second time he was assaulted, but the process seems to have stopped moving forward months ago. Nothing ever came of it and an officer just told him he should stop seeing me. I officially filed for divorce on February 21st of this year pro se as I could not afford a retainer fee. My husband counter petitioned and I ended up being bullied into signing over majority custody of our daughter to him, which I regret bc he is not a stable parent. At the time I was made to believe I had no choice, but time has proven that he makes poor choices for her emotional well being and she is in therapy. I am now paying approximately 45% of my monthly income, which is already small to him in child support, insurance for her, daycare for her, and other medical fees monthly. He makes good money and can easily sustain everything need for her without my extra payments. I am now on the verge of being homeless because even though I work full time and clean houses on the side I still don't make enough to cover rent, etc once my payments to him come out. Since November of last year he has stalked, threatened, cyber stalked (getting into all of my accounts constantly bc he works it security and changing info, etc) read all of my text messages, constantly hacked in and wiped/locked out my phone through google account manager, etc, and has begun to hack into my work's it network to post inappropriate pictures of me etc for all my coworkers to see. He refuses to give me a divorce now on top of it and constantly breaks the morality clause in our custody agreement. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. I feel like no authorities will listen to me and he never stops. I know that this post was very very long. I hope that someone can please help. This has been a total nightmare and I have no one to turn to. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading!	No
509	Two of my friends recently ended an 8 year relationship. Partner A was away on work for a few months, partner B decided to start a new relationship/fuck whoever they wanted. They break up, and Partner A comes home to her world in a whirlwind of emotions and crazy lesbian bullshit. Their lease is not up until march, and Partner A doesn't want to fuck over Partner B. They are both on the lease and sharing a bedroom until further notice. Any advice on how to go through breaking the lease and/or dividing up almost a decades worth of cohabitation?	No
510	I live in PA, my house is on a corner lot. My deed states that a ten foot wide roadway must be accessible for my two neighbors next to me to access their property located at the back of my property. It is my land on the deed. One can I remove this from my deed so I can build a garage or shed? Two, the person next to me is not providing access to their next door neighbor which it states in my deed could this help? There is a gate to my neighbor’s yard but I have never seen anyone use the gate. Please help if you can, and thanks in advance.	No
511	"Currently, I live with my bf who owns 2 vehicles. Unfortunately, our apartment complex only allows one parking spot per person living in the apartment. I have 1 car and my boyfriend has 2 which obviously leaves us one space short. The next part of the story is super important, at the time of move in and multiple times afterwards (via email as well as verbal) the apartment complex I currently live in told us that the street across from our apartment is a public street meaning that we could park our extra vehicle on that street without paying for an additional spot. That was what we thought was the end of that. Additionally, at least 20-30 cars park on this street daily as spill over from our complex.  My boyfriend primarily uses one car over the other; however, both cars have been used throughout the 8 months we have lived there and we have never had issues up until this point.   A little bit of background on a separate incident but related in the sense that the same officer has issued all the tickets to the vehicle in question:  On 12/16/2016 my boyfriend received a parking ticket for being ""more than 12 inches away from the curb"". Not really thinking to take a picture of the vehicle before moving it, accepted the ticket and paid the appropriate fee.  Back to the current story:  After running into my neighbors and talking to them about what happened everyone I talked to had similar stories! I figured ""I guess this is how the police deal with their time in a sleepy town and while annoying parking tickets are apart of life"". I sent an email to my leasing office explaining the situation and the leasing office sent a reply saying their policies are their policies and to their understanding we are legally allowed to park on that street. I still have a copy of this email for my own records.  On 06/08/2017 we received a warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location (I do have this warning but it is not with me. I can upload this ticket late if need be). So not thinking much of it, my boyfriend moved the vehicle a couple of streets over with additional public parking(which I pass on my way to work everyday and can visually see the windshield and would noticed any ticket or warning).  On 06/29/2017 on my way to work I noticed that the car was not in it's normal ""spot"" which I check daily on my way to work. I sincerely make it a point to check everyday as we almost missed the deadline to pay for the first ticket due not seeing the ticket. I frantically call my boyfriend and explain whats going on. At first we thought the car had been stolen but after looking online realized it could have been towed. We contacted the local tow company and sure enough that was the case.  We promptly went to go retrieve the car; however; because the police department was the one who issued the tow, we could not retrieve the car until we have payed the associated fees with the police department. Great. At this point we were livid as we had never received any notification that car was going to be towed.   We go to the police department and to our utter shock there were apparently 2 outstanding parking tickets for ""parking without permission on public property"" (WTF does that even mean?!?!) and that we had received ANOTHER warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location. Outraged we said we were never notified of the tickets or the second warning to move the vehicle (The tickets are bright pink and I visually check the windshield daily and would have noticed these tickets/warning) and would be appealing them but unfortunately we were told we had to pay the additional associated fees if we wanted to retrieve the car from the impound lot. Additionally, we stated we had moved the vehicle after the first ""dead"" vehicle warning so clearly it was not a dead vehicle. The clerk stated all she could do was give us the tickets and pay the fee but if we wanted to appeal the tickets we would have to submit additional paperwork (we have the paperwork and are currently filling it out).   We then retrieved the car which had NO PARKING TICKETS ON THE WINDSHEILD and after getting home a reviewing the tickets realized ALL THE TICKETS WERE ISSUED BY THE SAME OFFICER!!! Including the first parking tickets we received in December.  I have no clue if what is going on is illegal or not and I am just really looking for advice on how to move forward. This situation does not read right to me and after everything is all said and done (and if we end up having to pay the tickets) we will have sunk 1k into this whole ordeal.  I can't help but to feel we were specifically targeted as about 20-30 people park on the street across from our complex all the time and never get towed. My head is spinning and the idea that a police officer can get away with what has happened sickens. I'm also having a hard time stomaching a 1k loss without any idea on how to prevent it in the future as my bf was about to go to college and we had to dip into that money to cover this expense.   /r/legaladvice please help. What can I do? Is this legal? Should I file a complaint against the police officer?"	No

513	Whenever I go to my orthodontist, they have a bunch of dentistry chairs in the back so each patient is getting treated side by side with no privacy. In this same room, there's a big television in the middle with patient's names, reason for visit, treatment for the visit, who they're seeing, appointment time, et cetera. This seems to me like a very clear violation of the law. Am I correct in thinking this?	No
514	I am a college student living in Pittsburgh for the summer.  My lease for the school year starts on August 1st, but I have been here for two months on a short lease, working for the summer.  When I found the place, I signed the lease (the landlord had told the current tenant that he could feel free to find other people to sign the lease to make the cost cheaper if he wanted), and then a week or so later, the landlord contacted me asking for me to fill out a rental application, as well as submit $25 for a background check.  I was confused as to why this was necessary, and asked him why I needed to pay more money if I'd already signed the lease.  He responded a little while later, in an email I didn't even see until just now, telling me this:   &gt;Having a rental application on file is a matter of protocol for anyone living in our apartments, and it is mandatory that i raun [sic] a background and credit check in case you are wanted in any of the fifty states or on some kind of terrorr [sic] watch list or something.  You have signed Manuael's [sic] lease, but as owner I hold the primary lease to the place, and if you have anything in your background untoward or a potential threat, I am obliged to know that.  &gt;As for a complaint about the processing cost, you are summer subletting a semi-furnished place for about $350-400 that this fall will rent for $750, so I would hope you would appreciate that rather than making such a strident complaint about a VERY minor sum.  We do our best to provide quality housing, but at the same time there are rules Ihave [sic] to follow.  The guy is, as you might have been able to tell, a bit of a condescending asshole.  Earlier in the month, we had our ceiling falling apart due to rain, and he couldn't be bothered to care about the fact that plaster was falling down in our living room, and wouldn't get it fixed for the longest time, but that's a whole separate matter entirely.  **Ultimately, my question is:**  Am I under any sort of legal obligation to fill out a rental application and pay for a background check if I have already signed the lease and will be moving out in nine days? $25 is not a lot of money at all, but at this point, with how our landlord has treated us during the past month and a half, I'd really prefer not to pay anything extra if I don't have to.  This was a bit of a long-winded post for such a simple question, but if anyone knows the PA laws about this, I'd appreciate an answer. Thanks!	No
515	Hello all,  A little back story, my grandfather purchased a car for me in his name... I made the payments, it was insured in my name ETC.  He died last November, and my mother never had took any of the paperwork down to the bank after he died.. Fast forward to last Wednesday i went and made my payment like normal, except later that evening there was a tow truck outside of my house towing my car...  The tow truck driver said that they had been looking for the car for months etc..   What should i do? I have been told that we are able to sue BB&amp;T because they shouldn't have been taking payment for the car once it was out for repo, I am only looking to be able to finish paying for the car as there is less than 2k owed on the car....   Thanks in advance!	No
516	I'm a Canadian citizen studying in the UK. I'd like to come back to Canada (and more specifically to Quebec -- I don't know if this makes a legal difference) in a few years (2-4) with my girlfriend, who is a British citizen. I'm under the impression that we could both benefit the legal advantages of being married (which I'd be happy to know more about; I'm thinking visa, scholarships, etc.), but we don't have the money or time to organise a wedding (my girlfriend's parents live in Australia).  Q: Can we get married now (in secret) and get married once more (not religiously) when we arrive in Canada?	No
517	"Hi folks,  I was excited to see that Ryuichi Sakamoto is having a short film contest where you make a short film that utilizes songs from his new album, and three winners get money, compositions to use in future films, filmmaking advisor services, a spot on the blu-ray version of the album, among other things.  But in the submission guidelines, there is this bullet point:  &gt;Upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the submitted work in any media form for any purpose. **Our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, adapt, transmit, demonstrate, create derivative work, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion.** Furthermore, upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company and any affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the name(s), nick name(s), and biography of the filmmaker in any media form for any purpose.

The filmmaker must represent and warrant the lack of a third party contract which may interfere with the licensed rights above.  Is this (especially what I bolded) as sinister as it sounds? A mere submission means that a third party can create derivative work based on submitted work? ""Sorry, you lost, so we don't have to pay you, but we can spin your idea into a feature film or music video of our own production at any time.""  Am I misreading this and it's actually standard? Or it's standard anyway? Or it's an overzealous lawyer just covering themselves in case someone wins and then sees a better offer elsewhere? Er, covering themselves in case they happen to make something similar to a generic submission in the future so no one can try to pull a Creed situation?   Thanks"	No
518	"There's a lot of craziness going on in regards to housing in Portland right now. Particularly with building companies offering large cash sums to home owners with large lots, demolishing the existing home, subdividing the lot, and then building smaller houses on them.   My parents' neighborhood wanted to prevent this from happening (most of the homes sit on large lots and the neighborhood has a very distinctive look they want to ""preserve"" by preventing these new construction projects). So one woman spear headed a campaign to get the area designated as a historic neighborhood (I don't know how or why this prevents the whole subdividing thing so I can't provide much more info than this). My parent's and their next-door neighbors were both strongly against this idea and refused to sign some sort of petition that was going to be presented to whoever makes the decision about historic neighborhoods.  The designation attempt failed, and the woman who spearheaded the campaign places a lot of blame on my parents and their refusal to sign the petition. There is now a lot of bad blood between them.  My parents and the next-door neighbors were actually approached a few years back by the historical society about possibly placing their homes on the registry. They turned the opportunity down because being placed on the historic registry creates a lot of red tape should you ever want to remodel, or even just plant trees in your front yard, down the line. This is the main reason why they were against asking for a historic neighbourhood designation.  This same woman is now trying to create an HOA in order to try and prevent the whole subdividing issue.   Again, my parents and their next-door neighbors want no part of it. They've both lived in their homes for decades, are about to retire, and don't have any complaints about the types of things HOA's usually seek to fix. They don't want to have to deal with the headache of an HOA. The rest of the neighborhood supports the idea, though.  They recently received an email from the woman spearheading the idea that according to the lawyer the attempted HOA has hired, should the HOA actually be created, my parents will be forced to participate in it. They're obviously upset by this.  This doesn't seem right to all of us. I would think that their ability to not join would be ""grandfathered in"" for lack of a better word since they purchased their home long before the HOA was created.   They've been warned that should they try and get around the HOA situation by not following the rules they create or by not paying dues, a lien will be placed on their home.  Long story short- would they legally have to pay dues and follow all the rules the HOA creates or is this woman so full of shit that her eyes might as well be brown?"	No
519	My cousin is currently going through a psychotic break.  He has relapsed on drugs and alcohol since his best friend over dosed last year,  and has completely lost his mind.  He has admitted to being back on crack and drinking to the point of black out, but his actions also point to meth use.    He went missing for 4 days,  his sponsor went to his apartment  to find everything smashed,  all his money and belongings left behind and located him wandering the streets.  He was able to get him into a hospital but after giving him ativan, was released.    I want to make the drive from Ottawa to try and get him admitted,  but what are my chances of them actually keeping him against his will? Is there anything I can legally do with him being 40?	No
520	"Hi guys,  Purchased my first home in November that was supposedly remodeled and have been hit with non-stop issues. Not sure if I have a litigation case against the sellers, inspector or both. Here are some of the issues I've had the deal with in the span of about 8 months:  - Major amount of exposed Asbestos in attic. Seller denied knowing (despite contractor saying it had been there a while) and inspector claimed ""no access to attic"" despite easy access all around the premises both inside and outside. 10k to clean up.  - Plumbing issues. The drainage leading to sewer is so rooted I had to pay to unclog the toilets twice (clear out, which cost 1k each time) and then install a device to help with roots which was 4k.   - Central air. The whole system setup was just unbelievably haphazard.  3 ton unit outside with 2 .5 coil (contractor who I hired to fix everything said had never seen this before). It also was setup so that the emergency drainage duct was being used rather than primary and had gotten so bad that I was a few weeks away from water coming through the ceiling of the house. Inspector said in report system was fine. 4k to fix configuration.   The selling agent, sellers, and inspector have gone MIA and would really like to know if I have a case here. I specifically bought a home that was remodeled under the notion I wouldn't have to put significant amount of money into it, at least early on. It's basically been the exact opposite and has become a project home, with over 20k spent in fixes within 8 months of ownership.  Do I have options?   Thank you."	No
521	This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. My location is Mississippi. First let me give you the facts. I graduated high school in 2014. My junior and senior year of high school I had a teacher that I hit it off with. Throughout high school I was a very good student, had a 31 on my ACT, numerous scholarship offers, and 3 nominations from my congressmen for the United States Naval Academy. About Christmas time of my senior year, this 32 year old female teacher and I exchanged phone numbers and began texting occasionally. By two weeks before graduation, there were sexually explicit texts being sent. I visited her house at her request twice before graduation. I graduated on a Friday, and on saturday night as a 17 year old I was at her house, she provided me alcohol and we first had sex. We did this same thing a couple more times before I turned 18 in June. By this point I was so smitten by her that I had given up every scholarship and college opportunity I had.  We continued our relationship and she convinced me out of going to school and into the workforce as soon as possible, as well as convinced me to marry her and have a child as soon as possible. In July of 2015 we married. In September of 2016 after many months of trying, she became pregnant, and abruptly moved out without telling me where she was going. I held on for almost a year hoping that she would come back and that we could be a family.   The child was born in May. I was allowed to see her a couple of times until my then wife decided that I couldnt see her again until I agreed to her custody terms. I refused and consulted with a lawyer to figure out my options and within 2 weeks I was served at fault papers which falsely accused me of being an abusive alcoholic (I was under 21 the entire marriage, so any alcohol I had was provided by her) and she was suing for full custody as well as the meager possesions ive managed to put together since she left in October of last year.  after being served those papers is when it finally clicked for me that my family was right. She manipulated me into marrying her and having a child with her. She has even openly admitted to only marrying her first husband because she wanted a child.  At this point, I have a 3 month old daughter that I love dearly and she is keeping away from me, as well as my former teacher pursuing an at fault divorce for full custody. I think she is expecting me to just give in as I have over the past three years.   I want full custody of my child to at least be able to regulate her being around her insane and manipulative mother. I also am considering pressing seperate civil as well as legal charges against the mother for the manipulation and pain that has been a result of this, in order to get custody as well as secure the future of my daughter. My-ex wife has already ruined my life, I cant let this ruin my daughters as well.  My lawyer seems to think I could have a case against her, but he said he cant think of a cause of action for it. By some of the other things he said, it kinda seemed to me like this case might end up being more work than he bargained for. I dont know. Am I out of luck due to a dumb decision while I was in high school, or do I need to find another lawyer that could push ahead with my case, or at least suggest a cause of action for him?  I dont want to ever see my ex-wife again, but I also dont want her to do the same thing to anyone else, and most importantly, I want to be able to see my daughter and provide her a life away from the crazy that is her mother.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. This has been a tough time and I dont know which way is up and which way is down.	No
522	"Context:    My coworker (we'll call him Steve) has a 17 year old son. Steve's neighbor is a pretty old crotchety guy (We'll call him OCG) and likes to make noise complaints. OCG even said so to Steve when Steve first moved in. OCG complained to Steve once in person and Steve says to let him know any time he has any problems with noise so he may deal with his son (who may be loud at times because he is 17 years old). He also happens to mention he works at a medium sized company in town (We'll call it McCompany). OCG rents from the property management department in McCompany. Steve does not work in this department, however.     The next time OCG decides to complain he goes to the property management department of McCompany and asks the manager to mention this to Steve through his employer connections. Steve tells this to me because he found it weird. Steve also finds out that OCG had tried to file a complaint with the police.   What Happened Today:  OCG decided to visit McCompany's HR department, introduced himself as Steve's neighbor and asked where Steve works because ""He just wants to say 'Hi'"". The HR girl happily leads him into our office, then HR girl pops in and asks where Steve is and I casually mention he was out for some personal stuff and will be back shortly. That's when she mentions to me ""His neighbor is here to say 'Hi'.""  What I'd like to know:  Is what HR girl did illegal? If so, would this law be publicly available for me to read or show to them? (Hopefully with more laws they probably do not abide.) What could my coworker or myself do about this? I really don't feel like my information is safe within the hands on our HR department.  Any help or even a point in the right direction would help and I would be greatly appreciative."	No
523	"As title says, I have lived in my house for just under a year. I began noticing an area in the back corner of my backyard was slowly eroding away every time it rained (I am in the state of Louisiana, so lots of rain), and more recently the hole has grown to a very large size. In my closing documentation, it states that proper drainage was installed ""per Home Owner Warranty Act"" however clearly this is not the case, as every time it rains the water is slowly taking the earth away with it.  I have reached out to the builder with basically no luck, and all they have offered to do is fill the hole in with dirt for a ""cheaper"" price than what the going rate would be for a local contractor, but mentioned nothing about fixing the root cause, which is improper drainage. I brought out another independent contractor to evaluate the situation, and he pretty much told me the situation was pretty bad and gave me a quote for several thousand dollars to fix.  Do I have legal grounds to bring a lawsuit upon the builder? It has been under a year and this problem was brought on strictly due to there not being proper drainage in my lawn. Additionally, as the ground has eroded away, large chunks of concrete have been revealed, alluding to the builder just throwing all sorts of rubbish into the ground in order to build up the level of the yard during construction phase.  Any help will be appreciated."	No
524	My wife and I are getting divorced and I'm trying to figure out if I'll have a penny left to my name after this.  We have a house, 2 cars, no children.  Married 2 years.  What I'm trying to determine is how ownership of the house is divided. We've been putting money into paying it off as fast as possible, including an inheritance that she received last year.   Is it as simple as the two of us agreeing to how much each is owed, or is there an official accounting method?	No
525	My mother is a 66 year old disabled manic depressant who survives on welfare. She currently lives in a trailer on a trailer park which she pays rent. She's been here for about 15 years and the landlord has refused to fix things in the park for years. However, this newest refusal I consider to be out of line. My mom recently fainted and broke her foot (about 5 days ago) and this has basically immobilized her. A few days prior to her accident she called me telling me that the toilet and bathtub were broken. Basically when she flushes the toilet it backs up somewhere and in the piping and what she flushed begins to come out of the bathtubs drain. The bathtub itself doesn't want to properly drain. Her and her neighbor discovered a piece of land outside of her home that seemed to be leaking and spewing up sewer waste. They both called the landlord on multiple occasions leaving voicemails that he never returned. She finally got through to the landlord yesterday and told him what was happening. He told her that he'll get to it and she described her injury. Once she told him this he replied by telling her to go to the bathrooms at supermarkets. She replied by telling him again about her broken foot, how she's been using a portable toilet in her living room, and that there was nowhere for her to dispose of the waste. His follow up to her response was to take the portable toilet outside and throw the waste into the vacant lot next to her trailer. My mother hasn't been able to use her toilet in over a week and has resorted to going to the bathroom in bags/pots. She hasn't taken a proper shower or bath in over a week.  She is currently refusing to drink water and eat too much food because it makes her have to go to the bathroom. Is there anything that can be done here?	No
526	"I am having hell with my landlord, and have some questions about repair and deduct. They are using an excuse that they are away and have bad internet for the next couple weeks, and we can ""discuss"" when they are back. To me that's unacceptable, and I want to repair and deduct, but not sure what is legal to deduct.  I have the following issues.  Roaches - Told the landlord, they don't seem to care, told me they will pay for a $35 exterminator on craigslist. I told them that's not acceptable and am hiring a licensed exterminator.  Garbage Disposal in Sink - It's completely rusted up and leaking from the bottom which makes half of the sink unusable. This leaking can potentially cause mold as well (plan on replacing that).  Air conditioner - This is a tricky one, I had it looked at and the HVAC is completely dirty, apparently hasn't been cleaned in 10 years, the filters are messy. The guy says he has to take it apart to clean it up. However, I'm not sure if air conditioner counts as habitability.  Unusable Toilet - In the master bathroom the toilet runs. I know it's plumbing, I'm not getting what I paid for, but it's not the only toilet in the house so I question the habitability for that one.  Thanks"	No
527	"Hello,  I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop.   Reference:  ""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic stop for another violation.   Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement. Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""  From the Arizona state legislature.  The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.  The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.  I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt.   I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this.   Thanks"	No
528	Hi I live in GA and recently bought a car from a private seller. He hid the fact that the engine was bad by bumping up the RPMs. Is there anything i can do to get my money back or have him pay for the car?	No

530	Hey LA,   I am posting on a throwaway just in case. I am looking for advice and intelligent next steps on getting this issue resolved.   My partner and I built and bought a townhouse from a builder here in MO. Custom built, finished and closed end of Dec 2016. The driveway was poured in December. In March/April we noticed the driveway started to sink and part of it started popping up and separating from the ground.   I email the warranty people at the builder, and they said the best they can do is pack underneath the driveway to keep it from sinking more.   Well I went out and measured today and on one side it has separated 2 inches from the driveway and the other side is 3 inches. Upon some fun googling (which is probably not accurate), but a driveway should not be sinking or settling that much in this short of a time frame unless something was faulty with installation or the land they put it on. It's to the point of stopping our cars as we roll up the driveway in to the garage. We are worried about something underneath causing it to sink this quickly, resale value, and a potential accident by having to give a decent amount of gas to get up over that bump.   What are the next steps to formally request or provide evidence that they installed it incorrectly? Should we get an inspector? Just email the warranty woman back letting her know we need to escalate? I just don't want to be railroaded. They've ignored my emails about issues before or just repeat the same shit back.   Thanks!	No
531	Hey everyone, hoping the title wasn't misleading or something. Im new to reddit btw! :0 Anyways, by the way my knowledge legally speaking is very amateur so please see where I'm coming from here! my wording might not be the best. Emma give this a shot and keep it very brief I am aware of the premise of emancipation in America, when someone comes of age to basically legally sever themselves from their parents or guardians. I was wondering if there is anything like this in Korea? My girlfriend is Korean and is wondering, for her own personal reasons. Ive done what research I can, but I end up stumbling into complexly worded and misguiding articles, blogs etc. Someone help me out here, i would love and appreciate any and all advice. Thank you !!  PS.Am I even posting this in the right sub? If you guys know of anywhere else I could post this question let me know!	No
532	A few years back I rented an apartment with my ex. Things fell through and I was removed from the lease and the utility bills upon her and the landlords approval. I have a formal document signed by myself and the landlord that I was taken off the lease. Currently I have a bill for the apartment as well as the utilities affecting my credit score. If I was taken off the lease am I still liable for those payments or can I dispute them?	No
533	"Short and sweet. My husband screwed around behind my back a lot in the past. I'm 9 months pregnant.  I had a bit of a moment today and texted my mother saying pretty much ""kinda wish I could Leave him I can't get over the shit""  He saw and has decided we need to do something so we are discussing a marriage consoler but he also would like to put the baby up for adoption to avoid ""getting trapped"" and child support. Is there a way to put his fears to ease and avoid him paying child support? I am some what attached to the baby by this point and have already started a nursery and have a baby shower in a week so im a bit commited. Financially if I were alone with a child I would be doomed but I will have family who will help.  He has a great paying job and doesn't want to feel like he's getting screwed.    *TL;DR* I want to ensure my husband doesnt have to pay child support in case we do divorce. Is there anything I could do?"	No
534	(WA) I am out $400-500 and deserve it back due to the other party not delivering on the date we both signed on.  I believe that they gave me a contract to sign in bad faith.  This is about renting an apartment and a lease and includes false advertising on apartment availability and move in date.  If I ask is it better to ask in an email or letter?  Is it better to go straight to small claims?  Is it better to hire a lawyer who told me it would cost about $167 for his paperwork and I could include that cost in the small claims case? Thank you	No
535	My ex-wife recently filed an application for divorce.  There were some issues pertaining to the separation agreement that I wanted ironed out prior to accepting the divorce (specifically fixing FRO arrears to $0 since the amendments to the agreement were not on file as I had assumed she would have done which had adjusted the support amounts payable, as well as some other access issues and firming up some wording on the agreement).  We were able to settle all these issues in our first case conference, and a court order was filed to amend these changes.  I just received, from her, Form 12: Notice of Withdrawal, requesting that I fill it out so she can proceed with the divorce.  Now, I don't want to get boned here, so I was just wondering:  Does this notice of withdrawal rescind my answer that I had on file, nullifying the court order or is it just a formality since we are now in agreement to move forward?  I've also read in the Ontario Family Law that if a Notice of Withdrawal is submitted, that I will have to pay the court fees.  What kind of fees am I looking at?	No
536	This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	No
537	So roommate slumped on rent and of course late fees and posting fees had stacked. We got this letter posted on the door yesterday saying we had 3 days to rectify the problem or else (I’m not really to sure since the lease ends Monday next week) he’s since paid his portion of the rent and like $50 of the late fees but there’s still ~$150 of fees left needing to be paid. I was curious if this would have any effect on my credit/ability to rent in the future. Could they evict or continue forward with an eviction after the lease has expired? Was this a threat to pay so they could avoid deducting from the security deposit? I’m at a loss really and can’t afford anything going to collections or any of that if it would even escalate that much. I have never had this happen so I’m kinda nervous. What would be the best recourse? If he just leaves the pending debt me and my other roommate are left footing that which is shitty and would just absolve the friendship	No
538	I am currently residing in Florida  In April, I made the personal decision to leave my apartment due to personal conflicts with my roommate. We are both on the lease and I asked to either have my name removed from the lease, or to terminate all together. She refused to comply with either of those options out of spite. There is no contractual agreement between me and my roommate stating that we would pay our share of the rent, only a contract with the landlord(the lease). I have been paying the second half of the rent out of fear of what may happen if I choose to stop. From what I understand reading Florida law and finding bits and pieces, the landlord would undergo this process to collect rent: Once the rent is X amount of days late, the landlord will file a 3-Day eviction notice. The tenants will have 3 days to either pay the late rent, vacate the apartment, or fight the eviction in court. Now with that being said, having the eviction to my renter's history IS NOT A BOTHERSOME to me. I also understand the landlord may sue for missing rent. Being evicted and having to pay overdue rent for the month sounds like a better deal to me than continuing to pay rent for an apartment I'm not living in until December. My main concern is the retaliation of my roommate, and fact checking the eviction process. Is there anything legally she may pursue in a small claims court against me directly beings that there is no contractual agreement directly between the two of us, stating we would split the rent? Is there any actions that the landlord may take that is much more serve than eviction/suing for missing rent? Does my roommate have a case to fight the eviction in court?	No
539	"So an interesting thing happened today. There have been rumors for a while about a potential list of employees who will be laid off. Someone in the office noticed in the printer queue from our HR manager (This printer is a public printer and used for most of the office) Seperate documents in the queue with titles that would say ""termination notice - employee name.""  Things got out of hand really quickly and the entire office knew by the end of the day. HR probably scared for their own job quicky called a meeting explaining who was the person who originally saw the Printer Queue as they will be fired immediately and if no one comes forward they will start making assumptions on who that person is.  I would like to know who is in the wrong here and do they have any legal standing"	No
540	Looking for advice on how to apply for apartments with an emotional support dog. I haven't had luck finding dog friendly apartments but I want to know my options on notifying the potential landlord about my dog. I know that landlords can't discriminate based on ESA's but I'm worried that if I tell them about my dog they will make up another reason. Can I not inform them of my dog until after the lease has been signed? Or do I have to bring it up earlier in the process to avoid being on the wrong side of the law?	No
541	My son’s father filed for a child custody modification last year. We are going to trial at the end of the month. The original judgment handed down by the court gave me primaryp physical custody with visitation for our son’s dad on Wednesday nights and every other weekend.   I cannot afford an attorney so I will be representing myself at the trial at the end of this month.   I have a few questions: 1. His lawyer emailed me a “take it or leave it offer” regarding visitation (for me) which I declined to sign. Since then, my son’s father has not let me see our son. His lawyer indicated in the email that I could not show the judge the “offer.” Is the lawyer allowed to say this? My son’s father has now said he will ask the judge for me to see our son a few hours each week.   2. DCF (Mass) was involved during a domestic violence incident in 2015 in which I was arrested and my son’s father had a 51A filed against him for abusing me. A 51A was filed against me as well because I was arrested in front of our son. At the time, our son was 4 months old (I had full legal and physical custody) and I was used to the abuse and thought it would make more sense for me to decline to press charges against my son’s father so that my son wouldn’t be taken into custody by DCF. How can I most effectively tell the judge the circumstances of that night?  Thank you in advance for your help.	No
542	I have recently been stopped by a CHP in Southern California going 65 on a 55. I explained to the CHP that I've had a chronic series of bladder, prostate, and kidney infections the past few months and was in the middle of an episode on my way to get treatment at a clinic close by. He seemed to chuckle a bit and proceeded to give me a ticket. Do I have any legal standing or way of fighting this ticket in court?	No
543	As mentioned above this happened today morning, and ever since i have been super stressed.   A lady by the name of Mrs Sauvie called from CRA REVENUE COLLECTIONS DEPT, 18002679541 ext 2305  She asked me if i was so and so...confirmed it and then she went to explain to me she was calling me on behalf of CRA.  and then confirmed that my landlord is so and so..i confirmed yes.  and then she went on to say that i will be receiving a legal package in registered mail on monday/tuesday.   I was like...for what...  and she replied that this is inregards to my landlord and my rental payments.   and she said after i received the package i will have to direct all my rent payments to CRA...  I live in a condo, and i am really confused...i recently came out of rehab from an accident ( being run over by a car) and have slowly started working...  I checked up on them and it seems legit.   If i send CRA the cheques i am afraid Either my landlord of the condo board will kick me out.   I live by myself and my service dog and i am really confused...like wtf...  I called my landlord and he says its a scam...and i called the 1800 number on cra website and they transferred me to rev collections dept.   I mentioned my worries to the lady and she was like..well ya you can go to tenant and landlord board..  I mean why the hell am i in the middle of all this crap...  Please advise..should i seek legal aid..  i live in mississauga, ON so i got no idea how the rules work	No
544	Sorry if this sounds stupid. It's my first time moving out (sort of, I'm moving in with my sister), and I'm disabled with a service animal. Management at the apartment said I'd need to be on the lease for the laws regarding service animals (waiving pet fees, etc) to apply. Legally I'm not subleasing &amp; can't under the lease, but can otherwise move in without issue (save my dog). I'm wondering if it states anywhere that you need to be on the lease? More out of curiosity than anything, because I'm aware I have other options. But if they're wrong, y'know, it'd be useful. I would be paying part of the rent if that makes a difference, just not officially.	No
545	"My girlfriend and I just received a voicemail from our apartment complex saying that we had to take down our [CA Pride Flag](https://smile.amazon.com/California-Pride-Flag-Rainbow-Banner/dp/B002OSQEUG/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8) because it's not on a flag pole (we saw a neighbor hang their USMC flag against their porch wall vertically, so we did the same with our flag.) and that it needs to be ""displaying colors properly.""  Our lease says nothing specific about flags, but it does say, about patios and balconies, ""any item not specifically mentioned here must be approved in advance by the community manager. Any item that has not been approved in advanced will be required to be removed immediately."" We didn't get permission, we assumed because we saw the other flags we could do the same. We can fly it on a pole, but we're worried about ""displaying proper colors."" What rights do we have to fly this version of the California flag?"	No

The guy has posted this site on /r/beermoney and other places a while ago and I ended up trying it out in March. Since then I have been contacting the owners via twitter/email etc and get absolutely no reply regarding why my ""earnings need to be finalised"". Now this happened in March and I completely forgot about it but my images are still earning money, I have 25$ worth of bitcoin to check out.

547	My husband and I are pretty sure we just witnessed a raid in our expensive apartment complex. Due to his job sensitivity, we don't want to live in a place like this any longer. Can we break our lease due to feeling unsafe? Our apartment complex might be filed with rich, drug dealing college kids. (Also, we're pretty sure our mailbox got broken into the first month we moved in.)	No
548	I was fired from my job as a health inspector at a county government in Illinois. I was told it was because I was not performing to expectations. I was on a 6 month probationary period and at 5 1/2 months through it, and would not have protection from the union until 6 months. I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me.   I work very little with my bosses (the director and assistant director of the division), and instead work closely with senior people who work as trainers. In the 5.5 months I received no formal performance review or corrective action.   I was part of a harassment investigation, against the director of the division as I witnessed him say something sexist to another coworker. This was the second harassment investigation against the director.   There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire.   Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires.   The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women).   Do I have a case for retaliation since I was fired being part of a harassment investigation? Do I have a case for wrongful termination since there was little to no documentation about corrective action and heterosexual employees, who performed worse than me were retained.   If I do have a case, what do I do next?	No
549	I will keep this short.  I am currently enrolled in a summer program at a private university in Vermont. I was recently injured, and the university offered me housing in a different area of the same building to accommodate for this. While I am grateful for the offer, the university has refused my request to inspect the room prior to making my decision. Are they not required to do so? Many thanks!	No
550	Essentially to make a long story short I work for my states welfare office Indiana, I came across some pay stubs that looked fake so I reviewed them and found an identical template by searching for fake pay stub templates. I informed my supervisor and was told to process them normally whether they are fake or not is not my problem because everyone lies to us. So I accepted the documents and processed them and notated my findings and my supervisors response. Essentially I knowingly accepted fraudulent documents due to my supervisors instructions. Can my employer fire me for this? Am I in anyway liable if they are determined to be forged documents since I accepted them during the eligibility determination process ?	No
551	So i have a buyer who is buying my house and wanted pre occcupancy. Against my better judgment I accepted because it paid my mortgage and the house was sitting vacant and the mortgage company assured me they had him pre approved and just needed the appraisal.  Well Now 5 days prior to closing there is an issue with my buyers financials and there is a chance he wont get a mortgage at all.  So my question is my contract specifically states that the pre occupancy DOES NOT create a landlord tenant relationship, and would be something along the lines of week to week.  My Question is if they refuse to move out once its official its a dead deal, can I call the sherriff to have them escorted off the property? Do i have to go through the eviction process?  They are assuring me this wont be necessary but im just trying to prepare	No
552	Child support in Washington state. I was paying support for 2 kids. The temporary order was just that temporary it had no foresight into my oldest aging out or graduating high school. My soon to be ex wife tried to change support in April due to my new job and wanted more money. The judge opted not to change anything then because I was supposed to have trial in July. The trial didn't happened solely because she failed to give her discoveries in time to review them. Two boxes of accounts on Friday after 2pm and trial scheduled for Tuesday morning. I went thru the paper work that weekend and found their was 7 additional accounts listed in the transactions of deposits and withdraws. It is believed that she is hiding money in these accounts. It's been now 60 days since the formal request and two weeks since the request for additional accounts and my trial rescheduled to November. I have read that in most cases when paying support for more than 1 child if the order doesn't specify it is understood that you stop paying support for child if they age out and only request to change the temporary order to prevent confusion.	No
553	So I recently bought a trailer from a guy here in New Jersey. The guy that I bought it from bought it brand new recently but never used it or registered. I have the certificate of origin, a receipt, and a notarized bill of sale. The problem is the certificate of origin has the place it was bought from name on it and the bill of sale has the guy I bought from name on it. I go to Dmv and they said I can not register because the guy I bought it from needs to register it first basically so they can collect the tax on it. The other problem is the guy I bought the trailer from wants it back all of a sudden. So even if I went with him to Dmv and had him register it then he could technically say oh that's my trailer and try and say I stole it. Not really sure what to do here. Don't really want to have to give this thing back because I bought it as a package that came with some other stuff too and it would be hard to separate everything.	No
554	Obviously I would be ineligible for unemployment benefits, but the idea of not having to list a termination on my work history is appealing.   I'm mostly wondering if resigning would impair my ability to seek legal relief regarding how my termination has been handled.	No
555	I received and email from my schools financial aid office notifying me that my low GPA from last semester could possibly put my financial aid in jeopardy. This email was sent with a open mailing list of every other student who received poor enough grades to have their financial aid threatened. From my understanding my grades are supposed to be private from other students and this may be a violation of something called FERPA. Should I or can I pursue legal action?	No
556	Hi all,  I'm located in Minnesota and live in an apartment. My lease is ending soon, so management sent us a moveout checklist - what we need to do/clean, etc.   Part of this document details the penalty for moving out late. Specifically, for every half hour we're late to move out, they'll charge us $100. Or in other terms, the fee is $4800 *per day*  We plan on moving out on time but I'm just curious: if they tried to charge us this outrageous fee, would it stand up in court?	No
557	Recently, my mom and my stepdad broke up, there were a lot of problems, but I want advice on a particular one.  My former stepsister(age 14) lured my nephew into her room, waited until he fell asleep, then took pictures of her making my nephew touch her inappropriately.  She then snapchatted a few of those photos to her friends.    Among the picture of her making my sleeping nephew touch her inappropriately, we also found nude photos of my nephew.  Her phone was taken away from her, but I'm not sure if she got it back since my mom and I left, and she may have deleted the pictures; BUT she has an iPhone which stores pictures in the cloud, so they may be in the cloud.  Is there any way my mom and I can go to the police and they can issue a search warrant to look through her iCloud photo's and/or past snapchats?	No
558	"A couple days ago, my mother went to the doc for a bump in her eye that seemed to be infected. The eye doctor examined it and said everything would be fine if she just rinsed it with warm water for two weeks. However, my mom didn't like this advice as she has been misdiagnosed before (years ago). Upon getting another eye doctor's opinion the next day, her fear was confirmed- the bump on her eye was infected and she needed surgery within 72 hours.  My question is: what can be done from a legal standpoint? I am sure that a complaint to the hospital will just be a slap in the wrist for the first eye doctor and I would hate for the same thing to happen to another person. I believe it to be utter unprofessionalism to say ""wash with warm water and rinse,"" and so I've came here to ask for advice.  Is this medical negligence, malpractice?"	No
559	"So for those of you who are familiar with Chicago, we have a large amount of speed enforcement cameras and red light cameras throughout the city. While driving down north clybourne, there were alot of young kids and adults jaywalking, causing me to brake suddenly twice in a one mile section.  I ended up only going 25 mph on a 30 mph because I feared it would happen again, and a speed enforcement camera ending up triggering on me  and the car behind me as we passed it and as I was going five under. Would it be possible for me to receive a citation do going too slowly, even given the circumstances? Is it possible the camera triggered due to two cars occupying it's ""zone"" at the same time? Would it be possible to contest the ticket in front of a hearing officer and using the testimony of my passenger? Sorry for what probably seems like a run of the mill post; I'm just afraid and annoyed that I might get ticketed for trying to be safe in an area they want to fine people to drive safely in."	No
560	The new owners of the mortgage originally refused communication entirely with my friend and after months of failed calls and mail did the new owner actually respond by stating they refuse to accept any payments and will simply foreclose and sell the house.  They have already filed legal notices and set a date for the foreclosure. My friend's family has enough money to pay but with the new company refusing to accept those payments it's now been several months of no actual payments being made. They instead have been depositing it into a bank account waiting to pay so they can keep their home.  Is this even legal? What can anyone do in this situation to at least stop the foreclosure. Sadly my friend and has family have already gone to court once with an attorney but the attorney is pressing them to file for bankruptcy.   I am entirely ignorant to the law but that seems too drastic of a measure especially considering how close they were to paying off their mortgage and how they've never missed a payment. It just doesn't seem remotely legal. I'd really appreciate any advice or even a point in the right direction.   Extra details: they have receipts of every transaction, they were suddenly sent multiple letters all summoning them to court claiming they missed payments and now have to pay an incredible amount of money to not lose their home.	No
561	As far as I can tell this is not allowed per the law I found below. Are there any issues I'm not seeing? Who do I report this to in Colorado or what is the best way to approach this situation? I'd like to pay rent with my credit card but the fees the landlord charges are extremely high.  Colo. Rev. Stat. §5-2-212 (1) Except as otherwise provided in §§24-19.5-103 (3) and 29-11.5-103 (3), C.R.S., no seller or lessor in any sales or lease transaction or any company issuing credit or charge cards may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit or charge card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means. A surcharge is any additional amount imposed at the time of the sales or lease transaction by the merchant, seller, or lessor that increases the charge to the buyer or lessee for the privilege of using a credit or charge card. For purposes of this section, charge card includes those cards pursuant to which unpaid balances are payable on demand.	No
562	My friend's mother is currently being taken care of by hospice and they called her mother's siblings and told them that it is time to make funeral arrangements.  As her mother has been an incredible money pit her whole life and quite the burden on her siblings, they are declining to pay for any part of the funeral arrangements, and are foisting the monetary issues onto my friend (We'll call her Alice).  Alice is a management figure at a food chain, and doesn't make the money to pay completely for the cremation of the body.  Are there any legal footings that Alice can stand on that will compel her next of kin (who are loaded by the way) to pitch in or contribute to the cremation costs and transportation costs?  Is there any financial help that she can garner to complete the burial?  She would like to avoid the state taking the body so I would like to get an answer swiftly since her mother doesn't have much time left.  Thank you in advance for any information or help you may have.  We are located in Brevard County Florida, USA.  If this is the wrong subreddit to post in I am sorry in advance.	No
563	I run a computer repair business and sometime customers abandon their devices. We have them sign a form that says after 30 days it's forfeited. Sometime we've fixed them and they don't come back or call back for months. We have to recover or cost of parts and can't hold on to something forever. Is there anything we need to do to legal have ownership to sell it or get rid of it? We are in Kansas.	No
564	So long story short, I was awarded this scholarship by a university to complete a Master's programme with them. However, I ended up not getting admitted to the course, and hence would have to forfeit my scholarship.   But the scholarship department transferred the money to my bank account (due to a lack of communication between departments) but is now asking for it back.  Aside from moral dubiousness, how legal would it be for me to just block the email and keep the money to pay for a Master's programme at another university? I never signed any legal document (I think) apart from the below acceptance form but I'm not sure if it's legally binding. I'm still wrestling with the moral dilemma but I'd still like to know whether or not it would be legal. Any help would be appreciated!   Picture of form: http://imgur.com/a/vOpo4	No
565	I have a opportunity to work outside of my country for two years. Anyways I would still apply each year for DV lottery while I'm outside of Croatia. And if I happen to be chosen for the further selection, do I have to be in my home country or can I do an interview anywhere in the world through USCIS and just go to the nearest US embassy?	No
566	So I got a mechanic's lien from a company that didn't do work on my property...but is owned by the same guy whose company DID do work on my property. We are in a dispute over the technicalities of the work...and an inspection done by 2 third parties may have elucidated he committed fraud which is why I'm hesitant to pay at this moment (coupled with the fact that he billed stuff my insurance denied and I cannot afford at the moment), but that's besides the point. The point is, we signed a contract that said he couldn't put a lien on my property prior to the work being done. Now he's filing the lien on behalf of this second company. Can he do this? Also, one thing that I thought about, can he say that he transferred the debt from company A to company B? In court, are there ethical considerations that could defend me considering it's the same dude that owns both of these companies?   &amp;nbsp;  I'm gonna lawyer up soon but I literally cannot sleep over the fact that I may lose my home...and it's making me sick to my stomach.	No
567	"Was at walmart last night and was walking up the frozen food isle to start heading to check out. Right as I reached the end of the isle I slipped smacked the side of my face along my jaw against the freezer door, landed on my butt and hit my left elbow, ankle and tailbone. Along with catching my toe on one of those end racks. Thankfully a friend was with me and helped me up. The back of my pants were soaked. Sure enough I slipped in a puddle of water. Now it had been raining, so I grabbed the first employee I saw and let them know I was injured and there was water on the floor. He spoke no English and didnt understand I needed a manager. I had to almost drag him to where I fell to even get him to pay attention. He still didn't call a manager. Went to customer service and they were gonna make me wait. So we went to jewelry where someone finally called a manager. Waited 10 min before they came up. She handed me an incident report and asked where it occurred. I told her the location and her reply was ""we have busted pipes up there that leak and need to be fixed"" and I was not the first injury. So they know there's a leak, and have neglected to fix it or put up a sign. I currently have no insurance but my jawline to my temple is killing me, my elbow hurts and it feels like I tore something in my left shoulder. What happens if I go to a doctor seeing as I don't have insurance? would walmart need to pay my medical bills. Could I sue for negligence? Or what can I do. Thank you for any and all advice in advance. I'm in Dallas Texas."	No
568	I live in Austin, Texas and for the past month and a half, I have had a mold and humidity issue in my (nice) apartment. I have put in work orders and have talked to the leasing office in person on several occasions to address this issue, but the problem remains. I've had to throw out pairs of moldy shoes, clothes, and buy a dehumidifier for my bedroom (which hasn't really done much).  I just got an email from the leasing office a few minutes ago saying that to repair the problem, they will allow us to terminate our lease agreement and move out. They previously offered to move us to a different unit in the apartment complex but its on the top floor, and we're really fed up with the complex in general.  My question is, can I take any actions here? Can I push for them to reimburse us for our damaged clothes and the cost of the dehumidifier? What about getting them to reimburse us for any moving costs associated with moving to a different apartment complex?	No
569	I recently leased an apartment a couple months ago around college but I haven't moved in yet because it's the summer. ander that time I found out that someone apart from my roommate and I have been going in there to presumably shower as there is soap and shampoo in there that's moved places from the separate times I've been in there as well as some other random stuff on the kitchen counter. We contacted the landlord and they changed the locks and told us they were gonna check the security cameras, but now they are avoiding contacting us. I was wondering what some of my potential next steps could be, or if I might be entitled to my first couple months rent back.	No
570	Last year I was sexually assaulted at a school dance. I don't want to give details I just want a black and white response.  The school nurse and the principle encouraged me not to press charges. I didn't want to tell my parents but now I have and they want to do something about it.  Do i have any legal leg to stand on?	No

572	"Been here for three years now and every time the lease is due for a renewal, they raise the rent, claiming ""the market justifies it."" Fair enough, if they actually provided any services to us tenants here that is. Here's a rundown on their nonsense over the years (besides the aforementioned rent raising of course).  *They **Never** Shovel/Plow During The Winter*  Every year, as is custom in New England, we get snow. You know the stuff; heavy, sometimes slushy, but always here in winter. This property owner acts like it is never expected, to the point where we had over three feet over the course of one day/night and they didn't even shovel *once*.   That is not an exaggeration: We're talking not even paths to upper staircases and safety hazards galore over here.  I had to call the fire marshal and get an inspector down here just to get them to clear out pathways for people. Even then, I'm sure the only reason they did it at all was because they were threatened with fines.  **Stray Cats. Stray Cats Everywhere**  Up front, I'll tell you that I've called animal control for this, but they say it's on the landlords here since it's their property.  The quick version is that there are groups of cats running around the whole complex. They **are not** any of the tenants pets, though these idiots here feed them all the same.  As animals do, these cats got to humping and now there are at least ten cats of various ages running all over the damn place. No owners, now tags, no shots or other care. Just a bunch of felines tearing around the place while other tenants act like they're they're family.  I've discussed this with the main office multiple times, but they don't care and Animal Control doesn't seem to either. No idea how to handle this one short of paying to have them removed myself, which I *definitely* shouldn't have to do.  ...I could go on about this property, about how maintanence takes their sweet time fixing it and how the ""on-site laundry"" seems like a scam, but, really, I was wondering how to proceed?  I've been looking for other places, obviously, but they're all either full or out of my price range. Though, with the way this place keeps raising it's rent, I don't think I'll be here for much longer either.  Any thoughts? Well, besides telling my fellow renters to stop feeding the damn cats at least?"	No
573	"I bought a gun online via an auction. The auction's title, picture and description were for the ""middle model"" of this particular gun style. I was shipped the baseline model, and accepted it at my gun store (called an FFL, you must go to one of these to pick up a gun). This store charges $30 to do all the paperwork so that I could receive the gun (such as a background check). This is great, and completely fair.   When I got home i noticed the gun was not the advertised model. There are very minor differences on the outside of the gun, you would have to break in down and look at the internals to notice the differences. It was like I ordered a V8 mistang, but was shipped a V6, and I had to pay $30 to drive it off the lot.   The shipping store is willing to pay for the gun to be returned, but is not paying the $30 transfer fee I paid to my local gun store. I asked they do pay for it, because it was their mistake they listed the wrong item. The owner confirmed it was their fault that the advertisement was wrong.   Im considering canceling the charge, and telling them to come pick up the gun whenever they want (it is a 2 hour drive for them). Unless they decide to pay back that $30 in addition to the price of the gun.  Basically, I lost money because of their mistake. And they expect me to go out of my way to ship a gun back to them, which I have not done and is probably a little tough to do.   They have also tied up ~$450 of my money due to this. Should I just cancel the charge because I didnt get what I ordered, and make them come get it?"	No
574	An active duty member serving in the USAF was prescribed a service dog by his PCM, but is not being allowed to bring his service dog into his office setting workplace. His superiors are claiming that the dog comes from a place (Labs 4 Liberty) that is not accredited by the VA. I have done some research on the ADA and the DoD's policies but haven't found much information about this particular situation. Is their reasoning legal, and is there any thing that can be done to remedy it?	No
575	Hello, posting from Ontario, Canada.  I am a step-parent of three years to a nine year old girl whom my wife had with her ex boyfriend. My wife and I also share a child together of two years. I have fully supported this family and the biological father has paid maybe $600 total over the entire course that I have been in a relationship with my now-wife. To give context, I make about $53k per year on average, and my wife makes about $16k. I suspect the bio father makes about $45ish.   My wife refuses to pursue legal action against the biological father to pay child support. My home expenses are roughly $3000 a month, and my family (my mother, myself, my father) have basically helped clothe, feed, and provide a home to my step child. The bio father provides no support.  Am I legally able to initiate a legal action against him for child support? All of the results I found online were post-divorce, but I am still married. Please advise, thank you!	No
576	Hi,   Am from Michigan. The apartment where I was staying send me a bill for all the renovations they did to the apartment once I moved out. It was in excess of 3K.   I disputed within 7 days as asked by them in the letter. Now they have responded after 2 months with some invoices and says that I still need to pay.  Is this legal? Weren't they supposed to file a claim in court withing 45 days of me moving out? What should I do with the letter they had sent? Should I ignore it? Any advice or suggestion is greatly appreciated. Thank you all.	No
577	My apartment complex is asking us (i.e. the tenants) to fill out a form for The New Jersey Multiple Dwelling Reporting Rule which basically asks us our name, address, and race. If we do not fill it out ourselves, they are required to check in visually.  Should I fill this out, or is there any reason not to, etc?	No
578	"I recently had to shut down my business, it wasn't working out. i wasn't making any money, but i own the office space i was working out of. this was three months ago.   last week, i broke up with my girlfriend and we will be moving out of the apartment we are currently renting on July 19th.   the space i own is pretty large. the bathroom has a drain on the floor so i can most definitely build a shower in there no problem. shouldn't take me more than a couple hours work, and it'll look decent when i'm finished.   there is a small room in the back i used to use as my office, i was thinking about moving my desk and putting a bed back there. there is also a break room that already has a refrigerator, toaster oven, and microwave. i don't need more than that for a ""kitchen"". anything i cook is in the toaster oven or microwave.   that leaves the rest of the space for me to ""live"" in. can i legally furnish this place up and just live here for a bit? i live in florida if that matters"	No
579	"I'm looking to get advice on regarding what to do. I know the best way to get legal advice is through a bar approved lawyer, but I would like to have some second-hand advice on what I should do regarding this situation I'm currently experiencing.  My Grandmother has been ""ill"" for a while (see can't be by herself and someone has to always watch her) and currently has her house for sale. My Oldest brother has been taking care of her primarily (Being at home with her to watch her while he tries to live out his own life) and also my mother. (She can't be alone with my grandmother due to her inability to take care of herself.)(Tdlr she is a severe alcoholic and has really bad short term memory due to it.)  During most of the time, it has been my older brother taking care of her. He even transferred household utility bills in his name (Gas, Water, Electric, Comcast, ext) and additionally paying for other expenses. (Groceries, living expenses for my mother and grandmother to survive).  A Few months ago, her oldest daughter (my aunt) started giving her vitamins/pills/ect in other words ""alternate medicine"" (Whatever Steve Jobs did before he sought out real help) and in my past couple months watching over them I've notice she gets a tad better, but a bit worst each time.  In regards to what I want to ask, just recently my Aunt made herself Power of Attorney (Even though she is not the oldest sibling) even when my grandmother is in current state of mind. Her current state of mind consist of ""flashbacks"", random hysteria episodes and the inability to do the basics of living (Getting up from her bed, using the bathroom, washing herself, ect).  When she became POA she recently informed me that when the house sells that she (my aunt) will get all the money and then presumes to tell me I have to find a place for my mother since ""I'm her son"" when I can't even take care of myself in the 1st place.   So tldr - Aunt has POA, sells my grandmother house keeps the money for herself and then my mother, brother, and myself don't have anywhere to go. Honestly I'm pretty scared about this and I don't really know what to do so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	No
580	"After moving to NYC last summer for work, I signed a 2 year lease in a rent-stabilized housing development. Due to unforeseen circumstances I have had to suddenly move to another state this month. In order to avoid paying a heavy (3 months rent) early termination fee, I was hoping to assign my lease to another party. However, my landlord is making it very difficult to do this, and I suspect that they are violating my lease by in doing so.  In particular, while my unit has a legal regulated rent, when I signed the lease it was with a preferential rent rider that stipulated that the landlord would accept a substantially lower monthly dollar amount through the end of the two year lease period. This preferential rent rider also has a successors and assigns clause applying to both myself and the landlord. To my untrained eye, it seems as though this clause should mean that my landlord must also accept this preferential rent as payment from any potential lease assignees. However, after I found someone to take over the lease, I was told by the legal department at this development that there would be no preferential rent for this assignee and they would instead be required to pay the full legal regulated rent (plus some adjustments). When I asked them about the successors and assigns clause in my preferential rent rider they wrote:   ""We stand by all of the information provided to you.""   They then stopped responding to my emails. Because the adjusted legal regulated rent for the unit is about 33% above market value, it was too much for my assignee to pay. Accordingly, my assignee had to back out and I am proceeding with termination of the lease, as I cannot imagine finding any reasonable person to pay this much for the unit.  I have two questions:  (1) Does the successors and assigns clause in my preferential rent rider mean that it should apply to someone to whom I assign my lease?  (2) If so, hasn't my landlord violated the rider (and thus the lease), giving me grounds for legal action against them?  Thanks for your help!!"	No
581	A little backstory i think is necessary: Back in mid-2000's my wife and I divorced. Around 2013, I filed for custody and given the circumstances she was in, I was granted custody as it was clearly the better place for him to live.  My son (16 years old) visits his mom during the summers and had stated to me before leaving he wanted to live with her. I think this was due to him getting in some serious trouble soon before he left and wanting what he thinks will be a more lenient household. Also he had a serious falling out with his best friends shortly before he left as well. He told me again during a Skype call a couple weeks back that he still wanted to stay at his mom's. I was considering allowing him to move back there at the end of the next summer but wanted to talk to his mom and get a lawyer involved to protect all parties' interests.   Yesterday I was served with paperwork, filed by my ex-wife, that I abuse our son. It seems to reference a couple of incidents that I somehow harmed him. Im not sure, it doesnt go into specifics. As a single parent Ive tried really hard to provide the best life I can for him. I didnt even file for child support so his mom would have more money to do fun stuff with him when he visited as we were *fairly* secure at the time. Im really scared what could happen with these accusations.   I cant imagine any proof they might have since abuse never occurred.  Any advice or comments would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading.	No
582	Long story short.  My wife and I separated for a short time and filed for divorce, divorce was dissmissed.  We have a minor child and there was a child support order issued.  We worked things out after about 6 months and have been back together for several years.    I have been paying the child support all of this time up until 6 months ago when I took a new job.  Our question is how do we request the child support end?  The only forms I was able to find were if the child turned 18 or was emancipated.  I know to dismiss the divorce all we had to do was write a letter to the judge requesting it, is that all tjjat we would need for this?	No
583	I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this	No
584	"Currently renting at an apartment community in GA. I've been here for a couple years and every year they send out a renewal offer each year. Well, i've been trying to get them to send the lease over so I can lock in my renewal rate for another year (we lucked out and pay MUCH less than any of our neighbors). The staff in the office has changed a lot over the years and I'm worried someone new will come in and really jack up our rent. We received a written renewal offer on the company letterhead stating our renewal rate for 2017-2018 with absolutely no expiration date or stipulations (i.e. offer is void if presented with future offers). Would they have to honor this since it's in writing? We've been calling and going into the office in person and keep getting the old ""we'll get to it"". Starting to get very nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!"	No
585	TEXAS We were served with a writ of execution on 7/13. The constable knocked on the door, said Good luck, signed the back and left. I opened it up and then called the JP court to ask about it. They told me the constable shouldn't have just left etc. The constable showed back up 30 mins later &amp; asked to see the paper he served me. The constable asked if we could come up with a payment agreement. We did &amp; agreed to a deposit of $1,000 and payment of $250 starting on Aug 25. He wrote out the agreement on his letterhead, signed it, and gave it to me. I asked if this was it, and now he wont be back to take things, and he said yes, there is an agreement now and unless you do not make payments everything is good. He gave the check to the person who sued us and he cashed the next day.I called the constable the next day, and he said that the person who sued us could technically still have him force the writ and take our possessions. I asked WHAT ? Yesterday he told me that the agreement he wrote down would suffice the writ. I am so confused as what to do now.	No
586	A few months ago, I came home to my apartment and it was open. I thought I rushed out and kinda was whatever about it.  I live in a safe area, so really what was the worst it could be? Nothing was out of place, the animals were home. I just assumed I was an idiot.  About two weeks ago, I had an Amazon package riffled through. It was an IPL laser for in home hair removal, the guy stole a cartridge. I thought nothing of it and thought that Amazon messed up or the package was delivered incorrectly until my neighbor indicated the man, whom my neighbor saw, was going through my stuff and waiting out in the parking lot 8 hours later, gave up, and went somewhere else.  I got home shortly after that time.  The cops really were whatever about it. Amazon replaced the part.  I dusted off my gun.  Life went on.  About four days ago, I found a box of razor blades and rope in front of my door.  I thought nothing of it, eh people are moving so whatever, and I moved on.    This morning, I woke up and went to go feed the cats.  Now, the bin I have the cat food in is heavy.  Those monsters can't knock it over if they tried, and believe me, they try.  The bin was perfectly inverted and in a different location in the room.  The food stays in the bag, as I like to keep crumbs out of the container, and I usually fold it down, it was rolled down.  This is not something I do.  I also don't invert the food tub and as it was perfectly inverted, I doubt it was a cat that did it.  I don't go in that room except to clean the litter box and feed the cats.  My landlord nor has the management stepped foot in my apartment. There is no sign of entry.  My spare key is still in my kitchen.  Am I crazy or does this sound like something I should chat with the cops about?  This feels weird.	No
587	"I am dealing with a two year lease, and the landlords are not being reasonable and not fixing any problems. They want us to fix everything.  They left the place a complete mess when we moved in and lie about everything. They expect us to take care of and repair things that were not fixed from the beginning.  It wouldn't be such a big deal, but their entire attitude is the problem.  For example, we told them that there is a minor roach infestation, which I had to purchase baits and gels, and they said ""Ok, thanks for the update"". They do not have any plans on helping to get rid of it.  The air conditioner which is in the unit does not work, although according to the lease terms we were supposed to notify them within 48 hours, but we never had to turn it on.  Anyway, I fear that I will be upset for the next two years dealing with them, what would be the best way to break out of the lease as they do not take care of the place, leave it a mess, and lie about everything.  They wrote on the lease terms that they are supposed to have a bidet in it (I never asked for it), but they refused to take it out even though it was filthy. - NSFW  http://imgur.com/a/ARzu6  Would love some real advice on how I should go from here."

588	My brother recently saved up for and purchased a 2003 BMW M3. He's mad about cars and this one especially. A few days ago, while parked at a friend's house, someone backs in to his car in the driveway and then flees the scene. An onlooker thought it was something like a Pontiac Grand Prix, a pretty common car for a high schooler. He thinks he knows who it is as the paint scrape matches the color of a friend's Grand Prix. They and their parents denied the accident but I am somewhat skeptical. The person in question was present at the time, paint matches what was left on my brother's car and they drive a Pontiac Grand Prix, apparently very poorly. (As all high schoolers do) The damage done is pretty extensive to the front bumper and lights, would have to replace the entire bumper most likely? (Not sure) Insurance apparently doesn't cover the type of damage done so it would be all out of pocket for our family. Just generally curious on how I should approach the situation and if there is anything I can/should do to hopefully figure out who caused the incident?  -Previously posted in /r/cars   Images of car damage: http://imgur.com/a/e2sm3	No
589	I'm posting this on behalf of my girlfriend to find some answers. My girlfriend (23) is a single mother of a 3 (almost 4) year old. Her daughters father went to prison a few months before she was born (Child Sex Offender). He's now being released fairly early cause of a new law in California to let non-violent criminals out, something along those lines. My girlfriend didn't look for any government assistance or legal help during these 4 years. She's received no financial support from her baby daddy or his family and raised her daughter on her own with help from her own family. The father isn't even on the birth certificate.   It's tough for her right now. She has 2 jobs but doesn't make nearly as  close to what she needs. Her parents don't financially assist her aside from helping her pay for insurance. Now her baby daddy's family is buying him a house and car when he gets out of prison. She freaking out cause she has a car payment, credit card payment, rent, etc. while trying to support her daughter working minimum wage at 1 job and works event scheduling at the other. So fairly inconsistent.   I always tried pushing her to find legal advice, but she terrible looking for help, especially with this situation. Her baby daddy's mom promised to send money her way for support but never did. Now with him getting out of prison, she wants to take action against him. I can go a bit more in depth if needed.	No
590	My daughter turns 18 in 5 months and has one year of high school left. She is severely mentally ill after being sexually abused by her bio dad for six years, and she has lived with me since January of 2016. Her bio dad is in jail awaiting sentencing.   She threw a coffee mug at me tonight as hard as she could because I asked her to pick up her belongings in the living room, she went to bed without doing it, and I immediately asked her to please get up and do it. When she did she was yelling at me the whole time, throwing things, etc. Long story short, we were arguing and she threw the mug at me. I covered my face, and it hit me in the ribs. She picked it up to throw it at me again, and I held her wrist and asked her to please put it down. She dug her nails into my arm before slamming it onto the table. She also broke a knitting needle in half and threatened to stab me in the neck with it.   After she went to her room I had my husband change the wifi password, and told her we would talk about it tomorrow. She decided to try to punish us by playing music really loudly, and when we told her we weren't going to let her use the wifi regardless she left. It was around 11:30pm at this time.   This is not the first time she has gotten violent with me. She also rescinded her consent to allow her therapist and doctors to speak with me, and she has not been to see her therapist in over a month. She won't allow me to have access to her meds, nor will she tell me what she is taking. She has broken our property, punched holes in the walls, broken the bathroom sink. I have had her hospitalized before. I should have called again tonight, but I'm just so exhausted with her. And I'm legit scared of her.   I suspect she went to her boyfriend's house. I was unable to call his father because she had her boyfriend block my phone number on his dad's phone. I was able to send him an email through the form on his business website just to give him a heads up.   I don't want her coming home without being able to communicate with her doctors and therapist at the bare mininum. Really at this point I would rather she not return home at all because she is completely uninterested in cooperating with me of following the house rules to even the barest degree. What are my options? I would like to still keep her safe as much as I can, but I don't feel safe with her living here anymore.	No
591	We lived in a house a year or so ago and after moving out, we found out that the landlord didn't own the house we were paying monthly to live in. The people who did own it, didn't even recognize the lying landlord's name. Should we make some sort of report? I have receipts for every month. I know the person who moved in after us and she is a single mother. Is she entitled to that money back? I know very little about this kind of thing, but it feels like the fake landlord should face circumstances of some kind.	No
592	I know laws are ambiguous in defining 'normal wear and tear', but the problem I'm facing is that the apartment complex wants to charge us for carpet replacement due to the contrast between used carpeting and carpet that was covered by furniture for 2 years, as can be seen [Here](https://i.imgur.com/VvGATds.jpg). Note, the light making a window outline seems to exaggerate the contrast, but you can still see what they're talking about. We didn't do anything crazy to the carpet, just lived on it. I'm sure a better vacuum wouldn't have hurt, but still.   Further, they replaced all of the carpeting, but said they only charged us for the rooms they said needed to be replaced. Is this just 'out of the kindness of their hearts', or did they replace it all then try to make some of that money back?   Additionally, we were told we could get it professionally cleaned and show a receipt or they could do it for $50 upon move out. I feel a good bit of the contrast would've been alleviated (though likely still existent) had the carpets been steam cleaned, but this never happened as we intended on paying them the $50 to do so. Does that play a role in this at all?  Thank you!	No
593	Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.  I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.  Thank you all so much for your support, I am completely shocked right now	No
594	"Hi /r/legaladvice,  I am posting primarily on behalf of my boyfriend and his newfound daughter.  To preface the situation, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years and have lived together just about as long with full intentions of marriage someday. We have a very stable household and both have steady upper management jobs with reliable incomes.  For backstory, my boyfriend and a woman were dating in California around 2003. Right before he deployed, she became pregnant. By the time that he returned from deployment, the child had already been born. He says that he never signed a birth certificate, but the child has his last name. He cared for her for 2-3 years after birth as if she was his own. When she was 3, he was PCS'd to Georgia and the mother then denied that he was the father entirely, that she had been with other people, etc. It was messy, but there were no legal proceedings then. He took her word for it and moved to Georgia, while the mother and child remained in California.  About 2-3 weeks ago, we were served child support documents (after a few months of notices via mail). When the papers were served, my boyfriend was incredulous because the mother had explicitly said that he was not the father of the child. The child is 12 years old and the paperwork came out of nowhere, nearly a decade after their last contact.  Within days, the daughter found us on Facebook and sent friend requests to each of us, as well as several of his family members with the same last name. Looking at her profile picture, the resemblance is undeniable -- they are 100% related. He accepted her friend request and they have started a relationship via Messenger. While most of the conversations revolve around favorite snacks, animals, innocent stuff, he has uncovered the following things: (1) She does not actually live with her mother, who filed the child support paperwork, (2) She lives with a young woman (older sister or younger aunt, I can't remember) who is ~19 and has two other children of her own, (3) She is often dropped off at Grandma's in a CA/Mexican border town and is allowed to freely walk around alone despite child abduction being all too common, (4) She has a mild case of scoliosis that is not being treated, (5) She commonly eats non-nutritious food and is very thin, including as ramen and ice cream, (6) She is often sad and yelled at by family. One instance involved a woman (whom I believe was her mother visiting) who yelled ""fucking"" at her about 18 times in a 30 second span while on video chat with her dad. The family members with whom she is staying know that she has started talking to her father and accept this and several have encouraged it via comment on a cover photo she created with a picture of her dad, and (7) She has repeatedly asked to come to Georgia over and over and over again.  We have reached out to a GA lawyer with no reply and he has also reached out to an old military buddy in law about the child support, but we are still a little frazzled (understatement) about where to get a foothold. He has decided to petition for full custody, and I am behind him 1000%. But where do we begin? He has already agreed to pay the $1200/month child support to the mother she does not live with, and we also received a petition for health insurance yesterday.  I am assuming we would need to instead find a lawyer located where his daughter lives? How does that conceivably work when we are located 2000 miles away, court-wise? I feel like we are lightyears behind, having waited 3 weeks when she needs us.  Thank you all in advance for any insight and direction."	No
595	"I have 2 roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. ""John"" is the one bringing his family over. He said his mom would be over for a few days, and we consented. He had 10 members of his family over for 5 days, then had 4 members stay over for another 5 days, at which point he had 10 again for the final 2 days.      I told him this was too much when I realized, but he said they had to stay as they had nowhere to go. This is the second time his mom has come in 4 months (totalling 16 days).      We are all on the lease equally. I want to know, what are my rights in this situation? I've googled and saw it was OK if it was just an overnight guest like a girlfriend, but I saw nothing about 10 people... I'm not trying to get all of us kicked out, but it feels like I have no power in this situation if he wants to bring his family back. I told him not to bring them back, but I also said to get a hotel for them, which he did not. Any advice you can give would be helpful"	No
596	"We have a small ""buffer"" between my fence and the fence separating my house from the 2 half lots beside me. Neighbor informed me he was paying to have the trees cut and brush cleared from that area. I'm not 100 percent sure, but the ""buffer"" may belong to me. I like the trees as they mostly block the 2 houses I could see from my back porch, he does not and says the city will issue a citation to have the area cleared. We have only been here a few months, so I can't verify that information as accurate or not.  Also, first reddit post. Correct me if I've made some formatting errors.  Thanks"	No
597	I am in the military, and my wife has a 7 y.o. daughter from a previous relationship.   The birth father has a rough history, and essentially lost joint custody for a) harassment of my wife, b) repeatedly asking to pay less child support, and c) not showing up for court. By Oct '13 my wife had a protection order against him and his only rights were bi-weekly visitation.   I married wife that same year, and the military re-located us out of state. NY law required that we receive consent from the father to relocate step-daughter, and he was not willing to give consent, so we had to go to court. To sweeten the deal for him, we offered to reduce child support. The judge determined it was in the child's best interest to move with us for several reasons. Birth father is now allowed to see step-daughter every summer for 6 weeks and Christmas for 1 week, which roughly equals the cumulative amount of visitation he had with her before - arguably, more quality time together as opposed to 48 hours every 2 weeks. And he was released from obligation to pay child support, with the implied intent being that he could save the child support money to visit his daughter. He has never visited. We paid out of pocket to fly my step daughter home to NY twice per year, at about $500-800 round trip each time.   We have since moved 2 more times, and birth father has never paid child support. He has offered 2-3 times to pay for something like soccer registration fee, so about $100 worth of donations. Birth father got married last year and his own child this year.   Do we have any leg to stand on if we ever want to resume his child support payments? What would we have to prove? We don't need the money right now, and I don't want to be greedy, but it would be nice to put a little more into her college fund and savings account. We are not living in NY currently, which would affect our ability to attend any legal proceedings.	No
598	I am in the process of a legal name change, although it can take anywhere between 60-90 days.  At the same time I am also trying to start a business. I don't know if I should just sit tight and wait for the name change to happen, or if this wouldn't matter anyway because I need to get things to match with past IRS tax returns, etc. I also don't like sitting still if I don't need to, since this is time I could be using for my business.  So I'm not really sure what I should be doing. Wait for the name change and then file the paperwork, or use my current legal name to get the ball rolling and then try to register my name change with the proper places later?	No
599	I'm from Cape Town.  I'm quite pissed today. So I'm a student and I pay my rent for a room every month without issues. However, there is no laundry dryer in my complex or my flat, so I attache a rope on my balcony and put my clothes to dry there.  So around 10 days ago, the Board Director (or some other shit) of the complex I stay at knocked on my door and told me to remove the clothes and the rope as it's an eyesore for people on the road. You see, my garden is opposite a train station and people move there all the time and they can see inside the fencing, which basically shows my clothes hanging on the rope.   To day I can't figure out why this is a problem, when I'm paying my rent and causing noone harm.  So here's what happens today. Dude knocks on my door from my balcony(it's ground floor) and I don't  open. Why? I got a flu, I haven't slept since last night and just as I was falling asleep a, loud knock.  Next thing 2 hours later I open my door to pick my clothes as I don't have any clean clothes. Here lies on the fucking floor, amongst the the dust ALL of my clothes. I'm really pissed and I don't know what to do.   All I want to know is, is that legal? Is a landlord(board member of the complex of w.e fuck) allowed to do that? I mean seriously, that's really fucked up imho.   Is there any legal action that can be taken?  Thanks	No
600	"Il  I was stupid and lucky. I parked somewhere with free parking for an event at a con. Only rule I could see was ""No overnight parking"". I get back to my car around 1am to someone calling  in my car to be towed. He said that once the mall closes you can't be parked there and it's a big fine. Luckily he let me go.   Now, this is just for curiosity sake, but he put a big sticker on my car window. On the driver's side back one. It isn't coming off easy, it's ripping like a sticker does and is leaving behind sticky shit. It's irritating. Is it legal for someone to vandalize my car like that?"	No
601	"We own property in a county. The property borders a two-lane highway that is the city limit line. On the other side of that line / highway is a subdivision (in city limits).  Basically, what's happening is rainwater / runoff is being collected  in the subdivision, and fed across (under) the highway by a 24"" pipe and on to my property. And we're not talking a trickle. With a decent rain storm that 24"" pipe is going full-bore. Think pressure similar to a fire hydrant. The problem is this is causing a literal river through my front yard. It's also causing pretty bad erosion. Like, washboarding my front lawn. To add to that, after this river of water travels through my property it goes in to a neighbor's - basically forming a small lake. Whatever doesn't run off just sits stagnant until it evaporates.  So the legal question is, what is a city's obligation to contain / retain rainwater runoff from roadways, etc? It *seems* like legally they shouldn't be able to just pipe it ten feet over the city line on to someone else's property and declare (so to speak) not our problem. Is this something I should speak with an attorney about regarding mitigating the runoff and the erosion damage to my property? Am I basically screwed? If I should talk to an attorney, what type of attorney am I looking for?   Thanks."	No
602	"2014 I went to court filed for custody. My oldest I was able to keep. She was living with me anyway since cys got involved due to drugs in the house and some abuse. At the time my youngest who was 15 at the time also had a live in 19 year old BF. The constable found him in the closet in her bedroom. This all went to court including the constable. Why they let her stay with her mom I don't know.  At the time they said she was old enough to decide. She liked to party with her mom and now she's in rehab. Butler county juvenile has her in for the second time. The first time she went in she was 18 and she was still in high school. I was paying support to her mom. I stopped paying support to her mom since she was not living there. Soon as I did that butler came at me for support. She got out and I was paying the arrears for that while again paying her mom. The arrears were paid off and then my support juSt stopped because washington county domestic relations emancipated her as she was 18 and graduated. The week they stopped the support she ran to butler saying she was hot for drugs. THE WEEK MY SUPPORT ENDED! I figured this would happen. Anyway I enjoyed about a month of not paying support and just got the letter from butler setting up suppprt for ""the minor"". I am in the process of getting an attourney and would like some advice. She is now 19 and butler says they can make me pay support while she is there until she is 21. I'm trying to stay calm."	No
603	I got a speeding ticket about a week ago in Florida. Not my county but next over. Its only $131 and I just want to pay it and get it done with. I called and the lady said give it a few days and told me to check again and I did and its still not there. They use a 3rd party ncourts for payments. They have no record nor the county clerks office! Don't they have to make it available for me to pay? What are my options here? Should I challenge it? I dont mind paying I just need it taken care off to not worry. What should I do, and the officer also did not mention anything about points on my licence, is was doing 79 in a 70. He followed me for 25 min through another county until I entered his just to nail me.	No
604	I work as a supervisor in a fast food restaurant that is locally owned in eastern Washington. Most of my shifts are closing shifts (75% or so), and where I work, closing shifts are on the clock until a certain time at night, whether all the work is completed or not. Not finishing the work in time (this happens often if we're busy towards the end of the night) does not remove the expectation for the work to get done properly, despite the fact that my fellow closer and I are no longer getting paid. Sometimes this means an extra 5-10 minutes of work, but in our busy season, it very often means 20-30 minutes or more of unpaid work. I'm quite sick of working for free and then getting chewed out if the tiniest thing isn't completed, because I've gotten to the point where once I'm not being paid I stop caring.  Under the FLSA, I've recently learned that I can request up to three years of backpay for unpaid work, but I'm not certain at all how I would go about proving that I've been worked off-the-clock, especially as heavily as I have been (between July 3rd and July 10th, 2017, I easily did at least three hours of unpaid work). My restaurant does have a CCTV security system that my boss taught me how to use and get footage from one time when we were robbed on a shift I was leading, but due to a shortage of hard drive space, all footage older than three days or so is overwritten. Can I get some footage over time of myself and my coworker(s) doing this extra work and use it as legal proof? There's no official tracking of how much work any of us employees have done for free, so if I can't use the security footage, what can I do?	No
605	Colorado  I own a nail shop, but I received notice from the water company that they suspect that there is a leak coming from our building. I am renting the building space, so since I didn't have any access to the basement pipes, I told the building owner that the water company would cut off my water in two weeks unless we get it fixed.   I kept reminding the building owner, but he continuously pushed the issue away and never sent a plumber to get it resolved. I have until Monday to get this resolved, but the building owner just told me he is leaving for vacation (or something else, he wasn't really clear) and won't be back until next week.   I'm not sure what I should do exactly. Any advice would be really appreciated.	No
606	Tim and Barbara have a marriage ceremony in 2007 in South Carolina, and fill out the applications for a marriage license (one for the judge, one for govt agency, and one for their own records), but do not file them because they want to continue receiving social security benefits from Tim's first wife who passed away. Instead, they opt to store those filled out by unsubmitted documents in a box in their closet.  The two live together, but do not file taxes together, do not share bills for many years, and have almost entirely separate finances.  Tim has recently passed away. Would they be considered married by common law in South Carolina, or would their not filing a marriage license application and continued receipt of social security for Tim's previous wife be sufficient evidence that they did not intend to marry? If so, how would this be presented to the court that makes this determination?  I apologize if my understanding of common law marriage is lacking, I'm still researching the subject and don't have any legal knowledge outside of what I've picked up on Reddit and a few other sources. Thank you for your time!	No
607	My father claims they'll never pursue collection, and it'll only present an issue if I try to collect social security in another way. I'm worried that this is untrue.  They applied the overpayment note to my case in February of 2016. I was cut off in October. Nothing has happened as of yet, but I've found papers saying my mom, who was my representative payee, has been paying a little over $700 a month. My question is, does this mean it's on her to pay the debt since she was my payee? Or is it a coincidence? If it's just a coincidence that she's the one paying it, if she stops, will they come after me?	No
608	My husband and I are live in an apartment community in Nashua, NH. We were just informed that a child in the building has lead poisoning which resulted in the community's apartments being tested. They found lead in the concrete of our apartment (we live in a mill building) but my son who is less than three years old tested within normal limits for it. We signed a lead disclosure that stated there was no known records of lead and no known problems. We fear this means they never tested for lead or they barely tested. Is it still possible to sue for damages and our three years of rent back since the disclosure was falsified? Any help is appreciated, thank you!	No
609	I'm in Amarillo, TX. I paid my rent online an hour after midnight on the third. The deadline is the third, so I was technically late by an hour. The total fees are $100, and the letter I received on my door yesterday says I have to pay with a cashier's check or face further penalties, and my lock will be changed. My rent is $620. Is this fee excessive? I was given the notice Friday. Can they continue to charge penalties until I can pay the fee on Monday? Do I have any recourse? Thanks in advance for any help.	No
610	I'm talking to them tomorrow when they are in the office, but I am interested to know what my options/leverage are. Also going to talk to the police afterwards: can I file a report but not have them act on it until I have moved out?   Any help would be appreciated.	No
611	"Looking for advice on pursuing a freelance scammer. My close friend was just ""scammed"" out of 50 hours of digital work that was agreed to be paid after completion.   Payment was per hour ($100.00) which the client agreed to multiple times through email. There are emails even letting the client know how many hours have gone by and if they wish to continue, in which the client replied that they wish to continue the process.   The job has been completed and now the client is arguing that it took too much time and they are not paying the amount they owe.   Is there anything my friend can do in order to receive payment? Is suing an option?  Thank you for the help in advance."	No
612	I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	No
613	I work for a Fortune 500 company in California.  I accepted an offer in the fall of 2016.  The offer did not explicitly list my PTO days, but it had a link to the current benefits site.  The current benefits site detailed that PTO days for employees in my range would be X, and a footnote that said the schedule would change on 1 Jan 2017.  My hiring was delayed by the company until 2017, and now I make X-16 hours of PTO, according to the new schedule.    I believe this has happened to numerous other employees as well, since my hiring class was around 100, and all had offers accepted in 2016.  Do I have any recourse for the company changing the terms of employment?	No
614	Hey everyone,  I posted here a few days ago asking about this but deleted it (I know we're not supposed to do that now, my apologies.)  (NYC) We saw an apartment with a broker from a big rental company, signed a fee agreement stating that in the event that we rent an apartment in that building we owe the company the commission fee. We almost signed with them but they would not wait over the weekend for our guarantor paperwork even though we had put down a deposit. We backed out and went to look elsewhere. We found a new broker who showed us a few places we didn't like and then he tried to show us one at the building where tried to apply to before. We got excited, applied, and got the apartment.   Now the original broker is coming at us for the fee which we thought we were going to have to pay. We did however find out that they do not work with the same company anymore and is asking us to make a check payable to this new real estate company. In the fee agreement, it explicitly states that we are only to make the commission payable to the company that showed us the building. Not to the name of the broker, broker, and certainly not a whole new company. After seeing this we decided to contact a lawyer who believes that that is illegal and we only have to pay if the original company comes after us.  The broker is not contacting me from any company and is instead sending me text messages directly. When I mentioned that we will not be making a check out to the new company they are requesting or them personally, the broker got upset and is now threatening legal action again. Basically saying that we have to pay the new company so they can process it through the old one.  This all sounds extremely fishy and again, nowhere in the one fee agreement that we signed does it say anything about a new company, the broker receiving the fee, or any transfers between companies. The only issue is the original company no longer has that building under it's listings and it looks like the broker took the building over to their new company.  We are contacting the lawayer again today but I was wondering if this all sounds like bluffing because to my untrained legal mind, we would've had to sign something saying that the fee can transfer companies before paying a whole separate entity instead of who it says to pay in our agreement.  Does anyone have any experience in NYC rental/broker laws?  Thanks for the help!	No
615	"We've since moved out of state but the property in question was in Eastern Washington. Landlord sent a proxy for the walk through who was in our opinion completely over the top with the walkthrough, but despite that we thought it went okay. We were expecting for the landlord to find ways to chip away at most of our deposit with stuff here and there (for instance, there had been an ancient, cheap garage door opener which disappeared; we got charge $50 for it, but whatever). So even though we thought we had done a very good job taking care of the place and prepping it for the next renters, we were prepared to kiss our 1200 goodbye.  The landlord sent us a bill for $5,000 in ""damages"". That's it. No explanation, just ""tenant damages"".   There was no damage whatsoever that was caused by us that wasn't repaired before we left. There had been some severe damage caused by a freak windstorm a year prior that the landlord had never fixed. There had been damage that had been there before we even moved in, but the landlord claimed they didn't have our damage report on file and that they were going to go off old photos from ""before we moved in"". We had completed that when we moved in, sent it in, and wrote it down separate in a notebook since it was a single page form that they said they would copy and send back and of course never did. We completely repainted, we completely rebuffed and waxed the floors, we made every bathroom sparkle cleaned the chimneys, etc. We can't think of anything else they could possibly be charging us for.  What can we do to dispute this? They said we had ""ten days from the time of this letter"" to respond before it would be escalated to collections, and the date on the top of the letter was clearly marked two weeks before it was even sent. I've never had a landlord try to screw us like this before so I don't even know where to start."	No
616	"I'm not sure if I even need any legal advice, but the potential is there if I don't get this issue cleared up with them by the 9th as that's when I'll get an eviction notice or it'll go my apartment's management company's lawyers.  I'll try to explain this as brief as possible. I paid June's rent via check, but apparently I only wrote the correct amount in the numerical representation on the check and not in the wording of the amount. So about a month and a half later I get a letter in the mail, stating that my check was not honored and was returned and a reverse payment issued. (The management company has their control numbers for the reversal of payment and the receipt for this reversal for records.)  I went to the office and showed them that the incorrect amount was deducted from my account, which they say should not have happened if it was not honored and payment was reversed. So I showed them a copy of the deduction and paid the amount that was left and because the check had the actual amount written in the numerical representation, would waive the return check fee. I didn't know at the time payment had been reversed as I just thought I owe the remainder. If I knew, we could've figured this out earlier.  At the end of June, I give them my check for July's rent, as I was going to be out of town and wouldn't be back until after the late date. But it turns out, they used ""July's rent"" to cover the cost of the reversal of June's rent. August, there's no issue.  The thing is though, I have not received any reversal of payment. I have received no refund, no return for any amount whatsoever. My bank statements show nothing being credited to my account in either the apartment complex's name or the management company. If I received the amount that was reversed, fine, sure, I'll pay what I owe, but that has not happened. There is no evidence that I have received the payment reversal. I am not paying an extra 95% of my rent to the company when there's still money unaccounted for.  Also to note, the reversal of payment amount, does not match the amount that was deducted from my account. So there's essentially about one months rent floating in the air somewhere."	No
617	So I rented at this somewhat shady apartment complex and I decided I will not renewed this year. The lease was a joint lease between me, Roommate A and Roommate B. Roommate A and I decided that we will no longer rent here and we're moving out meanwhile Roommate B decided that he will stay there and bring in new roommates. I decided that I did not want to renew this lease nor be involved with this apartment unit any more so I will not renew the lease and they can decide what to do on their own.  Fast forward a month, I heard nothing and the lease is almost over so I checked with my roommate. They said that they already renewed without me or my other roommate and then 2 new people signed the lease instead of us. The security deposit will not be given back to me but the 2 new tenants will be responsible for paying us back. I understand that the security deposit is probably binded to the the unit therefore if someone is staying in the unit, it remains. But they also told me that 'legally' the new tenants are required to pay us back. Is this true? What if the new tenants do not pay Roommate A and I our deposit back? Was it legal in the first place to have this apartment unit renewed without 2 of the leaseholders? Thanks!	No
618	"One of the stones of an expensive necklace I purchased fell out and broke.  This stone is unique to the manufacturer (because of its cut, I don't think I'll find it anywhere else).  I found the necklace still for sale on the brand's company website.   Ideally, I would purchase a replacement stone from them at a fair price.  In communication with their customer service team, they said ""normally we offer a one year warranty, however since the purchase was made over a year ago, we can't replace it. Also, we are not able to make repairs.""  Also they claim not to have any replacement stones.  I'm just looking to purchase a replacement stone so I don't have to purchase a whole new necklace.  Are there any consumer protection laws applicable?  Company HQ is in TX, I am in GA."	No
619	My older brothers house was raided by police. He has 2 kids which were taken into protective services. Right now I guess he is being charged with burglary, theft, possession of an illegal firearm, child abuse , possession of controlled substance. His wife is being charged with receiving stolen property, and possession of illegal substance. According to my younger brother who was staying there and witnessed the whole thing, all that was in the house was stolen stuff, and 3 meth pipes. Now I love my brother very much and I want to do what I can to help, but he's in Nebraska, and I'm in California. I don't think he can afford a lawyer so I was wondering if I could hire a lawyer from here to defend him in another state. I also want to see about taking custody of his kids while this all gets sorted out. Wtf do I do?There is more, but I'm on my phone right now.	No
620	Backstory: My girlfriend and I just moved from CT to AZ for her work and my school. We agreed to use a moving company to transport our belongings to AZ. We contracted Radius Moving and Storage Corp for approximately $3200 based on assumed square footage of boxes. We agreed to the date of 6/25 at 0900-1100 arrival time for pick up of boxes that we packed. Radius did a no call no show. I attempted to reach out to them via a number on their website once they were late. Neither my girlfriend or I could reach someone until around 3 hours past their designated time slot. This individual informed us that they don't know what happened to the first truck so they were going to send another truck with an ETA of 1600-1800. 1800 comes and goes, once again we try to reach out to them and get the same no pick up or direct to voice mail treatment we were exposed to the first time around. Around 2000 we finally get ahold of someone. He said that the 2nd truck was involved in an accident. While unfortunate this still leaves us without a moving truck. After a lengthy back and forth conversation the individual said he would get us a truck for 0700-0900 time slot tomorrow (6/26). I get up around 0630 to ensure everything is lined up for their arrival. 0900 comes and goes no call no show. The next couple hours are filled with the same phone call avoidance and general neglect for our situation that we had become accustom to. Finally around 1300 a car and truck arrive to pack up our things. They left around 1630 with our things.   The overall treatment of company and the lack of professionalism in their response and customer service was deplorable. I was in the military for 9+ years and moved a bunch of times, i had never received this kind of treatment. Due to this and the fact that they were over 30 hrs late past our agreed time, my girlfriend and I believed we should get some money off of the final cost of the move (4300$). They said that 100$ should suffice, which is a slap in the face. Over the last couple weeks my girlfriend has been on the phone with them every day to try and track down our stuff which hasn't even left CT. Reading through their contract it says they can take up to 30 working days to deliver our things. Which is same time then it takes to get household good delivered from Hawaii to NY. After all this we asked for more money off. They told us that since we had written a negative review of them on the internet they would not give us any additional money off. We had not written anything yet which means we are not an isolated incident. As such they said they would give us 300$ off but we had to sign a contract prior to receiving the money.     The question: How is the below contract even legal? What can be done legally to this company? We are already planning on writing up a formal complaint with the BBB.    It feels like this is blackmail to ensure we don't write a scathing review of their practices.          RELEASE AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF CLAIM  Date:    07/11/2017                                                                                         Job#:XXXXXXXXX    Upon receipt by the undersigned of a check for consideration of the undersigned or his agent heirs, administrators, executors, successors, and assigns here and completely release and further discharge Radius Moving and Storage, it’s past, present or future officers, directors, stock holders, agents, representatives, employees, affiliates, partner(s) and successors from any and all past, present or future claims, demands, obligations, actions, rights, damage costs, expenses and compensation of any nature whatsoever, whether based on tort, contract or other theory of recovery, which undersigned or anyone entitled to any recovery, now has or which may hereafter accrue or otherwise be required on account of, or in anyway going out of the contract for services rendered and entered into between the parties named here within.

621	I work in an office with one other co-worker. He is male and we have the same position but I am the senior of the two.  I requested a transfer to work in another state to live with my fiance. I worked on detail in the other state who is aware of my interest in transferring and would like to have me. Unfortunately, they can't hire right now.   After this request my supervisor, who is not the authority to determine if the transfer is approved, began treating me much worse. I get that being a jerk is not illegal but I have documented several incidences where my male co-worker was clearly favored.   I then was up for a promotion, which was at the discretion of my supervisor, and which I didn’t get. She said she decided I needed to obtain a job certification first which she hadn’t told me prior. Additionally, part of my supervisor’s job is to help support me in getting certified.   I made an informal complaint to her supervisor about what was going on and the treatment I’d been getting compared to my male peer. He thought she was being fair.   Since this complaint my supervisor has been even worse. Lack of communication, discussing my work with my co-worker and not me, and preventing me from working towards my certification. Other senior staff are aware of this and no one is trying to help me. She has a history of bullying her staff.   So I need the certification to get the promotion, as well as for my job, and I’ve been told to stop working towards requirements for the certification. I think this is considered retaliation and there is a financial loss from this.   Side note: She is still supporting my co-worker in progress towards his certification.  Also, I was told that my informal complaint didn’t impact any decision on approving a transfer. It’s basically political.  There’s a lot of other examples I have documented of unfair treatment but I don’t want to make this post too long.   Ultimately, I have great job security. I like my job and I don’t want to let one supervisor stop me from pursuing what I need to do to advance my career. I also don’t want to jeopardize my chances of working with the other state or anyone to think this is just complaining because I want t to transfer.  Any advice on what to do here? Pursue discrimination case or retaliation case? I was thinking about filing an informal grievance and going from there.   Thanks in advance!	No
622	Hey everyone. I'm not sure where to look for information, or what to search for. I've tried a bit, and found some information, but not complete.   So here's the situation.   I'm 8 months pregnant, my husband went to work for a company to go tree planting for a couple of months.   Turns out it's a shitty company and he wants to leave early. He told the boss that he needs to come back to help me, as I'm on sick leave currently.   His boss said two things that are making me scratch my head.   1. He needs me to provide a sick note detailing why I'm sick and what's wrong with me. I told my husband that in the note I provided my employer, it didn't say anything about why I am sick, just that I am sick and that I will be off work from this date until this date.   2. Then he said that if my husband leaves now, instead of paying per tree, my husband will get paid minimum wage for the hours worked. My husband also said that he can stay for one more week.   My husband doesn't have a copy of his contract, and will talk to his boss tomorrow to get a copy.   I'm just wondering about the legalities of leaving a contract early, and if the boss can change the rate of pay in this situation.   Also I tried looking into family sick leave in MB, and I found a phone number I can call to ask more. Unfortunately tomorrow is Sunday and I may have to wait until Monday to call.   Also if he is in a different province, what provinces labour laws should he be following, assuming this company is a MB company?   Thanks in advance.	No
623	I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back. Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this. After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time. By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything. I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts. Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?	No
624	A few months ago my boyfriend bought an apartment. When seeing it for the first time it looked okay apart from some minor finishing touches that had to be done, so my BF bought it. We were especially happy about the bathroom, since it was installed just two years ago and we wouldn't have to do anything about it in regard to (re)installing anything. When we moved in we noticed that there was a lot of water on the threshold of the bathroom, but at first we wrote it off as condensation. A few months later we wanted to put the finishing touches on the bathroom (before we mainly focused on new outlets, wallpaper and wooden panels which we had installed on the floor against the wall), which included putting on some silicone stuff on the edges of the tiles. The silicone stuff wouldn't stick and we noticed that the water wasn't condensation as we thought, but it seemed to come from underneath the tiles of the bathroom. We immediately called a plumber company and they came by to check for leaks. He had to remove some floor tiles and the tiles that are placed against the built-in bathtub. Long story short: the plumbers discovered that the bathtub was improperly installed; the construction on which the bathtub should be resting was not installed properly. Large parts of of the wooden beams were rotten due to water slipping through the silicone. This was only possible because the tub had no proper construction to rest on, causing the silicon between the tub and the wall tiles to slowly detach over time. Also the drainage pipes weren't properly installed, one of them was even broken, presumably from installing the bathtub. So, the leakage and water damage which came from that were caused by the work of the previous owners, who installed the bathroom incorrectly. We had to replace the tiles, the whole bath plus installation and drainage and the drainage of the sink. You can imagine that this was quite costly (±3000eu,-). We already sent a registered letter to inform the previous owner we hold them accountable for the sustained damages, but they haven't responded. What can we do now? I've heard it's very hard to prove that the previous owner had to know about the leakage, and that a legal case depends on proving this since this is one of the exceptions of the 'we bought the apartment with all its visible and hidden defects' thing in the contract (because the leakage wouldn't classify the apartment as 'unlivable'). I hope someone can give us advice on how to proceed. We both just finished school so we don't have a lot of money saved, and €3000,- is a lot of money for us. Especially since we didn't expect to have to redo parts of the bathroom.   We live in the Netherlands by the way. I know this sub consists mainly of US-based legal advice, but when searching I came across other countries too, so I hope this is okay. Any advice is welcome, in any case.  Thanks in advance :-)	No
625	We are in Ontario Canada and have been looking at places in Toronto, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario.  We signed one buyers representation agreement with an agent in the Toronto area when we were looking to lease a place in Toronto. We just moved to Toronto on July 1st and ended up finding a place without the agent.  The agent marked on file that he is helping us out for the Toronto central, east and west area. He says he only works in the Toronto area and Windsor is about 4 to 5 hours drive away.  In Windsor we are signing with another agent and purchased offer was accepted yesterday evening.  Today we are planning to send acknowledgment forms, sign buyer representation with the Windsor agent and so on.  I am wondering if there will be any problem with the previous agent trying to take the new ones commission or anything.  Any info helps!   ** TL;DR: Signing buyers representation with two different agents in two two different cities about 4 to 5 hours away from each other.  Neither of them work in the others duristiction but are in the same province. Any problems here?  **	No
626	[TX] I was driving in the left lane of traffic on highway 361 preparing to pass another car that was 1000 feet in front of me, I realize that I might have gotten into the left lane a little early but they were going slow and we were the only people on the road. As I'm coming up on the car I see a black SUV sitting in the median facing the wrong way and I slow down kind of panicking that they're going to pull out in front of me. I do not change lanes because I'm watching the SUV to see if they pull out in front of me. As I pass the SUV they turn their lights on and I realize it was a cop, I was not speeding at any point. I get pulled over and issued a ticket for driving in the left lane, the cop will not listen to the fact that I was preparing to pass a car until I saw him facing the wrong way in traffic and slowed down. What are my chances of fighting this? It's a $500 ticket and as I wasn't impeding the flow of traffic I don't really see what I did to warrant a ticket. The law is so ambiguous, and there is not place (that I can tell) that tells you when you can officially get into the left lane to pass.    Also worth noting, I have a Conceal Carry License but I've never owned a gun or really had anything to do with guns. Got it because my boyfriend is in the military and wanted me to get a gun and I kinda forgot I had it. The cop ran my DL and saw that I have a CCL and came back screaming that he could arrest me for not giving him my CCL with my DL but when I took the class they told is that we're under no obligation to give the officer our CLL granted we do not have a gun on our person, which I most definitely did not. I would really like to file an official complaint for this because as far as I can tell, he's just making up law to suit himself but I want to be sure that this is correct before I raise hell at the police station.

627	"As stated above, I am getting married and we are both signing a prenup. I don't come from any significant money, but my partners parents own several successful businesses that will eventually be passed down to her (she manages them currently). I have no problem signing a prenup excluding me from any inheritance or spousal support (I make good money, and have a good career), and my ""almost"" wife and I make very good income combined. Is there any legal shenanigans I should watch out when looking over this agreement? I obviously want to protect myself as well in the event that we get divorced. I am mostly looking for suggestions for things easy to overlook, before I sign I will go see a lawyer to look over it with me of course.  Thanks in advance!"	No
628	My aunt has sole custody of the kids, the court allows my uncle to speak to the kids when he wants to and vice versa. However he never calls the kids and instead harasses my aunt who put a restraining order against home because he's crazy and abusive.   My uncle is extremely authoritarian and tries to restrict everything he can, currently in divorce with my aunt; he does not allow the kids to speak to my aunt when it's his days or weekends.  He disables their internet on their iPads and blocks all her calls/texts so she never has an idea whether or not the kids are safe. She fears one day the kids may get kidnapped from him and she won't be able to get a hold of them...  I'm concerned for their safety to and am curious, if I buy my cousin a phone and pay for his services per month to be able to keep in touch when needed; is my uncle allowed to confiscate it or place restrictions?   Any help is truly appreciated, thank you!	No
629	My brother and his ex were never married and have been together for 6 or 7 years. They have 3 children and have lived in Iowa all throughout their relationship. They split up a couple months ago and had been sharing custody without any official agreement. She just left and took the kids, she is currently on her way to Georgia. What are his rights.  Where will a custody battle take place?	No
630	Hey legal helpers, my brother-in-law just moved to the USA a week ago and is approved for his Green Card but we're still waiting for it to be sent along.  In any case, he got unexpected Misdemeanor citation when he was caught swimming at a county quarry by sheriffs in Iowa. Does anyone have any experience in guessing how this could affect his immigration status? His record is very clean excluding this one screw up.  Thank you much for any advice or ideas!	No
631	Hello /r/Legaladvice,  I guess i'm not sure where to turn here. 3 months ago I completed my graduate degree. Upon doing so the owner of the company I work for told me that everyone was proud of me for doing so, but he felt that the company may not be able to pay me what I am worth, and encourage me to go fourth and find somewhere that would be willing to pay what they felt my degree deserved. I was very appreciative of their honesty, and up until that point loved my job. So i've been job hunting for a few months, found another great opportunity and accepted an offer. I went into my current job and told them immediately because I wanted to give them as much notice as possible, because they've been so great to me. This all happened yesterday. I came in today, and was basically told to pack my shit and that today was my last day. Do I have any recourse here? I would have started the new job next week had I known that giving my notice would just turn around and bite me in the ass? I have nothing in writing as at the time I didnt consider it would be necessary. Now i'm liking going a month without pay (both company pay bi-weekly, and new job is a cycle behind). Am I entitled to any form of payment, as the owner very clearly verbally stated that I would be able to work out a 2 week notice. Does being let go today, negate the chance of receiving unemployment in the mean time? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Apologies if this is the incorrect subreddit for these types of questions.   Location: Minnesota, US	No
632	So around two to three years ago a mortgage company by the name of cove map fund llc bought a house next to us in a private neighborhood that's more upper middle class/ lower upper class. They rented it to this family that very clearly could not afford to pay the rent on a house of this caliber. Several people on disability, many adult children living at home, dogs chained in yard, cars in blocks in driveway. They had so many cars they practically blocked the street when they parked.  Anyway they defaulted a couple months ago and moved out. Now the company is dumping the house and it's completely trashed on the inside and is poorly maintained on the outside.   The house is already listed undervalue and the realtor who we are friends with know they can't sell it any where near that. 2 story 4,100sq ft.  Is there anything we can do legally to force them to fix the house it's having a severe effect on our home equity.   Thanks, and sorry for the long post.	No
633	Hi, I live in Arizona and I've told my apartment complex that my A/C is broken but they haven't fixed it yet. It's passed 48 hours now and I've told them again but no fix. Is there anything I can do?	No
634	We have had water damage in our bathroom ceiling for over two weeks and I have contacted the landlord once via text and once via a letter. when we texted she said she would send someone but never did, and she has not responded to my letter yet, although its only been two days. We have been planning to move soon (which the landlord knows), but now we are considering leaving at the end of the month and forfeiting our security deposit.the problem is that seems wrong to me because it feels like we are legally in the right. I have looked at the RTA but I still do not know the legality of leaving or how long she has to fix something like water damage. any legal help is appreciated as I do not know how to proceed and I am worried she will come after us for rent if we bail without giving a months notice.	No
635	Long story short, I traded in my old car for a preowned BMW a couple of months ago. The BMW was 5 hours away in PA, and because of my recent move/mother being on the registration to the old car, it was tough to get the paperwork lined up to pick up the car.   She had to sign a SPOA to give me the right to trade the car in and get the new one. I guess the dealer didn't receive it back in time, so we wrote up two contracts, one with the trade and one without. The contract without trade was to be voided upon arrival of the SPOA and mailed to me. It was voided, but never went to me, until the family-friend lawyer got involved. Magically I had everything I needed.   My latest problem is I understand my old car has sold, and the previous owner is now emailing and calling me about the car saying he's have all these problems with it. From what I understand the contract signed at the dealer prevented them from giving out my information. A quick search online also suggests this is against FTC regulation. I'm not looking for any sort of compensation for this, but my question is, can the dealer legally give out my contact information without my consent?	No
636	Just like the title says, my brother's rent was raised $300 a month starting next month. Probably beside the point but a further relative (cousin) in the same apartment house (house broken into apartments) was also raised $400 a month and all of this comes a week after the cousin was sexually assualted by a plumber the landlord hired doing work on the house. The police were called and a report was taken. We don't know what eventually happened as everyone just got back in town from vacation.  Is this legal in the state of Nevada? Is there any recourse? He has a wife and 3 children and we do not have the room or resources to do much to help them right now. I don't know what to do in this situation and I could really use some advice.   Thank you for any advice.	No
637	"Hi all,   So I had a lapse of judgment and got caught up in a craigslist apartment rental scam. I live in NY, and was in NY when I transferred a security deposit plus 6 months rent to a 'landlords' bank account for an apartment I was going to rent in California. It wasn't until the landlord requested a $10K 'immediate refundable credit check' that required me sending him an additional $10K that he would then immediately send back, that I became suspicious. I have never met this landlord, nor seen the apartment, and in retrospect there were a lot of signs that this was a scam that I missed. Since requesting this credit check from, I have taken the following actions:  -I saved and printed out my email conversation, and all text messages, with the individuals I was in contact with.  -I researched who the real owner of the apartment is, and have been trying to get in touch with that individual to confirm he is not renting out his apartment. I want to be 100% sure this is a scam, with proof, which is why I've reached out to him.  -I called a local California police department, and they directed me to go to a NY police department since ""I was in NY at the time I made the funds transfer, therefore I am a victim in NY and should go through a NY police department"".   -I went to a NY precinct with the emails / texts / bogus lease printed out. In order to confirm this was a scam, the NY officer told me to request from the landlord a refund in the form of a bank certified check (that way I don't have to give him my bank account info). If the landlord refused to refund my cash, the police officer said I could return to the station to file a police report. He also said that I should call up the Cali PD again and push to have them work on this, since the apartment is in Cali and since I'm moving there in a week.   -Today, I am going to go to my bank of america branch and talk with someone there about possibly reversing the transfers I sent. I will also call the scammers bank and see if they can freeze his account.  -After the bank, I plan on heading to the FBI offices in NYC with all of the evidence that I have (the texts, emails, lease, bank transfers, name of real owner, the scammers bank info) and hope to convince them to look at the case. I'm going to say that this scammer could be scamming other people as well, and therefore it's worth their time.    Other than that, I'm not sure what routes I can go. Any thoughts are appreciated with regards to the best path moving forward."	No
638	In early July, I established a subletter for my room in the apartment I was living in before moving to a different state. He applied through the leasing agency and was put on the lease, which ends in September.   Just yesterday, I received pictures from him showing a burn hole in the carpet in my room about the size of a fist. He claimed that he forgot to tell me about the burn, but that it was there before he moved in. I know that the burn was not there before leaving the apartment. My roommates who I have contacted about it agree that it was not there when I moved out. I also have a picture taken before moving out that doesn't show the burn mark.   My question is about what options I have if I confront the subletter about his lie and he refuses to pay for the damages. The security deposit was paid by me at the start of the lease. When I contacted my rental company, they said this was likely a situation that I would have to work out with my subletter. The only sort of leverage I can think of is threatening to take him to small claims court with the evidence I have. Are there any other routes I should consider?  Thanks for reading!	No
639	My ex-boyfriend and I purchased a condo together in Chicago.  Both of our names are on the title.  We both contributed 50% of the down payment.  After we moved in, we agreed he would take care of 100% of the monthly mortgage payment, and he did.  After we broke up and I moved out, he said that he would keep the condo in my name and I could have it after he passed away.  He has since said that he wants me to sign over the condo to him, with no compensation, claiming that I owe years of back payments, and the total cost is greater than the condo.  He says that he has signed his half over to his daughter who will get ownership upon his passing.  He says that he will sue me for abandonment of property if I don’t comply.  Does he have legal standing to sue me for back payment or abandonment of property? Can he will his half to his daughter? What is the best way to resolve this issue?	No
640	"So my brother and I have been living together.  We are both adults (I'm 27 he's 34).  Last week we got into a fist fight.  He managed to get on top of me and attempted to gouge out my eyes before I forced him off by getting my pocket knife out and slashing at him.  That night after I got home from work I tried to talk to him and he said ""the next time you hit me I will assume you intend to kill me and I will take my knife, and I will gut your fat sorry ass.  I will carve your fucking face off before I gouge your eyes out.""  Now normally that would be enough for an arrest but I hit him about 20 times and gave him a mild concussion.  I want to make sure I can press full charges and have his 2 kids put into foster care with out legal repercussions my self"	No
641	Hi, I was told by r/personalfinance to post this here.  So, I am going to try to make this as brief as possible, but I also need to add in enough background information that may also help provide a better answer.  My dad and mom have been living together for nearly 30 years, my dad has worked full time post of that time in various positions. He is retired now and receives a significant amount of retirement income each month, totaling between 3k-4k. My mom has worked, but only infrequently and only has SS of about $500 per month.  Their combined income should be enough to live off of, but... My mom has been recklessly spending money on various things, mostly dining out and groceries that seem to disappear. Not only that, but my mom and sisters are semi-hoarders and breeders of animals (cats and dogs) which are destroying the house and costing them hundreds if not thousands of dollars each month to maintain. The amount of cats and dogs combined are almost 20. My mom also has power of attorney over my dad for unrelated reasons.  I recently found out that my mom forced my dad to open several credit cards in his name and has maxed out of them to a total of 25k. Additionally, in the past week my mom and my sisters have left me and my dad at home with a barely operable car and we do not know where they have gone or when they are coming back. The biggest issue is a large settlement that is incoming for my dad to the amount of 200k. Since my mom has power of attorney over my dad I need to know whether or not she can take the money out right or if we have time to stop her.     He has already been to a notary public to revoke the power of attorney and has a set appointment date for receiving the settlement in person. So, my question is, what the hell do I do or can do? What the hell do we do when we get the 200k? My mom and dad also own the house, both of their names are on it. My dad wants to setup a living trust and invest the 200k and keep it away from my mom. Is this the right decision? I just need help or advice.  Additionally, my dad is going to see a lawyer on Thursday about getting the POA fully revoke and we'll see  Thank you.	No
642	So, we have $850 in electricity bills at the moment and my housemates are only willing to reduce the bill by $100 even after they spent 60+ days using an 1800w heater many hours a day, have spent a significant amount of time more than me in the house and use a significant amount more than myself in general. About a month ago I made it clear I was aware of their excessive use and said it was erring expensive and prior to winter I had indicated we should try not to use the heater because it would be expensive. I want them to take $200 off of the total of the both because I've told them for the reasons above that it's unfair and that I personally reduced my use and suffered so that I could I afford it. What are my legal options in the way of making this a fair deal? The bill is in their name and I will not be paying till an agreement is reached.	No
643	So I lived with a roommate who refused to pay the last month of rent and to avoid it showing up on our credit, my girlfriend and I paid it. Obviously, I am less then pleased with him. However, lo and behold he must not have provided a forwarding address, as we just got all three shares of the down payment. Now, the return we got was about 1000 which splits evenly. The share of rent was 343 plus the 50 dollar late fee he caused. Now, my thinking is, fuck him, that's essentially the exact value I am owed. What kind of repercussions could I be looking at if I just take it?	No
644	GF moved in with BF three months ago. She never paid rent and was never on the lease. She did change her mailing address to said home, though. Also has lived there for 3 months consecutively. With texts and emails between the two talking about her moving in and living there rent free.  After a personal dispute between the two, she came home from work and found the locks were changed. He refused to open the door and told her to kick rocks.   She called the cops to see if they could get him to open the door and escort her in to grab her belongings.   When the cops came he refused to open the door, so after about ten minutes the cops suggested she brings a friends next time and then left.  That's where I come in. She wants to go get her stuff tonight but wants to know what her legal rights are? She's afraid because she wasn't on the lease he now technically owns her stuff now.   She made an itemized list of everything she owns and with the reasonable replacement value and it totals up to about $10,000.    He is also not the owner of the home, it is his older brothers (extra) home that he lets him live in. So technically the owner/land lord is the older brother and the BF is a tenant (also not on a lease)	No
645	We have 3 kids and we're going to co-parent/joint custody. We've agreed upon splitting assets and such. We want it to be legal and for our agreements to have legal weight. Our best option? And can we waive the 90-day wait period?  Also a friend and I have recently started a company and I need something legal that she can sign releasing any future claim/stake in this. It started after she wanted to divorce and she has had no hand in it. Is there a waiver for something like this?  **TL/DR** Wife and I are filing for a no fault divorce w/ joint custody of kids. Can we do this without lawyers and keep it inexpensive?	No
646	My friends soon to be ex husband moved from their home in Florida to Iowa. He some how made himself an account manager on her Verizon account. Then he went and charged a $1000 iPhone to her account and split the line. When she tried telling Verizon it was fraudulent they basically told her she was up the creek. Can there be legal action taken here ?	No
647	I filed a petition in Small Claims in Nueces County Texas that went unanswered.  I am now told I need to file for a default judgement.  Can someone explain how to do this?  I am not in Texas so this is something I will need to send in.  Thanks,	No
648	I recently bought a house and am planning on bringing in roommates to fill my extra bedrooms. As a landlord, I know I am not allowed to discriminate based on age, gender, race, etc. However, how about as a roommate? For example, I am 22 and would prefer my roommates to be close to my own age. Am I allowed to consider this when choosing roommates/tenants?	No
649	Dad just died, now my Mom is trying to put all her ducks in a row in case she passes too. I have 2 younger siblings that Mom wants things to go to equally. Issue is that my younger brother and his wife and kid are moving into my Mom's house (so they can save rent) and my Mom wants to give them the house if she passes away, but wants all her assets split equally. How can she set this up so that it balances equally for all 3 siblings? She told me that the house she wants to put in my brother's name is not her largest asset (IRA, savings, etc).  I understand that my brother may help care for the house while he's there, and might take on some of my Mom's care down the road (but probably not, it'll be me, the eldest, as he's kinda flaky).	No
650	"My wife and I bought a house in April of 2008. We decided to refinance the mortgage this summer, and got that process started. After a few weeks, I am contacted by the title company working on the refinance, and they inform me that there was a UCC Lien placed against my title in 2006 and they could not proceed with the refinance until the title is cleared.  After doing a bit of research, we discovered that the prior owners had a water softener system installed and did not meet their payment obligations for the system, which resulted in the original UCC Lien. The property eventually foreclosed and we ended up purchasing it. The Lien on the title was not mentioned at any time during any of the meetings we had with our realtor and title company while purchasing the property. The Lien was passed from the company that sold the water system to a collection agency, and was updated two times in the past 9 years (all without my knowledge). All of the Lien documentation is in the name of the prior owners, but it is still attached to the title.  At the end of June, I submitted a claim with the title insurance company that we used at our 2008 closing. I heard back from them today in the form of an email with much legal jargon describing why my claim was rejected. I have read and reread the letter many times over, and I still don't fully understand what they are trying to tell me. My synopsis of their email is that the title insurance is designed to protect against Liens on the property itself, not against personal property. However, I could be completely mis-reading.  One of the paragraphs in the email says: ""Texas case law also provides that following the valid foreclosure of a senior lien, junior liens, if not satisfied from the proceeds of sale, are extinguished. Arnold v. Eaton, 910 S.W.2d 181 (1995). Here, to the extent the UCC Lien was a lien against the Property without priority over a conflicting interest (which is not conceded), the UCC Lien was recorded subsequent to the Prior DOT,  therefore it is  a  junior  lien and  thus,  the  UCC  Lien  would  have  been extinguished  on  or about August, 2007, upon foreclosure of the Prior DOT. ""  I read the above as, ""Your situation should not be happening.""   Well, it is happening, and it is frustrating. Is my next step meeting with a lawyer, or is there something else that I can do?"	No
651	Okay so this issue takes place in Austin, TX. Here is what is happening and I need advice on this subject...it's for my sister. She had a child when she was 19 with a guy she had only known for 2 months who was involved in some pretty sketchy things illegal things I believe but I am not sure enough to put the people around him at risk. Here's an example when my sisters child was around 3 he would still visit his dad and the dads girlfriend at that time had a twin sister who was threatened to be beaten if she didn't give them the whereabouts obviously they were going for the one who was dating the dad but they didn't know that she had a twin. Anyway, when my sister was with him for about 2 years, he hit her a lot the cops were called maybe 3 or 4 times but she never reported him officially. The child is now six but he stopped taking interest in him when he was 3. When the baby went to see him he would not play with him it was mostly his girlfriend at the time who would look after him. My sister then decided that she didn't feel he was safe seeing him or happy or well taken care of so she didn't let him see him. From what I understand he tried to see him a couple of times. The dad has never NEVER provided for my nephew my sister has always earned all the money and she has supported my nephew financially. The dad wants to see the child now after 3 years and he showed up. He is on the birth certificate my sister wants to get full custody of him. She's afraid for their lives is there anything that she can do to win and protect herself and my nephew from him??	No
652	"My wife and I recently got married and headed over to the social security office in our city to change her name. She decided that she ""hates"" her middle name and thus requested it to be changed to her mothers first name. Normally, they don't ask you questions about a maiden name change if you have your marriage license on you.   Long story short the name got changed and about a month later, which is today, we headed into the DMV to update her license to a newer version with her new name on it. They told us at the DMV that the name was changed without a petition of the court indicating a lawful name change. How can I get this fixed? Why did the social security office allow us the get the name changed if it is unlawful? What course of action should I take?    Thank you for reading my long post.    TL; DR: Wife and I got married, tried to change her middle name to something unrelated, social security did it, DMV told us we messed up and sent us to the clerk court, now we either pay money to fix it, or change her name back."	No
653	I apologize in advance for my grammar, I'm currently typing this on mobile. My apartment decided to not renew my lease, I was wondering what I can do to make it the easiest process since my management does not like me since I left negative reviews about the place on Google. She asked me to remove it several time in which I politely declined since she refused to resolve any issues I brought to her attention.  Is it possible for my landlord to leave a negative tenant review on me as retaliation for the reviews even if I always paid my bills early and never had a complaint from the neighbors?   My apartment has some wear and tear from the previous tenant such as chips on the closet shelves , rust on the bathtub (which was hidden under an adhesive mat that started to pull up a few months into living here)   I did a video walk through from the day i moved in, is that enough proof to prevent them from pinning on me and charging extra fees?	No
654	I've never had this sort of thing happen before and I'm not sure if I can even pursue anything. But I thought I'd put it out there. My girlfriends brother in law had to help dislodge it from my windpipe.	No
655	"Im 14 years old and my father has been emotionally abusing me and my mother for years. Divorce has been an idea that has come up and it seems like it wouls be a good idea if it weren't for who my father is. He is a  lawyer and pretty big name in the town that I live in. Last time he kicked my mom out he tried to make her quit her job and said he will send her ""papers"". This makes me fear what would happen in the event of a divorce. I also have recordings of him talking to someone I believe he's having an affair with. What is the best way to proceed with a divorce and protect me and my mom. He's also very possessive of me and the property that him and my mom share. I'm sorry that this post is all over the place but this was the best way for me to describe my situation.   Thanks"	No
656	"Hi, so this may not be the right place for this post but there's recently been a ""friend"" of my grandmother show up and is taking advantage of her.   Little backstory: She is 87, was diagnosed with dementia and early stage Alzheimer's, and is in the process of moving from Massachusetts several states away to be closer to her daughters (my mom and aunt). The ""friend"" used to be a TV service guy for her, maybe ~5 years in the past. In the last 6 months he showed back up in her life, mysteriously and out of the blue. She claims he ""helps her with everything"" but we are pretty sure that is not true, he has done a handful of favors for her (including admittedly two quite large ones, driving her ~1 hour 30 minutes and the other driving her and a truckload of her furniture ~5 hours.).   About 2 months ago, she gave him $10,000 with which to buy a car (which he supposedly would use to drive for Lyft and pay her back $100/wk, which isn't happening). The kicker of the situation is, she opened a joint account with him and he has a debit card with which he is draining her money. She transfers money from her checking account to his ""sub""/joint account and then from there he spends it (gas, groceries, shopping at malls, etc), or withdraws it (including recently a $4,000 cash withdrawal). When we spoke with the bank about it their attitude was ""she is our client and we have to respect her wishes, if she wants to open this account with this man she can do that"" blah blah. Doctors say they can't do anything because she is still compos mentis.  I'm at a loss for what to do. Can my family and I go after this guy to recover some of the money he has stolen from her? is this even illegal? It's clearly elder financial abuse in my mind, but I don't know what grounds we have for any legal or financial recourse. Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated. I can also provide more info but will be at work most of the day so will only be on and off.  Thanks!"	No
657	Background: This one is tricky because I am in the army(until Nov) and my younger adopted  14 year old brother resides with my mother in California. She has a great heart at times but it is no secret her mental health is on the decline. And she is prone to tantrums of extreme anger in which she takes it out on my brother. My little sister and older brother that live there will attest to it. Our father passed away 9 months ago and so she is worse than ever but so are all of us and the tension is high and I constantly worry my little brothers emotional, mental and physical will being around her.  Questions:   How could I go about getting custody of him?  If I succeed is there a way for me to be given the state support she receives for him(that she frivolously spends away) after my father passed?	No
658	My family owes state taxes to the tune of about $700. (We owe more than that, but I don't recall what year this is about)   Yesterday, July 14th, we received a letter stating that a lien had been placed. Today, we received a letter stating that we had ten days to do something before they would begin garnishing our wages and selling our personal property.   We can not afford this. My wife lost her job this same week and we have close to $5000 in debt from a bed hold at the nursing home my mother-in-law lived at before her death last month. We were barely making ends meet to begin with and are tapped out as far as any other way to get money. Is there anything we can do?	No
659	I have a friend who has been having issues with a roommate and it came to a head last night. She tried to call the cops on them and get them kicked out, which didn't happen because she didn't follow the eviction process whatsoever, and so they have plenty of time to stay there. However, she decided to leave herself, and took the router/modem for the internet when she did. My friend paid half of the internet bill, although she has no real physical proof of that, but does have a verbal agreement for paying half of the utilities, and also her occupation REQUIRES that she has the internet, so she is unable to make money without it. Is this legal, is the roommate who technically has her name on the bill allowed to do this? Can my friend really do anything besides try to sue her? She doesn't really have the money for that kind of thing.	No
660	This is complicated.  We are trying to buy a house on an Indian reservation.  I am Native, he isn't.  The tribe and BIA won't put him on the land lease.  (white guy) I will not be on the mortgage. My income debt ratio is not viable as I am not working right now- I am a student.  How does community property speak to one spouse being on the land lease and the other being on the mortgage?	No
661	My grandma is 88 years old, and despite having three children, she suddenly only feels comfortable sharing her finances with her eldest. My grandparents had major dollars in the bank a few years ago, the last time my mom was allowed to see their accounts. My aunt has always been under financial pressure, and we believe that my aunt is taking advantage of their fortune to pay off their huge debts and allow her son to pay down his gigantic mortgage. My aunt, who was given power of attorney, has her own debit card under my grandmas account and sold our cottage without notice or allowing us to see any documents. Despite the will showing that the cottage should be split evenly between the three children, we only received a fourth, and no explanation. When we ask were the other fourth went, my aunt told us that it was going into my grandmas bank account (the one she has full access to), even though my grandma used to have more than enough money to cover living expenses for the rest of her life a few years back.  Before my grandpa passed away a few years ago, he warned us that there was money missing from his bank account, and told us to sue my aunt. He informed us that someone was making purchases with his money. After he told us this, my aunt and her family shut down all communication with us. Then my grandparents stopped talking to my family, and grandma has barely contacted me or my family for years (mental illness is a huge possibility). Every time we go over, my aunt insists on being there, not giving us a second alone with her. The scariest part of this is that is could have been resolved easily, had my aunt brought us to the bank and showed us that she hadn't taken unfairly from my grandparents account. My uncle has tried to sue them in the past and has not yet been successful. When I see them at family events they can barely look us in the face. It is very clear that they had been getting away with taking large sums of cash from my grandparents bank account without them or us knowing. Do we have a case of elder abuse or abuse of power of attorney?	No
662	Is there any way I can get my money back? 2 days have gone by and this guy hasn't done **ANY** work to my car. I'm [pretty sure](https://imgur.com/a/QCVc8) he has ran off with my money... What can I do to recover my money?	No
663	"I need some help just to make sure I've got all my stuff in order before I talk to this company on Monday. Thanks in advance.  Situation: I got a Certified Letter from a company named Robertson's Ready Mix in Corona, CA today. I am named as the ""Owner or Reputed Owner or Public Agency"" and my property address is where they are threatening a lien against unless I pay them the amount of $2,627.04. They claim that a company R.A. Johnson Co was contracted by me and they were in turn subcontracted to do Cement work for improvements on my property address.  Feeling kind of confused, I started doing some research. My Home Owner Association had contracted R.A. Johnson to fix a drain on Association Property (not on my property or address). Somehow either R.A. Johnson Co. used my home address and did not pay Robertson's Ready Mix.  I personally have never spoken with, authorized, entered into contract with, or even met R.A. Johnson Co. The work performed was not on my property, but across the street from my house (as can be seen on my surveillance footage). The Association Board was the ones who approved the work for R.A. Johnson Co on Association Common Property. I happen to be the closest address. Am I liable cause someone authorized work, used my address as where the work was performed and never paid their subcontractors?  Thanks."	No
664	TL;DR My uncle stole ~$1000 from my father after his final social security direct deposit and we have proof. We want to force payment since we don't think he will cooperate, but we don't want to put his ass in jail. Can someone comment on whether we could seek a judgment to garnish his wages in a civil suit and not a criminal suit?  Long version: My father died at the beginning of July and my uncle helped himself to his final social security deposit afterwards, we believe by way of forging checks.  We wish to recoup this money and apply it to funeral expenses. On principle I'd rather not let him get away with this. But my brother and I agree that we don't really wanna put the fool behind bars for this and we're not sure if this would be criminal or civil if it came to court. My brother is in the process of getting executorship because I am overseas and it's easier for him.  My question is, could we press charges and keep him from being incarcerated? We both had the thought that since it's related to social security and that's federal, this could blow up in a way we don't want.   We're of course trying to settle this out of court first and foremost, but my uncle stays unbelievably intoxicated between alcohol and prescription pills he gets from the VA. He is almost never in a sober state of mind and therefore next to impossible to reason with. In some stupid way he was actually trying to dupe us into believing the bank was at fault for the money he withdrew and that is the reason he actually mailed the bank statement proving his guilt to us.  Thanks in advance.	No
665	I moved into a new apartment (metro Detroit area, MI) recently and I've seen a couple bugs. I haven't really seen evidence of a substantial infestation, but there's definitely enough that I'm concerned. I submitted a maintenance request and yesterday a pest control company came.  The little description they left behind basically said they killed a spider in the bathroom and attributed its presence to the time of year. I had left a note describing where I had seen bugs, and the location of a couple dead bugs. In my maintenance request I included pictures of two bugs in my closet and mentioned seeing another in the kitchen.  After reading the description of work done and stepping into the next room, there was a bug immediately visible on the ceiling.  I'm concerned because I'm not convinced a thorough inspection occurred. What would be required for me to get a company I trust to do an inspection? Under what circumstances could I subtract that from my rent? I still have to talk to the landlord about this, and I doubt it will be necessary, but I'd like to know.  Another concern is that the problem will progress and eventually I will be blamed for the presence of bugs since no issues were found soon after move in. Is there anything I can do to protect myself from this?	No
666	"We live in NC and currently the temperature is mid to upper 90's every day. Yesterday, I smelled a burning in our house, like a plastic burning, but could not find any source. It happened once or twice over the next hour or two then stopped. I thought it was weird, but didn't fret too much. The wiring in this house is very ""eccentric"" and I wrote it off.  That happened around 10 am. Around 1 pm I looked at the thermostat. It was ~84 F in the house when the temperature was set to 74 F. This had happened before so I wasn't super concerned. Last time it was because I had left the blinds on our large glass sliding doors up and they let a LOT of sun in. I shut the blinds.  The temperature didn't go down. At the behest of my fiance (I wanted to see if it cooled down over night) I called the land lord and told him that we needed an AC repair. This was thursday night.  Friday morning, the house had stayed the same temperature overnight. My fiance left to take an exam and I stayed in the house. By 9 am it was 90 F in the house. By noon it was 94. Through this I kept texting the landlord saying that this was an emergency and that we needed the fix asap. He stated that he had called the company his home warranty group contracts with and they were just waiting for the service number to come in.   (An aside: we rented this house specifically for this warranty. It was a selling point. ""You call me (landlord) and within 24 hours they will be in contact with you."" I checked the lease, he doesn't mention it. Of course.)  I call my fiance and organize taking our pets to her veterinarian office (she is a vet and works there) for the day, thinking that we'd get it repaired quickly. Around 3 pm the landlord tells me that due to large volume they wouldn't be able to come until 9 am to 1 pm MONDAY.  I tell him this is unacceptable. It is 99 F in our house. (It is hotter but our thermostat doesn't go into triple digits. Why would it?) I tell him that I know it's not his fault but he has failed us and that he needs to contract with a new repair company. He goes into some platitudes about how he knows it's hot but that he and his family have had to deal with it before. Just open the windows and reverse the fans. And he won't get a new company because it won't be under warranty. And this is an emergency call. The soonest anyone else could get out there was wednesday.  I then let my fiance handle him for a bit. She's chomping at the bit. After more runaround he gives her the same spiel about it being hard. She calls another repair company ""OurCityName Heating and Air"". They say they can be out here on Saturday (today) and it will cost $50 plus the cost of repairs.  We ask our landlord if we can hire them and prorate the rent for the repairs (assuming it's less than our rent). No again. Out of warranty. We try and explain that this is very expensive to us. We're in a new town and having to stay in hotels AND board our pets and that we need help.  Doesn't care.  So what can we do? Our house is literally unlivable right now. It's summer in the south. It's not getting cooler any time soon. We are having to pay out of pocket for lodging and board for our pets."	No
667	"I hope this is the right sub.   When I went through immigration, they pulled up my ""rap sheet"", and even though I've never been convicted of a felony, they can see where I have been arrested for one. My actual record is clean (I have two marijuana related misdemeanors), but they said they need ""court papers stating that you have been cleared of all felonies"" that showed up on my report. I tried contacting my lawyer and he said he needs to charge me for ""post conviction representation"" for it to clear up, but I feel like that's just bullshit. Is there anything I can do without having to spend money? I didn't think it would be so hard to get into Canada. Will I have this problem traveling to other countries? Any advice is greatly appreciated."	No
668	"We got a letter telling us about the deductions from our deposit. Most of the stuff made sense but one item was ""Cleaning of unit 36 hrs @ $35/hr."" Is that normal? The rest of the list was   Replacement of broken door on northwest bedroom - $200.00   Cleaning of uniy 36 hrs @ 35.00/hr - $1,260.00  Carpet cleaning - $250.00  Replacement of broken glass at covered carport - $75.00  Reparing of patched holes on sheet rock walls and painting of same areas after patching. 3 hrs @ 35.00/hr - $105.00  Disposal of items left in house (this one we previously discussed) - $550.00  Replacement of broken blind - $40.00  Reparing of garage overhead door. - $150.00  My main question is is the cleaning hrs just the total from all the other listed cleaning and thats just the pay for labor?"	No
669	Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	No
670	I sold my first ever car with a broken transmission to some guy who claimed to own a scrap yard and told me he was going to scrap it. This appears to have never happened and now the car I haven't seen in 2+ years has been impounded by the city of Houston. It says I am the REGISTERED owner and also says there is a registered lien holder as well. I do not want to be on the hook for a $20 daily storage fee and the tow. What can I do to help make sure the city knows I am NOT the owner of the car still? I signed this title over to this guy at the scrap yard, who from my understanding was supposed to SCRAP the title but he did not. This is in Houston, Texas. I do not have a copy of the bill of sale right now and I'm currently looking for it	No
671	Lived in a furnished house. Upon leaving everything was up to spec.  2 months later I see he has done a lot of work to the outside like putting up a new fence and driveway and all of a sudden I am served with a small claims of 2400.  The damages he's seeking is replacing every dish ware, cleaning, new blankets, new couch, new pillows, pretty much he needs to everything new again. I'm assuming it's part of his remodel budget.   Assumptions aside, I have video of a final walk though on my end that shows clearly all the furnishings in good condition besides normal wear. He's asking brand new price and all the items intiallly were second hand.  How do I counter?	No
672	As the title says, the house took weather damage. The county claims we've been rebuilding the house. In reality, it's been a mix of cleaning/organizing/placing vapor barrier to prevent any more water entry/removing mold/removing unsafe structures. No construction. Most of the house was already not done to code when we bought it.  Consequences are fines and doubling the price of any future permits.  So what's going on? Is this legal? It seems like an extreme amount of duress on an already painful situation.	No
673	Lease expired June 30th. In Florida landlords have 15 days to return the deposit if there are no claims and 30 days to send an itemized list of claims if there are any.  On July 10th I sent LL a text with my new address which was acknowledged by him. By this time I had also set up mail forwarding with the post office from the address of the old house.  On July 31st (31 days after the lease ended) I sent him a text asking him if the deposit was in the mail and headed to the new address. He replied thanks for the reminder, he'll send it tomorrow.  Today, he texted me that cleaning cost $350 for the whole house, and that was some minor wear and tear but that he wouldn't charge me for it, and that he'd put a check in the mail today for $1800. The problem with this math is that the security deposit was $2250, not $2150. He is likely confused because that was the security deposit and rent from the year previous.  My thoughts on the cleaning itself: he was having the house cleaned ON the 30th. We handed over the keys on the 29th. He was also talking about getting cleaning people to the house weeks before the end of the lease. He was asking us to leave us the keys early if possible to facilitate him having them there before the lease ended. I believe that the house was not dirty beyond the level of 'normal wear and tear.' It needed routine dusting and mopping, but nothing beyond that. However, I made the mistake of not taking pictures on my way out, so I'm not sure if I have a leg to stand on there. I did take pictures when we moved in, and there was trash in the backyard and drywall dust and paint inside. $350 is also a lot to clean an 1800 sqft house.  Another thing he did that I'm not sure is relevant or not: he failed to give me a receipt for the security deposit per the FL statute, which should have disclaimed the bank it was being held at and whether it was accruing interest or not.   My plan is this:  1) Stop texting him. Start communicating via certified mail (which is actually also how he was supposed to notify me of claims in the first place according to the statute)  2) After I get the check, DONT cash it, and send a certified letter with the following information (summarized):  * Say that I was your tenant at address X until June 30th, and paid my rent regularly. I cooperated with handing the keys over a few days early to accomodate your request, stated over a week in advance, for cleaning.  * State the timeline of the texts that went back and forth, and that I have received his check (I actually haven't yet, but I want to prepare the letter so I can send it out on the same day I get the check)  * State that the refund is not accepted, and while I do object to the claim itself, more importantly, he's forfeited his right to claim the security deposit per florida statute  83.49(3). Statute attached.  * Even if the claim were legitimate, the $1800 is not correct because the total deposit was $2250.   * For the reasons above, I request that you mail the full security deposit in the amount of $2250 to my address below. A failure on your part to do so within 15 days will result in court action on my part. Please note that the prevailing party in court actions of this nature are also entitled to their court costs and attorney fees.  **My questions are the following:**  **Is there anything wrong with the content of  my letter or my plan? I thought it would be best to not go into the detail of the cleaning objection and stick to the deadline thing.**  **Am I leaving myself open to him simply returning the deposit and then him suing me for the cleaning? The statute says he may file an action for damages after return of the deposit. That would suck because if my case for that is bad I'd be out HIS attorney fees and court costs in that separate action.**   Statute: http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0000-0099/0083/Sections/0083.49.html  &gt;(3) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may disburse advance rents from the deposit account to the landlord’s benefit when the advance rental period commences and without notice to the tenant. For all other deposits:  &gt;(a) Upon the vacating of the premises for termination of the lease, if the landlord does not intend to impose a claim on the security deposit, the landlord shall have 15 days to return the security deposit together with interest if otherwise required, or the landlord shall have 30 days to give the tenant written notice by certified mail to the tenant’s last known mailing address of his or her intention to impose a claim on the deposit and the reason for imposing the claim. The notice shall contain a statement in substantially the following form:  &gt;This is a notice of my intention to impose a claim for damages in the amount of __________ upon your security deposit, due to _________ . It is sent to you as required by s. 83.49(3), Florida Statutes. You are hereby notified that you must object in writing to this deduction from your security deposit within 15 days from the time you receive this notice or I will be authorized to deduct my claim from your security deposit. Your objection must be sent to (landlord’s address) .  &gt;If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the 30-day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit and may not seek a setoff against the deposit but may file an action for damages after return of the deposit.  &gt;(b) Unless the tenant objects to the imposition of the landlord’s claim or the amount thereof within 15 days after receipt of the landlord’s notice of intention to impose a claim, the landlord may then deduct the amount of his or her claim and shall remit the balance of the deposit to the tenant within 30 days after the date of the notice of intention to impose a claim for damages. The failure of the tenant to make a timely objection does not waive any rights of the tenant to seek damages in a separate action.  &gt;(c) If either party institutes an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate the party’s right to the security deposit, the prevailing party is entitled to receive his or her court costs plus a reasonable fee for his or her attorney. The court shall advance the cause on the calendar.	No
674	"So my Great-Aunt(We'll call her Mary) is in her 80's now. She has wrecked two cars within the past year, and recently purchased a third one. Fortunately, she recently fractured her pelvis(I know, it sounds weird to say ""fortunately"" in this context), so she's not currently able to drive. Her younger sister(20 year difference) has offered to bring my Great-Aunt Mary to live with her in another state, but she would have to sell her own house so my other Great-Aunt could build her a small guest wing. Great-Aunt Mary can hardly see anymore, and is constantly repeating everything as if she didn't literally tell us the same thing five minutes ago. Nobody really knows what to do at this point. Great-Aunt Mary has no husband or children. We've offered to drive her to places, so she doesn't have to drive anymore, but she doesn't want to give up her freedom. She does her own yard work, which is how she broke her pelvis. She clearly can't really do all the things that she thinks she can, and we're just not very sure about how to proceed. None of us have ever had to deal with this before. We almost got Great-Aunt Mary to live with her sister last year, but she backed out at the last moment. Her money is going to run out at some point, as she got a reverse mortgage a couple of years ago, so we do need to get her house sold if we want to move her to her sister's house. I know part of it is that she's stubborn, but she's never lived anywhere other than this area as well.   What should we be trying to do? Is there anything that we can do? My mom seems to think that we can't really do much, since we aren't her children or grandchildren."	No
675	Background: partner and her ex split up five years ago with a one year old daughter. My partner's been the sole caregiver ever since. We've been together three years, and I think of her kid as a daughter to me, too. Her ex has a new partner, and a new kid with her. He's hit his new partner at least once, and  I think been charged for it, though I'm not 100% on that.  The ex is meant to pay child support (which is like, $70 a month or something, practically nothing, and he hasn't paid it in like six months anyway). I guess he doesn't want to do it any more, because recently he's been pushing my partner real hard for me to adopt their daughter. We've been interested in getting guardianship, but adoption will mean (correct me if I'm wrong) that he ceases to have any obligations towards his kid, and as shitty as he might be, my partner and I both kinda feel like that's not really our call to make? We've talked about it and always figured we'd give her daughter a choice when she was old enough to actually comprehend the consequences.   When we told her ex this he didn't agree with this decision, and is now saying that he intends to sue for full custody of his daughter. She doesn't know him, has no relationship with him and hasn't seen him in years. He clearly wants no relationship with her and is just doing this to fuck with my partner, and I think it'll be really tough on her daughter to go through this. She knows she has a biological dad out there somewhere, but doesn't need to know its this fuckwit, at least at this age.  Is what he's doing legal? Isn't it kinda unethical for a lawyer to take on his case, given that he has no shot of winning and clearly doesn't even want the kid and is just doing it to be a dickhead? How should we respond to this?	No
676	In 1996 I was stopped and ticketed for speeding in Oregon and never paid the fine. Last week when I tried to get a License in Washington, I was told that I couldn't because of this 20 year old citation. Does anyone know what the Statute of limitations on a traffic ticket is in the state of Oregon?	No
677	I live in an apartment building and someone in the neighbouring building has an incredibly loud motorcycle. I live downtown in a major city, and next to both LRT and heavy rail train tracks so I am used to road noise, motorcycles, trains etc.. This is way beyond normal. I live on the third floor in a different building and him leaving is so loud I can't hear a TV over it.   This is a particular problem for me because I have a serious issue with tinnitus and the extreme loud roaring will trigger my ringing to be much worse. i should also note that I have poor hearing, and so if it is loud to me it must be worse to everyone else.   I called 311 and they advised to call the police non-emergency. I did that but the police seemed very reluctant to do anything (even come issue them a warning) because I did not want to give them my name and contact information. The reason I don't want to give that information is because I am fairly sure that the guy in question is some kind of skinhead or neo-nazi, and essentially i don't want to have problems with him.   Would anyone know if he is actually violating a noise ordinance (he comes and goes in the middle of the night fairly often)? or if him modifying the bike to be louder would be illegal (I am suspicious he has done this since the bike is so extremely loud)? or how I could get the police to take my complaint as credible without sharing contact info? If anyone knew the consequences for the issue that would also be helpful (i.e. will he have to stop using the bike)?	No
678	This is a throw away account  My partner and i were living with a couple of friends. We've been waiting to sign the official lease for this place to put us on there and the landlord said she would get back to us in a week. It's been two months.  Our landlord knows we're living there and helping with bills but is not responding to the messeges about the official lease.   A week ago our friends moved out and my partner and i need to find our own place where the landlord isn't as dodging about contact.   If my partner and i move out would we get into any legal trouble since we're not on the lease/bills?	No
679	Does anyone have any examples for custody or visitation agreements for parents where one abuses substances?   Back story: other parent has been abusing OTC medication for a year, no test exists for this substance, but it alters mood. Also has mental health issues. Currently have an order for supervised visits, but that may not last long term, and I'd like to come up with something we're both sort of okay with instead of having a court decide.  I encourage a relationship, and the child's other parent wants one, but I'm not sure how much/what kind of visitation they should have other than supervised. Other parent uses sporadically, so I'm concerned the child could die if the other parent uses while watching the child alone.	No
680	I recently signed a contract with Jukin Media granting them the rights to license my video to other media outlets. I was offered $200 up front for signing and 70% of all revenue made from the video.      I didn't research the company as much as I should, and now I'm wanting out. I have not filled out any personal info that would allow them to pay me, so as far as the contract states, they can't use the video. The contract said this about terminations:      &gt;T4. Termination. Licensor may seek to terminate this Agreement at any time; however, this Agreement shall only be terminable upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of which may be granted or denied in Jukin’s sole discretion. No termination shall impact any prior license of the Images by Jukin prior to termination, which shall continue in full effect under the terms of this Agreement.      Since I cannot be paid and they cannot use the video because of that, I don't see why they would want to deny the termination request, since the video would seemingly be in limbo.      But I was wanting to ask about the wording of that excerpt. Does it imply that if the contract is terminated, they will still retain rights to use the video, despite the fact that the contract associated with it was cancelled?	No
681	"Hi all, my wife and I bought a house in Silicon Valley almost a year ago.  I was on deployment so I was not home.  We used my VA loan, I put down $10k and she put down $72k down payment; this was after we had a joint account.  He family, mother, father, brother live in their house rent free for almost a year now.  Her uncle lives there with $1,000/month rent.  I'm back home now, and our relationship is very rocky.  I can't handle the constant verbal abuse and her caustic nature day in an day out.  I want out.    The problem is she cut down 4, 70ft birch trees in our back yard while I was gone, tore up all the grass and did the same to the front yard.  She wants to remodel everything.  I feel suffocated in this this house.  Should I wait to finish the remodeling and file divorce or do it now?  I'm going to get a divorce, but I want to hear your advices too.  I can't pull equity on the house until one year and as it is, the property price probably dropped due to her ""renovations""."	No
682	I'm a mother of a super awesome three year old girl. I married my husband one year ago.   My daughter's biological father was abusive and an alcoholic throughout our entire relationship.  I have been her sole caregiver since birth, but for nearly a year I did allow supervised visitation 2 days a week.  During that time, he lived with his mother, and by her own admission, she provided care(meals, baths, etc) during his visitation.    He has never held a job longer than 6 months.  Recently, he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and other various drug related charges.  He is currently in drug court, is unemployed, and seems to be completely spiraling out.  Prior to his meth spiral, all visitation was facilitated through his sister, who is a social worker. I went no contact with him because his verbal abuse persists regardless of our relationship status.  Three months ago, his sister refused to facilitate any type of visitation with our daughter because he insisted we allow him to take her to his girlfriend's house overnight.  His girlfriend is a meth addict, covered in fresh track marks who lost her own children because of drug addiction and neglect.  Even if her bio dad DID beat his addiction issues (he won't, but hypothetically) he will still be inconsistent, verbally abusive and dangerous to my bubbly baby girl if he ever has access to her alone.   I was lucky to marry a man nothing like her bio father. He is absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to us. He's involved in every aspect of her upbringing, responsible, and brings peace and consistency to both our lives.  He and my daughter are the best of friends. She's nuts over him. She's a mommy's girl, but if she cant have me, she chooses my husband (even over her grandparents that spoil her to pieces). She deserves this father. She does not deserve a lifetime of inconsistent, likely very psychologically damaging and physically dangerous situations her bio father will put her in if given the chance.  How do we begin the process of terminating bio dad's rights/step-parent adoption?  What proof is needed in the event bio dad contests termination of rights?	No
683	"If I were to divorce my husband of almost 5 years, what are my legal rights?  He definitely makes more money then me and we did not sign a pre-nup.  We got married in NYC but will be moving to NJ this fall to attempt saving our marriage.  We also have a 15 month old daughter.  These are my questions below.  My biggest fear is that because he makes alot more then me that the courts will side with him or he'll hire lawyers to ""get me"".  Also, if we got married in NY and lived in NY but soon will move to Jersey (in Oct/Nov 2017) How does that work?  Would it go under NY or NJ law and how would that affect me? HELP! :(  1.  Child custody.  I would want joint custody for us to make decisions together, BUT I want her to live with me with granting him visitation rights.  During a heated argument he threatened me with taking me to court to gain full custody of our daughter.  He even mentioned that he will hire the most expensive attorney for him to win.  He has since apologized multiple times, but I have no idea if he will rant and threaten me again!  2. We did not sign a pre-nup and live in a co-op (that we bought together).  I recently became a stay at home mom with no income.  However when we move to NJ, I plan on going back to work and earn my own money."	No
684	So we both live in California, he's been separated for 5 years no but his divorce isn't finalized. Well our baby is due soon and we aren't sure if he can be put on the birth certificate seeing as he is still legally married. Would it be better for us to wait till it is finalized? Or can he get in trouble if we put him on the birth certificate?	No
685	I'm 17 at the moment and want my baby's father in the delivery room. My dad threatened me saying he will call the cops if my baby daddy showed up and I'm scared because BD has statutory rape charges since he is 21. After my baby is born I know my dad wont let my BD see his child either. My mom is on board with my dad. Is there anything I can do? I don't want to be at home because my parents are emotionally abusive but I can't move out since I'm 17. I know in Texas it is legal to move out (I love in Texas) but I have to be financially responsible for myself and my baby. I rely on my partner, but my parents have and will try everything they can to make sure my partner is in jail. Is there anything I can do? Or he can do, considering he has statutory rape charges?	No
686	My parents have always had a rocky marriage, and my dad was (and is) extremely verbally abusive and controlling.  Mom stayed for many complicated reasons, the primary of which is that she worked in ministry, and divorce at the time would have required her to take an unpaid leave of absence (and been a potential career killer).  They are now both retired.  Throughout their marriage, Mom was the primary wage earner, as Dad sabotaged a variety of jobs through (surprise) bad attitude and behavior.  She was also the primary homemaker and caregiver for my sister and I (now both adults).  Dad was verbally and sometimes physically abusive to us as well (think taking corporal punishment a step too far). She has a substantial pension, life insurance, and a significant inheritance from her aunt and uncle, and co-owns the house my parents live in (though the down payment all came from her).    Furthermore, my dad has a history of TERRIBLE spending decisions.  Pyramid schemes, miracle supplements and cures, fake investment opportunities, flat-out scams... you name it, he's thrown money at it, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.  (Most recently he handed over all their banking info to a guy claiming to be from a tech support firm that would provide better security...than the bank. $8k vanished before he was finally willing to admit he'd been had, and then he tried to blame the bank.) And of course, he hassles her about every penny she spends (including recently pitching a fit because she bought my daughter a watercolor paint kit for all of $12.)  My mom recently consulted a lawyer about divorce, and while she wants to ensure he has enough to live comfortably, she was alarmed to discover that NJ law is such that Dad would automatically be entitled to half of all their assets.  She is balking now at leaving him, because she is convinced (for good reason) that he would blow through all of it and leave nothing for the kids/grandkids.  Plus it is just deeply upsetting to her that after all her hard work and his poor treatment of her, he would get half of everything she earned as well as half her inheritance from her family.  Does she have ANY options for moving/reallocating even some of that money to keep it out of his hands? I would hate for this to be the reason she stays with him.   TLDR: Mom wants to leave Dad, she earned/inherited most of their assets, he's a controlling jerk who's terrible with money, any way to keep him from getting 50% of everything in a NJ divorce?  Thanks in advance.	No
687	I moved into my new apartment on Monday (the 24th). I finished moving the last of my things out and cleaning my old apartment on Tuesday and went to turn in my keys. The landlord wasn't there, but since it was about 1600 I figured she left a little early, since the office runs on normal business hours, M-F 8-5. I usually work those hours so my time to stop by is very limited. Wednesday I actually had to go in at 1100 instead, so I stopped by about 1000 and she still wasn't there. I tried to call, but no answer, so I just went to work. Yesterday I was off, so I stopped by around 1200, she still wasn't there, and there was a note from another tenant put into the door between it and the doorframe. Went home, did some things, stopped by again around 1500 and the note was still there, meaning she had not gone in. Tried to make a call, no answer. Stopped by again at 1630, note still there, phone call went straight to voicemail. I'm currently on my lunch break, went to stop by again, not there no answer on phone.   My lease ends on the 31st and my question is what legal trouble could I get in if I still haven't been able to turn in my keys by then? What actions can I take on the 31st before any legal actions are taken against me?	No
