Supplier Code of Conduct

Siemens wants to be perceived as an integral part of the national society and economy in all countries. Due to the huge diversity of conditions at the 177 countries in which we purchased goods and services in the last Fiscal Year (Oct 1st - Sept 30), this maxim of Siemens‘ business policy was considered in the principles of the “Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers”. It is based on – among others – the UN Global Compact and the principles of the International Labor Organization but also reflects the Siemens “Business Conduct Guidelines”, which establishes fundamental principles of sustainability and apply to the entire company.

Siemens operates not only in accordance with clear Business Conduct Guidelines, which are mandatory worldwide, but also with directives to concentrate business with only the best suppliers who agree to and comply with our standards in the supply chain. In the long term we cooperate only with suppliers who place as much value on Sustainability as we do and who adhere to the principles of Global Compact with respect to human rights and work relationships.

In order to continuously monitor and improve the performance of our suppliers we utilize a consistent Supplier Management System. At the foundation of this system is our process by which we obtain supplier contractual commitment to responsibilities towards their stakeholders and the environment through the Siemens Supplier Code of Conduct. The code addresses the following concepts:

		Compliance with laws. 

		Prohibition of Corruption and Bribery 

		Respect for Basic Human Rights of Employees (which includes to refuse to employ or make  anyone work against his or her will) 

		Prohibition of Child Labor 

		Health and Safety of Employees 

		Environmental Protection 

		Promotion of the above principles in the supply chain of the supplier  The full Supplier Code of Conduct document and detailed description of the key provisions can be found under the following link: https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx)  Once a supplier becomes part of the Siemens supply chain, it then becomes subject to the compliance verification activities established as part of the Supplier Management System. The system uses a combination of four approaches to accomplish the compliance verification process. These approaches are: Sustainability Self Assessments, Risk Evaluations performed by the responsible Siemens Buyer, Sustainability Audits performed by third parties and Siemens Quality audits. These audits include determining if the supplier adheres to the Code of Conduct. Further information on our systematic approach can be found at www.siemens.com/sr/detection-modules  Siemens Management System considers the assessment and audit findings and then employs supplier development actions which establish improvement measures to be taken by suppliers to mitigate or correct issues raised in audit findings. If a supplier fails to execute the agreed upon measures, Siemens may terminate any existing business with the supplier. This termination right is established in Siemens supplier contracts and purchase terms and conditions. 

 

The number of 3rd party audits and number of findings are published in the Siemens Sustainability Report, and can be accessed through the following links: (www.siemens.com/scm/sustainability; or specific suppliers chapter under : http://www.siemens.com/sustainability/pool/en/current-reporting/sr2010_suppliers.pdf).

Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers

In order to orient our entire supply chain in an ecological manner, we work closely with our suppliers to identify and implement measures for the efficient use of resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, we developed our Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers (EEP4Suppliers) which provides access to know-how and experience from our own Environmental Program and Environmental Portfolio.

In fiscal 2010, we successfully piloted EEP4Suppliers at 17 production facilities operated by major suppliers. Plans call for the first 1,000 suppliers to be integrated in the EEP4Suppliers program by the end of fiscal 2012.

Organization Awareness.

All Procurement professionals within the Siemens Supply Chain organization are trained on the “One Supplier Certification” process and related Code of Conduct requirements so that the principles can be effectively explained to suppliers. Additionally Siemens conducts sustainability workshops with our suppliers in higher-risk-countries. The workshops include presentations by Environment, Health and Safety Officers who lead break-out sessions that address human right topics such as worker safety.

Web Based Trainings in Sustainability are available for suppliers as well as internal Siemens personnel and can be accessed through the following link. https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx

Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy Statement

In 2010 the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was passed and will go into effect January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have gross worldwide sales of over $100 Million Dollars; to be transparent about the efforts they have undergone to eradicate Slavery and Human Trafficking in their supply chain.

As a member of EICC we have shown our commitment to environmental and social responsibility. Since 2004 the EICC has built upon the Code of Conduct which prohibits the use of forced, bonded, indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. We audit our suppliers to this code and take seriously all forms of non-conformance. The EICC also has a Freely Chosen Employment (FCE) task force designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training.

In addition to the EICC, Adobe Systems Incorporated has internal policies and practices that are based on international labor and human rights standards. We partner with our supply chain to create an environment where workers have the right to freely choose employment, the right to associate freely, voluntarily join or not join labor unions and worker councils, and the right to bargain collectively if they choose. Workers also have the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination.

This focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort of supply chain transparency and accountability. Adobe Systems Incorporated has taken multiple actions to ensure and verify the absence of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain, include the following:

• Adobe Business Partner Code of Conduct: The Adobe Business Partner Code of Conduct articulates Adobe’s foundation of integrity and honest and ethical conduct. Adobe upholds standards that require business partners to treat their own employees fairly in accordance with local laws and regulations regarding labor and employment, including slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.

		Internal Supplier Audits:  Adobe’s audit program evaluates suppliers’ compliance with the EICC, which prohibits forced labor and child labor. Audits are performed at least once a year by Adobe employees who make scheduled visits to the suppliers. Audits are announced and conducted independently of the supplier. 

		Certify Materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery:  Adobe’s ODM (original design and manufacturing) suppliers comply with the Adobe Business Partners Code of Conduct, requiring them to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations regarding forced labor and child labor. Suppliers also maintain their own zero tolerance policies for forced labor, slavery and human trafficking. 

		Maintains internal accountability standards:  In order to maintain internal accountability, it is the intention of Adobe to discontinue its relationship with any Adobe business partner who does not comply with the Adobe Business Partner Code of Conduct or, upon discovery of noncompliance, does not commit to a specific plan to achieve compliance. 

		 Procurement professionals training:  Adobe requires that employees responsible for supply chain management complete a training course on how to recognize the potential risks of human trafficking in a business and identify actions that can be taken to address them.  For complete information concerning our supply chain responsibility program, see Supply Chain Responsibility."

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (the “Act”) requires manufacturers and retailers doing business in the State of California to disclose information regarding their efforts to address the issues of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. In accordance with the requirements of the Act, AMD offers the summary below of our activities to identify and prevent human trafficking and slavery activities by our vendors.

AMD Policies and Actions

AMD strongly opposes the practice of slavery or human trafficking. AMD utilizes several approaches detailed below designed to ensure and verify the absence of such practices in our supply chain.

AMD is an active member and Chairs the EICC. AMD has adopted the Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (the EICC Code of Conduct) and generally requires conformance with this code from its suppliers. The EICC Code of Conduct is based on international labor, environmental and human rights standards that clearly prohibit slavery and human trafficking.

Risk-based supplier assessments: As a part of AMD’s supplier management process, we assess our suppliers to evaluate their conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct. This approach includes preliminary risk assessments as well as more detailed supplier self-assessment questionnaires. The results of each method are scored utilizing the EICC scoring system to verify the suppliers’ risk of non-conformance.

Supplier audits: Based on the results of the risk assessment, AMD may require a third-party on-site audit of supplier practices and management systems to evaluate supplier compliance with the EICC standards including avoiding human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain and with applicable laws and regulations. These audits may be announced or unannounced depending on the circumstances.

Supplier assurance: Each year, AMD communicates with suppliers in writing to ensure our expectations are clear and up-to-date with regard to responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct. This letter requires suppliers to comply with international standards, applicable laws and regulations as well as the EICC Code of Conduct. Additionally, AMD’s standard terms and conditions for the procurement of goods and services require conformance to applicable laws and regulations, and reinforce our expectations regarding responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct.

Accountability: In addition to risk assessments and audits, AMD discusses conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct as well as related management systems with our suppliers during regular business reviews. Our supplier business reviews are the optimal venue for accountability with regard to responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct because senior management participates in these meetings and future business awards are at stake.'

Training: AMD suppliers have access to information and training regarding conformance expectations through the EICC learning and capability activities.

AMD Standards of Business Conduct: AMD’s Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct establish mandatory rules and guidelines for AMD’s employees. These standards are substantially equivalent to the EICC Code of Conduct and specifically prohibit forced and compulsory labor practices. These standards apply to all AMD employees. Every AMD employee has access to and receives mandatory training on these standards. In the event an employee violates these standards, AMD will take immediate and appropriate action, which may include termination of employment."	Yes

In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657), effective as of January 1, 2012, Aeropostale makes the following disclosure of its efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain for its goods offered for sale:

1. Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.
Aeropostale will not do business with a vendor or manufacturer that is unable to comply with the Aeropostale’s Code of Conduct and Guidelines. The Code of Conduct requires, among other things, that vendors and manufacturers not use “any form of forced labor including, but not limited to, slave labor, prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or labor derived from human trafficking, or permit their suppliers to do so”. As part of the factory evaluation process, all factories are subject to a third-party social compliance audit. Aeropostale’s internal Social Compliance Manager evaluates third-party audits to ensure compliance with Aeropostale’s Code of Conduct. 

2. Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains.
Aeropostale has engaged STR Responsible Sourcing to conduct third-party social compliance audits of all factories manufacturing Aeropostale products to ensure compliance with Aeropostale’s Code of Conduct and Guidelines. The third-party social compliance audit includes questions which specifically address slavery and human trafficking. The factory is given an audit window of two-weeks and the audit can occur anytime within that two-week period.

3. Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.
Aeropostale’s Code of Conduct and Guidelines are part of Aeropostale’s Master Sourcing Agreement (“MSA”). All Aeropostale vendors and manufacturers sign the MSA which includes a representation that the vendors and their factories will comply with all applicable laws and Aeropostale’s Code of Conduct, including, but not limited to, not using any form of forced labor including, but not limited to, slave labor, prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or labor derived from human trafficking, or permit their suppliers to do so. The Code of Conduct must also be displayed in the local language of each factory producing Aeropostale products.

4. Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.
Aeropostale’s Social Compliance Manager reviews all Aeropostale third-party audits. In the event a factory receives a non-passing audit score for a finding of “forced labor” which includes slavery and human trafficking, Aeropostale’s appropriate executive team members are alerted. The factory is required to take immediate action and provide a corrective action plan. The corrective action plan must include: (i) the immediate action that will be taken, (ii) persons responsible for action, (iii) the date of completion and (iv) the root cause of the issue and change in system that will prevent reoccurrence. The factory will also be required to undergo a reaudit. If the reaudit reveals continued noncompliance, production will be removed from the factory.

5. Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.
Aeropostale employees and management that are directly involved in Aeropostale’s social compliance must be familiar with Aeropostale’s Code of Conduct and receive regular updates on applicable laws."	Yes

As AGCO continues to expand globally, we are committed to labor conditions and human rights standards that are not only compliant with local regulations, but ones which also meet our own, often- higher, expectations. We strive to protect and manage our internal labor pool and also collaborate with suppliers that support the same standards in terms of ensuring a safe, legal, and healthy labor force.

We verify that our supply chain understands our expectations on labor and human trafficking.

What is Alpine's position on Forced Labor and Human Trafficking?

Alpine Electronics of America, Inc. (Alpine) recognizes the devastating effects of forced labor and human trafficking on society and prohibits any such form throughout our wholesale trade operations as part of our corporate social responsibility and commitment to legal compliance.

The International Labor Organization (ILO) defines forced labor as involuntary work or service demanded from a person under threat or penalty, which includes penal sanctions and the loss of rights and privileges. It can also be a means of political coercion or as punishment for holding or expressing political views.

Forced or compulsory labor is virtually globally banned. The ILO's 1930 Forced Labor Convention (No. 29) as well as the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention (No. 105) are the most widely endorsed of all international labor conventions.

For more information, see: http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm and http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/Events/ILOevents/lang--en/WCMS_092176/index.htm

What is Human Trafficking?

The United Nations General Assembly resolution 55/25 of 15 November 2000 defines Trafficking in Persons as:

The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include . . . the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.

communicate and engage with business partners that promote actions consistent with our Mission;

monitor and manage supplier performance and verify that the products or services delivered satisfy contractual specifications; and

utilize a broad, diverse supplier pool to provide goods and services.

Our companies work to develop and maintain business relationships with suppliers who share our commitment to: 

conduct business in a responsible manner in compliance with applicable laws;

respect the rights of workers to a safe working environment;

comply with environmental laws and regulations and aim to reduce the environmental impact of their activities; and

implement management and monitoring practices to ensure compliance with contracts and applicable laws.

We outline our expectations for suppliers in Altria’s Supplier Code of Conduct.

Although our operations and sourcing are largely concentrated in the U.S., we understand that our actions may also affect those beyond our borders. Respect for people is fundamental to the way we conduct business.

The 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work inform our principles and policies for employees and our expectations of suppliers. To uphold and promote these principles, Altria and its companies:

respect the rights of our employees and establish a culture of respect and compliance as articulated by our Values and the Altria Code of Conduct;

work with suppliers to promote actions that are consistent with our Values and the Supplier Code of Conduct; and

collaborate with others in industry and society to address human rights issues where our companies have a role to play. Our tobacco companies have a policy addressing child and forced labor. As a condition of our business relationship, supplier contracts require compliance with all applicable laws, including those addressing child and forced labor.

We have built monitoring processes for the following purchasing areas:

direct materials

marketing incentives

original equipment manufacturers

tobacco growers

tobacco suppliers

 As a result, we focus on the following:

Supplier agreements. Domestic suppliers must comply with all applicable U.S. federal, state and local laws. Domestic direct contracted tobacco growers must certify that all labor used in their operations to produce tobacco will conform to the child and forced labor provisions in their contracts, which require compliance with applicable laws. In addition, Ste. Michelle’s domestic grape supply contracts typically forbid the grower from using illegal child labor or forced labor to produce grapes for its wineries. Suppliers with operations outside the U.S. must also comply with the applicable laws in the countries in which they operate as provided in their contract; however, they are not presently required to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Supplier audits. Based on a range of factors including our evaluation of risk, we conduct periodic supplier reviews, announced assessments, on-farm visits and independent third-party audits. These assessments include a review against Altria’s Child & Forced Labor policy and applicable laws. When we learn of non-compliance issues, we communicate them to the suppliers. We then expect suppliers to take corrective actions to address these issues and keep us informed of their actions. In some situations, we require immediate action to achieve compliance, or we halt business with the supplier. In other situations, we take a continuous improvement approach and work with the supplier to improve their practices. Details of those assessment and audit results can be found on altria.com.

Internal management, training and accountability. All Altria employees are required to comply with the Code of Conduct, which states that Altria does not condone the unlawful employment of children in the workplace, nor does it condone forced labor. All employees receive training on the Code of Conduct. As part of the training, employees are asked to acknowledge their commitment to follow the Code. Altria’s Code of Conduct is enforced through internal compliance training and audits. Employees are trained on these standards annually. Our companies investigate all allegations of non-compliance. If allegations are substantiated they are addressed as appropriate, including training (or re-training) and employee discipline. Supplier managers do not currently receive specific training on human trafficking and slavery.

14	"Supply Chain Standards

Amazon is strongly committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner, including engaging with suppliers that are committed to the same principles. We require suppliers in our manufacturing supply chain to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct* (""Supplier Code""), which is detailed below. Amazon also expects our suppliers to hold their suppliers and subcontractors to the standards and practices covered by our Supplier Code. Our products must be manufactured in a manner that meets or exceeds the expectations of Amazon and our customers as reflected in our Supplier Code.

Here are some of the key areas we focus on: 

Health and safety in production areas and any living quarters 

The right to legal wages and benefits 

Appropriate working hours and overtime pay 

Prevention of child labor or forced labor 

Fair and ethical treatment, including non-discrimination 

To ensure that our audit protocol and standards incorporate best-in-class practices, we conduct formal benchmarking with industry experts to review Amazon criteria against globally-recognized international standards and other businesses in the retail and electronics industries. We work closely with a leading independent specialist in designing, operating, and continually improving our audit program. Amazon managers participate directly in many of the on-site audits. Audit reports and findings are reviewed regularly by the senior leadership of the appropriate business and corrective action plans are implemented as needed.

We partner closely with our suppliers to drive continuous improvement in worker conditions. We train our suppliers on the standards and conduct required by our Supplier Code. We use independent auditors to audit suppliers and verify compliance, including through confidential worker interviews. We audit all suppliers at least once per year to monitor continued compliance and improvement; many sites are audited multiple times a year, including for follow-up audits to address specific findings. Amazon may terminate its relationships with any supplier that violates our Supplier Code or does not cooperate with our auditors.

Every site audit includes: 

Inspection of all areas of the site and any living quarters; 

Confidential worker interviews conducted without site management present; 

Review and analysis of site documents to assess workers' age, contracts, compensation, working hours, and workplace conditions; 

Audit and review of current licenses and any past compliance issues; and 

Identification of areas for improvement and development of a remediation plan. 

Upon completion of an audit, a supplier must promptly provide a detailed remediation plan for each issue identified. Amazon tracks remediation closely and conducts follow-up audits for significant issues. Between audits, Amazon employees often meet on-site with supplier managers to discuss open issues and remediation progress.

Supplier Code of Conduct

Guiding Principle. Our suppliers’ business and labor practices must comply with all applicable laws, as well as the requirements and principles of this Supplier Code. Suppliers must comply with the standards of this Supplier Code even when this Supplier Code exceeds the requirements of applicable law.

Child Labor. Amazon will not tolerate the use of child labor. Our suppliers must engage workers whose age is the greater of : (i) 15, (ii) the age of completion of compulsory education , or (iii) the minimum age to work in the country where work is performed. Furthermore, workers under the age of 18 must not perform hazardous work. Amazon supports the development of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programs that comply with applicable laws and this Supplier Code. 

Involuntary Labor, Human Trafficking, and Slavery. Our suppliers must not use forced labor - slave, prison, indentured, bonded, or otherwise. Our suppliers must not traffic workers or in any other way exploit workers by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, or fraud. Working must be voluntary, and workers must be free to leave work and terminate their employment or other work status with reasonable notice. Our suppliers must bear or reimburse to their workers the cost of all excessive recruiting, hiring, or other similar fees charged to workers, and all fees and expenses charged to workers must be disclosed to Amazon and the workers in advance. Our suppliers must not require workers to surrender government issued identification, passports, or work permits as a condition of working, and our suppliers may only temporarily hold onto such documents to the extent reasonably necessary to complete legitimate administrative and immigration processing. Workers must be given clear, understandable contracts regarding the terms and conditions of their engagement in a language understood by the worker. Suppliers must ensure that each of its staffing or recruiting agencies comply with this Supplier Code and with the more stringent of the applicable laws of the country where work is performed and the worker’s home country.

Safety and Health. Our suppliers must provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment, and suppliers must, at a minimum, comply with applicable laws regarding working conditions and with the standards below.

Occupational Safety. Suppliers must educate workers on safety procedures and also control worker exposure to potential physical safety hazards by implementing physical guards, barriers, and/or engineering and administrative controls. Workers must be informed and receive appropriate education in advance if they will be working with (or otherwise exposed to) hazardous or dangerous conditions or materials. In addition, workers must be given appropriate personal protective equipment and educated and trained on the proper use of such equipment. Suppliers must manage, track, and report occupational injuries and illnesses.

Physically Demanding Work. Suppliers must continually identify, evaluate, and control physically demanding tasks to ensure that worker health and safety is not jeopardized.

Emergency Preparedness and Response. Suppliers must identify and plan for emergency situations and implement and train their workers on response systems, including emergency reporting, alarm systems, worker notification and evacuation procedures, worker training and drills, first-aid supplies, fire detection and suppression equipment, and unblocked exit facilities.

Machine Safeguarding. Suppliers must implement a regular machinery maintenance program. Production and other machinery must be routinely evaluated for safety hazards.

Sanitation and Housing. Workers must be provided with reasonable access to clean toilet facilities and potable drinking water. If suppliers provide a canteen or other food accommodations, they must include sanitary food preparation, storage, and eating accommodations. If suppliers provide residential facilities for their workers, they must provide clean and safe accommodations. In such residential facilities, workers must be provided with emergency egresses, reasonable and secure personal space, entry and exit privileges , reasonable access to hot water for bathing, adequate heat and ventilation, and reasonable transportation to and from work facilities (if not reasonably accessible by walking).

Wages and Benefits. Our suppliers must pay their workers in a timely manner and provide compensation (including overtime pay and benefits) that, at a minimum, satisfy applicable laws. Suppliers must provide to their workers the basis on which workers are being paid in a timely manner via pay stub or similar documentation. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure are not permitted.

Working Hours. Except in unusual or emergency situations, (i) suppliers must not require a worker to work more than 60 hours per week, including overtime, and (ii) each worker must be entitled to at least one day off for every seven-day work period. In all circumstances, working hours must not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law.

Anti-discrimination. Conditions of working must be based on an individual’s ability to do the job, not on personal characteristics or beliefs. Our suppliers must not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, political opinion, pregnancy, marital or family status, or similar factors in hiring and working practices such as job applications, promotions, job assignments, training, wages, benefits, and termination. Suppliers must not subject workers or applicants to medical tests that could be used in a discriminatory manner.

Fair Treatment. All workers must be treated with respect and dignity. Our suppliers must not engage in or permit physical, verbal, or psychological abuse or coercion, including threats of violence, sexual harassment, or unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting work and residential facilities. Workers must be free to voice their concerns to Amazon or its auditors, and allowed to participate in the Amazon audit process, without fear of retaliation by supplier management.

Immigration Compliance. Our suppliers may only engage workers who have a legal right to work. If suppliers engage foreign or migrant workers, such workers must be engaged in full compliance with the immigration and labor laws of the host country.

Freedom of Association. Our suppliers must respect the rights of workers to establish and join a legal organization of their own selection. Workers must not be penalized or subjected to harassment or intimidation for the non-violent exercise of their right to join or refrain from joining such legal organizations.

Ethical Behavior 

No Bribery. Our suppliers must not offer nor accept bribes or other means of obtaining undue or improper advantages to anyone for any reason, whether in dealings with governments or the private sector. Our suppliers must not induce Amazon employees to violate our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics posted at: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&p=irol-govConduct 

Anti-Corruption. Suppliers must comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and not offer anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Suppliers must not make illegal payments to government officials themselves or through a third party. Suppliers who are conducting business with the government officials of any country must follow Amazon's guidance on the law governing payments and gifts to governmental officials. 

Whistleblower Protections. Suppliers must protect worker whistleblower confidentiality and prohibit retaliation against workers who report workplace grievances. Suppliers must create a mechanism for workers to submit their grievances anonymously. 

Management Systems. Suppliers must adopt a management system to ensure compliance with applicable laws and this Supplier Code and to facilitate continual improvement. 

Management Accountability and Responsibility. Suppliers must have designated representatives responsible for implementing management systems and programs that oversee compliance with applicable laws as well as this Supplier Code. Senior management must routinely review and assess the quality and efficiency of the management systems and programs. Amazon also expects our suppliers to hold their suppliers and subcontractors to the standards and practices covered by this Supplier Code. 

Risk Management. Suppliers must establish a process to identify the environmental, health, safety, and ethical risks associated with their operational and labor practices. In addition, management must develop appropriate processes to control identified risks and ensure regulatory compliance. 

Training. Management must maintain appropriate training programs for managers and workers to implement the standards in this Supplier Code and to comply with applicable legal requirements. 

Communication and Worker Feedback. Suppliers must clearly and accurately communicate and educate workers about Amazon policies, practices, and expectations. Amazon may require suppliers to post this Supplier Code in a location accessible to their workers (translated into the appropriate local language(s)). In addition, Amazon encourages suppliers to partner with us to implement a process to assess workers' understanding of the standards and practices covered by this Supplier Code. 

Documentation and Records. Suppliers must create, retain, and dispose of business records in full compliance with applicable legal requirements along with appropriate confidentiality to protect privacy. 

Environment. Our suppliers must comply with applicable environmental laws. Amazon encourages our suppliers to implement systems that are designed to minimize the impact on the environment by the supply chain system, the production process, and the products themselves. 

Environmental Permits and Recordkeeping. Suppliers must obtain and keep current all required environmental permits, approvals, and registrations and follow applicable operational and reporting requirements. 

Effective Management and Disposal of Hazardous Substances. Suppliers must effectively identify and manage the safe handling, movement, storage, and disposal of chemicals and other substances that pose a threat to the environment, including providing workers with appropriate training on the safe-handling and disposal of hazardous substances. Suppliers must also monitor and control wastewater or solid waste generated from operations before disposing in accordance with applicable laws. In addition, suppliers must characterize, monitor, control, and treat regulated air emissions before discharging in accordance with applicable laws. 

Continuous Improvement. Amazon encourages our suppliers to continuously improve and reduce waste. Amazon welcomes suggestions and feedback from its suppliers to improve Amazon's own operations and processes. 

Conflict Minerals. Amazon is committed to avoiding the use of minerals that have fueled conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. We expect suppliers to support our effort to identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products. 

Corrective Action. Suppliers’ compliance with this Supplier Code is subject to Amazon’s review, including third-party auditing of work and residential facilities and conducting confidential worker interviews. Suppliers must provide prompt access to their facilities and workers during any audit. We require suppliers to promptly provide a detailed remediation plan and take corrective actions for deviations from this Supplier Code, and Amazon will track suppliers’ remediation efforts. Amazon may (without liability) terminate its relationships with any supplier found to be in violation of this Supplier Code, including for denying prompt access to our auditors.

Supplier Code Last Updated: November 24, 2014

Amazon employees who manage our manufacturing supply chain receive training on our Supplier Code and audit requirements. Amazon also has a training program for our manufacturers on our Supplier Code and supply chain standards. Our independent third-party auditors periodically conduct both unannounced and announced on-site audits of our manufacturers. Amazon aspires to audit our manufacturers before Amazon begins ordering products, and we require all of our suppliers to meet the standards in our Supplier Code as a condition of doing business with us. Amazon's manufacturing purchasing agreements require our suppliers to comply with supply chain standards, which, among other things, include laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Amazon employees are subject to internal accountability standards, which include disciplinary measures up to and including termination, for failing to follow Amazon requirements regarding our audits.

16	"CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was signed into law in the State of California on September 30, 2010. The Act goes into effect on January 1, 2012 and requires retail companies and manufacturers doing business in California with annual worldwide gross receipts of more than US$100 million to disclose corporate policies to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains.

American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO, Inc.) is committed to ensuring that the people who make our clothes are treated with dignity and respect. The following disclosure provides an overview of AEO, Inc.’s initiatives around human rights and social compliance, including steps we take to mitigate the risks of and work to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in our supplier base. For complete details about our Corporate Responsibility efforts, please see AE Better World.

		Vendor Code of Conduct & Supplier Agreement. AEO, Inc.’s Vendor Code of Conduct is based on universally-accepted human rights principles and sets forth our minimum standards and expectations for suppliers. Our Code expressly prohibits the use of child labor and forced or involuntary labor. These prohibitions include, but are not limited to, trafficked, prison, bonded, and indentured labor, as well as forced overtime.  All suppliers must agree contractually and in writing to abide by the terms of our Vendor Code of Conduct and other applicable laws and regulations before we do business with them. As part of this agreement, AEO, Inc. suppliers also warrant that any subcontractors they may independently contract with to produce AEO, Inc. product will comply with the terms of our Code and other applicable laws and regulations. For more details on our Code of Conduct as well as associated guiding principles and governance, please see the Corporate Governance section of AE Better World. 

		Supplier Monitoring. AEO, Inc. maintains a dedicated team of people and an extensive factory monitoring program to help ensure that suppliers comply with the terms of our Vendor Code of Conduct. Through a combination of third-party auditors, local independent auditors, and our own inspectors, we conduct pre-sourcing inspections of apparel factories before we place purchase orders and strive to visit approved factories at least once a year. Inspections conducted by our internal team are generally unannounced, while inspections conducted by third-party auditors are semi-unannounced. AEO, Inc. team members review inspection results with factory management and provide targeted training to help suppliers continuously improve their compliance performance. 

AEO, Inc. has a zero tolerance policy against all forms of slavery and human trafficking. Factories that cannot meet minimum standards and pass our pre-sourcing inspections will not be approved for ongoing business. If and when we uncover a serious breach of our Code of Conduct by a supplier already approved for production, we take steps up to and including the severance of our business relationship. For more details about this and other aspects of our supplier monitoring program, please see the Supply Chain section of our website. Full results from our FY 2010 factory inspections are available here.

		External Verification. AEO, Inc. is a participating company in the Fair Labor Association. The FLA provides independent external monitoring of our supplier base and publicly reports on its findings. In addition, AEO, Inc. is also a signatory to the global buyer principles of the International Labor Organization (ILO)’s Better Work program and relies upon independent Better Work factory assessments in lieu of our own inspections in countries where Better Work operates. Current AEO, Inc. sourcing countries with active Better Work programs include Cambodia, Vietnam, Haiti, and Indonesia. More information about our work with the FLA and Better Work can be found here. 

		Associate Training & Accountability. All AEO, Inc. associates must comply with the terms of AEO, Inc.’s Code of Ethics, which sets forth written standards designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, legal and regulatory compliance, and full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable company public disclosure. Associates are required to report any known or suspected violations of the Code of Ethics either through the anonymous AEO Hotline (1-888-587- 3582) or online at www.aehotline.com. For more information on our Code of Ethics and related polices, please click here.  Associates who engage regularly with suppliers are trained on our Vendor Code of Conduct and supplier monitoring efforts. Entry-level Merchandising and Planning associates participate in a rotation program that includes a specific course in AEO, Inc. Corporate Responsibility. New Production and Sourcing associates participate in onboarding sessions about Corporate Responsibility policies and processes. AEO, Inc. associates who regularly visit suppliers are also asked to assess conditions informally while on location and report back any concerns. In addition, the AEO, Inc. Corporate Responsibility and Production teams meet regularly to review supplier performance on social compliance and discuss sourcing strategy. The Corporate Responsibility team reports to the AEO, Inc. Board of Directors on an annual basis. More details on these and our other Corporate Responsibility business integration efforts are available here. 

		Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships. Most of the time, AEO, Inc. is just one of several brands doing business with any given factory. Because the root causes of poor working conditions are varied and complex, our leverage to bring about positive change can be limited. As a result, we engage other companies, civil society organizations, trade unions, governments, multilateral institutions, and other stakeholders on issues of mutual concern and who share our goals to improve global supply chain working conditions.

19	"Engaging early to catch potential issues.

When awarding new business, we take previous audit scores into consideration, or conduct detailed risk assessments with suppliers who have not been audited in the past. In 2014, we reviewed 459 suppliers, and factored their responsibility performance into our decisions.

This engagement has allowed us to address over 700 findings related to labor standards, worker safety, permits, environmental hazards, and chemical management — all before production began. For suppliers that haven’t worked with us before, or those requiring additional help, we go onsite, assess their facilities, and work together to build sound management systems from the ground up.

Suppliers hire significantly more workers before new product launches, in some cases nearly doubling their work force. During this critical period of peak production known as ramp, we send a team on site to provide hands-on guidance to work with suppliers needing more help to address potential labor and human rights issues. In 2014, we were on location, working together with suppliers who employed over 300,000 workers.

Working onsite with suppliers.

To make impactful changes across our supply chain, it’s important to understand firsthand what’s happening inside our suppliers’ facilities. That’s why we don’t simply employ and review audits from behind our desks in Cupertino. Instead, we directly gauge how our supplier facilities are doing by regularly visiting and partnering with our suppliers around the world. And when we discover a problem, we work together to get it fixed.

How an Apple audit works.

We actively look for issues so that we can fix them. When we find violations — which we do in every single audit we conduct — we view them as opportunities to partner with our suppliers to improve working conditions and to protect the environment. In 2014, we conducted 633 audits in 19 countries — the most since beginning our Supplier Responsibility initiative in 2006.

Every audit is led by an Apple auditor and supported by local third-party auditors. These third parties are experts in their fields. And all have been trained to use our detailed auditing protocols. During each audit, we grade suppliers on more than 100 data points corresponding to each category of our Supplier Code of Conduct. Our auditors are highly skilled at identifying when suppliers are covering up information.

Apple audits are proven to improve supplier compliance. Each year we review and raise our already strict requirements, and suppliers continue to meet our increasingly stringent standards. In 2014, facilities audited two times scored 25 percent higher than those facilities with first time audits. Facilities audited three times or more scored 31 percent higher than facilities audited for the first time.

In addition to these regular, prescheduled audits, we randomly select facilities to audit unannounced. These surprise audits help ensure that our suppliers continue to meet our standards at all times — not just during scheduled visits. Apple conducted 40 surprise audits in 2014, where our team visited suppliers on-the-spot and inspected the facility within hours.

We consider a core violation to be the most serious breach of compliance. These include cases of underage or involuntary labor, document falsification, intimidation of or retaliation against workers participating in audits, and significant environmental impacts such as releasing untreated air emissions. All core violations are escalated directly to senior management at Apple and the supplier, and must be addressed immediately. When appropriate, we also report these violations to local authorities. Any supplier with a core violation is placed on probation until successful completion of their next audit. During probation the issue is monitored closely, and if we believe that the supplier is not truly committed to change, we terminate our relationship. To date, we have terminated relationships with 18 suppliers.



Preparation. First, every new factory must follow our Code and Standards, and agree to be audited. Audits are prioritized based on geographic risk, previous audit performance, commodity risks, and planned spending, as well as concerns brought to us by internal teams, external stakeholders, NGOs, and others.

Onsite Audit. Every onsite audit is led by Apple auditors, and supported by local third-party auditors and experts who have been trained on Apple auditing protocols. Together we review hundreds of payroll documents, interview workers, physically assess the health and safety conditions of the facilities, and inspect the environmental conditions inside and outside the factory walls.

Corrective Action. Suppliers are required to remediate all violations. Every supplier must submit a Corrective Action Plan within two weeks of the audit, outlining a corrective course of action. Severe violations negatively affect the suppliers’ business relationship with Apple, including possible termination.

Monitor. A team of verification specialists works with suppliers, checking in at 30-, 60-, and 90-day intervals, to make sure they’re on track. Any delayed progress is escalated to senior management.

Verify Remediation. We hire a third-party auditor to visit the facility at the 120-day mark to independently confirm that everything was resolved to our standards. If not, a second verification is scheduled within 30 days.

2012 2013 2014



What happens after an audit interview?

Apple conducts physical inspections, reviews documents, and interviews workers in their native languages, without their managers present. Afterward, workers are given a phone number, so they have the opportunity to securely and confidentially provide additional feedback about a facility to our team, including anything they consider to be unethical behavior. We encourage workers to report any retaliation to us, and we follow up with all suppliers to address each reported issue. So do our third-party partners. They made more than 30,000 phone calls in 2014 to make sure no negative consequences resulted from a worker speaking up.

Implementing ethical hiring practices.

Select groups of workers — including students, juveniles, dispatch, and foreign workers — are at greater risk of being targeted by unscrupulous labor brokers and employers. This is fundamentally unacceptable behavior. By engaging early with our business teams and suppliers, we’re better able to implement fair hiring practices across the supply chain. And to anticipate and address potential violations before and during employment.

Prevention of Involuntary Labor and Human Trafficking

Code of Conduct Requirement

Suppliers recruiting foreign contract workers either directly or through third party agencies shall be responsible for payment of all recruitment-related fees and expenses.

Finding

Facilities found with overcharges on workers’ recruiting fees and expenses: 15

Remediation Details

Facilities found charging excessive recruitment fees to foreign contract workers, whether through their own recruiters or third party labor brokers, are given a core violation. Apple required violating suppliers to reimburse foreign contract workers in full, totaling US$3.96 million in 2014 and US$20.96 million since 2008. Hiring protocols were also implemented to prevent reoccurrence. We conducted 70 bonded labor focused investigations in 2014 and audited 100 percent of our top 200 facilities that had foreign contract workers.

Creating an educated workforce.

All workers deserve to be treated with dignity. And we want every worker in our supply chain to know that it’s his or her right to work in a fair and ethical environment. That’s why our suppliers trained 2.3 million workers in 2014 — and more than 6.2 million since 2007 — to understand the Apple Code of Conduct, local laws, and health and safety regulations.

Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Cal. Civil Code §1714.43), many manufacturers and retail sellers doing business in California must disclose information regarding their efforts to address the risk of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains.

Applied is a leading provider of innovative equipment and services to manufacturers of semiconductor, flat panel display and solar photovoltaic products. Our ability to manufacture products depends on the timely supply of parts and assemblies that meet defined specifications, which generally entails very close interaction with our suppliers, including regular visits to supplier sites.

Applied Materials is committed to conducting business in an ethical and responsible manner and is unequivocally opposed to slavery and human trafficking. These values are reflected in our Standards of Business Conduct, which states in part that “Without limitation, as a global company, Applied Materials prohibits the use of child labor, and the use of forced, bonded, or indentured labor practices in our operations.” This prohibition is also reiterated in the company’s Human Resources Policy Manual under the Global Policy against Child and/or Forced Labor.

In addition, Applied Materials is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a non-profit coalition committed to supporting the rights and wellbeing of workers and communities worldwide affected by the global electronics supply chain, and has adopted the EICC Code of Conduct (EICC Code). The EICC Code is based in part on international labor and human rights standards that similarly condemn child labor, forced labor and human trafficking.

Applied requires all members of our global supply chain who provide parts and assemblies to our manufacturing facilities (which we refer to as direct suppliers) to comply with the company’s Standards of Business Conduct as well as the EICC Code. We promote adherence in several ways, including the following:

		Agreements with key suppliers require compliance with these codes and applicable laws; 

		A reminder of our compliance requirements is emailed annually to direct suppliers along with a  copy of the Standards of Business Conduct and EICC Code; 

		Web-based training on our Standards of Business Conduct and the EICC Code is provided for Applied personnel and key suppliers, which includes guidance on raising concerns through our global business ethics helplines; 

		The top 80% of suppliers (based on company spend) must complete self-assessments on an annual basis to measure their compliance with these and other similar requirements; 



		Consistent with EICC membership requirements, we have implemented a process to identify any high-risk major suppliers and to perform third party audits of 25% of such suppliers, if warranted; and 

		We have internal accountability standards and procedures in the event an employee or supplier fails to meet company prohibitions on slavery and trafficking. An employee who fails to comply with our policy is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, while our agreements with suppliers include a termination provision for non-compliance with these or other requirements. 

		Further, Applied Materials operates global business ethics helplines that allow anyone to raise a concern. We take all reports seriously and conduct internal investigations and implement corrective actions where warranted.  This statement was last updated on September 12, 2014. For future updates to our policies and practices covered under the Act, please check back to this site."	Yes
22	"Disclosure Pursuant to California Transparency in Supply Chain Act

The California Transparency in Supply Chain Act requires certain companies doing business in California to disclose information about their efforts to address the issues of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. 

AppliedMicro is committed to responsible sourcing, including the prevention and elimination of slavery, human trafficking and illegal child labor, if any, in our supply chain. We have solicited written confirmations from our key suppliers about the absence of slavery, human trafficking and illegal child labor in their businesses, and have a policy to discuss these and related topics with them during our periodic supplier reviews. We may request periodic re-confirmations from these and additional suppliers over time, depending on the context. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, including laws governing forced, indentured or compulsory labor, human trafficking, and child labor. AppliedMicro has not, to date, engaged third parties to audit these matters, and is considering at this time whether to adopt more formal supplier verification, audit, certification, standards and training processes in this area.

AppliedMicro’s guiding principles concerning our workforce and business environment are set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, available at http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=78121&p=irol-govHighlights. Consistent with these principles, we expect all of our suppliers to adopt sound human rights practices and to treat workers with dignity and respect, provide a safe work environment, conduct business in compliance with applicable environmental and employment laws, and comply with other applicable laws and regulations."

23	"The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) requires many companies, including Aptina, to disclose on their websites the efforts they take to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. SB 657 requires disclosures regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability and training.

Verification
At our core, Aptina's core business philosophy is to conduct business with uncompromising integrity and professionalism. Because of this, the company has worked diligently to ensure that we have openly communicated with our suppliers our position as it relates to Supply Chains Act (SB 657). Aptina has confirmed via questionnaire to each supplier and through collecting responses that these suppliers are in agreement with the Supply Chains Act. For those suppliers providing unacceptable responses, Aptina has followed up with additional inquiries.

We believe that our suppliers' agreement and confirmation is accurate and reflects our position of no human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain. Suppliers must comply with no human trafficking and slavery within our supply chain regardless of local business practices or social customs, and at Aptina’s request, demonstrate adherence.

Auditing
Aptina reserves the right to audit its suppliers. While Aptina has not engaged third parties to conduct audits, some of our suppliers may have been audited by other companies. Audits are typically announced prior to being conducted.

Certification
Aptina’s standard terms and conditions require compliance with all applicable laws, including laws against slavery or human trafficking.

Internal Accountability
Aptina requires all team members and contractors to follow the standards and principals set forth in Aptina’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Team members who fail to comply are subject to disciplinary action and contractors who fail to comply may be dropped from Aptina’s supply chain.

Training
Aptina provides managers and its employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with knowledge and information regarding Aptina’s requirements."	Yes
24	"At Arizona Chemical, one of our core values is “We pursue excellence in everything we do,” which we believe includes dealing fairly and ethically with everyone. We strive for high standards in ourselves and seek the same in our suppliers. We will not conduct business with anyone who does not operate with integrity or who may compromise our core values and ethical standards. Basic human rights are fundamentally rooted in our core values. We will not use forced or involuntary labor and expect the same from our suppliers. We strive to maintain our high standards and to seek suppliers who share our commitment in this goal.

We comply with all applicable laws in the operation of our business, including, without limitation, laws regarding child labor and human trafficking. Our supplier selection and maintenance processes help ensure our suppliers, and those with whom our suppliers do business, share our commitment to operating in a socially responsible manner.

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the “Act”) went into effect. It requires retail sellers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eliminate slavery and human trafficking from direct supply chains. The numbered topics below are directly from the Act:

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

		1)  Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.  Arizona Chemical relies upon published reports, including, without limitation, reports published by Transparency International and the U.S. Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor, as well as other business intelligence documents in order to identify country risk, evaluate suppliers, and document verification activities. This evaluation is initially conducted by Arizona Chemical, but may be elevated to a third party depending on the results of the initial evaluation. For high to medium risk suppliers and/or countries of origin, further investigation occurs including but not limited to conference calls with suppliers to address and clarify any questions and/or concerns. If concerns cannot be resolved during calls, possible on- site evaluations and audits may occur. 

		2)  Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.  At this time, the audits are “self-audit questionnaires” and are e-mailed/mailed to suppliers. If concerns arise from responses, corrective action notices will be sent to suppliers with time to remedy or prevent occurrences in the future. If the supplier does not confirm compliance within the designated period, immediate suspension or termination of business with such supplier may occur. In the future, on-site audits will be performed opportunistically or scheduled if any concerns arise around specific suppliers. At this time, Arizona Chemical is evaluating the best method of conducting on-site audits. 

		3)  Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.  The surveys require suppliers to certify that their products, and any materials incorporated therein, comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they do business. Arizona Chemical’s Purchase Orders and Standard Terms and Conditions require that all suppliers be in full compliance with all applicable governmental, legal, and regulatory requirements. 

		4)  Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.  A specific business process is in place detailing the verification procedure and includes the internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. Arizona Chemical is forming an anonymous global hotline to aid employees and those with whom we do business who have concerns regarding slavery and trafficking. Arizona Chemical also emphasizes its Code of Business Conduct and requires its employees to comply with such code as well as the company’s employee handbook. Failure of employees to comply with the law or company policies may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

		5)  Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.  Arizona Chemical trains its employees who are directly responsible for supply chain management on the proper business processes applicable to supplier selection and ongoing evaluation, and the importance of compliance therewith and enforcement thereof. Additionally, external training such as seminars and webinars will be evaluated and obtained for training purposes if necessary."	Yes
25	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure (SB 657)

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires companies that manufacture or sell products in the State of California to disclose their efforts, if any, to provide information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chains. The law was designed to increase consumers’ knowledge about products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Tesoro Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Tesoro”) are committed to complying with the law wherever we operate and conducting all business activities in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We expect the same of the parties with which we do business. Our ethical standard is reflected in our Code of Business Conduct, “Doing the Right Thing” (“Code”) which outlines our expectations of ethical conduct and compliance with all laws from our employees and others who work and represent Tesoro.

In addition to receiving our Code, employees take annual ethics and compliance training and certify their adherence with its standards, or disclose any exceptions. Tesoro maintains a 24/7 Business Conduct Helpline where employees and contractors can submit any concerns of possible ethics and compliance violations, including slavery and human trafficking, anonymously, if requested. Every submission is reviewed and handled accordingly. Any employee or contractor who is found to have violated the Code provision is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts, as the case may be, and referral to appropriate legal authorities.

To ensure that our supply chain reflects our commitment to compliance and ethics standards, our corporate business practice provides that Tesoro’s purchasing decisions with suppliers include being based on integrity. Tesoro expects its suppliers to comply with legal requirements and operate consistently with the principles the Code when working on our behalf.

CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) will go into effect in the State of California. This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Atmel seeks at all times to conform to the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition’s Code of Conduct (the “Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is underpinned by international labor and human rights standards. We believe that workers at supplier facilities have the right to freely choose employment and the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. Slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including forced labor and child labor.

Atmel Corporation has zero tolerance for suppliers that traffic in persons, use forced labor in performing contracts, or use debt-bonded contract labor (all referred to here as “Forced Labor”). Atmel has undertaken efforts to require that its vendors comply with the Code of Conduct and pledges to continue to do so in the future. Additionally:

				  Atmel does not believe that any of its suppliers engage in Forced Labor practices. The company has initiated a review of its supply chain to evaluate compliance with these requirements. Atmel conducts these reviews, and will conduct any verification efforts, with its own qualified employees. Atmel does not anticipate engaging any third party to perform these reviews or verification as of the date of this Statement. 

				  Atmel has not, as of the date of this Statement, conducted audits of its supply chain. If it determines that such audits are appropriate, it would expect to conduct audits under those circumstances, without prior announcement, either by independent auditors or its own qualified employees. 

				  Atmel has begun to require its direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into its products comply with all applicable laws addressing Forced Labor. 

				  Atmel intends to implement a policy specifically addressing Forced Labor matters, including slavery and human trafficking issues, and to integrate that policy into its supply chain requirements. 

				  Atmel trains employees responsible for supply chain management on how to identify and respond to supply chain issues, such as Forced Labor. We require all Atmel employees and contractors to comply with our Standards of Business Conduct (SBC).  Atmel does not utilize any Forced Labor activities at its own facilities in the United States or elsewhere.  Atmel expects to take appropriate actions to ensure that its products are not manufactured through Forced Labor.

At Baker Hughes, we believe principled business practices are key to our success. We seek to play a positive role in the communities where we work by conducting business in a way that respects human rights. Our business operations adhere to the principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a general standard of human rights worldwide. We are committed to universal human rights standards, such as nondiscriminatory treatment, voluntary employment, freedom of association, minimum wage, anti-harassment, and maintaining a healthy and safe work environment.

It is our expectation that our direct suppliers of tangible goods will uphold the human rights of workers, and treat their employees with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. We expect our direct suppliers to always strive to be fair and objective in their advice and actions, and never to be influenced in their decisions, actions or recommendations by issues of gender, race, creed, color, age or personal disability. Direct suppliers shall prohibit harassment and unlawful discrimination in the workplace; and not traffic in persons or use any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured, or prison labor. This includes the transportation, harboring, recruitment, transfer, or receipt of persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, fraud, or payments to any person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation. All work must be voluntary and workers shall be free to leave work or terminate their employment with reasonable notice; child labor is strictly prohibited as is the employment of children.

These principles evidence our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking by our direct supply chain for tangible goods that we offer for sale:

Verification of product received from direct suppliers of tangible goods

We evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and slavery in our direct supply chain of tangible goods by establishing our expectations of our management and employees in our company Business Code of Conduct and suppliers in our Supplier Code of Conduct.

We verify, evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and slavery in our direct supply chain of tangible goods through our supplier due diligence program and post-contract award audits as well as through the enforcement of the terms and conditions under which our direct suppliers perform their work for us.

Our Business Ethics Help Line is a free, multilingual, 24-hour service answered by an independent third party. The help line provides a forum to report concerns or instructions on the reporting process so concerns or questionable conduct can be brought to our company’s attention.

Audits of direct suppliers of tangible goods

Our procurement due diligence process includes an evaluation of and certification by our direct suppliers of their compliance with international standards and all laws regarding forced labor, slavery, human trafficking and the worst forms of child labor in the countries in which they do business.

We also perform post-contract award audits of our direct suppliers. Our direct suppliers are provided a short period of notice prior to the audits to help ensure that the information needed for the audit is available. These audits focus on whether the suppliers are committed to conducting business with the highest degree of ethics and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and have the programs in place to do so. The audits are conducted by our Financial Compliance team, who operate independently of our supply chain organization. The audits are not conducted by an independent third party.

Certification of materials from direct suppliers incorporated into products 

We require our direct suppliers, as a part of our due diligence process, to certify that they comply with international standards and all laws regarding forced labor, slavery, human trafficking and the worst forms of child labor of the country or countries in which they do business.

Subsequently, our post contract review of direct suppliers requires the supplier’s to certify that they are committed to conducting business with the highest degree of ethics and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that they have a program in place to ensure compliance.

Our direct suppliers are further obligated to comply with the terms and conditions in our contracts that include compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We have revised our standard supplier contract to specifically preclude suppliers from using any form of forced or child labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise. Slavery and human trafficking are prohibited.

The company has the right to terminate a supplier’s contract and cease any further activity with the supplier should our due diligence process evidence that a supplier is failing to meet the company terms of our standard supplier contract or if the supplier otherwise violates the law.

Internal accountability and standards

Should the company be made aware of a violation of our Business Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct or applicable laws or regulations by one of our management or employees or a supplier, the company would have the discretion to terminate any or all of those relationships and take such other actions as it would deem legally available.

Training

The company provides training to all of its new and existing employees and management regarding the principles established by our Business Code of Conduct and Core Values. It provides the guidelines and identifies resources available for making ethical and legal decisions in the workplace. In addition, there is specific procurement compliance training for supply chain employees.

Baxter seeks to foster and maintain a culture of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and the highest standards of ethics and business conduct with respect to forced labor and human trafficking and slavery. Our commitment to fostering this culture of compliance extends to our relationships with suppliers. Specifically, Baxter does not support, encourage or endorse any form of forced labor or human trafficking and slavery in our operations or in our supplier networks. We take a number of steps with respect to verification of our supply chain and certification of materials to ensure suppliers are operating in an ethical manner with respect to forced labor, including the following:

  On an annual basis, Baxter conducts a sustainability survey of its select suppliers to assess whether these suppliers have programs to address potential human rights risks, including human trafficking and slavery and whether they have been alleged to have violated any human rights standards. This survey is conducted by Baxter and not a third party. 

  Supplier contracts include language that permit Baxter, upon advance notice, to access facilities at which any products and services provided to Baxter are manufactured and delivered to assess suppliers’ compliance with Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance Standards for Suppliers. Baxter does routinely conduct quality audits of its suppliers and is currently evaluating the need to audit compliance with company standards for human trafficking and slavery. 

  We have incorporated rules against forced labor into our Ethics and Compliance Standards for Suppliers and commercial agreements with suppliers. Suppliers who conduct business with Baxter are required to acknowledge receipt of Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance Standards for Suppliers. Specifically, the Standards forbid the production or manufacture by suppliers of products or services (or incorporation of any materials therein) in violation of laws governing workers’ human rights, including human trafficking and slavery. 

  Employees and contractors of Baxter are expected to know, understand and live up to Baxter’s Code of Conduct. Employees have a duty to report any known or suspected violation of the Code, or any laws, rules or regulations applicable to Baxter. Reporting such violations helps to safeguard the reputation and integrity of Baxter and its employees. Baxter’s internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and contractors can be found at the following link: http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/corporate_governance/ethics_and_compliance
/procedures_for_employees.html#communications_investigations. 

  Baxter's Ethics and Compliance Helpline, a telephone and web resource, is available to employees, their families, suppliers and customers as another channel to report or seek guidance on issues. The Ethics and Compliance Helpline has the ability to connect callers to counselors, 24-hours a day, seven days a week in 150 languages, at 1-877-BAXTER-3. 

  Baxter provides training sessions on Baxter’s Code of Conduct for new and existing employees. Additionally, Baxter has a Procurement Ethics course for those who have direct responsibility for supply chain management. Beginning in 2012, this module includes material to educate procurement professionals about human rights risks, including human trafficking and slavery.

35	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. The following highlights Bayer’s global efforts in this regard. 

Bayer supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a number of globally recognized declarations for multinational enterprises. As a founding member of the United Nations Global Compact initiative, Bayer undertakes to implement the 10 universally recognized principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption throughout the organization when shaping business processes and strategies. 

Promoting human rights standards internally and throughout all of Bayer’s business operations is in line with our Values and Leadership Principles, our Sustainable Development Policy and our group-wide Human Rights Position. Bayer’s commitment to foster the implementation of human rights is supported through our Corporate Compliance Policy. It is in effect at all Bayer locations, and it applies to Bayer’s business operations worldwide. Bayer will use this position as a framework to guide our decision-making and constructive engagement within our sphere of influence, while the responsibility of the governments of the various countries for protection of human rights is respected. 

Bayer has combined all of its fundamental sustainability standards and requirements for its suppliers in a Supplier Code of Conduct. This code of conduct comprises the areas of ethics, labor, management systems, health, safety, environment, and quality. Our Supplier Code of Conduct emphasizes international labor and human rights standards. Suppliers are expected to protect the human rights of their employees and to treat them with dignity and respect. Supplier employees shall have the right to freely choose employment, the right to associate freely and join or be represented by worker councils or labor unions on a voluntary basis, and the right to bargain collectively as they choose. Workers also have the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. 

In order to successfully address the diverse challenges of a sustainable supply chain and to leverage synergies together with other companies, we collaborate with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) as well as with Together for Sustainability (TfS), an initiative co-founded by Bayer. In both initiatives, we focus on the standardization of sustainability aspects in the relevant industries in order to establish corresponding social, ethical and environmental practices among our suppliers. The exchange of supplier assessments and audits among member companies enables access to additional sustainability evaluations of suppliers who also work for Bayer. This minimizes the administrative burden for both suppliers and the member companies. 

The Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative is a group of major pharmaceutical companies who share a vision of better social, economic, and environmental outcomes for all those involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain. This includes improved conditions for workers (including freely chosen employment, no involuntary prison labor, abolition of child labor, and no use of forced, bonded or indentured labor), economic development, and a cleaner environment for local communities. 

The Together for Sustainability Initiative is a group of multinational companies which aims at developing and implementing a global supplier engagement program that assesses and improves sustainability sourcing practices, including ecological and social aspects. The initiative is based on good practices and builds on established principles – such as the United Nations Global Compact and the Responsible Care Global Charter as well as standards developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Social Accountability International (SAI) and others. 

Slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including forced labor and child labor. We follow a clear 'zero tolerance to child labor' policy in our business operations worldwide. We do not tolerate child labor in our supply chain either, where we take action against known cases of violations. Our efforts to fight against child labor and forced labor are consistent with the ILO’s core labor standards and the United Nations Global Compact principles.

Our efforts for more sustainability in the supply chain include: 

Sustainability standards: Bayer regards adherence to sustainability standards within the supply chain as a crucial factor in the value chain. By acting responsibly in collaboration with our suppliers, we aim to minimize risks and create stable, long-term business relationships with our partners. For this reason, Bayer applies not just economic standards, but also environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards in choosing new suppliers or continuing its relationships with existing ones. These standards are defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes child labor avoidance and no utilization of forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. It is legally binding and integrated into electronic ordering systems and contracts throughout Bayer. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and our Human Rights Position.



Supplier sustainability performance evaluation: The sustainability performance of our suppliers is monitored through online supplier assessments and on-site audits. The assessments are carried out on our behalf by a leading web-based service platform for sustainability performance monitoring (EcoVadis). They are based on a web-supported, modular questionnaire completed by the supplier, coupled with accompanying verification documents and 360° screening. Suppliers are selected for these assessments based on a combination of country and material risks as well as strategic importance in accordance with our Group targets. We conduct the on-site audits with external, independent auditors. Here, too, we apply the standard of the respective industry initiatives in which we participate in order to benefit from synergies. In addition, internal auditors perform inspections focusing on health, safety, environmental protection and sustainability. All assessment and audit results are thoroughly analyzed and documented. Wherever the results are unsatisfactory, we develop improvement measures together with our suppliers to ensure that they observe social, ethical and environmental standards in the future. In 2014, 5% of the assessments had a critical result. In each of these cases, we initiated measures ranging from action plans through the improvement of defined weaknesses to the reduction of the procurement volume. In 2014, Bayer was not prompted to end a supplier relationship due solely to sustainability performance.



Training for procurement staff: We offer training activities to help procurement staff worldwide create awareness of sustainability and possible risks in dialogue with our suppliers. Training for employees in procurement in the Bayer Group includes attending courses on sustainability in supplier management. In addition, the subgroups organize specific training events, such as courses for selected procurement employees on the issue of sustainability audits or sustainability roadshows for different procurement categories and local procurement organizations.



Training for suppliers: We regularly provide information on sustainability to our suppliers through Supplier Days. This global and local dialogue is essential to build up reliable relations and to make the principles of our procurement policy and our sustainability requirements clear to our suppliers. In return, we would like to know more about the suppliers’ situation in order to be able to identify and remove obstacles in our collaboration at an early stage. The continuous development of suppliers in terms of sustainability is also a key objective of the industry initiatives TfS and PSCI. The TfS initiative offers online sustainability training to provide suppliers with general information on the initiative and the audit process. Moreover, the TfS member companies organize joint supplier events with the aim to promote a mutual understanding on sustainability challenges and requirements in the supply chain. The PSCI initiative likewise promotes continuing supplier development by means of the comprehensive information provided on the PSCI website, and by organizing webinars and conferences on subjects such as occupational safety."

This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by companies with regard to efforts to eradicate forced labor and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Forced labor and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor. BCBGMAXAZRIA has a zero-tolerance policy for both forced labor and child labor and we are committed to ensuring that our supply chain reflects our respect for human rights.

Our relationships with suppliers are based on lawful, efficient and fair practices. We expect our suppliers to obey the laws that require them to treat workers fairly, and provide a safe and healthy work environment. We require our manufacturing facilities to confirm in writing that they conform to these standards, and we maintain a file of these certifications.

We also reserve the right to make periodic, unannounced inspections of our suppliers’ facilities to verify each supplier’s compliance with our sourcing guidelines and other requirements. Such on-site inspections are conducted by either our internal team or by a third party company, and we reserve the right to terminate the relationship with any supplier who fails to comply with our requirements."

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is committed to sourcing quality merchandise and developing meaningful relationships with its vendors who share common principles of social responsibility. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. aims to cooperate with its vendors and their subcontractors on a systematic, long term basis to ensure our sourced merchandise is produced under socially responsible conditions.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is constantly looking for ways to improve in the area of corporate social responsibility.  In connection with this effort, we encourage our vendors to adopt a comprehensive program of responsible practices and to prepare a corporate responsibility (or “sustainability”) report if they do not already do so. 

All vendors and their factories must follow our ""Code of Conduct"", which details our policies in regard to child labor, involuntary labor, human trafficking, disciplinary practices, non-discrimination, health and safety, environmental protection, wages and benefits, working hours, employee relations, and other items.

Code of Conduct

The Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Code of Conduct summarizes the basic requirements concerning working conditions that must be satisfied by each vendor for every location. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. reserves the right to change and supplement the Code of Conduct at any time.

Vendors shall familiarize workers with the Code of Conduct and display it, translated in the local language, at each of their facilities in a place readily visible and accessible to workers. Vendors shall ensure that their contractors and suppliers adhere to the Code of Conduct.

Child Labor

Vendors shall not use child labor. The international standard for defining “Child Labor” is found in the International Labor Organizations’ Convention 138 on Minimum Age for Employment (1973) which provides as follows:  “The minimum age […] should not be less than the age of compulsory schooling and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 years.” If the country of production has a more restrictive definition of child labor, then Bed Bath & Beyond will not produce product made by persons in violation of that country’s laws. Vendors must verify the age of their workers and maintain copies of their workers’ proof of age.   Vendors must follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding working hours and conditions for minors. 

Involuntary Labor

Vendor shall not use involuntary labor. “Involuntary Labor” is defined as work or service which is extracted from any person under threat or penalty for its non-performance and for which the worker does not offer himself or herself voluntarily, and includes all manner of prison, bonded, indentured and forced labor.

Human Trafficking 

Vendors and all direct suppliers to such Vendors shall comply with the laws addressing human trafficking and slavery of the country or countries where the Vendors do business. For purposes of this Code of Conduct, the operative standard for defining “Human trafficking” is taken from the U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol):   “[…] the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.   Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, [or] servitude; […]”

Vendors shall certify that they have implemented procedures to manage all aspects of the supply chain to ensure they comply with laws on slavery and human trafficking. Workers must be allowed to maintain control over their identity documents.

Health and Safety

Vendors shall provide workers with a clean, safe, and healthy workplace in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

The work environment must be safe and sanitary to ensure there are no unreasonable risks to the health and safety of all workers. Factories must implement procedures and safeguards to prevent accidents and injuries to workers; procedures and safeguards include, but are not limited to, inspection of buildings, machinery, and fire extinguishers. Regular and recorded health and safety training shall be provided for all new or reassigned workers and management.

Vendors shall ensure that workers have access to clean drinking water, sanitary washing facilities, and an adequate number of toilets.

Aisles, exits, and stairwells must be kept unblocked at all times. The workplaces must provide adequate lighting and ventilation.

Vendors must maintain appropriate chemical safety ensuring proper chemical storage, eye wash stations, and Personal Protective Equipment for workers, as applicable.

Environmental Protection

Vendors should ensure that every manufacturing facility complies with environmental laws, including all laws related to waste disposal, air emissions, discharges, toxic substances, and hazardous waste disposal, as well as procedures for notifying local authorities in the event of an environmental accident resulting from the Vendor’s operations.

Factories must take steps to ensure that all input materials and components were obtained from permissible sources consistent with international treaties and local laws and regulations. Appropriate and adequate environmental training should be provided to all workers and management.

Wages and Benefits

Vendors shall provide wages and benefits that comply with all applicable laws and regulations or match the prevailing local manufacturing or industry rates, whichever is higher. Overtime pay shall be calculated at the legally required rate, regardless of whether workers are compensated hourly or by piece rate.

Factories must compensate all workers in accordance with the law and where applicable with contractual agreements. Workers must be provided with written and understandable details regarding their employment and compensation.

Working Hours

Vendors shall not require workers to work, including overtime, more than 60 hours per week or more than any maximum number of hours per week established by applicable laws and regulations, whichever is less. Vendors shall guarantee that workers receive at least one day off during each seven day period.

Employee Relations

Vendors shall respect the right of workers to take advantage of any laws relating to employee management relations.

Dormitories and Canteen

Factories that provide residential and dining facilities for their workers must provide safe, healthy, and sanitary facilities.

All areas of the dormitory facilities shall be kept secure, clean and have safety provisions (such as fire extinguishers, first aid kits, unobstructed emergency exits, emergency lighting, etc.). Emergency evacuation drills shall be conducted at least once a year. Additionally, Factories shall provide appropriate washroom facilities, including adequate toilets and showers segregated by gender. The facility should also have security measures to protect employees and their property.  Dormitories must be in compliance with all housing laws and regulations, occupancy requirements, and health and safety laws. 

Legal Requirements

Vendors shall comply with all legal requirements applicable to the conduct of their businesses, including those set out above.

Management at the Company has also participated in webinars and attended presentations organized by reputable third party industry groups with respect to the requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Internal team members with direct responsibility for supply chain have also participated in training on slavery and human trafficking.

Social Compliance Audits

Though the amount of product sold in our stores that is imported directly by us is a very small portion of our business, Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, and Harmon, Harmon Face Values have developed a Social Compliance Audit Program for all vendors of direct import merchandise.  In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY have instituted the same requirements for vendors of private label products whether imported or domestically sourced.  The requirements of the Social Compliance Audit Program are communicated to vendors through our Quality Assurance Manual.

All vendors or Buying/Selling Agents are required to be fully knowledgeable of all factories and labor arrangements used in the production of goods. 

The Company has partnered with an ISO accredited, worldwide, independent laboratory to implement the Social Compliance Audit Program.  Audits initiated by the Company are conducted on a semi-unannounced basis. All vendors or their agents must allow the Company’s partner to conduct both scheduled and unscheduled inspections of their facilities for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Code of Conduct and employee health and safety standards. During audits, the Company maintains the right to, among other things, review all employee related books and records maintained by the vendor and to interview workers outside the presence of factory management.  The audit also includes protocols to assess risks of human trafficking and slavery.  Any deficiencies identified in a Social Compliance Audit must be remedied within a reasonable timeframe.  

All vendors are required to sign our Import Vendor Compliance Guide Acknowledgment Form, which confirms their acceptance and certifies their compliance with all of the above policies."	Yes
39	"This disclosure is made in accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 567) which requires that companies disclose certain matters with respect to their efforts to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.

Masco Corporation and its subsidiaries have a longstanding commitment to the ethical and responsible sourcing of goods and supplies for Masco's family of companies.  Masco's Supplier Business Practices Policy (SBPP), which is published at www.mascopurchasing.com, formalizes that commitment by requiring, among other things, that our suppliers respect our standards and those of our customers, including with regard to compliance with laws, human rights, child labor, human trafficking, slavery, wages and benefits, excessive working hours, corporal punishment, discrimination, safe and clean workplaces and other labor and employment standards.

Verification of Supply Chains

Verification of supply chains and auditing of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance and address risks with respect to human trafficking and slavery.

Masco requires our operating units to have a formal system for reviewing and accepting new vendors.  For vendors located outside the United States, Canada and Western Europe, this program requires a physical review of each new factory to ensure that it meets at least baseline requirements with respect to applicable laws and working conditions, including laws against human trafficking and slavery.  Additionally, Masco's Purchase Order Terms and Conditions for Masco Companies (published at www.mascopurchasing.com) requires compliance with applicable laws as well as the standards and requirements set forth in the SBPP.

In addition to the process for selecting new vendors described above, Masco engages in verification of the practices of its existing supplier base (other than suppliers located in the United States and Western Europe) through periodic announced audits to assess risks and ensure compliance with applicable laws and conditions, including laws governing human trafficking and slavery.  These audits are conducted by Masco employees for suppliers in China, Taiwan and Vietnam, and by third parties for suppliers located in other countries.  If significant issues are raised by an audit, we may also conduct a follow-up unannounced audit to address the initial findings.  

Masco maintains an internal scoring system with respect to its periodic audits of suppliers and records the results on an internal web site.  Masco further investigates all reported instances of non-compliance and takes appropriate action to help ensure that our SBPP standards and applicable laws are observed. Masco's global compliance program is managed from Masco's Shenzhen, China office in conjunction with Masco's internal auditors located in Taiwan and Vietnam.

Selection Standards

Masco selection and continued use of suppliers is based on the following standards with respect to all goods that we purchase described in our SBPP:  
1. Comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
2. Protect against the use of workers younger than the minimum age required by law.
3. Protect against the use of forced labor (i.e., human trafficking and slavery).
4. Provide appropriate wages and benefits as required by law.
5. Protect against excessive working hours that exceed local laws or business customs.
6. Protect against physical and mental punishment of workers.
7. Protect against unlawful discrimination against workers and encourage employment based on ability.
8. Respect workers' rights to associate freely.
9. Maintain safe and clean workplaces, including any residential facilities, in compliance with the law.
10. Protect our confidential and proprietary information.

We will not knowingly work with suppliers that do not respect these standards and those of our customers.  We will periodically assess our supplier's compliance with these standards and those of our customers.  Any reported non-compliance will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken.  These standards apply whether the supplier is a Masco company, an affiliate or a third party.

Internal Accountability Standards

Masco's internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding trafficking and human slavery and training for employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management.

Masco maintains internal accountability standards for employees through its legal and ethical compliance program (the ""Code of Business Ethics""), which focuses on areas of ethical risk, and helps foster Masco's culture of honesty, accountability and transparency.  Further, the SBPP pledges that Masco will avoid working with suppliers that do not respect our standards and those of our customers. If an employee is in violation of our Code of Business Ethics or if a supplier is acting in violation of the SBPP, we will (in certain egregious situations) terminate such employee or supplier, or we will work with them to remedy the violation.  If the effort to remedy the violation is unsuccessful, we will evaluate our business relationship with that supplier or employee and take appropriate corrective action. Corrective action may include cancelation of an affected order, prohibition on further use of a facility or supplier, termination of employment and reporting the violation to the proper authorities.  If a supplier refuses access to our auditors, the relationship with that supplier will be terminated.  

Masco believes that education and training are critical components to ensuring that our standards are met and that human rights within our supply chain are respected.  All salaried employees, including those with responsibility for supply chain, are required to certify annually their compliance with the Masco Code of Business Ethics and complete on-line training.  Masco's Code of Business Ethics includes the requirement to comply with all laws in all places where Masco does business, and a violation of the Code may result in penalties, including termination. Additionally, Masco periodically trains each of its employees and managers with responsibility for supply chain management with respect to the applicable requirements of, and compliance with, our SBPP, including with respect to human trafficking and slavery."

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 went into effect in the state of California. The Act requires retailers and manufacturers that do business in California to publicly disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. Big Lots is committed to ensuring that its supply chain reflects its values and respect for human rights. To that end, Big Lots requires that its suppliers, their contractors and their subcontractors certify that they agree to and fully comply with, the standards listed in Big Lots’ Standards for Suppliers (“Standards for Suppliers”).

The Standards for Suppliers requires that suppliers comply with the legal requirements and standards of their industry under the local and national laws of the jurisdictions in which the suppliers are doing business, including the labor and employment laws of those jurisdictions, and any applicable U.S. laws. Furthermore, the Standards for Suppliers states that Big Lots will not accept products from suppliers who utilize in any manner child labor, forced labor or prison labor in the manufacturer of its products.

Big Lots favors suppliers who have a social and political commitment to basic principles of human rights and who do not discriminate against their employees in hiring practices, or any other term or condition of work, on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability or other similar factors.

BioMarin believes there is a very low risk its supply chain contains any element of slavery, child labor, or human trafficking and is committed to ensuring it remains free of any such activity. BioMarin will continue to raise awareness among our employees, suppliers, partners, and other stakeholders on this critical topic. Through diligent efforts we will assure that our supply chain reflects BioMarin's commitment to human rights.

We believe we are a low risk for the following reasons. BioMarin does not source materials associated with forced labor or child labor as listed in the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor (2010). BioMarin does not pursue a strategy of low cost country sourcing and is foremost focused on quality and risk avoidance. Further, BioMarin sources greater than 99% of its materials from Tier 1 countries as defined in the U.S. State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report (June 2011). BioMarin does not source any materials from Tier 3 countries and although BioMarin contracts with companies in two Tier 2 countries (China and Switzerland), each of these suppliers produce active pharmaceutical ingredients for BioMarin and therefore are closely monitored for many aspects of the production process including the caliber and training of the personnel employed.

BioMarin conducts regular cGxP compliance audits of its direct material and service providers as part of its overall commitment to the quality of the products we produce. BioMarin employs its own staff or contractors for these audits and they are scheduled in advance. The scope of these supplier evaluations will be expanded to include review of labor practices and will document instances of deviations from legal or ethical standards established by the country of origin or by BioMarin. BioMarin has not employed a third party to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery in its supply chain.

BioMarin contracts with its direct material and service providers and specifies within those contracts that compliance with all applicable laws is integral to performance under those contracts.

BioMarin believes its Global Code of Conduct and Business Ethics establishes the principles and expectations of its employees and contractors and enforces compliance with those expectations through internal audits, training, and when necessary, disciplinary action. The scope of these principles includes adherence to applicable laws including those regarding labor practices. The clause on ethical business practices clearly states:

● BioMarin does not seek competitive advantages through illegal or unethical business practices. Each employee should endeavor to deal fairly with the BioMarin's patients, customers, healthcare professionals, and other employees, and other business associates. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through inappropriate manipulation, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any unfair dealing practice.

BioMarin's Corporate Compliance and Ethics function is responsible for monitoring and enforcing its principles and reports on compliance issues to the CEO and Board of Directors regularly.

In an effort to increase awareness and understanding of the issue of human trafficking and slavery, and to improve our ability to verify its absence in our supply chain, BioMarin has established the formal training of its supply chain personnel and supplier quality personnel. This training will be repeated periodically and will be documented in the personnel files of the employees.

BioMarin is committed to conducting its business in accordance with all legal and regulatory requirements and with the highest standards of ethical behavior. To this end, BioMarin has adopted corporate governance principles for business conduct and ethics to serve as a guide to help all BioMarin employees, directors, and BioMarin subsidiaries maintain the highest ethical and professional standards in the course of performing their job duties. Any questions or comments regarding BioMarin's business practices should be directed to BioMarin's Compliance and Ethics Hotline www.BIOMARIN.ethicspoint.com or by telephone at 1- 866-513-7198."	Yes

At Bio-Rad our mission is to provide useful and high-quality products and services that advance scientific discovery and improve healthcare. We provide an expansive line of products and services to hospitals, universities, major research institutions, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical firms throughout the world.

In keeping with Bio-Rad’s Mission and to comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) we are posting this disclosure. The Act requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. The Act requires disclosures regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability, and training.

Bio-Rad supports the elimination of slavery and human trafficking.

Verification

Certain of our business units evaluate the risks of human trafficking and slavery in Bio-Rad's product supply chain and also use supply chain processes to mitigate potential risks. Bio-Rad does not employ a third party for verification.

Auditing

Some business units audit their principal suppliers. Bio-Rad continues to evaluate its supply chain processes to consider how it can further support the elimination of slavery and human trafficking.

Supplier Agreements

While Bio-Rad suppliers may have their own codes of business conduct and ethics which require them to comply with applicable laws, our suppliers may also commit contractually to such a standard in their supply contracts with us or when they accept Bio-Rad’s purchase order terms and conditions. Some Bio-Rad business units also engage their principal suppliers in supplier awareness training concerning slavery and human trafficking during periodic supplier day events.

Internal Accountability

Bio-Rad has a Code of Business Ethics and Conduct which applies to Bio-Rad’s employees worldwide and to Bio-Rad’s Board of Directors. The Code requires employees to comply with applicable law and transact business in a lawful, honest, ethical, and professional manner. Employees are also required to treat customers, suppliers, employees, governments and the public with respect, honesty, and integrity. In particular, the Code states that regulators have a “zero tolerance” policy with respect to acts that support the trafficking of persons or the use of forced labor. If an employee needs guidance or knows of or suspects a violation of the Code, the Code requires that he or she consult with or report the matter to his or her supervisor, management or Human Resources. Those employees who violate the Code are subject to appropriate corrective action, which can include disciplinary measures permitted by applicable law, such as dismissal, and possible legal proceedings.

Procurement Training

All Bio-Rad employees receive periodic training on the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. In addition, some Bio-Rad business units provide periodic training to employees responsible for procurement of materials for Bio-Rad’s product supply chain and have undertaken to familiarize their buyers with identifying slavery and human trafficking issues and mitigating such risks. One of the questions that procurement personnel may consider when selecting a supplier relates to slavery and human trafficking.

For purposes of this Statement, the term “Bio-Rad” and such terms as “our,” and “we” may refer to one or more or all of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.’s consolidated subsidiaries. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise designation of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Bourns, Inc. (“Bourns”) seeks to use only suppliers which Bourns believes act in a responsible manner, including having no involvement with slavery, human trafficking, forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards. Bourns evaluates suppliers on criteria beyond price. Such criteria include, among others, business history, financial stability, quality, timeliness of delivery, working conditions and compliance with laws.

Bourns requires its direct suppliers to comply with the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct which states that:

				Bourns supports the eradication of slavery and human trafficking worldwide and the effective elimination of all forms of forced labor and child labor in violation of international standards; and 

				Bourns will use this objective as a criterion in the selection and management of its suppliers.  Although Bourns expects compliance pursuant to the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct, Bourns presently does not require its direct suppliers to provide written certification that materials incorporated into the supplied product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.  Bourns employees conduct on-site reviews of a majority of significant new direct suppliers which includes personally observing the supplier’s workplace. When evaluating significant new direct suppliers, Bourns typically examines issues associated with the supply chain below that supplier. Beyond these actions, Bourns presently does not engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery or use any third parties for this purpose.  When concerns arise, Bourns visits existing suppliers to observe and assess compliance with Bourns’ standards. Under the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct, suppliers are obligated to provide Bourns or its representatives with access to the supplier’s premises to assess the supplier’s compliance with the standards and expectations of the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct. Bourns’ policy is not to use any independent third parties to audit its suppliers for compliance with the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct, either on an announced or unannounced basis.  Bourns also requires its employees, including those with supply chain management responsibilities, to review, understand and comply with the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct. Bourns currently does not provide training specific to the mitigation of human trafficking and slavery.  Bourns’ policy is to cease doing business with any supplier that fails to meet Bourns’ standards regarding slavery and human trafficking. Any Bourns employee that violates the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct is subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment."	Yes

Bridgford Foods Corporation is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, and to actively engaging and promoting socially responsible and ethical business practices. This commitment extends to our supply chain, and we work with our suppliers to ensure that together we manage our business and business relationships in a socially responsible and ethical way. 

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires Bridgford Foods to disclose our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain. Bridgford combats human trafficking on two fronts: first, by holding our suppliers to a high standard of accountability; and second, by ensuring our own employees are made aware of the problem of human trafficking, and providing them with relevant training about the problem of human trafficking. Bridgford is committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner, and therefore expects both its suppliers and employees to comport themselves in the same manner. 

Bridgford has long required compliance with applicable labor and employment laws, including those that address the illegality of human trafficking and slavery. Now, we are taking steps to verify such compliance from our suppliers. To evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and slavery specific to each link in our supply chain, and verify that our suppliers are combating human trafficking, Bridgford Foods utilizes a Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits all types of illegal conduct by our suppliers including unlawful discrimination and harassment as well as human trafficking and slavery.  The Code of Conduct makes clear Bridgford Foods’ commitment to eradicating human trafficking. Bridgford Foods requires each and every supplier to accept the Supplier Code of Conduct, and to sign an acknowledgement of receipt of the Code. 

To evaluate supplier compliance with our Supplier Code, particularly with the provisions that prohibit human trafficking and slavery, Bridgford Foods has obtained the authority to conduct unannounced audits of its suppliers to ensure their compliance with the Code of Conduct. If Bridgford ever receives a Complaint or other constructive knowledge of an allegation of human trafficking or slavery, it requires the supplier to perform a thorough and complete investigation and report the results of the investigation to Bridgford. Additionally, Bridgford Foods requires that suppliers certify that all materials incorporated into their products abide by applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

Moreover, Bridgford Foods has a corporate Human Rights Policy. This policy further advances our goal of remaining socially responsible, while at the same time maintaining an accountability standard to which we hold our employees. As our policy states, we have zero tolerance for human trafficking and slavery. This policy is distributed to, and applicable to, all employees. 

To make sure our employees have the requisite knowledge to aid in our efforts to eradicate human trafficking, Bridgford Foods makes available to all our employees various training and information addressing human rights, including the human trafficking training offered by the Department of Homeland Security. All employees are encouraged to avail themselves of these trainings and opportunities. 

Bridgford Foods is committed to working closely with its suppliers and others to raise awareness of and eradicate slavery and human trafficking. We remain vigilant on this issue, and, if necessary, will hold any offending supplier accountable for its violation of our policies and the law."	Yes

Calavo management worldwide is aware of their responsibilities to promptly report such potential incidents as noted above.

–  While Calavo does not require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the countries in which they are doing business, all suppliers have access to Calavo’s Code of Conduct which includes the company’s position on human trafficking and slavery.  A notice was added to vendor check stubs regarding Calavo’s stand on human trafficking and slavery and referring vendors to the Calavo Code of Conduct.  In addition, excerpts from the Code of Conduct regarding human trafficking and slavery are posted in key locations for both employees and vendors and/or may also be distributed to vendors who pick up vendor checks."

59	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)

Effective January 1, 2012

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act applies to retail sellers and manufacturers doing business in the State of California with $100,000,000 or more in annual worldwide sales. The Act requires these businesses to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale.

CSI is committed to complying with all applicable laws providing equal employment opportunities and protection from illegal discrimination. A cornerstone of the success of CSI has been to build a reputation for quality, integrity and trust between CSI and each of the individuals and companies with whom it does business. In order to protect and maintain this reputation, CSI demands that its managers, employees, and agents conduct themselves with integrity and professionalism and it expects its vendors, suppliers, contractors and tenants to adhere to the highest ethical and business standards in the course of their dealings with CSI. California Steel Industries (CSI) requires its employees to conform to ethical and legal standards to abide by the law, and training of its employees is performed. No specific training is held regarding risks within the supply chain on human trafficking and slavery.

As detailed in CSI’s “Business Partner Guidelines and Code of Conduct” CSI requires these entities and their respective management, employees, sub‐contractors, and agents to comply with all local, state, federal, national, international or foreign law or regulation that applies to its business activities. This includes forbidding and preventing forced or compulsory labor or child labor. Many activities are subject to complex and changing legislation governing domestic and international trade and commerce. Ignorance of the law will not be considered a valid defense for the failure of a Business Partner to satisfy this requirement.

CSI performs routine audits of its suppliers in accordance with its ISO standards and those detailed in the Business Partner Guidelines and Code of Conduct. This includes visits to the suppliers’ manufacturing and distribution facilities. No specific evaluations or risk assessment of human trafficking and slavery risks are performed, no audits performed, nor is certification required. If the use of human trafficking or slavery is possible in CSI’s supply chain, it should be reported immediately to CSI at its Ethics and Compliance Hotline at 866.294.9348 or at www.ethicspoint.com."

CORPORATE AND SUPPLIER CODES OF CONDUCT

Company Code of Conduct
The Company's Code of Conduct is part of Callaway Golf Company's effort to conduct its global business legally. The Code applies to all board members, officers and employees of Callaway Golf Company and its subsidiaries. All Callaway Golf Company employees are required to comply with the Company's Code of Conduct, which includes provisions designed to address the principle that child, prison, or forced labor are not permitted at any Callaway Golf Company supplier operation. Callaway Golf Company's Code of Conduct is applicable throughout the world, and the Company trains employees on these standards from time to time, including new hire training for all incoming employees and ongoing training of all company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management. This ongoing training specifically addresses education on human trafficking and slavery prohibitions within the product supply chain.

Supplier Code of Conduct
The Company has also adopted and implemented a ""Supplier Code of Conduct."" The Supplier Code of Conduct describes the business practices and employment standards applicable to Callaway Golf's direct suppliers on a global basis. Click to view the Supplier Code of Conduct.

Direct suppliers receive copies of or have access to the Supplier Code of Conduct and many suppliers post the Code on site at their various locations.

HOW WE VERIFY COMPLIANCE

The Company uses various approaches to verify the absence of forced labor and child labor in our supply chain, including the following:

Supply Chain Qualification and Supplier Assessments 
Callaway Golf Company performs assessments of potential suppliers according to a risk-based approach. This approach includes preliminary risk assessments and supplier assessment questionnaires. New supplier screenings are generally conducted internally by Callaway Golf Company personnel. Ongoing supplier compliance is typically monitored by a combination of measures (as discussed below), including supplier self-assessments, Callaway Golf Company-conducted audits and third party audits. Callaway Golf Company uses tools such as regular questionnaires (which are administered by Callaway through a web-based service), that are completed by direct tier one suppliers and selected tier two suppliers.

Supplier Audits 
Callaway Golf Company's audit program evaluates suppliers' compliance with the Company's Supplier Code of Conduct. Various types of announced audits are conducted under this program, including onsite audits conducted or attended by Callaway Golf Company personnel, collaborative or self-audits, and periodic third-party on-site audits of practices and underlying management systems. If deficiencies are identified, suppliers are directed to produce corrective action plans. The corrective action plans typically outline how a supplier will resolve issues uncovered in audits. If any compliance issues are identified, the Company may terminate the supplier relationship or will require action by the supplier to rectify the problem within a designated timeframe.

Currently, site audits are scheduled at most direct supplier sites every two years. These audits are conducted by Callaway Golf Company or by a third party auditing company. The audits are semi-announced audits. This means that the suppliers are given a window of time when the audit will take place, but the exact date of the audit within the timeframe is unannounced.

Terms and Conditions in Purchase Orders and Agreements 
Callaway Golf Company has various agreements or purchasing terms and conditions in place with most direct suppliers, requiring them to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including laws regarding forced labor and child labor.

Corporate Purchasing Policy
Callaway Golf Company has a Corporate Purchasing Policy in place that applies to all US employees responsible for commitment of funds to external suppliers. The Policy also serves as a guide for all non-US employees. Applicable employees are responsible for understanding and complying with this Policy. Among other things, the Policy is designed to promote compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

Supplier Certifications 
Over the course of the next 12 to 18 months (through 2013), Callaway Golf Company is introducing a program to require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the Company's products comply with the laws of the countries where the suppliers are doing business.

Product Compliance
Callaway Golf Company strives to ensure products comply with applicable laws and regulations through education, testing, certifications and audits.

Conflict Free Sourcing
Callaway Golf Company has policies and procedures to reasonably assure that the use of the tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the products manufactured do not directly or indirectly finance armed groups in Covered Countries as defined by the Conflict Minerals Rule issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Click to view Callaway’s Conflict Mineral Policy.

Employee and Supplier Training
Callaway Golf Company educates employees responsible for supplier programs on how to identify and report compliance issues. Callaway Golf Company also strives to educate suppliers on relevant regulatory requirements, programs and Company policies.

Company Legal Compliance Committee and Internal Audit Department
Callaway Golf Company has formed a Legal Compliance Committee to address compliance issues on a global basis and to develop systems and procedures to address any ongoing compliance issues in the locations where we conduct operations. The Legal Compliance Committee meets on a regular basis and the Chief Ethics Officer provides updates of key findings to the Callaway Golf Company Board of Directors.

The Company also has an Internal Audit Department that periodically tests supplier compliance with contract terms through a variety of methods. The Company also seeks to promptly address internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet Callaway Golf Company standards.

61	"Campbell Soup Company Disclosure Statement on Human Trafficking and Slavery in the Supply Chain

Campbell is committed to conducting business in compliance with the law and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. Our employees know that they are expected to honor the Company’s commitment to integrity at all times, everywhere in the world. We also recognize that our suppliers and other business partners play a critical role in helping us execute this mission and fulfill our commitment to sustainability in an ethical and responsible manner.

Campbell’s Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual, which is published on our public website, www.campbellsoupcompany.com, identifies our requirements and expectations of all firms that are or aspire to be Campbell suppliers. A firm’s adherence to and performance of these expectations are factors central to our decision whether to enter into or extend existing business relationships. Our suppliers are required to manifest their commitment to the requirements and expectations set forth in the Manual as part of our purchase order and contract process.

The most recent edition of the Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual includes expanded expectations with respect to employee health and safety, environmental performance, and human rights. Among other things, our requirements and expectations specifically address:

		Minimum Employment Age 

		Voluntary Labor 

		Discrimination 

		Wages and Benefits 

		Health and Safety 

		Working Hours and Rest 

		Freedom of Association 

		Fair Treatment 

We are also currently working with industry partners and strategic suppliers to strengthen standards and performance with respect to expectations for ethical sourcing.

We regularly communicate our performance expectations to our suppliers, and include discussions of our corporate responsibility requirements in top-level meetings with a range of ingredient and packaging suppliers. We also promote awareness by discussing our Supply Chain expectations in our corporate social responsibility report, disclosing our expectations on our public website, and referencing them in contracts.

Campbell representatives participate actively in roundtables, panels and industry commissions on the subject of ethical sourcing. We also benchmark to identify best practices and regularly share our best practices with our suppliers, other companies, and other stakeholders who can adopt them.

Our approach to supplier social responsibility is based on strong relationships and continuous improvement. While we use third parties to audit and assess the performance of our suppliers, those

assessment methodologies do not currently include detailed assessments for human trafficking and slavery. We plan to investigate ways to strengthen those assessments in 2012. If we identify suppliers that do not meet our expectations in this area, we will work with them, or direct corrective action plans, to eliminate deficiencies and drive long-term improvements in performance. We will not continue to do business with a supplier that does not take meaningful steps to correct identified shortfalls in its performance.

Campbell provides comprehensive training for all of its employees on the Company’s core expectations with respect to ethics and compliance. As part of our “Winning With Integrity” program, employees are required to complete annual training focused on Campbell’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This training is available online or in person, and is offered in 13 languages. We also provide “risk-based” training that is tailored to individuals' roles in the Company, and have conducted specific awareness training on the issue of slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain with members of our Procurement organization and Campbell ingredient buyers. In 2012, we will evaluate ways to expand training on slavery and human trafficking, including training on mitigating related risks in supply chains, to employees and executives with direct responsibility for supply chain management.

62	"California Transparency in Supply Chains

CareFusion is committed to conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner. It is our expectation that our suppliers also conduct themselves in such a manner. To that end and in accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2011 (SB 657), we have implemented a policy against slavery, unlawful child labor and human trafficking that applies to CareFusion and its suppliers. Pursuant to this policy, we include language in our purchasing agreements with our suppliers that make up our supply chain regarding our policy against slavery, unlawful child labor and human trafficking and we will hold our direct and authorized suppliers accountable if they fail to comply with employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management to obtain training on how to mitigate risk associated with slavery, unlawful child labor and human trafficking. CareFusion does not actively audit suppliers for compliance with these regulations."	Yes
63	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act – In 2010, the state of California passed the Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the “Statute”). The Statute requires companies doing business in California to disclose their efforts to ensure slavery and human trafficking are not part of their supply chains. More specifically, the Statute requires companies disclose to what extent, if any, they address each of the five points below. 

Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party. Carter’s strictly prohibits the use of slavery and human trafficking in our product supply chain. Our Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) specifically prohibits the use of “forced or involuntary labor of any kind in the supply chain, including any labor obtained though slavery or human trafficking.” Prior to engagement, a Carter’s employee or third-party agent evaluates each potential supplier on such supplier’s ability to meet Carter’s requirements, including compliance with the Code. 

2) Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit. To ensure compliance with our Code, each audit of a Carter’s supplier is conducted by an independent third-party firm. The third-party auditor employs experts in local laws who speak the local languages. The frequency of audit for each facility varies based on various factors, including prior audit results and a risk assessment profile. Our goal, however, is to have each facility audited at least once per year. In 2011, our third-party auditor conducted more than 450 audits on Carter’s behalf. The third-party auditor conducts both announced and unannounced audits. We have found that providing a short notice period helps ensure that all required personnel and documentation can be made available. Unannounced audits, however, are conducted when previous audit results include serious or multiple violations of our Code. 

3) Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Carter’s requires each of its suppliers to annually certify that it complies with Carter’s Code. In addition, each time a vendor enters into a purchase order with Carter’s, the vendor certifies compliance not only with our Code but also with all applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

4) Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. Carter’s considers forced labor, slavery and human trafficking to be zero-tolerance violations to our Code. If any supplier is found to be non-compliant in these areas, immediate corrective action must be taken by the supplier. Regardless of corrective action taken, Carter’s reserves the right to terminate our business relationship with any supplier that does not comply with our Code. 

5) Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chain of products. Carter’s, our agents and our independent, third-party auditors work directly with suppliers to train them on compliance with our Code. Internally, we are in the process of implementing a formal training process for our employees who have direct responsibility for the management of our supply chain. This training will educate them on the risks of human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain and what actions can be taken to mitigate these risks"	Yes
64	"CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010

Destination XL Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") unequivocally support the human rights of all of our employees, and the employees of our global suppliers.

The Company also supports the intent of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the ""Act"").

The Company sells both private-label and branded-label products. Our branded-label suppliers are provided with our Code of Conduct, Global Vendor Agreement and Vendor Compliance Guide (collectively the ""Agreement"") and they are informed they are required to follow the Agreement. We ask that you visit the websites of branded-label companies to read about their efforts in eradicating slavery and human trafficking.

Under our private-label products, the Company addresses the concerns underlying the Act. Key elements of our practices regarding our private-label products are summarized below:

Verification Process. The Company has reasonable and appropriate measures to address and eliminate slave labor and human trafficking in and among its vendor factories and facilities;

Audit Process. The Company selects the independent audit party to evaluate the factories and facilities of the Company's vendors with respect to compliance with the Act;

Certification Process. The Company has reasonable and appropriate measures to make sure that the merchandise does not violate the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which it transacts business;

Accountability Standard. The Company's private-label product factories' standards are monitored by the independent audit provider with direct reporting to the Company. The Company has developed and maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for its employees, contractors and/or suppliers for any failure to comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking; and

65	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) (the “Act”) applies to retailers and manufacturers doing business in California, including Cavium.  The Act requires these companies to disclose on their websites certain information related to efforts the companies take to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chain.  Cavium is committed to acting in a socially responsible manner and upholding the values and ethics expressed in the Cavium Code of Conduct and Cavium Policy on Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility.

Cavium considers its strategic suppliers which deliver high volume products and/or services critical to Cavium’s business as tier 1 suppliers.  Prior to entry into a business relationship with a tier 1 supplier, the supplier must go through the Cavium supplier qualification process.  One of the critical items verified during the supplier qualification process is a supplier’s corporate social and environmental responsibility, including their policy against slavery and human trafficking.  Cavium does not use third party verifiers for the supplier qualification process.  Thereafter, Cavium relies on the process described below to assess risk of slavery and human trafficking for its tier 1 suppliers.

On an annual basis Cavium requires each tier 1 supplier to sign the Cavium Supplier Labor Responsibility Agreement which includes, among other things, prohibitions on slavery and human trafficking.  Cavium manages this process and does not use a third party.  In addition, Cavium requires each tier 1 supplier to complete a supplier survey, which includes information regarding slavery and human trafficking.  Cavium uses a third party vendor to assist with the survey process.

On a bi-annual basis Cavium schedules audits with its tier 1 suppliers.  One of the items verified during this audit is compliance with the Cavium Supplier Labor Responsibility Agreement and Cavium’s Policy on Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility.  These audits are performed by Cavium and are generally announced ahead of time.  Any non-conformances found in the audits are recorded and corrective and preventative plans are put in place with such nonconforming supplier.

Cavium employees are required to acknowledge the Cavium Code of Conduct on an annual basis.  The Cavium Code of Conduct requires compliance with all laws where Cavium operates.  Cavium has internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and contractors who violate the Cavium Code of Conduct, which may include termination of employment.

Cavium requires all employees to complete trainings on the Cavium Code of Conduct, which includes compliance with applicable laws.  In addition, we have provided those involved in supply chain management with training on the Act.  We are planning to expand our training on slavery and human trafficking for those involved in supply chain management."

66	"California Transparency Act

Celanese is committed to respecting the human rights of others.  We prohibit the use of child labor, physical punishment, forced or compulsory labor, as well as any other forms of human abuse.  We will not knowingly do business with any individual or company that abuses the rights of others.  This policy is part of the Business Conduct Policy (BCP) at Celanese.  All employees of Celanese and its subsidiaries, including those with responsibility for supply chain management, are expected to know and abide by all terms of the BCP, including this restriction.  Management employees must certify periodically that they have read, understand and are in compliance with our BCP.  Celanese has an active system for disclosure and investigations of violations of the BCP.  When investigation substantiates a violation of the BCP, an appropriate management team reviews the findings and determines an appropriate response. 

Celanese has a formal procurement policy that includes stringent reviews of suppliers’ integrity and compliance.  Additionally, Celanese procurement contracts include as a standard term that the supplier has complied with and shall comply with all applicable laws, including those relating to wages, working hours and working conditions, and that the supplier shall promptly certify to such compliance or furnish proof of such compliance upon request.  Celanese is currently assessing whether to require its suppliers to conduct self-evaluations and to what extent Celanese may require independent audits of its suppliers.  No decision has been made whether to verify future assessments or require unannounced third-party audits of suppliers."

67	"Corporate disclosure under SB 657 — California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

Central Garden & Pet Company has always sought to operate its business operations so as to respect and further the interests of consumers, customers and the public at large. Our intent is to accomplish this not only through the products we make and sell but also through the processes and relationships that help create these products.

The California Legislature has passed the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) which went into effect on January 1, 2012. This legislation requires that companies that meet certain size or sales standards must disclose what they are doing to monitor and discourage possible slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain aspect of their operations.

We believe that there are no circumstances under which it would be acceptable for forced or trafficked labor to be used in the production of any of our products.

As part of our efforts directed against human trafficking and slavery, we have a rigorous assessment process for all vendors, especially overseas vendors. This assessment process includes questionnaires directed at practices that could implicate issues relevant to human trafficking and slavery. As part of the assessment and verification process, potential vendors are and will be required to certify that they and any materials they use in the making of our products comply with applicable slavery and human trafficking laws. As we reassess existing vendor relationships, they will be required to certify or recertify such compliance. We have also retained a third party inspection company to conduct random inspections of factories that provide us with products or components in order to further assist us in monitoring vendor compliance with human trafficking, and slavery prohibitions.

We also are implementing a program to ensure that agreements with relevant suppliers require strict compliance with company standards regarding forced labor and human trafficking and with international and local legal requirements.

Central maintains internal standards and procedures making both its employees and outside contractors accountable for meeting company requirements relevant to human trafficking and slavery issues. As to outside contractors and vendors, the consequences of failing to meet such requirements can result in financial penalties and suspension or discontinuance of the business relationship.

We also provide company employees with training regarding both the legal requirements applicable to human trafficking and slavery issues and how those requirements impact supply side management. This training is directed at employees and managers who have responsibility for supply side issues and includes topics relevant to both recognition and mitigation of risks relevant to human trafficking and slavery issues."	Yes
68	"Child Labor: Suppliers shall employ only workers who meet the applicable minimum legal age requirement. Suppliers must also comply with all other applicable child labor laws. 

		Forced Labor: Suppliers shall not use any prison, indentured or forced labor. 

B) Compliance Monitoring

The supplier will allow Ceradyne and/or any of its representatives or agents unrestricted access to supplier’s facilities and all relevant records at all times, whether or not notice is provided in advance. Ceradyne will continue to develop monitoring systems to assess and ensure compliance.

C) Application to Sub-Contractors

This Code also applies to any sub-contractor(s) to the supplier, and the supplier is fully responsible for compliance by any such sub-contractor(s) as if it were the supplier itself in non- compliance. Ceradyne reserves the right to approve all sub-contractors.

D) Event of Violation

If the supplier does not comply with Ceradyne’s Code of Supplier Conduct, Ceradyne requires that the supplier implement a corrective action plan to cure the non-compliance within a specified time period (furnished by Ceradyne in writing). If the supplier fails to meet the corrective action plan commitment, Ceradyne will terminate the business relationship, including

suspending placement of future orders and potentially terminating current production. Ceradyne has the right to hold supplier responsible for any costs of investigating non-compliance.

The supplier must indicate evidence of written policies on the following when completing the Supplier Profile:

		Child and Forced labor 

		Non-Discrimination 

		Human Rights 

		Health and Safety  

Internal Audits

A supplier must conduct regular internal audits to ensure continued compliance with internal procedures and customer requirements.

Communication

All documentation must be communicated to Ceradyne in English unless otherwise specified by the using facility.

Suppliers must maintain and have access to an electronic form of communication i.e, the internet/ worldwide web.

Supplier Assessment

Once the initial screening process is completed and the supplier is identified as a potential supplier to Ceradyne, a self and/or on-site assessment based on the impact of the product or process being sourced will be completed. The results of the assessment will be reported and maintained by Ceradyne.

On-Site Assessment

An on-site assessment may be performed to evaluate the supplier’s operating and quality system. These assessments will be performed by Ceradyne personnel capable of determining the supplier’s effectiveness in key functional areas such as procurement, engineering, manufacturing, and quality.

When possible and appropriate these assessments will be performed by cross-functional teams. The purpose of a cross-functional team is to better substantiate the effectiveness of the supplier’s business, manufacturing and quality systems.

These evaluations by Ceradyne personnel will assist in ensuring that the supplier can consistently meet Ceradyne product and service expectations and that the supplier is capable of continuously improving its flexibility in meeting future Ceradyne requirements.

Per customer requirements some Ceradyne facilities may require annual on-site supplier quality assessments when:

		A formal customer complaint and/or root cause analysis determines the supplier to be the root of a concern 

		A supplier is classified as “high impact” 

		Future business is to be awarded to a new supplier that is to be classified as “high  impact”  Third party quality system registration such as ISO-9001-2000 or AS-9100 may be recognized in lieu of a periodic on-site assessment if the Ceradyne business group deems it appropriate.  Note: Suppliers must notify Ceradyne within 30 days if their third party registration status changes. This includes supplying updated certificates as they expire and/or are extended. 

The Supplier Quality Manager for the Ceradyne Business Group has the right to waive the on- site assessment. This waiver will not exempt any customer product or process approval. In some instances, customer approval must be obtained by the Ceradyne Business Group, prior to a waiver.

The following assessment formats may be used to evaluate, document and score a supplier as part of an on-site and/or self-assessment review.

		Quality System Assessment 

		Process Audit 

		Continuous Improvement Survey (based on Lean manufacturing)  Please note that when required, Ceradyne Business Groups may use an audit format that is specified by market and or customer requirements.  Ceradyne may also, at its option conduct financial assessments/reviews on a periodic basis.  Self Assessments  The supplier may be asked to complete a self-assessment in lieu of and/or in addition to an on- site review. The supplier will complete the assessment and provide any necessary supporting documents to the Ceradyne business group.  Assessment Results  In most cases the potential supplier shall receive a formal report of the survey results within 15 days of the assessment. When system deficiencies are identified, a response time will be provided for the supplier to define corresponding corrective actions. Failure to provide a suitable response in a timely manner is cause for disapproval for further consideration. Ceradyne personnel may discontinue the qualification process at any time.  Approvals  Two types of approvals may be granted: 

		Full approval 

		Conditional approval (subject to specific corrective actions which must be completed within 90 days)  Conditional approval status enables Ceradyne to contract with a supplier that is pending a site survey and/or corrective action from site survey. Conditional approval cannot exceed 90 days. Prior to such an approval, the supplier may be requested to submit a copy of its quality manual and complete a self-assessment as directed by the Ceradyne location initiating the supplier review. Conditional approval will be granted based on acceptance of submitted documents.

Conditional approval may also be granted to a supplier who has been charged with deficiencies during an on-site visit. A corrective action plan must be submitted and approved by Ceradyne within 90 days.

Approved Supplier Listing (ASL)

A list of all suppliers and their status as well as a master file of approval documentation will be maintained by all Ceradyne facilities.

Quality Contract

Some Ceradyne facilities may require that the supplier sign a quality contract. This contract specifies the quality requirements and expectations of Ceradyne.

Skip/ Lot Program

A supplier to Ceradyne may have their product/parts placed on a skip/lot program with one or more of our facilities.



CLOSED LOOP CORRECTIVE ACTION

All suppliers for Ceradyne must establish and maintain documented procedures for implementing a system of closed loop corrective and preventive action with disciplined problem solving methods. This shall be used when a nonconformance to specification or requirements occurs.

Any corrective or preventive action taken to eliminate the causes of actual or potential non- conformities shall be appropriate to the magnitude of problems and commensurate with the risks encountered. The supplier shall implement and record any changes to the documented procedures resulting from corrective and preventive action.

When supplier non-conformances are identified within a Ceradyne Business Group, and are determined to be significant in nature, a Corrective Action Request (CAR) will be initiated and sent to the supplier as an MWR or actual CAR. Each Ceradyne location will determine when a CAR will be generated and will provide an appropriate feedback format.

Once the CAR is made the following steps will be implemented:

The supplier and/or assignee will sign to acknowledge receipt and investigate the system deficiencies and provide a detailed and complete plan to correct using the format and content required by the Ceradyne Business Group.

Responses are to include adequate detail and supporting data to assure Ceradyne that appropriate system corrective actions have been taken. Responses are to be returned by the date required by the Ceradyne coordinator.

Written responses will include:

		Identifiable contact person: Identify the contact person(s) responsible for this CAR (if other than assignee) and immediately return to the designated Ceradyne coordinator. Depending on the scope of the issue, this may require formation of a cross-functional team. 

		Definition of the problem: A verbatim restatement of the deficiency/condition as documented in the complaint and if necessary restated in terms of the suppliers process, but it may also include enhancements to clarify the problem. The make-up of the team should be reflective of the defined problem. 

		Immediate Containment Action: Action taken immediately upon identification of the potential noncompliance, such as rejection tags, line checks or supplier notification. This section should describe actions taken by the supplier to correct symptoms in the short term. The response should include an evaluation of all affected inventory (i.e., all at risk population, internal or external of parts and/or product); verification of all currently assumed process/product controls and when, where, how, and by whom containment action will be or has been made. Potential ramifications of findings should also be investigated and dealt with. For example, if the finding is that out-of-date drawings and materials were found, the supplier should investigate and record whether any parts were made using the drawings and materials, and what the disposition was of affected parts. Containment actions must be completed within 24 hours. Failure to do so will negatively impact the supplier quality performance metrics.

		Identify and Verify Root Cause: The source or origin of the noncompliance, as well as any contributing factors involved. A finding is generally a symptom of a root cause problem. This section records the supplier’s analysis of the finding to determine the root cause of the problem. A root cause is usually found in inadequate procedures, processes, or in noncompliance (whether intentional or accidental) in one or more of these areas. Extensive analysis is called for in root cause identification. Detailed, in-depth questions should be asked (i.e. 5-Why’s), and appropriate analytical tools can be used to confirm and verify results. If there is a management problem, it should be revealed. 

		Implement Root Cause Corrective Action: The remedial corrective action implemented to address the source or root cause of the noncompliance that will preclude recurrence. The response to root causes should, at a minimum, include changes to procedures, processes and/or training. Root cause correction involves long-term prevention and process improvement rather than an immediate fix. Root Cause Corrective Action must be implemented within the time frame agreed to with the Ceradyne facility. The supplier should also verify that the committed corrective action has been implemented and that the root cause corrections have been accomplished. 

		Follow-up and Preventive Action: An audit to ensure that the committed corrective action plan has been found to be effective as implemented in precluding recurrence of the noncompliance. This section addresses monitoring of both symptoms and root cause correction. These monitoring activities should be added to the supplier’s internal audit program.  The actions described in paragraphs “Identify and Verify Root Cause”, “Implement Root Cause Corrective Action” and “Follow-up and Preventive Action” must all be completed within 30 days of receipt of CAR.  The supplier will provide periodic corrective action status reports if/as directed by the Ceradyne coordinator.  Failure to respond to requests as required will result in procedural escalation to the appropriate Ceradyne Quality Assurance Manager. Any questions are to be directed to the Ceradyne coordinator.  Assignee’s written corrective action plan will be returned to the responsible Ceradyne coordinator for review of adequacy and effectiveness. The results of the final corrective action plan may require an on-site visit at the assignee’s facilities. Assignee will be notified of acceptance or rejection of plan upon review. 

The Ceradyne coordinator will review the response for the following considerations:

		Does the team appear satisfactory to answer the corrective action request? 

		Has the problem been correctly described, properly noting, When, What, Where and How? 

		Did containment consider inventories at the supplier, in transit, warehouse, and Ceradyne facility? 

		Did containment verify current controls are in place and operating? 

		Has the customer been protected against suspect material being shipped? 

		Does the investigation adequately demonstrate a connection between suspected caused and the actual problem being investigated? 

		Will the corrective action affect any other product? 

		If the solution is to be monitored, has the criteria for monitoring been identified? 

		Is corrective action appropriately documented? 

		Have implementation dates been identified? 

		Has material been produced with the solution implemented? 

		Was the corrective action effective based on additional shipments? 

		Have the actions to prevent recurrence been successful? 

		Were controls plans etc, been revised as necessary?

Supplier Ranking and Total Performance is the standard methodology for Ceradyne supplier performance review and ranking.

Suppliers are evaluated within the areas of 1) Quality, 2) Purchasing, 3) Logistics. Ranking is based on Purchasing and Logistics is generally performed once a year for key suppliers. Quality performance and ranking combine to the Total Performance of a supplier."	Yes

Supply Chain Transparency



As a condition of doing business with our company, Charlotte Russe requires all vendors and agents that we contract with to ensure that all products are made and delivered in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our vendors and agents are also required to abide by Charlotte Russe's own specific requirements, even if they go above and beyond what's required by any applicable law.



When we identify areas of non-compliance, our goal is to work with our vendors to help resolve issues, improve compliance and promote better working conditions. That said, we have a zero tolerance policy for extreme violations such as the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking and any such violation would result in termination of our business relationship with the offending vendor.



California Transparency Supply Chains Act. Charlotte Russe respects internationally recognized human rights standards and believes that no business should ever be complicit in any human rights abuses. Pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, Charlotte Russe (along with all other retailers and manufacturers with annual sales in excess of $100 million who do business in California) is required as of January 1, 2012 to publicly report on the efforts we are undertaking to ensure that our products are made without the use of slavery or human trafficking Charlotte Russe respects internationally recognized human rights standards and believes that no business should ever be complicit in any human rights abuses. Pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, Charlotte Russe (along with all other retailers and manufacturers with annual sales in excess of $100 million who do business in California) is required as of January 1, 2012 to publicly report on the efforts we are undertaking to ensure that our products are made without the use of slavery or human trafficking.



The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, S.B. 657, requires retailers and manufacturers that do business in California and have in excess of $100 million in annual sales to state to what extent, if any, they are undertaking efforts to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and slavery in their supply chains. The following provides a summary of Charlotte Russe's efforts.



All vendors we contract with currently sign an acknowledgment that they are in compliance with all local and international laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to laws relating to the employment conditions of their respective employees such as: (a) wage and hour, labor and child labor; (b) health and safety; (c) labor and workers' rights and practices; (d) discrimination; and (e) environmental laws and regulations.



Our updated vendor on-boarding procedures require vendors and agents to certify that (1) all goods (including all materials incorporated therein) have been produced and delivered in full compliance with all applicable local and international laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to those relating to wage and hour, labor and child labor, forced labor, slavery and human trafficking, health and safety, labor and workers' rights and practices, discrimination, environmental, and customs/trade, as well as with all Charlotte Russe standards and requirements, including as set forth in its Vendor Handbook, purchase order terms and conditions and Code of Vendor Conduct; and (2) all of their own facilities, as well as all of their suppliers and factories, whether owned or contracted, have a compliance program in place and that all goods are produced in full compliance with all such laws and requirements, including all that pertain to the prevention of human trafficking and slavery.



Charlotte Russe partners with a third party, independent consulting and auditing firm to assist us in reviewing, updating and enforcing our standards for compliance and to help us ensure our vendors abide by all laws and requirements, including those that prohibit the use of slavery or human trafficking. We are also evaluating the extent to which our vendors have previously been subject to independent audits and certified by independent auditing firms. Additional independent audits will be undertaken annually with identified vendors based on our evaluation of several criteria, including the annual dollar volume of goods placed with the vendor, the vendor's compliance record to date, and the existence of other third party certifications, among other factors.



Charlotte Russe's Trade Compliance team has conducted a risk assessment of our supply chain sourcing countries specific to human trafficking and slavery by utilizing advisories published by the US Department of State, the US Department of Labor and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Our efforts to assess and mitigate these risks are ongoing. As noted above, Charlotte Russe has an independent consulting and auditing firm to advise us generally on our supply chain policies and practices and to help us with our mitigation and enforcement efforts going forward. As part of this engagement, and in addition to our ongoing internal efforts to educate our employees on ethical supply chain practices, the firm will assist us with the development of a training program for all employees responsible for supply chain management and compliance.



Charlotte Russe has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which requires all employees, directors and officers to, among other things, comply at all times with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the company or its operations. Moreover, all employees have a duty to report any known or suspected violation of the Code, including any violation of the laws, rules regulations or policies that apply to the Company. Failure to abide by our Code can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. In addition to its existing requirements applicable to its vendors, Charlotte Russe has developed a new Code of Vendor Conduct (""COVC"") that specifically references and prohibits the use of slavery and human trafficking. All vendors will be required to abide by the COVC as condition of doing business with Charlotte Russe."	Yes

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires many companies manufacturing or selling products in the state of California to disclose their efforts (if any) to address the issue of forced labor and human trafficking in their supply chains. The law was designed to increase consumers’ knowledge about products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Chevron’s Commitments

Chevron’s commitment to respecting human rights wherever we operate is embodied in The Chevron Way, our Operational Excellence Management System, our Business Conduct and Ethics Code and our Human Rights Policy.

Our Business Conduct and Ethics Code provides information about how we conduct our day-to-day business activities according to the principles of The Chevron Way. The Business Conduct and Ethics Code, which also includes our Human Rights Policy, is required reading for all directors and employees. Failure to comply with company policies and procedures may result in disciplinary actions up to and including termination.

As part of our Human Rights Policy implementation, we have refreshed our human rights training programs. We have also broadened the training population to include relevant employees and contractors in the Procurement/Supply Chain Management organization.

Supplier Engagement

Chevron encourages contractors, suppliers and service providers to conduct their business in a manner consistent with Chevron standards. These expectations are communicated through a variety of channels, including Chevron’s contracts.

We have specific language in our policies related to engagement with suppliers on labor issues. We require that our suppliers adhere to all applicable domestic laws and encourage them to be consistent with the International Labor Organization’s core labor principles.

We have begun the process of updating supplier contracts to reinforce expectations related to labor standards that address the use of forced or involuntary labor. We also are working to raise awareness of potential labor issues with our key suppliers through supplier forums and other efforts.

Through our Contractor Health, Environment and Safety Management and Supplier Qualification processes, we work with suppliers to increase accountability and continually improve their performance. Major suppliers are selected for periodic audits based on a risk ranking determined by the nature of the work to be performed and responses to a questionnaire on supplier policies, processes and performance. Business units may use internal, external or third-party auditing resources, depending on the audit strategy. The audits cover health, environmental and safety standards and compliance. Particular labor issues or concerns may be emphasized as part of this process, depending on the business location.

72	"Position on Slavery and Human Trafficking

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) is effective January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California, with gross worldwide receipts of over 100 million U.S. dollars (USD), to be transparent about the efforts they have undertaken to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale.

As an active member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), Cisco has adopted the EICC Code of Conduct, which prohibits the use of forced, bonded, indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. We audit our suppliers to this Code and take seriously all forms of non-conformance. We actively collaborate with our industry partners in the EICC to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the Code of Conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training.

In addition to the collaborative effort with the EICC, Cisco has internal policies and practices that are based on international labor and human rights standards. We partner with our supply chain to create an environment where workers have the right to freely choose employment. This focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort around supply chain transparency and accountability. Cisco has taken multiple actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain, including:

Supplier Code of Conduct with Freely Chosen Employment standard. Cisco rolled out its Supplier Code of Conduct, which is aligned with the EICC Code of Conduct. It outlines our requirements regarding workers at supplier facilities having the right to freely choose their employment; Forced, bonded (including debt bondage), indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons shall not be allowed.

Supplier agreements. Cisco has master purchasing agreements or purchase order terms and conditions in place with our supply chain suppliers, requiring them to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we have required our supply chain suppliers to adopt and abide by the supplier code of conduct (EICC Code of Conduct) which prohibits forced labor and child labor.

Supplier risk assessment and audit. Cisco participates in the EICC's collaborative audit effort (EICC joint audit). Suppliers may be asked to complete the self assessment questions on the EICC Risk Assessment Tool as well as the EICC Self Assessment Questionnaire that has been developed jointly by the EICC. To maintaining internal accountability standards to our supplier Code of Conduct and sustainability guiding principles, Cisco performs assessments of potential suppliers as well as does regular risk screenings of our supply chain suppliers. Cisco also conducts internal audits and onsite supplier audits, if deemed to be necessary to verify our supply chain suppliers' conformance to our Supplier Code of Conduct and related standards and policies. These audits are conducted by a third party and use the standardized audit protocols developed by the EICC. We work closely with our suppliers to develop corrective action plans and close out audit findings.

Procurement professionals training. Cisco requires all Cisco employees to comply with our standard Code of Business Conduct; and employees certify compliance with the Code of Business Conduct annually. Cisco offers training to our employees who are responsible for supply chain management on how to identify and respond to supply chain issues according with our supplier code of conduct, which is aligned with Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code.

Beginning in 2012, large manufacturers and retailers doing business in California are required under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) to disclose efforts that they have taken to eliminate human trafficking and slavery from their supply chains. The purpose of this law is to make more information available so that consumers are better enabled to make informed decisions about the products they purchase and the companies they choose to support.

Colgate-Palmolive Company has a policy that strictly prohibits all forced servitude and child labor practices and has taken important steps over the years to ensure the integrity of its supply chains and the Company at large. The following is an overview of the Company’s programs in this area:

				Supplier Assessment and Audit Process: In the first quarter of 2012, the Company is rolling out on a global basis a comprehensive Supplier Responsible Sourcing Assessment process that will be conducted with both existing suppliers and new suppliers. This program augments the Company’s preexisting supplier audit program in significant respects, including its focus on four critical areas: labor standards, health & safety, environmental management, and business integrity. This risk-management-based program includes identification of risks in the supply chain, self-assessment by suppliers against established standards, third party audits of suppliers’ facilities against established standards, and a remediation procedure for resolution of identified noncompliance with the standards. The remediation process includes supplier corrective action plans and follow-up activities. The program’s objective is to ensure that Colgate’s responsible sourcing standards, as described in the Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct (discussed further below), are being followed in practice by Colgate’s suppliers. A very significant portion of the assessment process is the evaluation of labor practices, including ensuring that no illegal child labor or forced servitude practices are present. 

				Supplier Adherence to Applicable Laws and Colgate’s Code of Conduct: Under Colgate’s contracts with suppliers, suppliers are required to comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and municipal laws and regulations, including all applicable labor and other workplace laws and regulations. Further, Colgate’s contracts bind suppliers to adhere to the Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires suppliers to abide by the Company’s policy prohibiting the use of illegal child labor, involuntary servitude, exploitation of children, and all other forms of abusive or exploitative labor practices. The Supplier Code of Conduct, which is modeled on the International Labor Organization (ILO) standards, further states the Company’s policy against working with any supplier that is known to operate with unacceptable worker treatment, such as physical punishment, female abuse, involuntary servitude or other forms of abuse, and obligates suppliers to take appropriate steps to ensure that they do not engage in any of these practices. It is Colgate’s policy that violation of these principles is grounds for termination of any business relationship. 

				Accountability: Like the Supplier Code of Conduct discussed above, the Company’s Code of Conduct reflects the Company’s prohibition on exploitative labor practices and binds employees to these requirements. Violation of the Code of Conduct may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

				Training: Colgate requires 100% of employees to complete training on the Company’s Code of Conduct and to acknowledge compliance with the Code. The 2012 training cycle will address the Company’s policies against exploitative labor practices."	Yes

As a global corporation with manufacturing facilities around the world, Corning is reliant upon a vast network of suppliers. In keeping with Corning’s Values and Corning’s Corporate Citizenship responsibilities, we invest considerable energy into selecting suppliers who meet our standards and we require that they adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct. In this way, Corning ensures that our suppliers’ operations are conducted with respect for the laws of the regions they serve.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits the use of slavery or other involuntary labor:

Forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor is not to be used. All work will be voluntary, and workers should be free to leave upon reasonable notice. There is to be no inhumane treatment, including any sexual harassment, sexual abuse, corporal punishment, mental or physical coercion or verbal abuse of workers: nor is there to be the threat of any such treatment. Child labor is not to be used. Workweeks are not to exceed the maximum set by local law.

Corning requires that its suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct. In the event of a violation of the Supplier Code of Conduct, Corning reserves the right to either terminate its relationship with the supplier or to work with the supplier to implement corrective action to remedy any non-conformance with the Code.

As appropriate, Corning audits suppliers through the Corning Supplier Management Program. Given the vast number of suppliers selling to Corning, and limited amounts sold by some of them, Corning does not audit every single supplier. Also, given the nature of Corning’s business and the high quality of our suppliers, we do not typically utilize third party auditors to audit suppliers.

Further information on Corning’s commitment to corporate social responsibility is provided on our Values and Corporate Citizenship web pages."	Yes
81	"Costco Disclosure Regarding Human Trafficking and Anti-Slavery

Costco has a supplier Code of Conduct which prohibits human rights abuses in our supply chain. Practices such as human trafficking, physical abuse of workers, restricting workers' freedom of movement, confiscation of passports and worker documentation, unsafe work environments, failure to pay adequate wages, excessive and/or forced overtime, illegal child labor, and many other aspects of worker welfare are addressed by the Code. Our suppliers contractually agree to follow the Code and to ensure that their sub-suppliers also comply. We may acknowledge and accept a supplier's code as equivalent to our Code. 

To evaluate compliance, we arrange for the audit of facilities of selected suppliers, with an emphasis on suppliers of private label merchandise and when Costco Wholesale is the importer. Audits are performed by independent third-party auditors who specialize in social responsibility audits. While we retain the right to conduct unannounced audits, as a practical matter, some minimum amount of notice is given to comply with security concerns and to allow the supplier to collect records that are reviewed during the audit. 

If we discover a violation of our Code of Conduct, we respond in a manner commensurate with the nature and extent of the violation. ""Critical violations"" are considered serious enough to require immediate and decisive remedial action and may result in the termination of the business relationship. For less serious violations, we allow the supplier reasonable time to develop and implement a plan for remediation. In those instances we conduct follow-up audits to monitor progress. 

In general, we prefer working with the supplier to correct Code violations rather than immediately terminating the relationship. Termination is unlikely to correct the underlying issue and may cause further hardship to workers and their families who depend upon the employment. However, if the supplier fails to make satisfactory progress toward improvement, we will cease our business relationship with that supplier. 

Members of Costco's buying team who manage a supplier relationship will continue to be provided with in-person and online training. The training covers the Code of Conduct and its importance to our business and to the workers who produce the merchandise we sell. We encourage anyone who is aware of violations of the law or our Code to notify their management, our Code of Conduct Compliance team or utilize Costco’s whistleblower site: costco.ethicspoint.com."

82	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure

Cost Plus World Market (“World Market”) is committed to ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations, respect for the rights of all individuals and respect for the environment. We are dedicated to upholding the human rights of all workers involved in our product supply chains. We consider fair labor practices to be an important part of human rights. Our goal is to ensure that all individuals involved in our supply chains experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. We will not knowingly work with any company that does not comply with our ethical standards. 

Because we specialize in finding unique products from around the world and working with artisan communities in many countries, we are particularly committed to working with vendors that provide fair and ethical working conditions. This statement describes our actions to support human rights, including our efforts to guard against human trafficking and slave labor in our company’s supply chain, in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.

Verification of Product Supply Chain to Guard Against Human Trafficking and Slave Labor
Our products come from partners all over the world, including buying agents and direct vendors located in the United States and abroad. We require our buying agents to perform audits and keep documentation confirming that the vendors with whom they work comply with our Social Compliance Policy. In addition, each vendor and buying agent must agree in writing to abide by our Social Compliance Policy, which is part of our Purchase Order Terms and Conditions and Vendor Guide. This policy guards against human trafficking and slave labor, and helps to ensure fair working conditions at all factories in our supply chain, including the following requirements: 

The use of prison, forced, indentured, or bonded labor is prohibited in the production of any merchandise.

Physical, sexual or psychological harassment or abuse, or cruel or unusual disciplinary practices are prohibited.

No child labor may be used in the production of goods for World Market. Every vendor must comply with the child labor laws of the country where the workers are employed and of the exporting country, and no worker may be employed who is under 15 years old or younger than the age for mandatory compulsory education in their jurisdiction, whichever is older.

Fair wages and benefits must be provided in compliance with laws of the country of manufacture and the exporting country, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime, maximum hours, piece rates, benefits, and other elements of compensation.

Overtime in excess of the hours allowed by the manufacturing country’s laws is prohibited, and employees may not work more than 60 hours in a week, except under extraordinary circumstances. Employees shall be entitled to no less than one day off in every seven-day period.

Our partners agree to monitor, report and verify compliance with this policy for both themselves and their suppliers. Buying agents Vendors agree to monitor, report, and verify compliance with these requirements for both themselves and their suppliers and subcontractors. 

Audits of Suppliers to Evaluate Compliance With Company Standards to Prevent Trafficking and Slavery in Supply Chains World Market regularly audits its vendors in order to monitor and evaluate their compliance with our standards for working conditions and human rights, including our prohibition on forced labor in any form. The audits occur in several ways: 

World Market uses a third party to conduct independent third-party monitoring of some of the factories that produce goods for the company, primarily factories located in China. These audits are conducted annually. The company intends to utilize third party auditing in other locations if issues arise that suggest closer monitoring is required to ensure compliance with company policies.

We require our buying agents to perform audits and provide documentation annually confirming that the factories with which they work comply with our Social Compliance Policy and the Vendor Guide. Buying agents conduct periodic on-site visits for the purpose of inspecting working conditions and conducting audits of production records and practices. 

Our own buyers may also visit factories of vendors with whom they deal directly, and they have been trained to be aware of signs of human trafficking and slavery and to report any observed issues or violations of the company’s Social Compliance Policy. 

Certification by Vendors that Materials Used in Their Products Comply With Laws Regarding Slavery and Human Trafficking
World Market vendors must provide written certification that they will abide by our Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, which contains the express warranty that the vendor is in compliance with all current and later adopted laws of the exporting country and the country in which the goods are produced governing child and involuntary labor. In addition, the Vendor Guide requires written certification that: “Vendor hereby certifies that the materials incorporated into the goods provided to the company comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country in which the vendor is doing business and the territory in which the goods are produced.” 

Internal Accountability Standards and Procedures Ensure Compliance With Our Social Compliance Policy
World Market recognizes that it must hold our suppliers accountable for compliance with its human rights standards, including our strict prohibition on forced labor of any kind. Our partners must monitor, report and verify compliance for themselves and their suppliers. In support of that effort, we have created an online social compliance reporting system for all direct vendors, whether located in the United States or abroad. Each direct vendor is required to complete a Social Compliance Assessment audit form annually, addressing a variety of topics, including human trafficking and slavery. 

We have a written procedure in the event we identify potential human rights violations. If an issue is identified, we work with the company’s agents and vendors to remediate any violations of our Social Compliance Policy, and require that vendors implement appropriate and timely corrective action. Any violation of the company’s Social Compliance Policy which our buyers, agents or other employees become aware of must be reported to senior management and the matter will be evaluated for prompt remediation. The company has established a confidential hotline that can be used by employees, agents or any third party to report suspected violations of the company Social Compliance Policy. We treat every violation of the Social Compliance Policy seriously, and reserve the right to terminate our relationship with any vendor who fails to meet our standards. 

Training on Human Trafficking and Slavery for Employees and Management with Direct Responsibility for Supply Chain Management
World Market has adopted a training program for buyers, sourcing and quality control teams, senior management, and other employees with responsibilities in the supply chain, educating them about the issues and risks associated with slavery and human trafficking. The company has also provided training to employees on how to identify and report issues relating to human trafficking and slavery. This training will be repeated at appropriate intervals to ensure that all new employees are educated about the company’s Social Compliance Policy and the issues relating to human trafficking and slavery.

We are committed to upholding the human rights of all workers involved in our product supply chains, and to the eradication of human trafficking and slavery worldwide."	Yes
83	"Supply Chain Transparency

At Cubic, we are actively engaged with our suppliers and partners to ensure a transparent and compliant supply chain. From the materials we buy to the labor used to produce them, Cubic is taking a proactive stance to being a socially responsible corporate citizen.

Materials

Cubic uses tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold in the manufacture of its products. These metals are identified as “conflict minerals” when they derive from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries identified as the “conflict region” by the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”). Dodd-Frank requires Cubic, as a publicly-traded U.S. company, to make certain disclosures every year related to the use of these metals in its products.

We do not source these metals directly; rather, they are present in the components that Cubic buys pre-manufactured from its suppliers. Therefore, Cubic must rely on the representations of its suppliers. In preparation for its Dodd-Frank conflict minerals filing in 2015, Cubic surveyed over 1,200 suppliers to ensure that the materials Cubic buys from them do not originate from the conflict region. While it was not possible to say with complete certainty that none of the products Cubic buys originates from the DRC, the responses we received did not raise significant concern. Cubic remains committed to supply chain transparency and continues to work toward improving its diligence processes as well as engaging suppliers and participating in industry initiatives in this area.

Cubic filed its Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report for the calendar year 2014 on May 22, 2015 as required by Dodd-Frank. The Conflict Minerals Report outlines Cubic’s reasonable country of origin inquiry and diligence process, and can be found here:http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/26076/000110465915040406/0001104659-15-040406-index.htm

Labor

Cubic maintains a regular dialogue with its suppliers on ethical labor practices. In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, Cubic verifies the safe and legal labor practices of its suppliers through announced, on-site inspections, and uses a variety of tools to monitor and evaluate supplier performance. Cubic inspects and monitors all goods it buys and integrates into its products for quality and compliance with law and regulation. Employees responsible for purchasing products receive training on slavery and human trafficking. Above all, Cubic maintains internal accountability standards through its company policies and has procedures in place for any employee or contractor that fails to meet Cubic’s standards."	Yes
84	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 became effective in California on January 1, 2012. The law was designed to increase the amount of information manufacturers and retailers doing business in California make available to consumers regarding their efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking.
 

As is stated in the Cummins Code of Business Conduct:

“At Cummins, doing the right thing is not optional. Whether it is providing the best possible product or world class customer service, treating all stakeholders with respect or acting with integrity in all we do, Cummins has a legacy of ethical behavior that dates back to the Company’s earliest days.

For more information, please see the Code of Business Conduct.
 

Accordingly, how Cummins treats others is part of our corporate DNA and embodied in the second of our ten ethical principles:  “We will embrace diverse perspectives and backgrounds, and treat all people with dignity and respect.”  Included in the description of this ethical principal is the following language:

“. . . We support human rights around the world, and we ensure that our employees and other stakeholders are treated with dignity. We comply with all applicable laws, and we will treat employees and their representatives fairly and honestly.  We will not tolerate child or forced labor anywhere in the world and we will not do business with any company that does. . . 

Our commitment to fair treatment also extends to our joint ventures, suppliers and other partners. . . .”
 

Through our Supplier Code of Conduct, we make sure our suppliers and partners understand our values and treat their stakeholders in a way that is consistent with those values.  The Supplier Code of Conduct provides, in pertinent part, as follows:

“No Forced or Child Labor

A supplier must not use involuntary labor of any kind, including prison labor, debt bondage or forced labor by governments. Only workers who meet the applicable minimum legal age requirement in the country where they are working or are at least 14 years old, whichever is greater, may be hired by a supplier. Additional standards include the following:

A. A supplier must comply with all applicable child labor laws, including those related to hiring, wages, hours worked, overtime and working conditions. Vocational or developmental programs for young people may require an exception to the age requirements.

B. The supplier must maintain official documentation that verifies a worker’s date of birth, employment history and training history. Cummins reserves the right to review this information if necessary.” 
 

Specific California Disclosures 
 

Verification of Product Supply Chain.  Cummins suppliers are required to sign a response form (“SCOC Response Form”) agreeing to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct (“SCOC”), which includes a prohibition against forced or child labor, or affirmatively set forth the reasons why they are unable to comply. Cummins reviews the SCOC Response Form to ensure that it meets the intent of the SCOC.  If Cummins concludes that the supplier is not in compliance based on the SCOC Response Form, Cummins will work with the supplier to (a) develop a plan to attain compliance, or (b) work on an exit strategy.  If the Supplier agrees to take the appropriate steps to comply, Cummins will monitor the supplier’s actions until all those required have been taken. 
 

Supplier Audits.  To verify that suppliers remain in compliance with SCOC, Cummins conducts an audit during supplier visits in China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Eastern European countries (including Russia).  The informal audit is conducted by Cummins personnel and the supplier is not notified before or during the audit.  Cummins management will contact the supplier’s management to inform them of all negative audit scores and Cummins will develop a corrective action plan with the supplier.  If any inappropriate behaviors or conditions viewed as systemic or critical are observed during the audit, the situation is reviewed with the Cummins legal department for appropriate action. 
 

Supplier Agreements.  Cummins requires suppliers that make up the top 80% of purchases to sign an SCOC Response Form or a contract that contains SCOC language, which requires suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and includes the prohibition against the use of forced or child labor of any kind.  
 

Accountability Standards and Procedures.  As our Code of Business Conduct states, “. . . [w]e will not tolerate child or forced labor anywhere in the world and we will not do business with any company that does. . . .” Employees and contractors have multiple avenues to raise concerns should a fellow employee or contractor be suspected to be in violation of this core ethical principal.  These avenues include contacting their supervisor, human resources or calling the ethics helpline or report through a specially designed ethics website.  Cummins does not tolerate retaliation and no action will be taken against an employee or contractor because he or she reported a concern. 

Similarly, Cummins SCOC sets forth our expectations for suppliers.  An employee or contractor who identifies a potential violation of the SCOC (outside of the Supplier Audit context described above) should report the information to his or her management, the purchasing department or the law department so that Cummins can investigate the matter and take appropriate action. 
 

Supply Chain Training.  Cummins trains employees responsible for supply chain management on Corporate Responsibility. We require all Cummins employees to comply with, and have training on, the Cummins Code of Business Conduct, which includes provisions prohibiting forced or child labor."	Yes

Dean Foods is one of the leading food and beverage companies in the U.S. and a European leader in soy foods and beverages. Continuing our success means making the right long-term choices for all of our stakeholders. In addition to our compliance with current U.S. and individual state laws regarding labor practices, as of January 1, 2012, Dean Foods is also required to comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657), which requires manufacturers and retailers to disclose their efforts to track forced labor and human trafficking in their supply chains. The information contained below relates to our obligations under this law.

Dean Foods predominantly operates in the United States. Other than the products manufactured by our European Alpro division, which is responsible for less than five percent of our total revenues, Dean Foods manufactures its products in the United States. As such, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to either U.S. or European laws and regulations regarding, among other things, forced labor and human trafficking.

Our supplier base is also predominantly U.S. based. The majority of our spending for ingredients is for fluid milk – both conventional and organic – and soy beans. Raw milk is our largest purchase by far, and our fluid milk is sourced in the U.S. and produced by U.S. farmers and farmer cooperatives that are also subject to U.S. and individual state laws regarding forced labor and human trafficking. All soy beans in both organic and natural varieties of our U.S. soy products, as well as almonds for almondmilk are sourced in North America. Additional inputs include resin (a petroleum-based product used to make plastic milk jugs), diesel fuel to operate our direct store delivery transportation vehicles, juice concentrates, and sweeteners.

We have a dedicated Procurement department that ensures we work with reputable commodity suppliers. Our Procurement team establishes guidelines and programs related to quality and product integrity for our major suppliers. Our guidelines are aligned with the Institute for Supply Management's Principles and Standards of Ethical Supply Management Conduct and Principles of Sustainability and Social Responsibility, that support worldwide efforts to eliminate forced labor and human trafficking as well as the pursuit of other human rights for workers in a particular supply chain In recent years, we have begun requiring suppliers to confirm their adherence to these principles as well.

Dean Foods requires suppliers of all Dean Foods products to disclose all facilities producing supplies or materials that are delivered to Dean Foods locations for use in manufacturing. While we do not use third parties to conduct audits of our suppliers’ standards, we internally monitor our supply chain to ensure that the locations providing supplies and materials to our facilities meet the standards that are required by Dean Foods, which includes compliance with all local laws and regulations. Should suppliers be discovered not to comply with our expectations, we can, and have in the past, elected to terminate the business relationship with a particular supplier.

To further our compliance with SB 657, Dean Foods will now require all suppliers to certify that they are aware of the need to comply with federal and local laws preventing forced labor and human trafficking. The requirement will be met either through the execution of Supply Agreements that contain such representations, or through a certification process that will be monitored internally.

  

Dean Foods also requires all of its employees to comply with a Code of Ethics which outlines that all Dean Foods employees are expected to act ethically and comply with all federal and local laws in the conducting of business. As with other alleged violations of law or policy, we will investigate any issue that is brought to our attention and take the appropriate action, up to and including termination for any employee that violates our Code of Ethics. All Dean Foods employees are trained on the Code of Ethics. In particular, the decision makers in the Dean Foods supply chain are trained on the purchase order and supplier management process, with a particular focus on adhering to the standards developed by the Procurement team regarding the requirement for selecting reputable and law-abiding suppliers."

89	"John Deere’s Support of Human Rights in Our Business Practices

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) will go into effect in the state of California. The act seeks the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires that companies disclose their efforts to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.

John Deere is known for its commitment to social responsibility, both as an employer and in how we conduct our business. The Ethisphere Institute has included John Deere in its list of the world’s most ethical businesses since 2007, when it first began recognizing social responsibility at a corporate level.

As a responsible corporate citizen, John Deere strives to ensure that human rights are upheld for our employees and all workers in our supply chain. We strive to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are absent from our supply chain through the following:

Supplier Code of Conduct:

				 Our Supplier Code of Conduct clearly establishes guidelines for the standard of ethical behavior expected from our suppliers. It states that suppliers may not use child, slave or forced labor. The code of conduct was introduced in 2005, and communicated to employees and suppliers at, and since, that time. As new suppliers enter our supply base, it is our standard practice to review the code of conduct with them. The code of conduct is available to the public on JohnDeere.com and to employees and suppliers through our JD Supply Network supplier portal. In addition, the code of conduct has recently been revised. The updated version will be available in January 2012. 

				 Our employees regularly discuss the Supplier Code of Conduct with suppliers during supplier conferences, meetings and performance reviews. 

				 Many of our standard contract templates contain language incorporating the Supplier Code of Conduct. 

				 Our purchasing terms and conditions, which are available on our supplier portal, state that the, “Seller shall comply with the John Deere Supplier Code of Conduct,” with a link to the document.  Risk-based assessments and audits: 

Suppliers who want to enter our supply base must complete a supplier information survey. The survey, which is administered by John Deere employees, requires suppliers to verify and certify that they do not use child or slave labor, or engage in human trafficking.

				 We periodically conduct “red flag” audits for potential suppliers, and current suppliers who provide less complex components. These audits use a short series of key questions from the Supplier Code of Conduct that verify and certify that suppliers do not use child or slave labor, or human trafficking. 

				 We conduct in-depth audits of all new suppliers against the John Deere Standard JDS-G223, the company’s supplier quality manual. The audit is derived from the manual, and contains questions that verify and certify that suppliers conduct their business according to the John Deere Supplier Code of Conduct. 

				 In addtion, we audit current suppliers of critical components in order of importance and highest risk. These audits use the same JDS-G223 criteria. 

				 Both JDS-G223 audits and “red flag” audits are conducted by teams of John Deere employees. The employee auditors are trained and qualified to thoroughly conduct audits that identify risks and unethical behavior, including a supplier’s use of illegal employee practices.  Training for John Deere employees and leaders: 

				 Annually, all John Deere salaried employees are required to review our Business Conduct Guidelines and certify they comply with them. The guidelines state the company’s commitment to human rights, including that company, employees, representatives, licensees and agents are “expected to not use any form of forced or indentured labor or child labor in the production or manufacture of goods.” 

				 Salaried employees receive training on the Business Conduct Guidelines every two years. Additional training courses focus on individual pieces of the guidelines as needed. 

				 Supplier code of conduct training is available for all employees. In 2012, this training will be mandatory for all Supply Management & Logistics employees. 

				 During 2012, all Supply Management employees and salaried employees with managerial responsibilities will be required to complete web-based training on the topic of eliminating forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking from the supply chain.  Internal accountability and controls:  Any John Deere employee, supplier or concerned individual can anonymously report a potential ethical violation, including human trafficking by a John Deere supplier, through any of the following methods: 

				 Compliance hot line: 1-800-933-3731 

				 Compliance mailbox: 90SMCompliance@JohnDeere.com 

				 By mail  Compliance Hotline Committee Post Office Box 1192 Moline, Illinois 61266-1192  All allegations are thoroughly investigated by an internal team that includes Supply Management representatives. Allegations that are found to be credible are dealt with as appropriate. Suppliers who are found in violation of the Supplier Code of Conduct may be eliminated from our supply base."	Yes

In 2010 the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was passed and will go into effect January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California and having annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million dollars to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chain.

As a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), we have shown our commitment to environmental and social responsibility. The EICC Code of Conduct establishes standards in treating workers with respect and dignity. Since 2004, the EICC Code of Conduct has prohibited the use of forced, bonded, and indentured labor and involuntary prison labor. Dell audits its suppliers to this code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. The EICC also has a Freely Chosen Employment (FCE) task force designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among EICC members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training.

Dell has been participating in the C-TPAT (Customs – Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) voluntary government-business initiative since its inception over 10 year ago. Dell works with its internal partners (logistics, security) as well as its external partners (manufacturers, carriers, brokers) to secure its end to end international supply chain to guard against cargo tampering from terrorist elements. Dell annually re-certifies its program with Customs Border Protection (CBP) and every 3 years undergoes a more rigorous re-validation with an onsite review from CBP.

Dell has internal policies and practices that are based on the EICC Code of Conduct as well as international labor and human rights standards. This focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort of supply chain transparency and accountability.

Del Monte Foods, Inc. is opposed to human trafficking and forced labor at any level. The following are steps we take to ensure that forced labor and human trafficking do not exist in our supply chain:

Supplier Assessments and Verification

Del Monte sourcing managers conduct multiple visits to contract manufacturer facilities prior to beginning a relationship with a contract manufacturer.

Supplier Certifications

Del Monte contract manufacturers are required to certify compliance with the Del Monte Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits suppliers from participating in, encouraging, aiding or fostering forced labor or human trafficking in any manner. The Supplier Code of Conduct and Purchase Order Terms and Conditions also require that suppliers comply with international, national and local laws, rules and regulations concerning labor, human rights and the environment.

Internal Accountability and Training

Del Monte employees who witness a violation of Del Monte policies and standards, including forced labor and human trafficking, are required to notify their direct supervisor, the Human Resources Department, the Law Department, or call the confidential Business Conduct Hotline. Furthermore, our Facility Security Policy has procedures in place that help to ensure the security of shipments from our suppliers, thus reducing the possibility of human trafficking opportunities.

Del Monte trains employees responsible for supply chain management, procurement, and internal auditing to identify and respond to qualitative and social responsibility issues in the supply chain.

Supplier Audits We conduct periodic audits of our contract manufacturers and certain other direct suppliers. These audits are conducted by our internal audit and/or supply chain teams which are trained in assessing risks in our supply chain. Independent, unannounced audits may be used to address quality assurance and compliance issues, but are not currently used to specifically audit compliance with human trafficking and slavery requirements. Del Monte’s Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, standard form Contract Manufacturing Agreement, and Procurement Purchasing Policy all prohibit forced labor and child labor. If an issue of human trafficking or slavery comes to our attention, then we would require that the supplier address the issue(s) or face termination of the supplier relationship."	Yes

93	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

As required under the California Transparency Supply Chain Act, we are disclosing our efforts to mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.

Verification

DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. is committed to fair labor practices throughout the supply chain. New and existing private brand contracted factories are regularly assessed against our Workplace Standards and Code of Conduct (below) which are based on International Labour Organization standards. Assessments are initiated based on geographic location, workplace history or previous audit record and other policy requirements. These audits are performed by DICK'S Compliance Team members and also by third party verifiers. Results are reviewed by Compliance Managers, who assist factories in remediating issues identified during audits, share key performance data with internal business partners as appropriate, and also engage with industry and NGO stakeholders to identify strategic opportunities to improve working conditions. DICK'S is a Better Work Buyer Partner (www.betterwork.org) and leverages the Better Work program to engage with key factories in countries where Better Work operates.

Auditing

Each year DICK'S audits a significant percentage of our private brand contract factories to determine if they are in compliance with our standards, which in addition to requiring compliance with local laws on working hours, wages and health and safety concerns, also prohibit forced, slave or child labor. Audits are performed by DICK'S compliance personnel or third party verifiers and are semi-unannounced within a negotiated time frame. Annual and follow-up audit frequency is determined in accordance with our policy and is based in part on the level of risk and non-compliance determined by previous audit results.

Certification

As part of the supplier onboarding process, all vendors are required to certify that they conduct business in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations which include any existing laws on slavery and human trafficking in the country of manufacture. DICK'S certifies private brand factories into various risk levels and active status categories. Detailed Corrective Action Plans are required within 14 days for any non-compliance with local law or our Code. Factories must exhibit continuous improvement, transparency, and management cooperation to ensure continued certification and business eligibility. Additional follow up audits are required until high risk issues are resolved. Lack of continuous improvement may result in termination of the business relationship. Factories that demonstrate low risk and strong management systems have opportunities to reduce the frequency of audits.

Internal Accountability

The Director of Global Ethics & Compliance, who reports to the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for overseeing the compliance and factory monitoring programs. The Director works with the DICK'S compliance team to ensure that the Factory Compliance Policy is followed and with Product Development and Sourcing teams to integrate key performance data into the sourcing business process and to address high risk factories. In addition to requiring corrective actions and remediation of identified non-compliances, DICK'S actively encourages factories to take ownership of compliance management and implement root cause/management systems based approaches to facilitate sustainable improvement. In addition to working with factory management, DICK'S strategically communicates responsible sourcing guidelines to internal business partners and vendors and also provides ""hotline"" channels for workers that we engage during factory visits.

Training

DICK'S provides annual training to relevant associates and business units on our Workplace Standards, Code of Conduct and program requirements. Training is conducted with management level associates in roles related to sourcing, product development, quality assurance and who interact with or travel to factories and may be in the best position to identify issues. Training on responsible sourcing guidelines and program expectations is also conducted in annual meetings with vendors and factories."	Yes

95	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)

In 2010, a law was passed in the state of California which requires companies to disclose what they are doing to address human trafficking in their supply chains. Referred to as SB 657, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act seeks to “educate consumers on how to purchase goods produced by companies that responsibly manage their supply chains ... to improve the lives of victims of slavery and human trafficking.”

DJO Global, Inc. (“DJO”) maintains a strict no tolerance policy with regard to slavery and human trafficking; under no circumstances is it acceptable for child, forced or trafficked labor to be used by DJO’s suppliers in the production of DJO’s products or product components. In furtherance of DJO’s no tolerance policy, DJO has instituted a Code of Supplier Conduct (“CSC”) that DJO’s authorized suppliers must abide by, and which explicitly prohibits forced labor of any kind.

Below, DJO has listed each of the five cornerstones of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, followed by an explanation of the actions DJO is taking to address each pillar.

Extent to which Company engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.

DJO requires, as a condition of doing business with DJO, that its suppliers comply with DJO’s CSC. DJO has unrestricted access to monitor all of its suppliers’ facilities and evaluate relevant records for purposes of verifying that DJO’s suppliers are in compliance with DJO’s CSC. DJO may engage in third- party verification of its supply chains to evaluate supplier’s compliance.

Extent to which Company conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.

DJO periodically conducts supplier audits, which may, at DJO’s discretion, include announced and unannounced audits in the supplier facilities that DJO monitors. DJO has the right to engage in unannounced third-party verification of its supply chains. In conducting these audits, DJO seeks to verify whether DJO’s company standards per its CSC and Global Procurement Standards (“GPS”) are being followed at the supply level.

Extent to which Company requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

All of DJO’s authorized suppliers are required to abide by DJO’s Purchasing General Terms and Conditions. DJO’s Purchasing General Terms and Conditions stipulate that:

“in performance of work hereunder, Seller shall comply with all applicable international, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.”

In addition, each of DJO’s authorized suppliers are provided an introductory packet which includes, among other things, DJO’s CSC and accompanying attestation form which states that supplier has read and understands DJO’s CSC and shall adhere to the standards DJO sets forth therein.

 

Extent to which Company maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

Failure of DJO employees to abide by DJO’s policies can result in correct action up to and including termination of employment. In addition, failure of DJO’s supplier’s to abide by DJO’s CSC can result in corrective action up to and including the termination of all existing business with such supplier.

Extent to which Company provides its employees and management, which have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.

DJO endeavors to work directly with its employees and management personnel who are directly responsible for supply chain management in order to ensure continued adherence to DJO’s policies prohibiting forced labor or any kind. In furtherance thereof, DJO provides its employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management training on DJO’s CSC."	Yes
96	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act SB657

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB657) became effective in early 2012. This law requires large manufacturers and retailers to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking within their supply chains. The purpose of the law is to educate consumers so that they can make informed decisions and purchase goods from companies that responsibly manage their supply chain.

Dollar General’s Mission is Serving Others, and our mission of Serving Others goes beyond the way we treat our customers. Our corporate culture and mission are the reasons we have conducted independent third party supply chain audits of foreign factories that we use for a more than a decade. Our audit procedures are routinely reviewed and updated to remain current with emerging market conditions. Our current factory audit is much different from the audit that we conducted years ago.

Verification:

Dollar General does not own or have financial interest in any factories, nor are we a top 3 customer for the majority of the factories that we use. We have a robust audit program that is designed to identify, and eliminate from our supply chain, any factories that do not meet our ethical standards, such as violations of our policy against the use of child or forced labor. We use a continuous improvement model with factories that are willing to make needed improvements.

Dollar General works with industry organizations and experts to benchmark our program and address evolving issues. As a result we continuously update our program and develop tools to identify cases of forced or child labor, physical or sexual abuse and harassment.

Auditing:

All facilities producing direct import merchandise for Dollar General are audited by an independent third party auditing firm at least annually. We use a combination of announced and unannounced audits plus surveillance audits are used as needed We chose third party audit companies with the reputation of having experienced auditors who are experts in identifying false records, conducting worker interviews and otherwise detecting violations of our ethical standards.

The findings of the audit may result in the relationship with the supplier being severed and no product accepted, such as in the case of a facility that uses child or forced labor. In other cases a factory may be suspended for a period of time for failing to make needed improvements in a timely manner.

Certification:

Suppliers must sign the Dollar General Supplier Agreement and agree to abide by our Code of Conduct as well as our Corporate Sociability Standards. Those standards require that the products provided to Dollar General will be manufactured only in accordance with our social accountability standards, including but not limited to:

No child labor, all workers must be 16 years of age or older if required by law Version 2.0

No forced or involuntary labor The vendor is required by the Terms and Conditions on the Purchase Order to warrant that the product is

not produced or packaged with the use of child or forced labor, or in violation of any other human rights.

Accountability:

All employees and suppliers are governed by the Dollar General Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Signing the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is one of the requirements for employment at Dollar General. Violations of the Code can result in discipline or loss of employment. Supplier or factory allegations are investigated, and Dollar General reserves the right to terminate the relationship with any supplier or factory that violates our Code.

Dollar General maintains a vendor manual for suppliers which calls out that we have Zero Tolerance for the use of Child Labor (workers must be at least sixteen years of age) or Forced labor (all types of forced labor to include prison, bonded, and indentured.) We reserve the right to visit at any time all facilities used in the production of goods for the corporation.

Training:

Dollar General conducts training for employees with supply chain responsibilities, to increase their understanding of how to recognize signs of ethical violations in the supply chain. Members of our compliance department review any identified factory issues with management and the merchants to keep them updated on how to interpret audit results and auditor comments. In addition we visit and work closely with our overseas offices to ensure a consistent message and complete understanding of our requirements. We educate about the risks in certain countries and product categories, using the US Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor."	Yes

Re: California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 567)

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (“Act”) went into effect in the State of California. The Act seeks the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires that companies disclose their efforts to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.

To this end, Dr Pepper Snapple Group (“DPSG”), on behalf of its operating entities, supports the corporate codes of practice set forth by the Ethical Trading Initiative (“ETI”), implementing human rights, ethical labor practices, and environmental protection standards. These are available at www.ethicaltrade.org. Our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct is modeled after the ETI standards, a copy of which can be found under the Ethical Sourcing link at http://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/values/sustainability/. Both the ETI and our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct require that employment is freely chosen and not forced in addition to other similar commitments to help to ensure that our suppliers are not engaging in forced or child labor.

As a responsible corporate citizen, we seek to ensure that quality and safety standards are maintained throughout our supply chain by well-treated, fairly compensated workers in accordance with all applicable laws. We conscientiously integrate the standards and commitments of the ETI into the way we run our businesses to address such concerns and have undertaken the following efforts to help to ensure and verify slavery and human trafficking are not occurring in our supply chain:

Acknowledgment of Standards: Each of our suppliers is required to commit to us that they adhere to our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct. Verification of supplier adherence is done internally with some suppliers through their execution of our Code of Conduct. Verification of Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct adherence for other suppliers will be conducted externally, through such supplier’s membership in Sedex, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange, a third party organization. Sedex is a non-profit organization linking global businesses with suppliers and focuses on labor standards, health and safety, environmental and business integrity.

Risk-based assessments and audits: In addition, we review our supplier base and assess all potential suppliers to determine the level of risk associated with each supplier with respect to compliance with our Ethical Code of Conduct.

As stated in our Corporate Sustainability report, by 2015 we will conduct annual third-party risk assessments of all suppliers and audit any high-risk suppliers to ensure full compliance with our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct. Our progress is updated annually and can be reviewed in our Corporate Sustainability Report located on our corporate website, www.drpeppersnapple.com.

The first step in this process was the segmentation and identification of our direct material suppliers into low-, medium- and high-risk categories based on our knowledge of their industries and country of origin.

With respect to audits, our process includes the audit of our high-risk suppliers. While high-risk suppliers make up a low percentage of our total direct supplier base, it is these suppliers that we intend to focus on in order to ensure compliance with our standards. Whether it is through supplier acceptance of our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct, participation in the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange, and/or on-site audits, we are holding our high-risk suppliers accountable.

Audits will be undertaken internally, by DPSG personnel, as well as externally by third party auditors and through Sedex membership audit submissions. In most cases the audits will be announced.

Non compliance: If we believe that a supplier is not in compliance with our standards with respect to our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct, which includes the elimination of slavery and human trafficking, we will provide such supplier with the opportunity to remedy any potential non-compliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan and we will conduct a subsequent audit. Should the supplier continue to fail to meet our standards, we will seek to eliminate such supplier from our supply chain.

Capability building and training programs: DPSG partners with third party providers to develop and maintain a robust process to allow us to identify and help reduce or eliminate risk of non-compliance with our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct.

We train employees from Supply Chain Procurement to identify and respond to supply chain risk issues such as forced or child labor as part of our procurement process. Team leaders were trained in 2011 and training is updated regularly.

Additionally, all employees are required to acknowledge and adhere to our Business Code of Conduct & Ethics. The Code includes the requirement to comply with all laws in all places where DPSG does business and a violation of the Code may result in penalties including termination.

DPSG believes that the elements of this approach will help prevent human trafficking and slavery within our supply chain."	Yes

Eastman Kodak Company (“Kodak”) believes that doing business on a global basis means acting right by customers, employees, and its neighbors in every location it operates. The operation of Kodak facilities, as well as those operated by our suppliers, should increase value by developing the individual, supporting the well being of the community, and promoting respect for the environment. 

 

Kodak expects its suppliers to contribute to these goals. Accordingly, Kodak suppliers are required to act according to Kodak’s Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Supplier Performance Standard. They must also comply with the Code of Conduct of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), of which Kodak is a member, and Kodak’s Corporate Responsibility Principles. EICC standards outline practices expressly geared toward upholding the dignity and respect of workers and prohibiting the use of forced, bonded, indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. The Company has developed processes to review its supply chain to identify potential risk areas, require adherence with the principles stated in the above documents as part of its contractual relations with suppliers, require Suppliers to certify that they will comply with applicable laws and regulations in any country in which they operate, and directly evaluate compliance as a basis for their continued association with Kodak. Suppliers may be subject to audit, with reasonable notice, by a third party under the EICC Validated Audit Program and/or by Kodak directly.

Edwards Lifesciences values its relationships with our suppliers. We are committed to conducting business only with suppliers who adhere to ethical business practices, act in an environmentally responsible manner, encourage workplace health and safety, adopt good human resources policies and practices and abide by all applicable laws. We regularly perform a variety of actions and activities to ensure that the services and materials provided to our company meet this commitment.

CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires many manufactures, including Edwards Lifesciences, to disclose their activities in monitoring their supply chains to prevent human trafficking and slavery. These disclosures are intended to allow businesses and consumers to make more informed decisions about the products they choose to purchase and the companies they choose to support.

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENTS AND QUALIFICATIONS

Prior to engaging a new supplier, Edwards Lifesciences typically evaluates the supplier through a risk-based assessment process. Our assessment may initially include a supplier questionnaire and an audit of their facilities, quality system and business practices, and subsequently may include follow-up visits and reviews.

SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Edwards Lifesciences is committed to continuous improvement in its supply chain. To that end, we periodically monitor the business performance of our key suppliers through periodic performance and objectives discussions and reviews.

SUPPLIER AUDITS

Edwards Lifesciences periodically audits suppliers to confirm compliance to performance and quality standards. Verifications and factory audits may be performed directly by our company or by third parties. Audits are typically pre-planned events with the supplier. Our audits verify suppliers’ compliance with our written agreements and quality systems requirements. Audit findings and recommendations are discussed with each supplier’s facility management. The supplier is expected to address all issues arising from the audit and Edwards Lifesciences validates the supplier’s corrective actions during follow-up audits or reviews.

SUPPLIER AGREEMENTS

Edwards Lifesciences generally has supply contracts, quality agreements and/or purchase order terms and conditions with its suppliers. These documents include the supplier’s agreement to comply with all laws applicable to the supply of services or materials to Edwards Lifesciences.

EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND COMPLIANCE

All Edwards Lifesciences employees are required to comply with our company’s global business practice standards. These standards include the company’s commitment not to produce or manufacture goods using forced or sweatshop labor, or indentured child labor. Our employees participate in periodic training on the company’s business practice standards to enhance understanding and compliance with these standards. In addition, we audit compliance with our business practice standards, investigate potential violations and, when appropriate, take remedial and/or disciplinary action.

Edwards Lifesciences has educated our key supply chain personnel on the purpose and intent of the Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. We also inform our supply chain managers on how they can further promote the law’s objectives with our suppliers and be more conscious of working conditions at supplier’s facilities. In an effort towards building a socially and environmentally responsible supply chain, we also factor our supplier’s demonstrated labor compliance practices and socially responsible behavior in our purchasing decisions.

***

Edwards Lifesciences is committed to ensuring that our supply chain partners are good corporate citizens, deal fairly in business matters, behave ethically, support a safe and healthy workplace, act in an environmentally responsible manner and comply with applicable laws. We regularly undertake numerous activities, including the activities described above, to satisfy ourselves and others that the products and services provided to Edwards Lifesciences meet this commitment."

102	"DuPont Statement on California Transparency Supply Chains Act

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in California. The law is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking.

In 2003, DuPont implemented a policy on child and forced labor. Since then, the company has upgraded its policy based on societal expectations.  The current policy is available at:  http://www2.dupont.com/media/en-us/news-events/insights/child-and-forced-labor.html

DuPont is committed to conduct its business in an ethical and responsible manner that supports and respects the protection of human rights.  We will work to identify and do business with suppliers and contractors who aspire to conduct their business in a similar manner.  Compliance with this policy and applicable laws is the responsibility of every employee and contractor acting on our behalf and is a condition of their employment or contract.  Management in each business is responsible to educate, train, and motivate employees to understand and comply with this policy and applicable laws.  

DuPont efforts include:

Inclusion of child and forced labor and human trafficking questions as part of initial supplier qualification for high risk areas. Procurement agreements issued by DuPont require that direct suppliers accept the DuPont principles. A supplier’s failure to correct any violation may result in the termination of the contractual relationship.

Establishment of a risk assessment process for contract operations driven by country leaders with the procurement function to prioritize contract operations that should undergo an audit process.  Audits by DuPont employees may be conducted on operations with a high risk profile.  The integrated audit protocol includes human rights risk assessment questions.

Regular network sessions to cover training on Human Rights and other high risk areas for supply chain management including contract manufacturing administrators, sourcing leaders and supply chain leaders.

believes that it is possible to end slavery in twenty-five years. To accomplish

this, consumers must be engaged and brands must exert long-term effort and

continuous attention. At EILEEN FISHER, we have engaged nonprofit partners

to guide our efforts and we have reached out to like-minded companies to

collaborate on change-making ideas. We cannot do this work alone.



How is EILEEN FISHER taking action?



We are keenly aware that conditions leading to human trafficking and slavery

can exist in very subtle forms, such as the withholding of identity or travel

documents and the charging of excessive recruitment fees. Therefore, we have

made a company commitment to go deeper with both our auditing and our

factory trainings. Our goal is to see if we can eliminate the root causes that can

lead to human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain.



Our strategy was developed with our monitoring partners and nonprofit

partners. It has five components:



    Verification In 2011, we used the Fair Hiring Toolkit published by Verité, our

    long-time partner, to survey our suppliers on their recruitment practices and

    grievance systems, so that we can evaluate where we could be vulnerable

    to human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain. We have also provided

    our suppliers with a copy of their country laws in their native languages to

    underscore their legal responsibilities with regard to human trafficking.



    Auditing Human trafficking is forbidden by both SA8000, the labor standard

    that we have followed since 1997, and ETI Base Code, which we adopted

    in 2011. We have reached out to our auditors--independent, third-party

    reviewers--to make sure that human trafficking is an important part of their

    audits. Audits are mostly conducted on an unannounced basis. To go beyond

    the items that their audits regularly cover--management interviews, worker

    interviews and health and safety walk-throughs--we are also conducting

    some mobile phone surveys in partnership with Good World Solutions to

    survey workers on the issue of human trafficking.



    Certification We feel it is our responsibility, not that of our manufacturing

    partners, to certify that the fabrics, yarns and trims incorporated into

    our products were made in compliance with local laws regarding human

    trafficking and slavery. Prior to placing bulk orders, we ask questions that

    will help us target potential human rights issues and identify red flags. Our

    Social Consciousness Team works closely with our design and manufacturing

    teams to engage our mills and incorporate ethical sourcing into our fabric

    and yarn approval process.



    Internal Accountability We have reiterated our zero tolerance for human

    trafficking to our suppliers and made it clear that if we discover a violation

    that cannot be resolved through remediation, we will have no choice but to

    end our relationship with the supplier.



    Training To raise awareness about what can occur in the global supply chain,

    we have conducted a series of trainings with various partners to educate

    our employees, our Hong Kong sourcing agent and both the managers and

    workers at our factories. These sessions identify red flags and examine

    important root-cause factors of slavery and trafficking, including recruiting

    practices and migrant worker issues. We believe that by providing the people

    in our supply chain with the relevant knowledge and tools, they can act as

    change agents in their individual communities.



    UL-STR partnered with us to host training sessions at our headquarters in

    Irvington, New York, at our Creative Center in New York City and also at the

    offices of our sourcing and production agent in Hong Kong.



    Ethical Trading Initiative worked with us to conduct an additional series of

    internal trainings.



    Verité, our long-time partner, conducted trainings at our factories in China.

    Managers attended mandatory sessions on human trafficking and slavery

    that focused on recruitment and grievance systems. Factory worker trainings

    covered how to get help for anyone in a compromised situation."	Yes
104	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Information

The E. & J. Gallo Winery is a leading wine and spirits company in the United States and around the world. We comply with federal, state, and foreign laws regarding labor practices in all parts of the world where we operate. On January 1, 2012, a new law came into effect in California called the Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657). The law requires our company and many other large retailers and manufacturers to disclose publicly their efforts, if any, to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. In compliance with this law, the information below relates to our efforts to eliminate human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain. 

The vast majority of our suppliers are located in the United States, principally in California. California and, we believe, all other states in the United States, have laws making forced labor and human trafficking a serious crime. So far as we are aware, no supplier to our company, whether located within or without the United States, has ever been accused of engaging in forced labor or human trafficking. We have dedicated Supplier Development and Quality Assurance teams that try to ensure we work only with reputable suppliers. These teams establish guidelines and programs related to quality and product integrity for our main suppliers. In addition, most of our contracts with suppliers require that the supplier conduct its business in accordance with all applicable laws, which would include laws against forced labor and human trafficking. We conduct announced audits and inspections, and we monitor our supply chain to insure that our suppliers meet our high standards. We will terminate our contract with any supplier found to be in violation with our policy on human trafficking and slavery. 

To further our efforts to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from our supply chain, we have now asked all suppliers to return a signed statement to us acknowledging that they support the elimination of forced labor and human trafficking. In addition, our supplier contracts now contain an express representation that each supplier will comply fully with all applicable laws prohibiting human trafficking and slavery. 

If you have any questions, please contact ContractAdministration@ejgallo.com."	Yes
105	"Corporate Disclosure in Compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires certain companies doing business in California to report on their websites the activities they engage in to monitor their supply chains to prevent human trafficking and slavery.

Lilly maintains a long-standing practice of complying with local minimum-age laws and requirements and does not employ child labor, or forced or compulsory labor, in any of our facilities globally. For more information on this, please visit Lilly’s 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report at http://www.lilly.com/Documents/2010%20Lilly%20Corporate%20Responsibility%20Rep ort.pdf. In 2011, Lilly began revising our global standards and procedures to include specific language about human rights, including our expectations that vendors abide by Lilly human-rights standards as one piece of our Supplier Code of Conduct. To view the current Lilly Supplier Code of Conduct, go to http://supplierportal.lilly.com/Suppliers/Pages/ConductCode.aspx.

In early 2009, Lilly adopted the Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management, as set forth by the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), an industry group in which Lilly is an active participant. PSCI Principles are designed to align with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact; they represent high-level expectations set for industry suppliers in the areas of ethics, labor, health and safety, the environment, and related management systems. To review the PSCI principles, please visit http://www.pharmaceuticalsupplychain.org/principles/introduction. Upon

adopting the principles, Lilly revised and updated our Supplier Code of Conduct to reflect these principles.

Verification and Audit—All suppliers in Lilly’s supply chain are reviewed for relevant compliance and quality issues at the initiation of their relationship with Lilly. All agreements with vendors require that suppliers represent and warrant to Lilly that they comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Lilly expects that all suppliers comply with the PSCI principles. Starting in 2012, Lilly will be working with PSCI as PSCI begins conducting audits of product supply chains for compliance with PSCI principles – including evaluating and addressing the risks of human trafficking and slavery. These audits are intended to be performed by third parties under PSCI direction.

Certification—As part of Lilly’s ongoing supply chain risk management, Lilly suppliers must complete a supplier self-assessment questionnaire. Suppliers must indicate that they support the PSCI principles and sign a statement testifying to this effect. In addition to the self assessment and certification processes described above, all suppliers in Lilly’s supply chain must meet rigorous compliance standards intended to meet Lilly’s quality and external

  

regulatory obligations. Lilly’s contracts with suppliers include provisions requiring its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws including laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking.

Internal Accountability—Lilly requires that all Lilly employees must comply with Lilly’s internal Code of Ethics and Legal Business Conduct, the Red Book http://www.lilly.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/pdf/RedBook.pdf, all company policies and procedures, all laws and regulations that apply to company business operations, and all applicable official orders and decrees. This includes laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Any violations of this policy are subject to disciplinary measures including dismissal as appropriate. For any supplier not meeting Lilly’s expectations under its contractual arrangements, Lilly reserves the right to terminate the agreement.

Training—All Lilly employees, including employees involved in our supply chain management are trained on Lilly’s Red Book on an annual basis. In 2012, Lilly will implement a training program for certain management and staff involved in Lilly’s supply-chain procurement to enhance awareness of supply chain risks regarding human trafficking and slavery issues."

106	"Developing and Managing a Responsible Global Supply Chain 

Extending the Reach of Emerson Values
As Emerson grew and expanded globally we broadened our supply chain, and in this process, helped elevate business standards in the locales in which we operate. Our success with growth and innovation helps suppliers worldwide advance their processes and technologies to gain access to new markets. Over the past half century, Emerson actively engaged the developing world in global growth, opportunity, and rising standards of living. As we invest in our capabilities around the world, we emphasize parallel efforts to localize sourcing as the best path to serve customers. Investing resources in new suppliers helps to accelerate progress throughout developing regions.

Emerson views our supply base as a direct extension of our company – one which projects our values and principles. We expect suppliers to stay current with technology, act with integrity and treat people and the environment with respect – all actions that reflect our priorities. In this way, identifying and cultivating the right partners requires significant investments as we strive to employ high caliber suppliers that demonstrate responsibility and commitment to fair and productive approaches as well as compliance with laws and norms. 

As Emerson expands into new regions, we sometimes encounter existing business cultures and practices that may conflict with our standards for honesty, integrity and full legal compliance. Having a growing vendor base aligned with our ethical position helps to assure our future in these geographies. We closely monitor our supply chain to eliminate wrongful practices and acts, allowing Emerson to build local vendor bases in new, developing-country production locations that align with our stances on social responsibility and ethics.

This vendor management process advances several critical goals:

Extension of high standards of integrity and responsibility

Continuation of quality assurance throughout our operations

Expansion of commerce and employment



Our supplier management practices include:

Affirming Supplier Responsibility
We expect suppliers to abide by our ethical behavior guidelines that forbid any Emerson employee or family member from accepting payment from outside parties in connection with supplier transactions. We also prohibit suppliers from offering gifts that could influence Emerson-related purchasing decisions.

We plan to require principal suppliers to affirm their understanding of Emerson values and standards regarding ethical behavior, labor practices, human rights and environmental protection. We expect all suppliers to operate in a manner that supports Emerson’s commitment to conduct business responsibly. 

Training Emerson Employees
Corporate social responsibility efforts address a range of complex issues across differing geographies, cultures and business practices. Acting responsibly requires knowledge of each subject, understanding of laws and practices, and the ability to recognize potential deviations. 

To deal with these complexities, Emerson trains managers and employees annually to help them engage effectively with suppliers as they communicate Emerson’s priorities. This training also helps improve our ability to recognize, report and support remediation and compliance issues.

Vendor Practices
To enhance our knowledge of suppliers and limit the risk of inadvertently supporting wrongful practices, we use internal, industry and public sources to alert us to improper supply chain behavior. We expect division supply chain managers to make reasonable assessments of questionable activity and to ensure that practices conform to Emerson expectations.

This is intended to comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. For additional information about Emerson's business ethics policies and practices, see Ethical Behavior.

107	"CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT DISCLOSURE

Enphase Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Enphase"") strive to achieve and maintain the highest possible standards of corporate integrity and ethical behavior. Enphase expects that its suppliers will conduct their businesses not only in a lawful manner but also in compliance with the same high standards of integrity and ethics.

In order to establish guidelines for such standards, Enphase has established a Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct sets forth and highlights important legal, ethical, behavioral and other requirements for parties that wish to be Enphase suppliers. Specifically, the Supplier Code of Conduct states that suppliers must not support, promote or engage in the practice of slavery or human trafficking, and it requires suppliers to comply with all international standards and applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Enphase suppliers are further expected to take reasonable and necessary steps to help ensure that their sub-contractors and sub-suppliers also comply with all international standards and applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

At this point, Enphase does not engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate or address the risks of human trafficking and slavery, audit suppliers to evaluate compliance with Enphase standards for human trafficking and slavery in supply chains, or require suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into their products comply with laws regarding human trafficking and slavery. However, Enphase provides its suppliers with a Quality Assurance Manual that outlines our Supply Chain Expectations and requires suppliers and subcontractors to comply with all international standards and applicable laws and regulations regarding slavery and human trafficking. It is our expectation that they do not support, promote or engage in slavery and human trafficking and that slavery and human trafficking do not exist in their respective organizations and supply chains. Enphase suppliers also may be asked to cooperate with Enphase in an annual verification of the absence of human trafficking and slavery in its supply chain through audits of supplier practices and underlying management systems conducted by Enphase. Suppliers are expected to promptly take

corrective action to address any deficiencies identified with respect to compliance with Enphase's Supplier Code of Conduct. If a supplier is found to be in violation of the Supplier Code of Conduct, Enphase will take prompt, remedial measures to address the violation.

Enphase also has established a Code of Conduct, which applies to all Enphase personnel, including employees and board members (collectively, ""Employees""). Enphase expects its business partners and contractors to share the general principles stated in the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct requires Enphase Employees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to those relating to human trafficking and slavery. While Enphase does not provide specific training on human trafficking and slavery, the Code of Conduct explains that if an Employee needs guidance on a legal or ethical question or has witnessed or has knowledge of an illegal or unethical activity, he or she should consult with or report the matter to his or her supervisor, Enphase’s Compliance Officer, the Compliance Hotline and/or the Audit Committee of Enphase's Board of Directors, depending on the specific circumstances. All reports of alleged violations will be investigated by Enphase. If the results of an investigation indicate that corrective action is required, the Company will decide the appropriate steps to take, including discipline, dismissal, and possible legal proceedings.

It is Enphase’s intention and policy to conduct its business with integrity and to rely on our employees and partners to follow appropriate ethical and legal business practices. Enphase takes the issues of slavery and human trafficking very seriously and will continue doing its part by responsibly managing its supply chains in an effort to eradicate human trafficking and slavery."

109	"Supplier Conduct

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (the “Act”) went into effect on January 1, 2012. The Act requires manufacturers and retailers doing business in the State of California to disclose information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. 

On August 22, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued the final conflict minerals rule under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Conflict Minerals Rule”). The Conflict Minerals Rule requires publicly traded companies to disclose annually the use of conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, or “3TG”) originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries (“Covered Countries”). The Conflict Minerals Rule is just one of many efforts to curtail the activities of armed groups responsible for human rights violation that are financed through the mining and trading of 3TG minerals. Beginning in 2014, we will file our initial report indicating whether or not Conflict Minerals that are necessary to the “functionality or production” of our products originated from any one of the Covered Countries. Our filing will describe the due diligence measures taken to identify the Conflict Minerals source and supply chain. We expect all of our suppliers will fully support our compliance activities, provide and use 3TG minerals which originate outside the Covered Countries and otherwise certify that all materials, parts or components procured in connection with products we purchase are “conflict free”.

As set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (our “Code of Conduct”), we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations and conducting our business affairs at the highest professional standards. We also do not want to directly or indirectly support human rights violations or human trafficking in the Covered Countries or other regions of the world. To that end, our efforts to address such abuses in our supply chain include the following:

Risk-based Supplier Assessments: We periodically conduct internal reviews of our direct supplier base and assess current and potential suppliers to determine the level of risk associated with each supplier, including with respect to the risk of human rights violations and human trafficking and/or use of 3TG.

Written Policies and Procedures: We have adopted written policies that strictly prohibit business practices that are unethical, illegal or that may cause harm to us, our employees, our business partners, our customers or the public, which include the use of 3TG minerals or permit human rights violations, slavery or human trafficking in our direct supply chain. These policies include our Code of Conduct and our Supplier Principles (our “Supplier Principles”), which can be located on Exar’s website (www.exar.com). 

Industry Associations:We support the efforts of those associations which are committed to the protection of human rights and the elimination of slavery, human trafficking and use of 3TG minerals

Supplier Certifications: We have distributed our Supplier Principles to our direct suppliers and have asked them to certify their compliance therewith, including the provisions barring the use of forced labor, slavery or human trafficking, or the use and distribution of 3TG minerals, as well as requesting that our suppliers complete, file and return the EICC and GeSI reporting forms distributed by Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) and Global e-Sustainability initiative (“GeSI). 

Audits: We reserve the right to audit all suppliers for compliance with our Supplier Principles. Currently we do not employ an independent third party to audit and evaluate our suppliers’ compliance with our Supplier Principles and instead will conduct audits of any suppliers identified as high risk. In addition, informal audits occur during the normal course of business as our employees, who are trained to identify non-compliance, interact with our suppliers.

Accountability Standards: If we believe that a supplier is not in compliance with the standards set forth in our Supplier Principles, which includes the elimination of slavery and human trafficking and use of 3TG minerals, we will provide such supplier with the opportunity to remedy any potential non-compliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan and we will conduct a subsequent audit. Should the supplier continue to fail to meet our standards, we will seek to remove such supplier from our supply chain. Our Supplier Principles permits the termination of a supplier for even a single violation and likewise our Code of Conduct permits a range of measures, up to and including termination, for our employees involved in any similar misconduct.

Employee Training: We conduct training for employees whose job functions include procurement that emphasizes the importance of ensuring that our suppliers abide by our Supplier Principles, including its prohibitions on slavery and human trafficking and use of 3TG minerals.

We believe our direct suppliers are reputable companies with internal standards requiring compliance with laws such as those prohibiting slavery and human trafficking and use of 3TG minerals. However, we will continue to update our policies and procedures as needed to ensure that we have appropriate safeguards against any mistreatment of persons involved in our direct supply chain."	Yes
110	"California’s Transparency in Supply Chains Law

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43) went into effect. This law, passed by the California state legislature, increases the amount of information made available by retailers and manufacturers concerning their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.

Forced labor and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor. Exelis Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively “Exelis”) has a zero-tolerance policy for any such forced labor, human trafficking or child labor used in the manufacture of the products it purchases or the products it provides.

Background

Exelis has a long standing commitment to conducting its business fairly, impartially, and in an ethical and proper manner. Exelis is committed to conducting business in a manner that respects and advances human rights based on intrinsic corporate values and operating principles. Exelis upholds human rights at all times and in all locations, regardless of local business customs.

In particular, Exelis is committed to:

• Providing safe and secure conditions for those working on our Company’s behalf

• Protecting the environment

• Following all applicable wage and hour laws

• Strictly prohibiting human trafficking and the use of child or forced labor, including prison or bonded labor

• Treating each other fairly and equitably

To ensure that every facet of our business upholds these standards, Exelis expects every supplier with whom it transacts business, regardless of location, to share these commitments.

Practices and Policies

I. Verification of product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery

Exelis communicates their expectations through standard conditions of purchase and obtains verification through an Annual Supplier certification process that every supplier in performing obligations under an agreement with Exelis will not use child labor as defined by local law, will not use forced or compulsory labor, and will not physically abuse labor. Each supplier must further assure compliance with all applicable wage and benefit, working hours, overtime and health, safety and environmental matters, laws and regulations.

II. Audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery

Through its conditions of purchase, Exelis reserves the right to require each supplier to demonstrate compliance with all requirements regarding forced labor, human trafficking or child labor and inspect any site a supplier may use in manufacturing or providing products for Exelis.

III. Internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or suppliers failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking

Exelis maintains a Code of Conduct for all employees. Any employee who fails to abide by the human trafficking, forced and child labor provisions of the Exelis Code of Conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination. In addition, Exelis expects suppliers, who have cause to believe that an Exelis employee or agent of Exelis has behaved improperly or unethically, to report such behaviors to an Exelis Point of Contact (POC). These POC’s, along with the Code of Conduct are made available to all suppliers on the Exelis website located at http://www.exelisinc.com.

A supplier’s failure to comply with the company standards regarding forced labor, human trafficking or child labor shall be cause for immediate termination of the engagement/relationship.

IV. Training on human trafficking and slavery

All Exelis personnel, regardless of position, receive annual training on the Code of Conduct, which includes updates and discussions on forced labor, human trafficking and child labor laws and the impact they have to how Exelis conducts its business and how it sources and manufactures its products."	Yes
111	"Our Supplier Code of Conduct 

Compliance with the Law 
Compliance with all laws, rules and regulations. 

Minimum Wages and Benefits
Payment to workers of the minimum wage prescribed by local law or the prevailing local industry wage, whichever is higher; provision to workers of benefits that conform to the better of applicable local law or prevailing local industry standards; and payment to workers of overtime compensation in compliance with all applicable laws. 

Maximum Working Hours
Overtime shall be limited to a level consistent with humane and productive working conditions. Workers shall not be required, on a regularly scheduled basis, to work in excess of 60 hours (or lower if prescribed by local laws or local industry standards) per week; and, generally, workers shall be provided with at least one day off in seven. 

No Forced Labor
Prison, indentured, bonded, involuntary, slave labor or labor obtained through human trafficking shall not be used. 

No Child Labor
All workers shall be at least the local minimum legal working age or ILO standard, whichever is higher. 

Health and Safety
The work environment shall be safe and healthy. 

Nondiscrimination
Workers shall be selected only on the basis of their ability to do the job and not on the basis of other personal characteristics or beliefs. 

No Corporal Punishment
Neither corporal punishment nor any other form of physical or psychological coercion shall be used against workers. 

Freedom of Association
The lawful exercise of workers’ rights of free association shall be respected and not restricted or interfered in, and workers lawfully exercising those rights shall not be threatened or penalized. 

Environment
Suppliers must comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

Community Involvement
Projects undertaken in partnership with community groups, or local or international NGOs, particularly those that address educational opportunities for younger people employed in production facilities, shall be encouraged and supported. 

Access
For the purpose of monitoring compliance with our policies, Express, its subcontractors and its agents shall be given unrestricted access to all production facilities and dormitories and to all relevant records, whether or not notice is provided in advance. 

Sub-contracting
Express requires all suppliers and sub-contractors to fully comply with its Code of Conduct. Express does not allow unauthorized subcontracting. A formal request must be submitted to Express for approval, should a supplier require sub-contracting. 

Performance & Evaluation 
We know it is our responsibility to ensure that our suppliers are in compliance with our standards. To assist us with our responsibilities, we engage third parties who specialize in supply chain compliance matters. 

If we discover that our suppliers are not in compliance with our standards, our first step is to attempt to bring them into compliance by supporting them in making the necessary changes through corrective action plans. We will not work with those who don’t work to meet our standards. 

Supplier and Associate Education 
As we continue to foster strategic relationships with suppliers, we are committed to supplier and associate education. Our third party service provider conducts annual awareness and training sessions on all compliance standards in multiple countries around the world and uses one-on-one training in conjunction with compliance reviews and corrective action plans. Also, we assure that our associates fully understand and comply with our sourcing policies and procedures. We maintain policies and procedures which govern the consequences of non-compliance by associates or suppliers with our policies and procedures, including sourcing and labor standards. While we recognize that local customs and values profoundly influence individual judgments in many areas covered by these standards, we support the work of international agencies and organizations that seek to implement internationally recognized standards for labor practices. 

Supplier Qualification and Audit
Our list of qualified suppliers and factories is established and maintained in reliance on specific qualification standards and protocols developed by us in conjunction with our third party service provider. First, our sourcing process includes a supplier verification procedure to prevent involvement with perceived high-risk suppliers. Once a supplier is verified, the relationship begins with a written master sourcing agreement wherein the supplier certifies that the factories that it contracts with and its own direct suppliers will strictly adhere to our Sourcing and Labor Standards, including those pertaining to slavery and human trafficking. Each supplier must agree to allow us, or an independent third party hired by us, to conduct an audit of the supplier’s business unannounced, without prior notice. Depending on the circumstances, a third party conducts announced or unannounced audits of each of our approved factories at least annually to ensure compliance. We may conduct more frequent reviews of suppliers located in countries designated as high risk by the U.S. State Department’s Trafficking In Persons Report. Exemptions from annual audits may be granted to highly compliant factories based on the previous year’s audit scores. 

Conflict Minerals
Express is committed to (1) compliance with the Conflict Minerals Rule that was adopted pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and (2) avoiding the use of Conflict Minerals which may directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups engaging in human rights abuses in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Conflict Minerals means columbite-tantalite (colton), cassiterite, gold, wolframite, and the derivatives tantalum, tin, and tungsten."	Yes

2. Labor and Human Rights, Human Trafficking and Slavery

At Flextronics we are committed to respecting the Labor and Human Rights of all our employees through the following principles which are clearly spelled out in our Flextronics Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (CoBCE).

				  Freely Chosen Employment. Our employees work in Flextronics at their own free will and are free to leave the Company upon reasonable notice under the terms of their labor contract. Our employment contracts are voluntary agreements and are free from forced, bonded, any form of slavery or involuntary imprisonment jobs. We will ensure that any risk of human trafficking is mitigated at our operations and at our supply chain. 

				  Prohibitions on child labor. We will comply with all appropriate local and international regulations on the restriction on the employment of child labor. 

				  Fair compensation, wages and benefits. We will ensure that the compensation and benefits for our employees comply or exceed the minimum legal requirements of the country where employees are employed.

				  Equal opportunity for all without discrimination. We will ensure our hiring, compensation, training, promotion, termination and retirement policies and practices do not discriminate on the basis of race, caste, national origin, religion, age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, union membership or political affiliation. 

				  Zero tolerance policies for harassment and abuse. We will not tolerate any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse against employees, suppliers or vendors. 

				  Freedom of Engagement with Management. We will provide the means for employees to freely voice their concerns and opinions and to engage with management without fear of reprisals and retribution. We will respect employees' engagement rights in accordance with local laws. 

				  Health and Safety. We are committed to providing a healthy and safe working place for all. 

3. Corporate Sustainability Management System

The diagram to the left summarizes our PLAN_DO_CHECK_ACT management system for corporate sustainability. Specially, the process involves:

3.1 Creating Awareness

Educate site leaders on Flextronics’ Corporate Sustainability program, including Flextronics’ labor and human rights policy, before they train the site operations personnel.

3.2 Employee Training

Site management disseminates Corporate Sustainability-related information and requirements to all employees.

3.3 Audit

Ensure successful gap closure.

3.4 Program Assesment

Carry out site-based assessments to identify gaps.

3.5 Competency/Certification

Sites are certified for demonstrating compliance to the standards.

3.6 Gap Remediation

Sites implement measures necessary to close identified gaps.

 

Gap Remediation



4. Compliance with Freely Chosen Employment (including Human Trafficking and Slavery) To date, we’ve audited all of our sites and all sites are found to be in compliance with our Freely Chosen Employment policy: “Our employees work in Flextronics at their own free will and are free to leave the Company upon reasonable notice under the terms of their labor contract. Our employment contracts are voluntary agreements and are free from forced, bonded, any form of slavery or involuntary imprisonment jobs. We will ensure that any risk of human trafficking is mitigated at our operations and at our supply chain.”

5. Flextronics Supplier Corporate Sustainability Program

The due diligence process for supply chain compliance is encapsulated in the four key areas shown in the diagram below:

				  The first, and most important area, focuses on “People”. Besides training our own people, we provide online training, via the Flextronics Supplier Information web site, for our suppliers on Flextronics’ processes and expectations before they undergo our Corporate Sustainability assessment program. 

				  The second key area highlights our stringent supply chain program conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct and our labor and human rights policy, including Freely Chosen Employment. 

				  The third column defines our physical auditing process that consists of two parts: a self-assessment (SAQ) to be completed by suppliers and a physical audit. As Flextronics works with thousands of suppliers, almost all of which are sourced and approved by our customers, it is impossible to physically audit all of them. As such, the decision on whether or not to audit, and the type and scope of audit, is based on several factors. These factors include Flextronics involvement in approving/qualifying the supplier, the level of trust we have with the supplier, and careful analysis of the SAQ. Audits are conducted by Flextronics employees and are generally announced. 

				  Finally, we complete the CSER risk validation through metrics management and identifying corrective actions carried out by the supplier. By early 2012, we intend to add key metrics to our integrated Supplier Rating System (SRS) to ensure CSER improvements within our global supply chain. 

 

 

5.1. Flextronics Supplier Code of Conduct Compliance Program

5.1.1. Compliance Process

Flextronics has integrated elements of the Flextronics Supplier Code of Conduct into the Supplier Qualification Process.

The Flextronics Supplier Qualification process covers several key aspects: Business, Quality Systems, Operations, Design, Product and Process Environmental Compliance, Supply Chain Security and Corporate Sustainability.

As illustrated in the pie chart, 37 per cent of questions asked in the audit revolve around Corporate Sustainability and “Product & Process Environmental Compliance”, demonstrating Flextronics’ commitment to supply chain Corporate Sustainability compliance.

 

Compliance Process

5.1.2. Due Diligence Process

A comprehensive due diligence process is used to identify high risk suppliers and high risk areas in the suppliers’ premises. It is also used to drive corrective actions in order to eliminate identified deficiencies. The due diligence process consists of supplier training on process expectations, a supplier self- assessment, a risk-based onsite audit to identify both critical and non- critical findings, and an integrated supplier corrective action process. Flextronics may conduct a follow-up onsite audit to verify the supplier’s correction action plan (CAP) implementation.

 



5.1.4. Compliance with Freely Chosen Employment (including Human Trafficking and Slavery)

To date, all the suppliers audited are in compliance with our Freely Chosen Employment policy: “Our employees work in Flextronics at their own free will and are free to leave the Company upon reasonable notice under the terms of their labor contract. Our employment contracts are voluntary agreements and are free from forced, bonded, any form of slavery or involuntary imprisonment jobs. We will ensure that any risk of human trafficking is mitigated at our operations and at our supply chain.”

5.1.3. Due Diligence Assessment

An independent audit team from the Global Procurement Organization is tasked to carry out Corporate Sustainability due diligence assessments of high risk suppliers.

Flextronics’ Corporate Sustainability Supplier Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) requires suppliers to answer 91 questions covering areas such as Labor, Ethics, Environment, Health, Production Processes, Material and Finished Goods Stores, Inspection Areas, Dormitories, Wash Rooms and Canteen. Audit results are evaluated and scored based on pre-defined criterion in order to eliminate any subjective findings. Each question asked during the self-assessment or on-site audit are assigned a 5-point grade scale, with 1 representing the lowest score and 5 as the best. 3 is the passing mark.

While we do not require suppliers to separately certify that materials incorporated into products comply with trafficking and forced labor laws, successfully passing Flextronics’ assessment and being qualified to provide products to Flextronics indicates that Flextronics sourced and approved suppliers comply with such regulations.

If suppliers are found to have any deficiencies, they will be requested to implement a CAP within a specified time frame. Our Global Procurement audit team will then monitor the CAP progress closely. Armed with a comprehensive evaluation system, we are able to generate statistics on the various audited attributes and rank suppliers based on their performance and CAP implementation."	Yes
115	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires certain companies manufacturing or selling products in the State of California to disclose their efforts (if any) to eradicate forced labor and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for goods they offer for sale.

Forced labor and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor. The Kroger Co. and its affiliated companies doing business in California, including Ralphs Grocery Company, Food 4 Less, Foods Co. and Quik Stop (collectively, “Kroger”), have a zero-tolerance policy for both forced labor and child labor used in the manufacture of all products that they sell.

I. Certification

In order to work with Kroger, vendors and their contractors in the U.S. and other countries are expected to operate in a manner that respects the rights of people and to abide by Kroger’s Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct requires that vendors and their contractors who provide products to Kroger not engage in any labor practices that violate the laws and regulations of the country where the products are manufactured or assembled and not engage in any unsanitary or unsafe labor conditions. This Code of Conduct, which follows the U.S. Department of Labor regulations and the Fair Labor Standards Act, provides, among other things, that Kroger’s suppliers and its contractors may not use or support child, indentured, involuntary, or prison labor in the manufacture of the products sold to Kroger.

The Kroger Code of Conduct is an integral part of the Kroger Standard Vendor Agreement, Kroger Purchase Orders, Import Letters of Credit, and Kroger’s form Services and Consulting Agreements.

II. Verification and Audit

Vendors and their contractors must maintain written records evidencing compliance with the provisions of the Code of Conduct and must make those records available to Kroger upon request.

Kroger directly imports general merchandise for sale under its private labels; Kroger requires 100% of all foreign plants that supply these Kroger private label products and its suppliers of foreign farmed or caught seafood to certify compliance with Kroger’s Code of Conduct. This may include providing Kroger with a copy of a third party audit, which may be announced or unannounced, evidencing compliance with the Code of Conduct, including its child and forced labor prohibitions.

The Company is a member of various trade associations that audit their members for social responsibility matters. Fred Meyer and Littman Jewelers, affiliates of The Kroger Co., are certified members of the Responsible Jewelry Council (RJC). Fred Meyer Jewelers was the first U.S.-based retailer to achieve this distinction. The RJC is a non-profit organization recognized as a world leader in protecting consumer confidence in the jewelry industry. It verifies that members operate with responsible ethical, human rights, social and environmental practices.

III. Training

Category Managers in the General Merchandise department receive annual training on the Code of Conduct, which includes updates and discussions of child labor laws and their importance in sourcing goods.

IV. Enforcement

Any employee who fails to abide by the forced and child labor provisions of Kroger’s Code of Conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination. Kroger may terminate its relationship with a vendor found to be using child or forced labor to produce products that it sells (or attempts to sell) to Kroger. That vendor will also be subject to damages resulting from breach of its agreement with Kroger."	Yes
116	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act



Foot Locker supports the goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. We outline our actions to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chains below:



Foot Locker reserves the right to make periodic, unannounced inspections of our private label suppliers' facilities to verify each supplier’s compliance with our Global Sourcing Guidelines and other requirements. Such on-site inspections are conducted by our internal team or by a third party company, and Foot Locker reserves the right to terminate the relationship with any supplier who fails to comply with our requirements. Private label suppliers affirm that, by accepting orders from Foot Locker, they will manufacture products in accordance with local labor and employment laws, under working conditions that meet certain standards, and without the use of forced labor."	Yes
117	"California’s Transparency in Supply Chains Law

Beginning in 2012, many companies manufacturing or selling products in the state of California are required to disclose their efforts (if any) to address the issue of forced labor and human trafficking, per the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657). This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by companies, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Forced labor and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor. Our Policy Letter 24: Code of Human Rights, Basic Working Conditions and Corporate Responsibility, makes it clear that we will not tolerate forced labor or child labor in our operations and we conduct internal audits of our manufacturing locations to ensure compliance We have instituted a number of actions to safeguard against human rights abuses, including forced labor in our supply chain. For example:

We regularly assess risk related to human trafficking and forced labor associated with our supply base. Our preliminary assessment is based upon geography, the commodity purchased, the level of manual labor required for part/assembly production, the supplier’s ownership structure, supplier quality performance and the nature of the business transaction. This risk assessment is performed by Ford with input from external stakeholders.

Our Global Terms and Conditions forbid the use of forced labor, child labor and physically abusive disciplinary practices. Our definition of forced labor is inclusive of trafficking, and this was made explicit in the 2012 revisions to our Policy Letter 24: Code of Human Rights, Basic Working Conditions and Corporate Responsibility. Ford’s purchase orders require suppliers to certify compliance with our prohibition of forced labor, child labor and physical disciplinary abuse as part of our Global Terms and Conditions that govern the purchase by Ford of goods and services from suppliers. We reserve the right to terminate our relationship with a supplier if issues of noncompliance with our policies are discovered and/or noncompliance is not addressed in a timely manner.

We conduct training and capability building. 

We regularly conduct internal training on our Policy Letter 24: Code of Human Rights, Basic Working Conditions and Corporate Responsibility with our Global Purchasing staff, including management and supplier quality teams. Additional training is conducted regarding our Supply Chain Sustainability Program, including coverage of the Code and our Global Working Conditions Program, emphasizing the role of our buyers and supplier quality engineers in responsible decision making.

Ford requires suppliers in high-risk markets to attend training that increases awareness of Ford’s requirements and legal requirements, including those related to forced labor and child labor. The training enables management systems that will ensure compliance over time. We conduct this training at Ford where necessary but increasingly with other automakers in the industry through the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) or CSR Europe.

Ford and other automakers at the AIAG have funded and created a training for buyers and supply chain managers on supply chain sustainability. This training addresses issues including supply chain risk assessments, policy and supplier contract development and other actions that can be taken to ensure that forced labor and child labor do not enter the automotive supply chain. 

We regularly conduct audits of at-risk Tier 1 supplier factories to monitor compliance with Ford expectations and legal requirements. These audits are independent and announced. We choose which facilities to audit based upon our risk assessment as described above. Following audits, suppliers are required to complete corrective action plans, which Ford reviews and approves. The corrective action plans outline how a supplier will resolve issues uncovered in audits and include clear responsibility and timelines for completion. We continue to regularly work with the supplier to resolve the identified issues – and, depending on the severity of the issue identified, we will return to the facility within 12 months to confirm resolution. Our supply chain work has demonstrated to us that the risk for issues such as forced labor and child labor (as well as other human rights and working conditions issues) are relatively low for Tier 1 suppliers. The risk increases, however, the further down the tiers of suppliers toward the source of the raw materials. Ford does not have visibility or direct access to these suppliers for the purpose of verification, and thus we work with our Tier 1 suppliers as well as other industries, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments to explore the options for appropriate validation systems."

120	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires retailers and manufacturers, who conduct business in California and have gross worldwide sales over $100 million, to disclose their ongoing efforts to eliminate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chain.

1. Fortinet’s Supply Chain Verification

 Fortinet is committed to eliminating human trafficking and slavery from our supply chain. All suppliers must conduct themselves honestly and ethically in order to work with us. If Fortinet has actual knowledge of any unethical behavior, we will investigate the issue in our supply chain. Fortinet does not routinely engage any third party to verify compliance within our supply chain. Suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when engaged by Fortinet.

2. Fortinet’s Supply Chain Audits

 Fortinet’s standard manufacturing agreement gives us the right to conduct unannounced audits for human trafficking issues. If Fortinet has actual knowledge of noncompliance, we use due diligence in investigating and resolving the issue. Fortinet does not routinely engage any third party to conduct independent or unannounced audits of our supply chain.

		Fortinet’s Direct Supplier Certification 

				  Fortinet’s policy is to require all of our direct suppliers to agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations for all work they perform with Fortinet. This is often accomplished by including compliance language in the contract or purchase order. Additionally, Fortinet’s standard manufacturing agreement includes specific language prohibiting human trafficking and giving us the right to unannounced audits. 

				  If Fortinet discovers any supplier is out of compliance, it is considered a breach of contract. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the issue is corrected by the supplier. If the supplier is unable to correct the problem within a reasonable time, Fortinet will use our discretion to take disciplinary action, including terminating the business relationship with the supplier. 

		Fortinet’s Accountability Standards

122	"The Way We Trade

Our 'Trading Fairly' Program

We buy and sell our products responsibly so our customers can know that everything they buy is produced under decent conditions and everyone involved is treated fairly. We support our suppliers and expect them to meet high labor, health and safety standards for their employees, as set out in our Ethical Trading Code of Practice. Our Code of Practice is based on International and National Labor Laws, as well as the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Codes (http://www.ethicaltrade.org).

We don't just rely on our suppliers to be knowledgeable about ethical trading topics, but we have built internal programs that ensure we understand the risks for non-conformances related to worker health and safety, human trafficking, child and slave labor issues. We created a program that utilizes our vast international networks of knowledgeable partners internally and externally. We are working proactively to address opportunities and increase the awareness of issues within our supply chain.

How do we assess and verify the ethical conditions of workers in our supply chain? 

Suppliers are required to complete a self-assessment which is based on a third-party system, to determine the likelihood of an issue to exist. This is based on their country of operation, type of product they produce and completion of a detailed questionnaire.

Suppliers who receive a high-risk rating will be required to undergo an audit. These audits are completed by a recognized, independent third-party auditing company. The audits are generally announced but may be unannounced depending on supplier history, country of operation or known industry issues.

Supplier purchasing agreements and terms of conditions are in place with all of our direct suppliers which require them to comply with all of our codes of practices, as well as all applicable laws and regulations.

We facilitate a transparent and open learning environment by ensuring that our suppliers, buyers, technical teams and management are trained on the relevant issues and how to identify and resolve them if they arise.

We have a mechanism to monitor compliance internally and within our direct supply chain, as well as commercial consequences if non-conformances are found.

We look for opportunities to participate in best practice building and working with government and non-government organizations to understand and minimize issues arising."	Yes
123	"California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 Mandatory Disclosure 

Chiquita Brands International, Inc., and its affiliated companies (""Chiquita""), recognize the atrocities of slavery and human trafficking which continue to exist in our society.  In compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, and in an effort to help eradicate these atrocities, Chiquita has taken certain steps to ensure that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.

First, Chiquita engages in the verification of its supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery through a variety of means:

* Agreements with Chiquita's suppliers typically require suppliers to certify that they do not use child labor, they do not use forced or mandatory labor, they do not violate workers' right of free association and collective bargaining, and that materials comply with all applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.  Chiquita is undertaking a review of our contracts, and formulating a plan to ensure such prohibitions are included in all supplier agreements.

* Chiquita's Sourcing Strategy, applicable to its vendors and suppliers, requires those entities to self-verify that employees are free to leave their workplace after their scheduled work hours and are free to terminate their employment after reasonable notice. 

* Chiquita's Code of Conduct is incorporated into its contracts with vendors and suppliers and demands compliance with ILO Conventions 29 and 104 prohibiting forced labor and slavery. Through these yearly contractual agreements our suppliers certify that they are in compliance with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in their respective countries.  

* All Chiquita–owned farms and many of Chiquita's independent banana and pineapple growers are certified by the Rainforest Alliance and SA8000 as being compliant with antislavery and forced labor provisions.  The Rainforest Alliance is an international, non-profit, environmental organization whose mission includes promoting worker welfare and community well-being. Compliance with the ILO Conventions and the UN Declaration of Human Rights, specifically prohibitions against forced labor, is mandatory. SA8000, developed by Social Accountability International, provides standards based on national laws, international human rights norms, and the conventions of the ILO. These standards include a strict prohibition against forced labor. 

These verifications are in process and are being evaluated to ensure maximum effort is geared towards mitigating the risk of human trafficking and slavery. That being said, these verifications are conducted by Chiquita, by the suppliers and vendors, and, with regard to Chiquita-owned farms and many banana and pineapple growers, by the Rainforest Alliance and SA 8000 authorized independent auditors. 

Second, Chiquita conducts random audits and on-site verifications of suppliers and growers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains.  These audits are conducted by Chiquita and we are in the process of contracting with an Independent Contractor to perform additional on-site verifications.

Third, Chiquita requires suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.  As outlined above, agreements with those suppliers require them to certify that they comply with those laws; vendors and suppliers must certify that employees are free to leave the workplace after scheduled work hours and may terminate their employment with reasonable notice; and Chiquita’s Code of Conduct prohibition against forced labor and slavery is incorporated into all vendor and supplier contracts.

Fourth, Chiquita maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding prohibition against slavery and trafficking.  If suppliers/contractors violate Chiquita's Code of Conduct in this regard, Chiquita is entitled to suspend its purchases of goods or services from that supplier/contractor.  Chiquita maintains a zero-tolerance policy for violations of Chiquita's standards regarding prohibiting slavery and human trafficking by its employees.

Finally, Chiquita provides annual training to all company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management. This training includes information on human trafficking and slavery and recognizing and mitigating risks within the supply chains.

The need to evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and slavery in our product supply chain has long been part of our commitment to Corporate Responsibility and will remain a critical aspect of our supplier management. We will continue to require our suppliers, vendors, and employees to comply with Chiquita’s prohibition against slavery and human trafficking."	Yes

125	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) will require companies that sell goods in California to make certain disclosures regarding their efforts to address slavery and human trafficking. The law is primarily intended to ensure consumers have access to detailed information about the human rights practices behind the production of goods that they buy, to assist in buying decisions. Fruit of the Loom, Inc. and our global affiliates, have a strong, comprehensive social compliance program, with a progressive Code of Conduct which includes third party monitoring. We do not tolerate human rights abuses of any kind.

Our company’s Code of Conduct, available here, reflects our core operating principles, emphasizing respect for people and adherence to laws and ethical standards. We believe that workers at our facilities and our suppliers’ facilities have the right to freely choose employment, and the right to a workplace free from abuse, harassment and unlawful discrimination.

Slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor and forced labor. To ensure we only do business with firms that share our principles, we screen contractors and use independent third party monitoring firms to conduct extensive assessments throughout our supply chain. Specifically, our program includes:

Supplier Screenings

As part of our contractor selection process, the company performs preliminary screenings, to identify areas of risk and weaknesses in social compliance policies and practices.

Supplier Verification and Audits

Our verification and audit program is designed to evaluate suppliers’ compliance with our Code of Conduct on an annual basis through the use of onsite assessments conducted by third party monitoring firms. In addition to the annual audits, the Fair Labor Association conducts assessments of a sampling of our facilities throughout the year. A finding of noncompliance with our Code of Conduct and other audit criteria relating to forced labor or child labor may be based on a supplier’s failure to adequately document compliance, even if no actual forced labor or child labor violation has occurred. An audit that discloses serious violations or weaknesses in a supplier’s policy or practices regarding forced labor and child labor may lead to suspension or termination of our business with the supplier. We have zero tolerance for forced labor and child labor. If any such practices are revealed in assessments, we require suppliers to rectify the problem, and, if they fail to do so, we immediately terminate the business relationship for a period of no less than 12 months.

Internal Accountability Standards and Corrective Action Plans

Following assessments, suppliers are required to complete corrective action plans, which are subject to our review and approval. These plans outline how a supplier intends to resolve and prevent future occurrence of issues revealed in assessments. As appropriate, our auditors conduct a follow-up audit at the facility to check progress on the corrective action plan and confirm resolution of any child labor or forced labor issues.

Supplier Agreements

Our supplier and contractor agreements and purchase order terms require compliance with international standards and applicable laws and regulations regarding forced labor and child labor, as specified in our Code of Conduct. 

Our Partners

We collaborate with a number of nongovernmental organizations to raise awareness of social compliance issues, particularly child labor and forced labor matters. We regularly monitor reports and follow the developments of leading NGOs in this field, such as the Fair Labor Association, ILO/IFC Better Work Program, FUNDAHRSE and Fundemas.

Material Certification

As a part of supplier screenings, our authorized suppliers of components and our manufacturing contractors are required to sign a contract that commits them to adhere to our Code of Conduct, including its prohibitions on the use of Forced Labor, and to sign separate Acknowledgments that they understand and will comply with same. Each partner producing cotton apparel for the company is required to sign a statement confirming Uzbek cotton was not used in production of our goods. The United States Department of State has identified the widespread use of forced labor and child labor in the cotton sector of that country.

Training and Awareness

Our Code of Conduct specifically prohibits forced labor, slave labor and human trafficking, and is distributed annually to employees and contractors. Our Code of Conduct is translated into 31 languages. Our contractors are required to sign acknowledgments that they have read and posted our Code of Conduct, and verifying they have communicated its terms and provided training to their employees. Our third party monitors are experts in recognizing and detecting forced labor, slave labor and human trafficking practices and conditions."	Yes

Fry's Electronics, Inc. makes this disclosure pursuant to The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, a law which is designed to increase the amount of information manufacturers and retailers make publicly available regarding their efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking. Fry's has taken strides to eradicate any such conduct from its supply chains in order to provide our customers with quality products free from the taint of slavery and human trafficking. 

For example: 

Vendor/Supplier Agreements 

Fry's standard purchasing agreement with new vendors contains a provision requiring them to certify compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Suppliers agreeing to this provision must now specifically certify that materials incorporated into their products and sold to Fry's comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which they do business. 

Company Verification 

Fry's strives to establish close working relationships with its suppliers. The company does not employ or rely on third parties to verify its product supply chains in order to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. 

Audits 

Because many of Fry's suppliers are located out of the country, and Fry's does not have foreign offices, Fry's does not conduct onsite audits of its suppliers. Many of Fry's vendors have their own codes of conduct and auditing programs in place to ensure they are working to eliminate human trafficking and slavery. 

Management Training and Accountability 

In addition to the requirements placed on our vendors, Fry's communicates its commitment to elimination of forced labor to applicable employees in its own workforce. Fry's will promptly address and remedy any circumstances of which it becomes aware of employees who fail to meet Fry's standards regarding forced labor."	Yes

GameStop is committed to conducting its business on the principles of integrity and sound business ethics. We are also committed to holding our manufacturers, vendors and suppliers to these same principles, which include taking measures to ensure that parties we do business with maintain basic labor and human rights standards for their workers.

To this end, GameStop has established a Code of Conduct to which each contract manufacturer for exclusive-branded products must adhere. The Code of Conduct represents GameStop's commitment to source this merchandise from persons and firms that strive to maintain comprehensive corporate responsibility programs and adhere to GameStop's expectations regarding human trafficking, forced labor and a variety of other important issues. Specifically, our Code of Conduct prohibits these manufacturers from utilizing any form of forced labor, whether in the form of child labor, prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor or otherwise. Manufacturers we contract with who fail to meet these standards would be in breach of our agreement. We also require manufacturers we contract with to ensure their subcontractors adhere to our Code of Conduct.

Members of our direct import and merchandising teams personally visit the factories where our exclusive-branded products are produced. In addition, we have in the past, and will continue to in the future, engage a third party to perform scheduled factory audits of our manufacturing vendors to ensure they are operating within the parameters of our Code of Conduct. These audits will continue on a periodic basis for as long as we do business with each of these manufacturers.

In addition to the above, each contract manufacturer is required to independently maintain sufficient documentation of its compliance with our Code of Conduct. GameStop will quickly investigate any reports of human trafficking anywhere in its supply chain, and will take swift action against any supplier that is found to have acted improperly. While contract manufacturers are not required to certify that all materials incorporated into the products they produce comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, both these suppliers and their subcontractors must adhere to the Code of Conduct and certify that all their operations are completely free of any form of child labor, prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor or otherwise.

In addition, all GameStop merchandising employees who maintain relationships with vendors are required to adhere to the GameStop Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct. The Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct requires all employees to observe high ethical standards in the performance of their jobs and in their relationships with customers, vendors, their community, and their coworkers. Failure by an employee to follow the standards set forth in the Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct may subject such employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment."

in Supply Chains Act of 2010 – Garmin’s Practices

Garmin‘s goal is to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. Garmin supports suppliers who share our belief that fair labor practices and safe working environments are an inherent part of human rights.

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect. This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by certain manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts, if any, to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking. Specifically, the Act requires certain manufactures and retail sellers to “disclose their efforts to eradicate human slavery and trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale.”

Garmin’s supply chain relies on sources of materials and labor all around the world. The raw materials used in our products are produced globally and our products are manufactured domestically and internationally. Garmin has a cross functional team of employees who have responsibility for supply chain management. We have taken a number of measures aimed at eradicating slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chain. First, Garmin has adopted a Supplier’s Code of Conduct that addresses issues such as maximum working hours, basic wage, respect, equality and restriction of forced labor, including those related to anti-slavery and human trafficking. Secondly, Garmin requires that its suppliers and entities throughout its supply chain comply with all applicable laws, regulations and international labor and human rights standards. Finally, Garmin factories are subject to periodic compliance audits by many of our distributors and other resellers so that they can confirm our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and international labor and human rights standards."

Genentech has requested that all key suppliers that supply materials for use in our products comply with the Roche Supplier Code of Conduct, or an equivalent code of conduct. Genentech is in the process of ensuring that all suppliers have equivalent code or agree to the Roche Supplier Code of Conduct.

The Roche Supplier Code of Conduct provides, among other things, that our suppliers may not use any form of child, involuntary, or slave labor in the manufacture of the goods that are incorporated into products that we sell. We have the right to audit our suppliers and we conduct or use third parties to conduct routine announced audits of suppliers on a periodic basis. These audits look at numerous issues, including issues related to child, involuntary or slave labor in the supply chain. If any supplier is found to have used child, involuntary, or slave labor in the manufacture of products supplied to us, we will cancel all outstanding orders with such supplier. Because of the overwhelmingly positive response to Genentech's request that vendors comply with the Code, we have not required independent certifications of compliance. 

We have conducted internal training on issues related to child, involuntary and slave labor with all of our global sourcing staff who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, as well as certain other management personnel and product buyers. Any employee who fails to abide by our procedures regarding forced labor will be subject to disciplinary action, including potential termination."	Yes

Verifies our product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery

GE’s Ethical Supply Chain program is multifaceted and risk-based. All suppliers must agree to comply with GE’s Supplier Expectations as part of our contracting process, including specific prohibitions against forced, prison or indentured labor as well as against subjecting workers to any form of compulsion, coercion or human trafficking, and the expectation is that they will hold their own suppliers to similar standards.



1 GE 2014 Sustainability Report

Suppliers are prioritized for detailed pre-engagement and subsequent periodic on-site assessments according to relevant country risks, supplier past performance and other factors, such as whether in the course of GE’s relationship with a supplier or otherwise, GE has become aware of any reason to believe that the supplier is not living up to our expectations. Almost all of our on-site assessments are conducted in developing countries, as part of our overall supplier-management strategy, but we maintain an “eyes always open” policy to be alert to potential violations of our standards in interactions with our suppliers.

Conducts audits to evaluate supplier compliance with Company prohibitions against human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain When on-site audits are required by our Supplier Responsibility program, they are conducted by GE personnel using a global questionnaire and risk-weighted metrics. GE uses a combination of specially trained internal auditors, sourcing personnel and third-party firms specially instructed in GE standards to perform verification and auditing procedures. Audits are repeated on a one- to three-year basis, depending on factors that include performance on past audits. Audits are supplemented by periodic spot-checks and anonymous desk-side reviews of GE audit records by inspectors from other business units or from our corporate EHS team. While audits are not unannounced, they are supplemented by “eyes always open” reviews when suppliers’ facilities are visited by GE sourcing personnel.

Requires suppliers to certify that their products comply with local laws and regulations regarding slavery and human trafficking Before GE enters into contracts with suppliers, they must agree in writing to comply with all relevant local laws and regulations, GE policies and the specific requirements of the GE Supplier Expectations, including specific prohibitions against forced, prison or indentured labor as well as against subjecting workers to any form of compulsion, coercion or human trafficking.

Maintains detailed accountability standards and procedures for suppliers that fail to meet Company standards regarding slavery and trafficking GE records all audit findings from on-site inspections in an automated audit tracking tool and monitors each until the audit finding is closed pursuant to evidence that the defect has been corrected. Typically, findings must be closed within 60 days. Purchase orders are suspended if findings remain open beyond this time frame, unless GE agrees that a closure requires more time, interim progress has been demonstrated and/or the delay has been approved by the corporate-level team that administers the Supplier Responsibility program. Labor-related findings, such as the presence of child labor or coerced labor, ordinarily result in immediate cessation of business relationships.

Trains relevant employees in procedures to prevent human trafficking and slavery

GE has specially trained more than 700 GE team members to execute the audits that support GE’s Supplier Responsibility initiative. More than 3,500 GE employees who interact with suppliers have undergone GE’s training in Supplier Expectations, human rights issues and on-site due-diligence requirements.

As part of our commitment to respecting human rights in our supply chain, we are leaders in the AIM-PROGRESS Responsible Sourcing Forum, whose mission is to promote responsible sourcing by sharing best practices and promoting efficiency in the packaged goods supply chain.

We also are signatories to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).

Our Supplier Code of Conduct details requirements of our suppliers.

Expectations

We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the same level of compliance expectations focused on four pillars: human rights, health and safety, environmental compliance and business integrity. 

Our Workplace Standards and Ethical Sourcing Policy, along with our Supplier Code of Conduct, set standards for our company, suppliers and other business partners regarding the protection of human rights.

These standards are based in part on the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

Progress

In 2015, we joined the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX), and updated our Supplier Code of Conduct to include General Mills’ mandatory requirements related to responsible sourcing.

We use third-party auditing firms to conduct independent audits of our suppliers. All instances of noncompliance found during audits are remediated – either resolved or are actively being addressed in an agreed-upon corrective action plan. 

In addition, in 2014: 

We completed 68 audits of our finished goods facilities and will now be working through our list of 200 at-risk suppliers to develop strategies for mitigating risks. 

Our eight General Mills-owned facilities in North America were audited, and all were compliant.

Guided by the 1998 Declaration, General Mills respects the principles of collective bargaining and freedom of association, and prohibition of discrimination, child labor and forced labor – including that associated with human trafficking.

133	"SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY

Supply chains built on strong, transparent and trusted partnerships are critical to ensuring product quality, availability and affordability for our customers. These partnerships are vital to improving our business competitiveness and lowering business risks. They also position us as a customer of choice, helping us transform transportation by working with our suppliers to find solutions for challenges we face in our industry. And as with any successful relationship, a strong supply chain is also built on the values of integrity and accountability. GM strives to ensure that the suppliers in its supply chain share these values.

To learn more, click here.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires certain manufacturers doing business in California to disclose information about their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. General Motors’ supply chain is extraordinarily complex, involving many tiers of suppliers that directly or indirectly supply raw materials, components and services from locations across the globe to GM’s global facilities. This supply chain complexity frequently prohibits GM from engaging with each supplier in its supply chain. Nonetheless, GM engages its direct suppliers, employees and contractors, and is deeply involved in industry wide activities through Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), including training development, funding, and identification of high-risk suppliers, in addition to other activities to help eliminate slavery and human trafficking from GM’s supply chain.

Our General Terms and Conditions forbid our suppliers, and their subsuppliers, from using forced labor

GM expects our suppliers to be fair, humane and lawful employers, and to enforce similar requirements from their sub-suppliers. These expectations are outlined in GM’s standard purchase contract terms and conditions, which reinforce our zero-tolerance policy against the use of child labor, abusive treatment of employees or corrupt business practices in the supply of goods and services to GM.  

The relevant part of Paragraph 31 of GM’s General Terms and Conditions (and the predecessor clause), applicable to all contracts with GM’s direct suppliers, provides: 

31. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

Seller, and any goods or services supplied by Seller, will comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, conventions, ordinances or standards of the country(ies) of destination or that relate to the manufacture, labeling, transportation, importation, exportation, licensing, approval or certification of the goods or services, including, without limitation, those relating to environmental matters, the handling and transportation of dangerous goods or hazardous materials, data protection and privacy, wages, hours and conditions of employment, subcontractor selection, discrimination, occupational health/safety and motor vehicle safety. Seller further represents that neither it nor any of its subcontractors, vendors, agents or other associated third parties will utilize child, slave, prisoner or any other form of forced or involuntary labor, or engage in abusive employment or corrupt business practices, in the supply of goods or provision of services under this Contract. 

Our suppliers are required to certify compliance with applicable laws

GM’s terms and conditions also require suppliers to provide written certification of their compliance with GM’s requirements that prohibit the use of forced or involuntary labor, and GM periodically conducts supplier compliance surveys to confirm compliance. This certification process supports GM’s efforts to verify its product supply chain and to evaluate the risk of human trafficking and slavery. GM has not historically conducted third party verification of its supply chain, nor does GM audit suppliers’ compliance with standards relating to human trafficking and slavery.

We assess supply chain risk related to human trafficking and force labor

GM requires its direct first tier suppliers to validate the component parts for which GM contracts and to also validate the processes used by the supplier to manufacture the parts. This validation process is to confirm that the parts and the processes used by the supplier satisfy relevant quality and manufacturing criteria. Through this validation process, GM employees and contractors are able to assess the risk of slavery and human trafficking associated with the supplier’s manufacturing operations.

We endorse industry principles and support training to address supply chain risk related to human trafficking and forced labor

In the automotive industry generally, it is difficult to engage directly with all levels of the supply chain with respect to slavery and human trafficking. GM, together with other major original equipment manufacturers, collaborate through AIAG to address issues impacting the entire industry, including slavery and human trafficking. GM employees maintain leadership positions in AIAG, and GM provides direct financial support to AIAG. Further, GM endorses Automotive Industry Action Group’s Corporate Responsibility Guidance Statements, which provide guidance on business ethics, global working conditions and environmental responsibility, including guidelines generally prohibiting slavery and human trafficking.

Moreover, direct supply chain training is an integral component to GM’s efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from the supply chain. GM, through AIAG, provides training to its suppliers and employees regarding human trafficking and slavery, including fundamental principles of responsible working conditions. The training reinforces the shared expectations of GM and other participating AIAG auto company members, all of which contribute to developing the content of the training. Training participants review the areas of child labor, forced labor, freedom of association, harassment and discrimination, health and safety, wages and benefits, and working hours. The training is provided to suppliers in high-risk areas at no cost to the supplier. In 2015, GM plans to require each of its employees in the supply chain and supplier quality functions that are responsible for physically attending supply chain facilities to complete AIAG training.

GM maintains relevant internal policies and procedures

GM has in place several internal and external polices that are relevant to anti-slavery and human trafficking policies. Winning With Integrity, GM’s code of conduct, applies to GM employees and also, in certain instances, to individuals who represent GM such as consultants, agents, sales representatives, distributors, independent contractors, and contract workers. The basic tenets of GM’s code of conduct, require GM employees and representatives to exercise accountability and integrity in conducting GM’s business. In addition, the code of conduct requires employees to comply with all applicable laws, including any applicable law prohibiting slavery and human trafficking. On a yearly basis, GM requires its salaried employees to certify their awareness of and compliance with the Winning With Integrity code of conduct. Employees who violate GM’s code of conduct are subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. GM also has an anti-harassment policy that strives to keep the work environment free from intimidation and harassment by broadly prohibiting abusive behavior.  

GM also maintains procedures for reporting potential safety concerns, potential misconduct, and concerns about potential ethical violations. The GM Awareline in North America allows employees and others to report concerns of misconduct by the company, its management, supervisors, employees, or agents. Reports can be made 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by phone, web, email, postal service or fax. Individuals filing reports on the GM Awareline can remain anonymous and calls and messages are never recorded or traced. A link to access information for GM’s Awareline is: https://www.awareline.com/index.htm

Finally, individuals who raise concerns in good faith are protected from retaliation by GM’s anti-retaliation policy. The policy prohibits any adverse action against an employee for reporting a safety concern or misconduct in good faith. Adverse actions can include threats, intimidation, harassment, discrimination, limiting career opportunities, or termination."	Yes

Introduction 

Nestlé Nutrition, representing the Gerber and PowerBar brands, supports the goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and strives to be examples of good human rights and labor practices throughout our business activities. The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles are at the heart of our company’s culture, which has developed over the span of 140 years. Since Henri Nestlé first developed his successful infant cereal “Farine Lactée”, we have built our business on the conviction that to have long-term success for our shareholders, we not only have to comply with all applicable legal requirements and ensure that all our activities are sustainable, but additionally we have to create significant value for society.

Nestlé’s actions in this area include the following:

Product Supply Chains / Suppliers
In The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé commits to foster responsible practices in our supply chain. The Nestlé Supplier Code, which is accepted by our suppliers, helps to implement this commitment and establishes non-negotiable minimum standards for Nestlé suppliers in the areas of Health and Safety, Labor Standards, Business Integrity, and the Environment.

Nestlé is also a member of Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), a not for profit membership organization dedicated to driving improvements in responsible and ethical business practices in global supply chains. Sedex is currently being used by a number of leading retailers and brand manufacturers and over 15,000 sites are registered on Sedex. More information can be found at www.sedexglobal.com.

Supplier Audits
Nestlé reserves the right to verify our Supplier’s compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code. Nestlé confirms compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code through either a combination of third party certifications or a Responsible Sourcing Audit conducted by a third party. In the event that Nestlé becomes aware of any actions or conditions not in compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code, Nestlé reserves the right to demand corrective measures. Nestlé reserves the right to terminate an agreement with any supplier who does not comply with the Nestlé Supplier Code.

Human Rights in our business activities
As indicated in the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé fully supports the United Nations Global Compact’s (UNGC) guiding principles on human rights and labor, and aim to provide an example of good human rights’ and labor practices throughout our business activities.

Code of Business Conduct
Since the Company was founded, Nestlé’s business practices have been governed by integrity, honesty, fair dealing and full compliance with all applicable laws. Nestlé employees worldwide have upheld and lived this commitment in their every day responsibilities ever since, and Nestlé’s reputation remains one of the Company’s most important assets today.

The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles prescribe certain values and principles which Nestlé has committed to worldwide. This Code of Business Conduct specifies and helps the continued implementation of the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles by establishing certain nonnegotiable minimum standards of behavior in key areas.

Employee Training
The new version of The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles was provided to each of our 280,000 employees globally by the end of 2010 and accompanied by learning and training tools. Employees were asked to acknowledge that they had received and read The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles.

As of 2011, a modular training program was rolled out on the various components of the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles. The depth and focus of the trainings was established in accordance with the materiality for the different functions within the company.

The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles will continue to evolve and adapt to a changing world. Our basic foundation is unchanged from the time of the origins of the company, and reflects the basic ideas of fairness, honesty, and a general concern for people."	Yes
135	"CALIFORNIA  TRANSPARENCY IN  SUPPLY CHAINS ACT

Disclosure for Gildan’s Genuine Stewardship website

In 2010, the California Legislature passed a new law, The California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (SB 657), which requires manufacturers and retailers of goods with annual worldwide gross receipts over $100 million to provide consumers with information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.
Human trafficking can take many forms, including forced and child labour, as defined in the following ILO Conventions:

ILO Convention on Forced Labour, No. 29;

ILO Convention on Abolition of Forced Labour, No. 105;

ILO Conventions on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, No. 182. 

Gildan’s current Code of Conduct, which was launched in 2005 and updated in 2012, guides our activities at each of our operating locations and clearly states our position on a wide range of labour practices. 

This Code is based on the ILO conventions and its associated compliance benchmarks, which address forced labour, child labour, wages and benefits, working hours, harassment and abuse, as well as health and safety.

We monitor working conditions each year at all owned and contracted facilities manufacturing our products. As a company whose labour compliance program is accredited by the Fair Labor Association (FLA), Gildan facilities and the facilities of our manufacturing contractors are subject to the FLA’s rigorous monitoring, remediation and verification system. The FLA accredits monitors and uses internal auditors to conduct unannounced verifications.

Please read below for details on how Gildan complies with each points of the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act.

1. Company engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

Gildan evaluates the risks associated with its supply chain by evaluating contractors through its pre-sourcing assessment, which guides our business decisions and relationship with the manufacturing contractors we use.

These assessments are designed to ensure that, at a minimum, all facilities manufacturing our products comply with our own strict internal Code of Conduct, local and international laws, and the codes which we adhere to, including those of Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) and the FLA. All the aforementioned code and standards include strict provision with regards to forced and child labor such as human trafficking and slavery. When external suppliers are used, they must also adhere to these codes. This is a requirement for conducting business with Gildan.

To ensure that we meet or exceed our strict Code of Conduct requirements, we conduct a series of independent internal and third party audits each year, ensuring our commitment to responsibility for our employees, customers and other stakeholders. In 2012, 142 monitoring audits were performed. Of these, 90 were conducted by Gildan's internal auditors or by external auditors on Gildan's behalf, and 52 were conducted by external auditors or assessors for WRAP, the FLA, Better Work or by customers. For more information regarding Gildan’s auditing process, please refer to point 2 below.

2. Company conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.

Gildan audits all of its owned and contracted manufacturing facilities yearly. All Gildan audits are unannounced. The majority of the audits are conducted by our trained internal auditors and we also use independent third party auditors in some instances. We are also subject to audits from some of our customers.

Gildan audits its contractors’ facilities according to its Code of Conduct. Assessments are based on the standards in the Gildan Vendor Guidebook, which is provided to all our contractors. Our auditing and monitoring tools include:

Facility self-assessment questionnaire

Audit guidelines and management action plan

Management interview form

Monitoring guidelines

Worker interview guidelines

Gildan uses a sampling methodology, based on the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) guidelines, to determine the number of documents to be reviewed and the number of individuals to be interviewed.

Additionally, some of our contractors have been participating in the ILO Better Work Programme. Gildan’s manufacturing facilities, as well as its contractors, are also audited by the FLA, WRAP and customers. Please read the Social Compliance section of our website for more information.

3. Company requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

To ensure that Gildan’s major contractors and suppliers respect and enforce the Gildan Code of Conduct, we include a clause in the commercial agreement governing our contractual relationship which stipulates that contractors must abide by our Code. 

Gildan requires all business partners to confirm, by means of a signed statement, that they do not use or procure any cotton fiber, originating from Uzbekistan in any supplies of yarn to our organization or in the manufacturing of our products. 

4. Company maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

Non-compliances with the Gildan Code of Conduct can result in corrective action or termination, depending on the number of non-compliances found and their severity. Although Gildan will always first seek for sustainable remediation, we may terminate a business relationship with a contractor if it is deemed necessary. Our team of internal auditors work with contractors to develop action plans to resolve any instances of non-compliance.

5. Company provides company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within supply chains of products.

All Gildan direct employees are trained on the key elements of our Code of Conduct. At our Haitian third party sewing contractors, training on our Code of Conduct is provided on an ongoing basis to all new employees. Our internal monitoring teams continuously receive different types of training on social compliance and human rights issues. They also work closely with our management team and our contractors to ensure they are knowledgeable of our Code requirements and understand the issues linked to social compliance.

In 2012, Code of Conduct training sessions for supervisors, managers and compliance staff took place at four major contractors (two in China and two in Mexico) as well as two sourcing agencies in Korea. The presentation included information about the Code of Conduct provisions and examples of non-compliances to the Code, as well as remediation examples. Similar training sessions are planned during the course of 2013 at other contractors in Asia."	Yes
136	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Beginning on January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act required many companies doing business in the state to provide information regarding their activities to ensure their supply chain is free from slavery and human trafficking. 

GLOBALFOUNDRIES has instituted supply chain management practices that clearly communicate our expectations to suppliers. We stand committed to the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition© Code of Conduct (available at www.eicc.info) and its continuous pursuit of excellence in corporate responsibility and extension of responsible practices throughout the supply chain. The EICC Code specifically requires compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to ethics, labor and environmental health and safety, in addition to forbidding forced, bonded or indentured labor and child labor. In addition, our own Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct strictly forbid child labor and forced or compulsory labor practices. All employees must adhere to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct. Mandatory training is conducted for all employees. GLOBALFOUNDRIES takes compliance with these standards very seriously. As noted in the standards, ""depending on the nature, severity, and frequency of an employee's violation of these Standards or related Company policies or procedures, the Company will take appropriate corrective actions up to and including termination of employment."" 

The expectation to conform to the EICC Code is included in all facets of our supplier management process. Our standard contract templates, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, Global Supplier and Subcontractor Management Policy and material qualification procedures all require affected suppliers to conform to the EICC Code. These supplier management processes are developed and implemented by qualified and knowledgeable personnel with the appropriate skills and experience to successfully perform their responsibilities. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Global Supply Management staff has received training regarding the EICC Code, focused specifically on its supply chain elements. 

We survey our Tier 1 suppliers who represent top tier equipment, materials, and service providers to determine their risk of non-conformance with the EICC Code, including human trafficking and slavery risks. The results of our supplier assessment support our belief that there is a low risk of EICC non-conformance in our supply chain, and in particular we believe there is a very low risk of forced, involuntary or child labor. Therefore, at this time we are not conducting direct on-site supplier audits specific to this topic. However, compliance with the EICC Code is included in the audit questionnaire element of our Supplier Audit procedure. We believe these measures will continue to ensure an effective supply-chain CSR program.

137	"Disclosure: Transparency in Supply Chains Act

Beginning in 2012, many companies manufacturing or selling products in the state of California are required to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking within their direct supply chain. This disclosure is mandated by the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Senate Bill 657). The law is designed to increase information available regarding manufacturers and retailers efforts (if any) to address slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. Slavery can take many forms of forced labor, including child labor. Through this disclosure we are communicating our efforts to address the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our direct material supply chain.

Our efforts include:

Risk-based Assessment

We perform an assessment of the materials and countries of origin in our raw material supply chain. The baseline for the assessment is the U.S. Department of Labor's (DoL's) 2010 report listing ""goods from countries"" that the Bureau of International Labor Affairs has reason to believe are produced by forced labor, child labor or both, in violation of international standards. The risk assessment results indicate we use a small number of materials listed in the DoL report. Through our Supplier Certification (described below), we are working to mitigate the risks for those sourced materials listed in the DoL report.

Supplier Audits

We perform periodic supplier audits on an ongoing basis for validation of material quality and supplier conformance to certain regulatory requirements. All suppliers that certify to our Supplier Code of Conduct may be subject to human trafficking and slavery audits at any time. We do expect that our suppliers be strictly compliant with local laws.

Supplier Certification

We have a Supplier Code of Conduct (Code) which contains specific language regarding human rights and other workplace issues, as well as the right for us to perform human trafficking and slavery audits at any time. Beginning January 1, 2012, we will require our raw material suppliers with materials found on the DoL report to certify to our Code, or provide their own code of conduct that we must review and accept. We may decline to make future purchases from a supplier that does not certify to the Supplier Code of Conduct, or does not provide an acceptable version of their own code.

Internal Accountability Standards

Our employees, contractors and suppliers are expected to adhere to our Human Rights Policy that includes specific provisions related to forced labor, child labor and human trafficking. All employees must also adhere to the guidelines in our Business Conduct Manual, which include disciplinary procedures for any violations.

Procurement Professionals Training

Our employees directly responsible for suppliers are provided awareness training on human trafficking, such as forced labor and child labor, and are expected to report any known or suspected violations."	Yes

139	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act



Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires retailers and manufacturers of a certain size doing business in California to disclose measures used to track possible slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains.

As part of our commitment to social responsibility, we have established Standards for Supplier Conduct. The standards cover topics including compliance with laws, voluntary labor, labor hours, hiring and employment practices, compensation, freedom of association and collective bargaining and the environment. We expect our suppliers to comply with legal requirements and operate consistently with our standards when working on our behalf. By supplying products to us suppliers are required to certify that they will abide by our standards.

We evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain through a combination of internal and third party verification methods. We require suppliers to consent to audits to evaluate compliance with our standards for trafficking and slavery in our supply chain. We may conduct these audits through third-party audit firms. Audits are unrestricted and may occur with or without advance notice.

We require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into products supplied to us comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. For example, our standards provide that by supplying products to us suppliers are certifying that they comply with these laws. In some cases, we may require additional written confirmation of these certifications.

We maintain internal accountability regarding slavery and trafficking, and procedures for employees failing to meet our standards. Compliance with our standards are part of our employee policies, and failing to comply with the standards may result in disciplinary action or dismissal. Our standards are documented and available for our employees and suppliers. Special attention to our standards is required for employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management.

141	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires certain retail sellers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. Lehigh Hanson and its affiliated companies doing business in California, including Hanson Pipe & Precast LLC, as well as all other companies making up the HeidelbergCement Group, are committed to complying with international social and environmental standards. These standards are set forth in the HeidelbergCement Group Sustainability Report and HeidelbergCement’s Supplier Code of Conduct.

Almost all of the products sold by Hanson Pipe & Precast LLC are produced or manufactured using raw materials and products obtained locally from the company itself, a Lehigh Hanson affiliate, or a third party supplier. Taking into account Company policies, social norms, and federal, state and local laws, it is highly unlikely that slavery or human trafficking is implicated in these local supply chains. The verification of these product supply chains is conducted within the Lehigh Hanson organization.

For any raw materials obtained from foreign suppliers, the number of suppliers is nonexistent or small – no more than a dozen or so – and any suppliers can be evaluated for compliance with Company standards on an individual basis without the need for independent, unannounced audits. At times, portland cement is imported from foreign affiliates or a limited number of suppliers. Again, the number of suppliers is small or nonexistent and they can be evaluated for compliance on an individual basis.

In any event, suppliers are bound, directly or indirectly, by the requirements of HeidelbergCement’s Supplier Code of Conduct. These requirements are implemented by certifications from direct suppliers and/or contractual provisions in purchase orders or agreements with direct suppliers, all of whom are required to exercise diligence in verifying that the Supplier Code of Conduct is adhered to by their own suppliers.

Employees and managers are subject to discipline, including termination, for failure to abide by Lehigh Hanson policies, including failure to observe Company standards regarding slavery and human trafficking. Contractors and suppliers are subject to having their contracts with Hanson Pipe & Precast LLC or Lehigh Hanson terminated should they violate the Supplier Code of Conduct.

The relatively few employees and managers with direct responsibility for supply chain management are in Lehigh Hanson’s purchasing department. All of these employees and managers receive regular training in the Lehigh Hanson Code of Business Conduct. Supplemental training on human trafficking and slavery and mitigating risks within the supply chains of products is offered as part of regular meetings of the purchasing department."	Yes
142	"The Hershey Company 
CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT

The Hershey Company, together with its subsidiaries, recognizes the importance of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, which is designed to increase the amount of information manufacturers and retailers make available regarding their efforts to address issues related to slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. We endeavor to model good business practices by striving to ensure our supply chains are responsibly managed.

Hershey has a history of operating with high ethical standards and integrity. The manner in which our employees and vendors manage social, environmental, and economic impacts is critical to our long-term business success.

We have established a Supplier Code of Conduct that sets forth Hershey’s standards and expectations for suppliers with respect to corporate and social responsibility. We require our suppliers to acknowledge their understanding of and adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which serves as a key governing component of our business relationship with these third parties.

As outlined in the Supplier Code of Conduct, our goal is to work with our suppliers to assure compliance with the following requirements:

Legal and Compliance

Suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their country of operation.

Social and Working Conditions

Forced Labor: Suppliers must not utilize or benefit in any way from forced or compulsory labor nor utilize factories or subcontractors that force unpaid labor.

Child Labor: Hershey is committed to the elimination from its supply chain of the worst forms of child labor, as defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 138 and 182. We expect our suppliers to support and participate in industry efforts aimed at the elimination of such practices, wherever they exist in the supply chain.

Working Hours and Wages: Suppliers should provide wages at least equal to the applicable legal minimum wage and any associated statutory benefits, and working hours should reflect applicable legal norms, which includes supplier compliance with applicable laws regarding working and overtime hours.

Freedom of Association: Consistent with local regulations, employees’ right to freedom of association should be respected by suppliers, including that employee relationships are voluntary in nature.

Non-Discrimination: Supplier hiring and employment decisions should be made solely on the basis of skill, ability and performance by the workers, and discrimination is not permitted on the basis of race, religion, gender, political opinion, national extraction, or social origin.

Health and Safety: Suppliers must provide employees with safe and health working environments and practices must comply with all relevant local and national laws, codes, and regulations.

Supplier Verification and Audits

Hershey reserves the right to monitor, review and verify supplier compliance with the principles set forth in the Supplier Code of Conduct, either through third-party certifications or a responsible sourcing audit, which may be performed by a third party. In the event the Company becomes aware of non-compliance, we maintain the right to set forth corrective actions and/or terminate our business relationship with the supplier.

Hershey requires key suppliers to undergo the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA), developed by the Associate Auditor Group of the Sustainable Ethical Data Exchange. SMETA is a prescriptive audit procedure that is a compilation of effective ethical audit techniques.

In 2013, Hershey used third-party auditors to complete social assessments on 25 percent of its external suppliers (based on spend). In 2014, Hershey used third-party auditors to begin assessing an additional 25 percent of its external suppliers (based on spend).

Code of Ethical Business Conduct

Hershey has committed to operating with the highest of ethical standards. This commitment dates to the founding of our company and has earned Hershey a reputation for fairness and honesty throughout the world.

The Company’s Code of Ethical Business Conduct (Code of Conduct) sets forth the standards by which we conduct our operations and establishes a clear expectation that the standards be followed in all job-related activities, regardless of business pressure. It further memorializes our commitment to consumers by maintaining the trust consumers place in our brands, providing the best products in the market and adhering to honest marketing practices.

Employee Training

Our Code of Conduct is distributed to all Hershey employees and is supplemented by targeted training and communications addressing the values set forth within it. Every year employees must complete training modules or acknowledge the standards, guidelines and practices set for in our Code of Conduct. Non-compliance with the Code of Conduct and related Company policies may subject employees to discipline, up to and including termination."	Yes
143	"CA Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect. This law seeks to increase the quantity of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts, if any, to address the issues of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. This in turn allows consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. 

HP's Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct includes provisions that address international labor and human rights standards. HP requires its suppliers to agree to conform to the standards contained in the HP EICC Code of Conduct ensuring workers at supplier facilities have: (i) the right to freely choose employment; (ii) the right, in accordance with local laws, to associate freely, join or be represented by worker councils, join labor unions on a voluntary basis, and bargain collectively as they choose; and (iii) the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. HP's Global Human Rights Policy further outlines HP's commitment to and respect for human rights.  Additionally, HP introduced guidance for the treatment of student and dispatch workers in China in 2013.

HP is aware that slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including forced labor and child labor. Since HP began its Supply Chain Responsibility program in 2000, HP has undertaken efforts to ensure and verify there is no slavery or human trafficking of any form in its supply chain. These efforts include:

Evaluation and verification of product supply chains. HP evaluates the risk of slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain through risk-based supplier assessments and supply chain due diligence. 

Risk-based supplier assessments. HP performs assessments of potential suppliers according to HP's risk-based approach. This approach includes preliminary risk assessments, supplier assessment questionnaires, and specialized onboarding assessments.

Due diligence. HP's Supplier Performance Management (SPM) scorecard is one method HP uses for measurement and tracking. The Scorecard is used to periodically assess supplier performance throughout the year and covers performance on issues such as regular business requirements—including compliance, legislation, and product quality—and social, ethical, and environmental considerations. In 2013, HP updated HP’s procurement scoring process to place greater emphasis on SER performance in the business award process. (See “Procurement integration” on page 2 of Our approach for more information.)   


HP also verifies the absence of slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain through the use of comprehensive and specialized audits as described in Part 2, ""Audits of suppliers,"" below.

Audits of suppliers. HP's audit program evaluates and verifies suppliers' compliance with HP's EICC Code of Conduct, which, among other things, prohibits both forced and child labor. With few exceptions, audit verification is substantiated by at least three different, independent sources of evidence including documents, records, management interviews, worker interviews, and physical observations. Various types of announced assessments are conducted under this program, including comprehensive on-site audits attended by HP, collaborative audits, and third-party on-site audits of supplier practices and underlying management systems. In addition to comprehensive audits, HP uses specialized assessments to engage on issues or questions specific to individual suppliers that are identified through the comprehensive audits, our Key Performance Indicator (KPI) program, and external stakeholder feedback. A finding of nonconformance with HP's EICC Code of Conduct relating to the issue of forced or child labor does not necessarily indicate that forced or child labor has occurred, but could indicate a lack of systemic processes or procedures to prevent such an occurrence. Following an audit and finding of nonconformance, suppliers are required to produce corrective action plans to outline how they intend to resolve the issues, which HP then reviews and approves. HP has a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of forced and child labor. If any zero-tolerance items are uncovered in audits, HP requires suppliers to rectify these items no later than 30 days after the original audit. HP then reexamines the zero-tolerance item between 30 and 90 days after the audit with an in-person visual verification to confirm resolution of the issue.  80% of HP's suppliers audited in 2012 and 2013 confirmed that HP's EICC Code of Conduct requirements were communicated to their next tier suppliers. Approximately 65% of HP's suppliers also demonstrated that they had implemented an effective process to ensure that their respective next tier suppliers implement HP's EICC Code of Conduct. (See page 6 of Our approach for more information on our audit strategy.) 
 

Certification requirements for direct suppliers. HP has purchasing agreements or purchase order terms and conditions in place with our direct suppliers and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs), requiring each to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations regarding forced and child labor as specified in HP's EICC Code of Conduct. HP's direct suppliers and ODMs certify that their operations comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking through their assent to the terms and conditions regarding the same in these HP agreements. Although the terms of the HP’s EICC Code of Conduct do not specifically address ""materials"" that suppliers incorporate into products, HP presents the Code of Conduct as a total supply chain initiative and requires suppliers and ODMs to certify, at minimum, that they require their next tier suppliers to comply, including compliance with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

Internal accountability standards and procedures. HP requires all of its employees and contractors to comply with HP's Standards of Business Conduct (SBC), which includes provisions aimed to ensure that bonded, child, forced, indentured, or involuntary prison labor are not permitted or enabled by any HP business partner or within supplier operations. HP's SBC is enforced through the HP Global Misconduct Policy which includes procedures for employees who fail to meet these standards, and we train employees on these standards annually. HP's SBC has also been adapted for contingent workers in the HP Contingent Worker Code of Conduct, which is re-enforced through labor contracts.
 

Employee training. HP trains employees responsible for supply chain management on how to identify and respond to supply chain issues, such as forced labor or child labor through HP's procurement training program. The program explains the definition, purpose, and enforcement of HP standards against forced and child labor as well as how to mitigate the risks within the supply chains of products. HP also partners with a number of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and training partners to raise awareness of and conformance to HP's EICC Code of Conduct through various programs. Among other things, these programs look to improve supplier capabilities to comply with HP's EICC Code of Conduct and reduce the risk of nonconformance. HP's supply chain capability building programs have included worker-management communications training, which provides employees access to mechanisms to raise any issues with management or superiors. Since 2008, HP has partnered with labor NGOs to provide training on HP’s EICC Code of Conduct, as well as an independent direct hotline for workers in China, to increase workers' knowledge of labor rights. Since 2011, HP has conducted two training sessions with a total of 39 suppliers in Malaysia and Singapore on best practices for employing foreign migrant workers. The trainings were based on guidance developed in partnership with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) through the International Labor Migration working group. Key HP suppliers as well as their respective sub-tier suppliers attended these sessions.  

In addition to the efforts described above, minerals mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo which may have directly or indirectly benefitted armed groups engaged in human rights violations is another area of concern for the industry. HP has been a leader in conducting due diligence of its supply chain, publishing a list of smelters of these minerals which were identified as being in the supply chain for HP products and being a leader in advancing industry programs and tools that enable companies to source conflict free minerals. (See Conflict minerals for more information.)

As an EICC member, HP benefits from the opportunity to participate in the identification and sharing of best practices to combat slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain with other EICC members. This includes evaluation of the EICC Code of Conduct and development of tools and training to help build the capability of EICC suppliers. Other collaborative alliances with Social Accountability International (SAI) and the Global Social Compliance Programme (GSCP) allow HP to exchange information on issues and best practices.

144	"Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy Statement

December 2011

In 2010 the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (“the Act”) was passed into law and became effective on January 1, 2012. In accordance with provisions in the Act, HGST, a Western Digital company, (“HGST”) provides the following information about the prohibition of human trafficking and slavery in its supply chain practices.

I. Supply chain verification

Key suppliers of HGST are required to perform periodic self-assessments of their participation in the HGST supply chain to confirm that it is free of activities related to human trafficking and slavery.

II. Supplier audits with respect to HGST standards

HGST audits its key suppliers against criteria for the prohibition of forced, bonded, and indentured labor as found in the HGST Supplier Code of Conduct. These audits are coordinated with these suppliers.

III. Compliance with applicable slavery and human trafficking laws

Suppliers contracted to HGST are required to comply with all laws applicable to their business operations. Additionally, HGST requires key suppliers to commit to and support the HGST Supplier Code of Conduct. This Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits all forms of forced labor as well as practices associated with trafficking. Suppliers are required to acknowledge their commitment to the HGST Supplier Code of Conduct in writing. This written commitment is required from these suppliers on an annual basis.

IV. Internal accountability

The HGST Code of Conduct prohibits employee involvement in activities related to slavery and human trafficking. Violations of the HGST Code of Conduct may be the basis for employee disciplinary measures that could include dismissal. Contractors are expected to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the HGST Code of Conduct.

V. Internal training

It is the policy of HGST to prohibit human trafficking slavery and to do so by adhering to HGST policies or local laws, whichever achieve higher standards. HGST provides mandatory annual training to employees, including those managing the HGST supply chain, on the HGST Code of Conduct. This training also includes an affirmation that compliance with HGST policies is expected of HGST employees. Employees are required to certify their understanding of the Code of Conduct and their commitment to upholding it."	Yes

The Home Depot, its affiliates, divisions, and subsidiaries strive to conduct business in a responsible manner. As we expand our business activities and work with suppliers domestically and globally to meet customers’ needs, it is important to preserve our collective commitment to human rights and safety in the workplace. 

The Home Depot expects that all suppliers will abide by all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacture and distribution of merchandise or services provided to The Home Depot. All suppliers are strongly encouraged to exceed The Home Depot’s guidelines and promote continuous improvement throughout their operations. 

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. This law is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. 

Since 2005, The Home Depot has had a set of Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) Standards which all suppliers are obligated to comply with by contract. Specifically our standards state the following for “Forced Labor”:

“Suppliers will not use of any form of involuntary labor including forced, prison, indentured, bonded, slave, or human trafficked labor.” 

We also actively monitor child labor in our supply chain which can be associated with slavery and human trafficking:

“Suppliers must not employ workers younger than the greater of 15 years of age -- or 14 where the local law allows such an exception consistent with International Labor Organization guidelines -- or the age for completing compulsory education or the minimum age established by law in the country of manufacture. In addition, Suppliers must comply with all local legal requirements for the work of authorized young workers, particularly those pertaining to hours of work, wages, and working conditions.”

The Home Depot utilizes internal staff as well as a number of third-party social responsibility firms to monitor and prevent human rights abuse in our supply chain.

Our efforts include:

Supply Chain Verification 
In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, The Home Depot performs factory assessments (Audits) of suppliers of private brand and direct import products on a periodic basis. Every factory receives an Audit at least every two (2) years. The majority of our factories receive a new Audit every six (6) months to one (1) year, while those achieving a 95% score or better receive a new audit less frequently. These assessments are conducted by trained individuals from our internal SER team as well as our third-party social responsibility firm partners. Notably, almost a quarter of the questions used in these Audits focuses on the risks associated with the various types of forced and child labor and other national laws associated with them.

Supplier Audits 
The Home Depot evaluates and verifies suppliers’ compliance with our SER Standards via on-site auditing. As described above, we audit all factories manufacturing private brand and direct import products while contractually holding our national brand partners to the same level of due diligence. Announced audits are conducted prior to placing any purchase orders with a private brand or direct import supplier. We also utilize pre-source assessments, specific response Audits when we are directly made aware of an issue by any source, and a comprehensive risk based re-audit program, which include both announced and unannounced audits, to ensure these factories are monitored on a continuous basis. At the conclusion of every Audit where an issue of noncompliance is found, a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) plan is created with firm timelines based on the level of risk (High 30 days, Medium 90 days). The Home Depot has a policy of verifying the CAPA implementation to confirm that the factories are meeting the commitments set forth in the CAPA plan. Evidence of forced or child labor during any of the aforementioned discovery methods is deemed a “Critical Deficiency” and results in a multi-step engagement between The Home Depot and the supplier. This engagement consists of three (3) visits to the factory over a six (6) month period. At the completion of this engagement, a new Audit is required and the factory must demonstrate systemic improvements or risk termination by The Home Depot.

Supplier Certifications 
The Home Depot has a Supplier Buying Agreement in place with our suppliers requiring them to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations, including those related to forced labor and child labor as specified in The Home Depot’s SER Standards. In the event of a non-compliant supplier or factory, we work with our suppliers on remediation efforts. Notwithstanding the above, we have a termination mechanism in place which defines the circumstances under which a factory or supplier will be excluded from conducting future business with The Home Depot.

Internal Accountability
We believe in Respect for All People and Doing the Right Thing, which are emphasized to all associates as part of our values wheel. To help enforce our values, The Home Depot has an anonymous hotline available to our associates for the purposes of reporting violations of company policy or legal requirements. This resource is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and each report is investigated by our corporate compliance team.

Training 
The Home Depot trains internal employees responsible for sourcing products on how to identify and respond to social and environmental responsibility issues, such as forced labor or child labor."	Yes
146	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43 and Cal. Rev. & Tax Code § 19547.5) was designed to increase the amount of information available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains, thereby allowing customers to make informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. Pursuant to this new statutory requirement, Honda of America Mfg., Inc. (“Honda”) makes the following disclosure.

Internally, Honda has adopted a Business Practices Policy that includes a commitment to adherence to all applicable laws and regulations. Training on this policy is provided to all associates to assure that they understand their obligations to comply with all laws, including all dealings with suppliers. Associates are held accountable for compliance with the Business Practices policy.

Externally, Honda was actively involved in the development of the automotive industry’s “Global Working Conditions Guidance Statements” which was developed in conjunction with other major manufacturers and suppliers through the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG). This industry guidance covers seven areas of responsible working conditions, including the prohibition of any form of forced or compulsory labor.

Honda’s efforts to eliminate the risks of human trafficking and slavery in its supply chain include endorsing these guidelines and communicating these expectations to our suppliers. Furthermore, management representatives from Honda Purchasing are active in the AIAG Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee, Global Working Conditions Oversight Committee, and Global Working Conditions Corporate Engagement Training Workgroup at AIAG. Free on-line training regarding global working conditions is available to all of our suppliers here.

Additionally, Honda contractually requires all of its direct suppliers to represent and warrant that they fully comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations or orders, and agency or association standards or other standards applicable to the manufacture, labeling, transportation, licensing, approval or certification of goods provided to Honda.

Honda maintains strong relationships with its suppliers and, consistent with our philosophy to go to the “actual spot,” conducts regular announced audits and evaluations of their capabilities, performance, and viability. At this time, Honda does not audit suppliers nor contract with third parties to evaluate and certify specific compliance against company standards regarding human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain. However, the company would vigorously investigate any reports or claims of non- compliance with local laws and/or industry standards regarding forced labor, and would remediate accordingly, up to termination of our relationship.

 

Honda’s treatment of its associates, suppliers, trading partners and dealers is premised on the company’s philosophy of “Respect for the Individual.” As envisioned by our company’s founders, this philosophy leads us to value and respect the unique contributions of each individual. Accordingly, we are committed to ensuring that each person involved in the production, sale, and distribution of our products is treated with dignity and respect."	Yes
147	"Social Responsibility 

At Hot Topic, Inc. we recognize the importance of providing our customers with products that have been produced in a legal and socially responsible manner. So, in addition to requiring compliance with applicable local and federal laws, we require all manufacturers and product providers to agree to adhere to strict standards for the production of the merchandise we sell. These are the minimum standards by which we expect each manufacturer and product provider to conduct business with us, and they are founded on the principle that all individuals are owed dignity and respect. The standards include prohibitions of child labor or forced labor, treating workers with respect and without discrimination, and ensuring fair wages. Included in these standards, we require all manufacturers and product providers to ensure that:

Forced Labor. There shall not be any use of forced labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise.

 

Child Labor.  No person shall be employed at an age younger than 16 years.

 

Harassment or Abuse. Every employee shall be treated with respect and dignity. No employee shall be subject to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse.

 

Health and Safety. Employers shall provide a safe and healthy working environment designed to maximize prevention of accidents and injury.

 

Wages and Benefits. Employers shall pay employees sufficient wages to meet their employees' basic needs.

 

In addition to maintaining these standards, we require all of our manufacturers and product providers to monitor their own facilities and to allow announced and unannounced inspections of their facilities by independent external monitors.

We also have a program for regularly training our employees with responsibility over our products about the importance of compliance with these standards, how to identify and avoid potential violations of these standards, and what they should do if they suspect a manufacturer or product provider has failed to comply with the standards. We also provide the ability for our employees to report any concerns they may have about these maters in a confidential manner, free from any threat of retaliation."	Yes

Saks Incorporated is committed to legal compliance and ethical business practices in all our operations worldwide and is firm in our resolve to do business only with those Vendors, suppliers, and contractors which we believe share in that commitment. In support of this commitment, Saks Incorporated demands that all individuals or organizations who provide direct and indirect materials and services, as well as all suppliers, contractors, consultants and other intermediaries (herein referred to as “Vendors”) agree to follow our Business Practice Standards as condition of the business relationship.

We require our Vendors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations mandated by the country in which the merchandise or product is manufactured, including but not limited to laws against child labor, forced labor and unsafe working conditions.

In accordance with the requirements of the California Transparency Supply Chain Act of 2012 (CASB 657), Saks provides the following disclosure:

Saks monitors foreign vendor orders that are being produced in high- and medium-risk regions of the world. For these orders, Saks requires vendors to participate in our social compliance program, which may include but is not limited to disclosure of factories, submission of a third party audit report conducted by an accredited audit standard or participation in a social compliance inspection through an independent third party auditing firm. Auditors are required to use a pre-defined, specific and detailed audit checklist which is based on the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) when inspecting a factory. The Code is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Standards, which includes a focus on monitoring for child, indentured and/or forced labor as well as harsh and inhumane treatment at the factories. Auditors are required to have appropriate training and credentials to ensure that generally accepted auditing principles are utilized. Audits are completed on an annual basis unless determined that more frequent intervals are appropriate.

During an audit, the factory is required to share records, allow the auditor to freely tour the production facility, and cooperate completely with the auditor at all times. Saks maintains internal procedures to clarify steps to be taken when Vendors, factories, and/or sub-contractors fail to meet the Company standards up to and including termination of the relationship with the Vendor and/or factory (as a matter of practice, our vendors are usually not related to the factories, and they work with a number of them at one time). All claims related to non-compliance to the standards are discussed with the auditing firm and reviewed by Associates with their Manager to ensure adequate and responsible handling.

In addition, Saks expects that all Associates follow the Saks Code of Business Conduct, the Saks Vendor Standards Manual, and established Saks Business Practice Standards. In addition, Saks provides specific training to Associates responsible for managing social compliance programs that includes education on addressing issues of forced labor and/or inhumane conditions in the Company’s supply chain."

These audits are performed by third party professionals in a scheduled manner in order to assure a thorough assessment against the code provisions.

This focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort of supply chain transparency and accountability. IBM has taken multiple actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain, including the following:

IBM / EICC Code of Conduct

Supply Chain Audits

Supplier Agreements: Our model supplier agreements require suppliers to comply with IBM’s supplier Code of Conduct.

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires certain companies manufacturing or selling products in California, which currently would include certain Units of IDEX Corporation, to disclose their efforts (if any) to address the issues of human trafficking and slavery in their supply chain and efforts to eradicate each of these from their supply chain. 

With a few minor exceptions, the products that IDEX purchases from suppliers do not fall within any of the classes of products that the U.S. Department of Labor has identified in its List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Force Labor published in 2009, and, to date, IDEX has not observed activity within its supply chain that would trigger any human trafficking or slavery concern.  Accordingly, IDEX does not consider human trafficking and slavery to be a significant risk for its supply chain.  Although IDEX Units expect their suppliers to comply with applicable laws and frequently obtain agreements and certifications from their key suppliers relating to compliance with applicable laws in supplying products to them, IDEX Units do not verify their supply chain or audit suppliers specifically to evaluate risks of human trafficking and slavery or require their suppliers to certify specifically that products supplied to them were not produced with child labor or slave labor. 

IDEX has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all IDEX employees, The Code does not include any standards specific to human trafficking and slavery, and IDEX does not provide training to its employees focused on human trafficking and slavery.  However, the Codes does require compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of every country in which IDEX does business, which would include laws on human trafficking and slave labor.  In addition, the Code obligates IDEX employees to act in every respect with honesty, fairness and integrity.  IDEX employees receive training on the standards and behavior expected of them under the Code."

International Paper Company (“International Paper” or “IP”), wherever it operates around the world, is committed to conducting business with honesty and integrity; in treating all people with dignity and respect and in complying with applicable laws, regulations and treaties. IP is also committed to protecting and promoting human rights globally. We do not tolerate illegal child labor, forced labor, or any use of force or other forms of coercion, fraud, deception, abuse of power or other means to achieve control over another person for the purpose of exploitation. IP respects international principles of human rights including, but not limited to, those expressed in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended (Public Law 106-386, Division A) and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. These principles and commitments are embodied in our IP Code of Conduct, the IP Way principles, corporate policies and our Supplier Code of Conduct.

We comply with employment laws of every country in which we operate and expect those with whom we do business to do the same. Effective by year end 2012, our Supplier Code of Conduct will be incorporated in the obligations of our standard purchase order terms and conditions and we will commence incorporation into our supply contracts to assure that our suppliers understand the standards that we apply to ourselves and expect from those with whom we do business.

The IP Foundation and IP’s other charitable investments fund community development throughout the world and reinforce IP’s commitment to human rights.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the “Act”) requires retail sellers and manufacturers doing business in California with over $100 Million in worldwide gross receipts to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. Accordingly, the Act requires IP to disclose, at a minimum, the following:

Verification. International Paper routinely assesses risk related to its supply chain. This assessment is based primarily upon supplier quality performance, the type of transaction, the specific commodity purchased, the geographic location of the source and other relevant business and legal criteria. IP follows the trade laws of the US and applicable laws of countries in which we operate, including the restrictions on export or doing business with certain people, companies or countries. IP’s Supplier Code of Conduct specifically identifies the expectation that our suppliers must comply with laws governing human trafficking and slavery and reserves IP’s right to investigate any discovered instances of non-compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Other than the foregoing, IP has no formal process for verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

Auditing. International Paper has audit rights in a many of its supply contracts, which permit IP to audit a supplier’s compliance with the terms of the contract. While IP has certain contractual rights to audit its suppliers, and has conducted routine audits or assessments of supplier performance, those assessment methodologies do not currently include intentional assessments of human trafficking and slavery. IP has reserved the right to investigate instances of non-compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, including instances of non- compliance with laws governing human trafficking and slavery.

Last Revised: November 2012

Certification. All IP contracts with suppliers require suppliers to comply with all laws. Our suppliers will also be required to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which states our expectations of compliance with laws and ethical business conduct, including those laws and principles prohibiting involvement in human trafficking and slavery. Upon transition of our contracts, when a supplier accepts our purchase order and/or enters into a contract with IP, they are acknowledging and consenting to comply with all laws and with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Other than these contractual obligations with suppliers and IP’s reservation of right to investigate, IP does not have a formal supplier certification process.

Internal Accountability. International Paper employees are, under the terms of their employment, expected to follow all laws of the countries in which they operate and all of IP’s policies, including the IP Code of Conduct. Employees who violate laws or IP’s policies are subject to disciplinary action, including discharge. International Paper’s suppliers are subject to the terms of all contracts with IP, including its obligation to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct. IP reserves its contractual rights to terminate relationships with suppliers who fail to comply with law and/or whose contractual noncompliance is not addressed in a timely manner. A supplier’s compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct is an essential factor in IP’s decision whether to enter into, continue or extend existing business relationships with that supplier.

Training and Awareness. IP regularly trains its employees in the standards of ethical behavior, policies, procedures and legal requirements that establish the manner in which we conduct business. We have specifically established and commenced training of supply chain and sourcing directors, managers and employees on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within supply chains.

162	"Ixia California Transparency in Supply Chains Policy Statement

Ixia is a global company where we take pride not just in our products and services, but in our strong core values.  Honesty, integrity, and the fair treatment of others are just a few of the values we expect of our employees, business partners, customers, and suppliers.  

In January 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the “Act”) became law.  As a result, manufacturers like Ixia are required to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their product supply chains.  

The following are highlights of our efforts in this area.

Protections 
Ixia strongly believes in the fair treatment of all persons working in our product supply chains.  Historically, our contracts with suppliers in our product supply chains have typically required those suppliers to comply with all applicable laws in connection with their provision of products and services to Ixia.  Now, the contracts that we enter into with such suppliers also typically require them to abide by the principles set forth in the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct.  The EICC is a conglomerate of organizations in the electronics industry that have joined together in the promotion of ethical business practices, including acceptable working conditions and environmental awareness in supply chains.  Among other things, the EICC Code of Conduct prohibits slavery and human trafficking.

Verification
Ixia requires certain randomly selected suppliers (“Selected Suppliers”) to either (i) complete and submit to Ixia an EICC Self-Assessment Questionnaire, or (ii) provide proof of EICC certification to Ixia.  The questionnaire helps us determine the degree to which Selected Suppliers comply with the EICC Code of Conduct, including the prohibitions on slavery and human trafficking set forth therein.  All Selected Supplier questionnaires are reviewed by Ixia, and not by a third party.  If any responses do not appear to comply with the EICC Code of Conduct, Ixia will contact the Selected Supplier for further review. 

Auditing 
Ixia periodically audits certain of our key suppliers to confirm their compliance with the EICC Code of Conduct.  The audits are announced and conducted by Ixia personnel.  Suppliers who fail to adhere to the EICC Code of Conduct may be provided an opportunity to remediate issues identified during the inspection process.  Suppliers who refuse to satisfactorily remediate identified issues are subject to removal from Ixia’s supply chain.

Certification 
As discussed above, we have typically required our suppliers in our product supply chains to commit that they will comply with all applicable laws in connection with their provision of products and services to Ixia.  Further, Selected Suppliers must describe their compliance with, or provide a certification with respect to, the EICC Code of Conduct.

Internal Accountability 
Ixia requires its employees to follow the standards and principles set forth in Ixia’s Code of Business Conduct, which requires ethical behavior, the maintenance of a healthy and safe working environment, and compliance with all applicable laws.  Employees who fail to comply with this Code are subject to disciplinary action.

Training 
All Ixia employees are required to participate in training on Ixia’s Code of Business Conduct.  Ixia also provides its employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with job specific training on Ixia’s requirements and policies pertaining to supply chain management, including Ixia’s policy of identifying and addressing any inappropriate treatment of persons working in our product supply chains.

163	"Slavery and Human Trafficking Avoidance Policy Statement.

 

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have gross worldwide sales of over $100M USD, to be transparent about the efforts they have undertaken to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain.

Jabil has internal policies and practices that are based on international labor and human rights standards. We endeavor to use companies in our supply chain that create an environment where workers have the right to freely choose employment, the right to associate freely, the right to voluntarily join or not join labor unions and worker councils, if they choose.

Jabil's focus on eradicating slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort of supply chain transparency and accountability. Jabil is taking multiple actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in our own operations and extended supply chain, including the following:

 

Slavery and Human Trafficking Avoidance Policies 

Provisions in Supplier Contracts 

Awareness Training 

Internal Audits 

3rd Party Validated Audits 

Worker Engagement Surveys 

On-Site Supplier Audits

 

Additionally, Jabil is a founding member of Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), which has since 2004 built upon its Code of Conduct which prohibits the use of forced, bonded, indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. We audit our suppliers for compliance with this EICC code and take seriously all forms of non-conformance. The EICC also has a Freely Chosen Employment (FCE) task force designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the Code of Conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training."

164	"Corporate Social Responsibility

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their own direct supply chain. JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “JAKKS”) is committed to ensuring that its supply chain reflects and upholds the values of human rights and the environment.

In compliance with the spirit and intent of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657), JAKKS undertakes the following actions:

(1) JAKKS internally (without the use of a third party auditor) conducts risk assessment of its supply chains in relation to potential slavery and human trafficking. 

(2) JAKKS incorporates into its supplier agreements standards which a) prohibit its suppliers from engaging in slavery and human trafficking and b) require the suppliers to provide a safe and healthy work environment that complies with all local and national employment laws. The agreements require that suppliers represent and warrant that they are not and will not engage in any slavery or human trafficking and prohibit them from engaging in any slavery or human trafficking. 

(3) JAKKS uses internal staff and does not employ third parties to audit suppliers to determine compliance with the foregoing. If JAKKS learns of or suspects any such violation by a supplier, it will audit the supplier and, if a violation is found, require the supplier to provide JAKKS an action plan to achieve compliance within a reasonable time period. JAKKS will terminate its relationship with any supplier that fails to timely correct violations within a reasonable time period.

JAKKS’ internal policies reflect the aforementioned policies. Employees and contractors working within the JAKKS supply chain are required to comply with these policies and attend training on mitigating risks of slavery and human trafficking. Those who violate the policies are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment."	Yes
165	"For more than a century, JCPenney and its subsidiaries have built a legacy of operating in an ethical and socially responsible manner. The standards that we set for our company and our associates are set forth in JCPenney’s Statement of Business Ethics. In addition, we require our suppliers to share our commitment to legal compliance. We recognize that a critical factor in our continuing success as a leader in the retail industry is our ability to build and sustain strong relationships with our suppliers – relationships based on trust, integrity and high standards for ethical behavior and legal compliance. Our expectations of our suppliers are set forth in the JCPenney Supplier Principles.

Below you will find the actions that JCPenney is taking to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chain.

1. VERIFICATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN AND EVALUATION OF RISK

With the exception of certain private brand window coverings, JCPenney does not manufacture any of the products that we sell. For our private brand merchandise, we source from suppliers that operate in or import from over 30 countries. These suppliers provide the wide variety of merchandise we offer in our stores, in our catalogs and on jcp.com, including apparel, footwear, furniture, accessories and home decor items. We strive to buy our merchandise from companies that share our values, and we include corporate social responsibility considerations in our sourcing practices. Ensuring that our suppliers’ operations reflect our values and that our products are made in safe and humane working conditions are top priorities. Monitoring our supply chain remains a dynamic and evolving process, and we work continuously to improve our processes and practices to adapt to the changing global environment in which we operate.

Factories producing JCPenney private brand product undergo an evaluation by JCPenney and third party auditors of the factory’s compliance with local health, safety and labor laws and JCPenney expectations. Annual risk assessments of the supply chain are conducted to identify areas of potential risk and to develop action steps to address identified risk. JCPenney participates in industry working groups and collaborative efforts with external stakeholders to improve transparency in the supply chain.

		AUDITING  All factories used by our suppliers to produce direct import or JCPenney Private Brand merchandise are subject to JCPenney’s social compliance program including unannounced audits by third party auditors. The frequency of audits is based upon a risk assessment and prior audit findings. Audit findings are reviewed with the factory management and corrective action plans are developed. Follow up visits and support for remediation efforts are conducted by JCPenney teams. Factory management is expected to address all issues identified in the audit and corrective action plan. A non-compliant factory that cannot, or will not, meet the requirements to become compliant within the time provided is suspended for a minimum period of 12 months. A suspended factory is not permitted to produce any private brand product for any supplier that sells merchandise to JCPenney during the suspension period. 

		SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION  JCPenney’s contract terms with its suppliers and the JCPenney Supplier Principles require all JCPenney suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, including all labor laws and refrain from using forced labor, whether indentured, bonded, prison or obtained through slavery and human trafficking (including forced child labor). Our expectations are communicated to prospective suppliers during the early part of the contract negotiation process, and suppliers are consistently made aware that they must stay in compliance to do business with us. All direct import suppliers provide certifications of compliance for each shipment of merchandise to JCPenney. 

4. ACCOUNTABILITY

All JCPenney associates are required to comply with the JCPenney Statement of Business Ethics, which is updated annually. Associate training and certification of compliance is also conducted annually. JCPenney seeks to work with only those suppliers and services providers that share our same values and ethics as set forth in the JCPenney Supplier Principles. Both Suppliers and JCPenney associates are encouraged to contact JCPenney with any questions or concerns about our requirements and are expected to report a potential ethical or legal violation involving JCPenney business. To that end, we provide a hotline, which can be accessed via a toll-free telephone number or website. jcpLine is operated by an organization independent from JCPenney and callers can choose to remain anonymous. A case number is assigned to each call or inquiry and is properly investigated. Suppliers, JCPenney associates and others may contact jcpLine toll- free by telephone at 1-800-527-0063 or may visit jcpline.com. For those located outside the United States may call a toll-free international number. A directory of numbers by country is available at jcpline.com.

All allegations of violations of the JCPenney Statement of Business Ethics or Supplier Principles are investigated and appropriate responsive action taken. If there is credible evidence that one of our suppliers, or one of their contractors, is violating the legal compliance provisions of our contracts, we may take one or more of the following actions: suspend current business activity until the supplier or the contractor is in complete compliance and we are assured the supplier has taken the steps necessary to prevent future violations; cancel outstanding orders; place the violating factory on our suspended factory list, prohibiting its use to produce JCPenney private brand merchandise; terminate our relationship with the supplier; report illegal activity to the appropriate legal authorities.

5. TRAINING OF JCPENNEY ASSOCIATES

JCPenney is dedicated to building a socially responsible supply chain. JCPenney associates who are responsible for international sourcing as well as those who are responsible for oversight and management of social compliance for direct import and private brand suppliers go through periodic training on social compliance issues, including labor compliance issues."

166	"For more than 115 years, The J.M. Smucker Company has been guided by our Basic Beliefs — values and principles that guide both strategic decisions and daily behavior. These Basic Beliefs regarding quality, people, ethics, growth, and independence have served as a strong foundation throughout our history and continue to be the basis for how we run the Company.

Today, Smucker bases present practices on these time-honored values and principles. We interpret them, in terms of modern business thinking, to be the guideposts for decision-making and daily interactions with consumers, customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and shareholders.

Our relationships with suppliers are particularly important, given that they directly impact our ability to meet the product quality expectations of our consumers and customers. To this end, we seek suppliers who support our Basic Beliefs. We expect every supplier to conduct its business with the same high standards of honesty, fairness, and ethics that we apply to our own business.

In particular, we require our direct suppliers to contractually agree not to employ children, prison labor, indentured labor, or bonded labor or to participate in human trafficking. In addition, using internal resources, we perform scheduled Quality Assurance audits on select suppliers, during which our auditing personnel look for any evidence of human trafficking and slavery.

We will continue to evaluate the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain as our Company grows, and we will institute training programs for supply chain personnel as necessary to manage any identified risks that would threaten our continued dedication to our Basic Beliefs."	Yes

168	"Kellogg Company has a solid foundation of integrity and respect. This is important because our business success depends on earning the trust of customers and consumers by meeting their needs for nutritious, enjoyable foods that are sourced responsibly.

As a responsible corporate citizen, Kellogg is committed to an ethical and transparent supply chain. One aspect of our responsible sourcing commitment is a zero-tolerance position against forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking.

We believe it is our duty to raise awareness and educate our internal and external stakeholders on this important issue and to take appropriate steps to verify that slavery and human trafficking does not exist within our operations or within our global supply chain. To us, this is a journey that should be made thoughtfully and proactively.

Awareness

Our Global Code of Ethics requires our employees to obey the law, act with integrity, show respect and do business with suppliers who embrace and demonstrate high standards of ethical business behavior. It requires diligence in determining whether suppliers conform to our standards such as no forced labor. Through training and general awareness messages, Kellogg requires procurement and supply chain employees to be informed of the issues surrounding slavery and human trafficking, and to report any and all actual or suspected violations that come to their attention.

Our global Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to treat their employees with fairness, respect and dignity, and specifically prohibits forced labor, physical coercion, corporal punishment and harassment. We require that our suppliers comply with the expectations and standards of our code, and that their suppliers and subcontractors do the same. We reserve the right to terminate a contract with any supplier, at our sole discretion, for violations of our global Supplier Code of Conduct.

At Kellogg, we have three main categories of suppliers: premium, direct, and indirect. Premium suppliers provide Kellogg with the small gifts and prizes we occassionally include with our products. Direct suppliers provide Kellogg with raw materials, ingredients and packaging. Indirect suppliers provide Kellogg with everything else that supports our business like consulting, travel, marketing services, etc. In 2009, we developed and deployed our global Supplier Code of Conduct. By 2010, 99% of our direct suppliers had accepted our global Supplier Code of Conduct. To date, 100% of our premium suppliers and 99% of our critical indirect suppliers have also accepted our global Supplier Code of Conduct.

We have embedded our global Supplier Code of Conduct in our contracts and purchase order terms and conditions in Kellogg North America and intend to do the same globally.

In the upcoming revision to our global Supplier Code of Conduct, we will make specific reference to human trafficking as a prohibited supplier activity.

Education

Since 2010, Kellogg has used our various supplier meetings to educate our suppliers on our expectations regarding our global Supplier Code of Conduct. As part of these discussions, we have addressed the important issues of slavery and human trafficking. Fortunately, we have not found instances of forced labor in our supply chain, but we want our suppliers to know that this is a critical issue for Kellogg.

Along with having industry and internal experts discuss the issue of slavery and human trafficking with select employees, in 2011 we required U.S. and Canadian employees in our Supply Chain, and those in our Procurement and Quality organizations who have direct and substantive interaction with our supply chain, to complete an online course on eliminating forced labor, slavery and human trafficking from the global supply chain. This online course will be rolled out globally in 2012.

To ensure alignment within our industry, Kellogg is a long-standing member of AIM PROGRESS, a forum of consumer goods companies assembled to enable and promote responsible sourcing practices and sustainable production systems. AIM PROGRESS is a global initiative supported and sponsored by AIM in Europe and the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) in North America.

Verification

In 2005, an internal risk assessment determined that premium suppliers were our highest risk supplier group. In response to that determination, we have conducted ethical sourcing audits on premium suppliers within a certain risk profile since 2006. Our audit approach for premium suppliers calls for both third-party and company audits, both announced and when necessary unannounced.

In 2012, we will conduct an internal supplier risk assessment focused on high-risk commodities and high-risk countries to determine high-risk suppliers among our direct and indirect supplier groups and develop an appropriate ethical sourcing audit approach."	Yes

Kelly-Moore Paint Company, Inc. 

Policy Statement for CA Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

It is the policy of Kelly-Moore Paint Company, Inc. (KMPC) to make reasonable efforts to ensure that our supply chain is free of any products of forced labor, child labor, human trafficking and slavery. To that end, KMPC has undertaken the following:

(1)            KMPC has investigated and evaluated the potential for products of forced labor, child labor, human trafficking and slavery to be present in its direct supply chain. We find that the raw materials used in the manufacture of architectural coatings are not known to be associated with any inhumane labor practices. It should be noted that architectural coatings raw materials are not among the products listed in U.S. Department of Labor’s 2009 Report on the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor. Further, the American Coatings Association, the principal trade association for the U.S. paint and coatings industry, is not aware of any documented instances of these labor practices in the industry or its supply chain. With respect to the sundry items sold but not manufactured by KMPC, we find no indication that our direct suppliers engage in any inhumane labor practices.

(2)            If, at any time, KMPC should become aware of any credible indication of potential inhumane labor practices on the part of a direct supplier, KMPC will arrange to conduct an independent, unannounced audit of that supplier to the extent practicable.

(3)            KMPC has begun to require its direct suppliers to certify in writing that materials incorporated into their products comply with the laws regarding forced labor, child labor, human trafficking and slavery in the country or countries where they do business.

(4)            KMPC maintains internal accountability standards for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding avoidance of forced labor, child labor, human trafficking and slavery.

(5)            KMPC provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on forced labor, child labor, human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chain of products."	Yes

172	"Supply Chain Human Rights Policy 

KLA-Tencor expects its supply base to adhere to global principles of human rights that include; freedom of association, right to organize, abolition of forced labor, elimination of child labor, equality and anti-discrimination rights, payment of minimum wages, and provision of legally mandated employee benefits.

As a company that must deliver extremely complex, high-technology products to our customers, it is critical that our supply base maintain highly trained personnel and best-in-class processes so the company can meet all customer requirements. To that end, KLA-Tencor established a global supply chain program in 2002. 

In 2006, KLA-Tencor received the Institute of Supply Management’s inaugural R. Gene Richter Award for “Innovation and Leadership in Supply Management” in the area of process for KLA-Tencor’s Supply Chain Management (SCM) program. Our SCM program was also named by A.T. Kearney as a 2008 “Leader in Procurement Excellence.” The supply chain management processes establish, support, ensure and continuously improve the adherence of our supply base to all critical tenets of human rights. In particular, KLA-Tencor expects its supply base to adhere and comply with global human rights standards. Such standards include but are not limited to:

The industry best practices for major electronics companies, its customers and suppliers as defined and adopted by the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC) which can be found at www.eicc.info

The requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 which can be found in Section 1714.43 at www.leginfo.ca.gov.

KLA-Tencor expects that suppliers and their supply chains adhere to the KLA-Tencor Human Rights Policy, and we strive to enforce such policies via a rigorous three pronged approach of (1) sourcing and supplier selection, (2) contractual supplier requirements and (3) ongoing supplier relationship management

Sourcing & Supplier Selection
To become a key supplier for the production of KLA-Tencor’s goods and services, suppliers are evaluated through a selection and qualification process that is a critical part of the company’s SCM process. Typically, such evaluations include supplier visits and/or supplier quality audits of the supplier’s people, processes and capabilities against pre-determined evaluation criteria. During the course of these assessments, the team qualifies how well the supplier meets KLA-Tencor’s standards. Only the suppliers that meet KLA-Tencor’s standards and that optimize or meet the overall selection criteria are selected. Those suppliers then become part of KLA-Tencor’s supply base and are, as appropriate, managed for continuous improvement.

Contractual Supplier Requirements 
Purchase Order Terms and Conditions: As a condition of doing business and as a means of self-certification, our purchase order standard terms and conditions stipulate that “Seller represents and warrants that it complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including eradication of forced, bonded, indentured, involuntary convict or compulsory labor, as well as illegal child labor in its facilities, and requires their suppliers, including labor agencies, to do the same. Seller warrants that its supply chain and materials incorporated into its products comply with the laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking. Seller agrees to adopt sound human rights practices, to treat workers fairly and with dignity and respect, provide a safe and healthy work environment for their workers, conduct business in compliance with applicable environmental and employment laws, and refrain from corrupt practices.”

Standard Supplier Purchase Agreement: 
Additionally, key KLA-Tencor suppliers must sign KLA-Tencor’s standard purchase agreement that specifically states that the supplier “represents and warrants that it complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including eradication of forced, bonded, indentured, involuntary convict or compulsory labor, as well as illegal child labor in its facilities, and requires their suppliers, including labor agencies, to do the same. Seller warrants that its supply chain and materials incorporated into its products comply with the laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking,” and the supplier “agrees to adopt sound human rights practices, to treat workers fairly and with dignity and respect, provide a safe and healthy work environment for their workers, conduct business in compliance with applicable environmental and employment laws, and refrain from corrupt practices.” Furthermore, it also stipulates that suppliers “shall comply with all applicable laws regarding non-discrimination in terms and conditions of employment, payment of minimum wage and legally mandated employee benefits, and compliance with mandated work hours. Seller shall comply with all applicable laws regarding employment of underage or child labor and shall not employ children under the age of 16.”

Supplier Relationship Management: 
Key KLA-Tencor suppliers, as appropriate, participate in the KLA-Tencor Supplier Scorecard program. The Scorecard includes several qualitative and quantitative measurement criteria related to a supplier’s performance against defined criteria. Non-quantifiable ratings include KLA-Tencor’s policies. Any deterioration below certain levels requires a Supplier Action Request. Supplier Action Requests are managed throughout the business review process. KLA-Tencor will discontinue business with suppliers that fail to either improve their Supplier Scorecard rating over a defined period or do not resolve requests in a timely manner. The Supplier Relationship Management program includes planned business reviews, site visits and performance audits that include adherence to human rights policies. Site visits and performance-related audits occur when and if a supplier’s scorecard performance is declining and/or if supplier risk is determined through the course of normal supplier visits."	Yes
173	"Philips focuses on motivating and supporting suppliers’ continuous efforts to improve their sustainability performance. The Philips Supplier Sustainability Declaration and Regulated Substances List clarify what we expect from suppliers. We use supplier audits to verify conformance with the Supplier Sustainability Declaration and to establish whether the supplier has systems in place to facilitate continued conformance. Audits also enable Philips to identify issues and build corrective action plans with suppliers to address them. Our capability building programs train suppliers in areas of concern revealed in audits.




One of the actions we took to promote a sustainable future was to become a member of the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition in 2006.  The EICC provides the electronics industry with a platform from which to develop standardized tools and processes, helping to develop a uniform standard as well as to measure performance against this standard. Using this platform as a basis, Philips has created the Supplier Sustainability Program, defining what we expect of our Suppliers.



Create commitment: what we expect from suppliers
As a baseline for building a sustainable business relationship with our supplier, we require all our suppliers to conform to the Philips Supplier Sustainability Declaration and Regulated Substances List. This requirement forms an integral part of any commercial agreement between Philips and the supplier.


The Supplier Sustainability Declaration is based on the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) code of conduct, supplemented with stricter requirements on collective bargaining and freedom of association, in line with the Philips General Business Principles. The Supplier Sustainability Declaration includes standards in the areas of Labor and Human Rights, Health and Safety, Environmental Impact, Ethics and Management Systems. The chapter on Labor and Human Rights specifies everything from the prohibition of child labor, forced labor and bonded labor to maximum working hours per week and safe working conditions. The prohibition of child labor and the use of forced and bonded labor includes forms of labor using indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery or trafficking of persons.


Suppliers must also comply with our regulated substances list, which contains, among other things, Philips’ global product content requirements. This includes restricting or prohibiting hazardous substances in products or manufacturing processes. For more information on regulated substances, click here.


Build understanding: training & capacity building
Supplier awareness and engagement are critical for building a sustainable industry. Our training sessions, supplier day events and briefings aim to build knowledge and commitment among our suppliers. We encourage our suppliers to analyze gaps and areas for improvement by completing the EICC Self Assessment Questionnaire for each site that manufactures products for Philips.


Monitor identified risk suppliers
Philips conducts onsite sustainability audits with identified risk suppliers. The goal of the audit is to verify that a supplier works in accordance with the provisions in the Philips Supplier Sustainability Declaration, and if needed identify areas and ways for improvement. The audits are conducted by an external audit firm, carried out using the Philips Supplier Sustainability Audit Tool and cover the entire site, not just the production lines set up exclusively for Philips products.


Philips has direct relations with approximately 10,000 product and component suppliers and 30,000 service providers. Given the size and complexity of our supply chain we need to focus our efforts and develop an approach based on the supplier’s sustainability risk profile, related to spending, country of production, business risk and type of supplier relationship. All risk suppliers are by definition part of our audit program.



Manage risk
If non-conformances are identified during an audit, Philips expects the supplier to take the initiative to resolve the issues involved. Philips will work with the supplier to define a corrective action plan, specifying the required steps, milestones and responsibilities.


Philips sustainability experts are available to support the supplier development by training, sharing best practices, defining corrective action plans, and monitoring their implementation. Adequate implementation of corrective actions is verified during resolving audits.


Child labor policy
We also specify our expectations of suppliers in incidents of child labor. Under our child labor policy suppliers are expected to follow the three H’s approach as set out in the ILO guide for employers on child labor:

putting a stop to underage Hiring

removing children from tasks where the risks from Hazards are high

reducing Hours to the legal level


Work with stakeholders
Engaging with relevant stakeholders, including industry organizations, civil society organizations and governments, helps us to further improve our programs.


A consistent message from multiple customers to suppliers is needed to leverage impact. Alignment can come from collaboration within the industry, which is why Philips joined the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) in 2006.

 

Sustainable Trade Initiative IDH
Philips is one of the initiators of the IDH Electronics Program, an innovative multi-stakeholder initiative sponsored by the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH) together with Dell, HP, Philips and civil society organizations. The program will work with over 100 electronics suppliers in China to support innovative workforce management practices, sustainability and better business performance. The goal is to improve the working conditions of more than 500,000 employees in the electronics sector.

Last Updated: December 12, 2011

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires manufacturers and retailers doing business in the State of California to disclose information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. At LeapFrog, we are committed to:

a standard of excellence in every aspect of our business and in every corner of the world;

ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations;

respect for the rights of all individuals; and

respect for the environment.

As part of this commitment, LeapFrog maintains and enforces written policies and procedures that strictly prohibit the use of slavery or human trafficking in its direct supply chain. We continue to update these policies and procedures as needed to ensure that we have appropriate safeguards against any mistreatment of persons involved in our direct supply chain. Currently, LeapFrog’s efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain include the following:

Supply Chain Verification

LeapFrog is an active member of The International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI), an association committed on behalf of its member companies to the operation of toy factories in a lawful, safe, and healthful manner. ICTI upholds the principles that no underage, forced, or prison labor should be employed; that no one is denied a job because of gender, ethnic origin, religion, affiliation or association, and that factories comply with laws protecting the environment. LeapFrog uses only manufacturers that have been certified by ICTI as compliant with its ICTI’s Code of Business Practices.

Supplier Audits

Prior to engaging a contract manufacturer, we examine every aspect of its business, including employee welfare and social responsibility. Having a “Seal of Compliance” from ICTI CARE (Caring, Awareness, Responsible, Ethical) Process audit is one of the key aspects being considered during supplier selection as it reflects supplier compliance with our standards for, among other things, trafficking and slavery in supply chains. “ICTI CARE Process” is a toy industry ethical manufacturing program aimed at ensuring safe and humane workplace environments for toy factory workers worldwide. These unannounced audits are conducted annually by an independent certified third party auditing agency.

Supplier Certification

We require all of our contract manufacturers to sign our Materials Sourcing and Manufacturing Agreement (MSMA) which prohibits the incorporation of materials in our product that do not comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country in which they are doing business. The MSMA also requires our contract manufacturers to abide by LeapFrog’s Supplier Code of Conduct which prohibits the use of forced or involuntary labor and requires adherence to all applicable laws and regulations.

Internal Accountability Standards

Leapfrog’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires all employees to comply with all applicable laws, including those regarding slavery and trafficking. Employees who do not comply with the law or who violate the Code are subject to disciplinary action which includes termination of employment.

Training

LeapFrog trains employees responsible for supply chain management on certification of our suppliers, including compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits slavery and human trafficking. All employees receive training regarding our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes compliance with all applicable laws."	Yes

Levi Strauss & Co.’s commitment to responsible business practices - embodied in our Global Sourcing and Operational Guidelines - guides our decisions and behavior as a company everywhere we do business. Since becoming the first multinational to establish such guidelines in 1991, Levi Strauss & Co. has used them to help improve the lives of workers manufacturing our products, make responsible sourcing decisions, and protect our commercial interests. The guidelines are a cornerstone of our business relationships with hundreds of contractors worldwide.

Levi Strauss & Co. utilizes Country Assessment Guidelines, which are part of the Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, to help assess any country-level issues that might present concern in light of the ethical principles we have set for ourselves. The Guidelines assist Levi Strauss & Co. in understanding risks and opportunities associated with conducting business in specific countries, including forced and prison labor.

Our Terms of Engagement (TOE), the contractor-specific component of our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, specify the requirements by which all of our contract factories and licensees must abide — including ethical standards, legal requirements, environmental requirements and community involvement. They also set out employment standards and specifically address issues of child labor, forced labor, disciplinary practices, working hours, wages and benefits, freedom of association, discrimination, and health and safety. Learn more about the TOE and our product sourcing requirements. Our risk assessment is performed internally.

2. Levi Strauss & Co. conducts audits of our suppliers based on the conditions outlined in our Terms of Engagement. We employ full-time factory assessors, located around the world where our suppliers are. These experts understand the scope of our labor and environment, health and safety standards and know the local languages, laws, culture and business context of each country in which we operate. They conduct regular assessments of every factory contracted to manufacture our products. These assessments are based on standards found in our Social and Environmental Sustainability Guidebook, which all our suppliers receive in their local language. These assessments involve on-site and off-site discussions with workers, management interviews, review of factory records (such as timecards and payroll) and environment, health and safety inspections. Each assessment identifies areas for improvement and a detailed corrective action plan, including actions, responsible parties, and timelines. Regular follow-up visits are also conducted, to ensure suppliers are completing their corrective action plans on a timely basis.

We conduct both announced and unannounced audits that are performed by a third-party monitors or trained employees. We use third-party monitors for our product licensee suppliers of non-core products, including belts, watches, glasses and other accessories, and to supplement our own monitoring efforts. All third-party monitors used for our direct and licensee suppliers must be approved by Levi Strauss & Co. through a process that involves interviews and screening for proper qualifications. Once screened, the candidates must attend a Levi Strauss &Co. assessor training and pass an assessment review that includes a one-on-one, post-training interview with a Levi Strauss & Co. senior TOE assessor and a “shadow audit” in the field. Approximately 70 individual third-party monitors currently are approved to conduct TOE assessments in licensee factories.

  



3. Levi Strauss & Co.’s purchasing agreements require all suppliers to comply with applicable laws within the country of business, as well as our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines and our Terms of Engagement regarding forced and prison labor.

4. Levi Strauss & Co. maintains and enforces internal accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding company standards in slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non- compliance, Levi Strauss & Co. reserves the right to examine the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non-compliance are not resolved within a timely manner, Levi Strauss & Co. may terminate the business relationship. While Levi Strauss & Co. wishes to aid in the resolution of incidences of human trafficking and slavery within Levi Strauss & Co.’s supply chain, it is not possible to effectively solve the issue of noncompliance without the cooperation of the supplier.

5. Levi Strauss & Co. conducts internal training on the Worldwide Code of Business Conduct annually to ensure we provide our employees with a clear set of standards and guidance for conducting our business with integrity and the highest degree of compliance with the law.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain.  Lockheed Martin is committed to ensuring that its employees and suppliers take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and slavery from occurring in any aspects of its supply chain. In accordance with the Act, Lockheed Martin makes the following disclosures:

Verification of Supply Chain
Lockheed Martin verifies product supply chains through several methods, including site evaluations, inspections, verification of government debarred and denied parties lists and other means. Third parties are not utilized for verification. Lockheed Martin requires all suppliers agree as a condition of contract that they will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. With respect to suppliers outside the United States, suppliers are required to comply with their local laws as well as applicable laws of the United States.

Evaluation of Supplier Compliance
Lockheed Martin does not conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards specifically for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. For anyone who observes conduct contrary to the principles set forth in Lockheed Martin’s “Setting the Standard”, Lockheed Martin maintains an ethics hotline at 1-800-LM-ETHIC. The ethics hotline number is included in all supply contracts. Lockheed Martin promptly investigates all reported matters and takes action as needed, including disclosure to governmental authorities as appropriate.

Supplier Certification
Lockheed Martin requires as a condition of contract that all suppliers commit to comply with applicable laws and regulations, but does not require suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Internal Accountability Standards
Lockheed Martin maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. Lockheed Martin has implemented several internal policies addressing this requirement. Corporate Policy Statement (CPS)-021 Good Corporate Citizenship and Respect for Human Rights, which states that Lockheed Martin seeks to improve the global society in which we operate, advance technological and economic development, communicate honestly and forthrightly, and hold ourselves accountable to deliver consistently what we promise to our stakeholders (customers, stockholders, employees, partners, suppliers, and communities); and minimize any negative consequences of our business activities. In furtherance of the foregoing the policy identifies specific principles, including:

promoting fair employment practices,

providing fair and competitive wages,

prohibiting harassment, bullying, and discrimination, use of child or forced labor,

trafficking in persons for any purpose.

Lockheed Martin also expects our suppliers to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with Lockheed Martin’s code of conduct, Setting the Standard and the principles expressed in CPS-021 and includes provisions in its supply contracts addressing this expectation. Additionally, Lockheed Martin has implemented CPS-734 Trafficking in Persons establishing requirements for compliance with the United States Government’s zero tolerance policy on trafficking in persons. Employees and covered supply chain contractors are required to comply with the Lockheed Martin policies and Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons.

Management Training
Lockheed Martin provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. Lockheed Martin sends periodic communications to suppliers informing them about the risk of human trafficking and slavery and their obligations to comply with all applicable laws and regulations."

186	"The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires that effective January 1, 2012, retailers and manufacturers with $100 million of annual worldwide revenue and doing business in the state publically disclose their efforts to eliminate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. The purpose of this law is to allow consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. 

As outlined in our Standards of Business Conduct, LSI is dedicated to conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner and it is our expectation that our suppliers also conduct themselves in a similar socially responsible manner. LSI acknowledges and implements the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct which defines performance, compliance, auditing and reporting guidelines across five areas of social responsibility: (1) Labor, (2) Health and Safety, (3) Environmental, (4) Management Systems and (5) Ethics. This code also reflects international labor and human rights standards such as the rights to: freely choose employment; join or be represented by labor unions or workers’ councils in accordance with local laws; and a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. The requirement to comply with the EICC Code of Conduct is cascaded to all our suppliers that manufacture or process LSI products through our Supplier Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Requirements. Awareness training on LSI’s process to ensure our subcontract manufacturers meet social responsibility requirements which includes but is not limited to a ban on human trafficking and slavery is appropriately communicated to responsible managers and is reflected in LSI’s Employee EH&S Handbook. 

To verify compliance with LSI and EICC Code of Conduct requirements prohibiting forced labor and child labor, we require that our subcontract manufacturers complete our Web-based Supplier Evaluation for Social Responsibility and Environmental Performance assessment questionnaire. Responses to the questionnaire are internally reviewed and verified through announced audits conducted as part of LSI’s internal audit program. Findings which do not meet our requirements are addressed through corrective action programs. ​​"	Yes

Contractual requirements: As condition of doing business, our purchase order standard terms and conditions require that the supplier comply with all applicable laws, including laws related to slavery, human trafficking and child labor in those countries in which they do business.

Xcerra Standards of Business Conduct: Xcerra’s Business Conduct and Ethics Policy establishes mandatory rules and guidelines for Xcerra’s employees. These standards require adherence to all applicable laws and regulations, which would include adherence to laws prohibiting forced or compulsory labor practices.

188	"our efforts to prevent human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain

Our partners around the globe make it possible for us to develop and create beautiful product. As we do not own our manufacturing facilities, we take great care in the selection of our vendors, and our process screens out any that don't share our values. We have a strong Vendor Code of Ethics program, with requirements that all partners must uphold.

the issue: International Labor Organization research shows that there are at least 12.3 million victims of forced labor worldwide and that women and children are particularly vulnerable. Although the issue is not new, recent legislation in California has provided the opportunity for an industry-wide conversation about the steps brands are taking to eliminate human rights violations in their supply chains. Our disclosure for the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB657) outlines the steps we’re taking in this area, ensuring our vendors meet internationally recognized standards and our Vendor Code of Ethics requirements.

our stand: We’re committed to upholding ethical sourcing practices globally, to protect the lives, freedom and wellbeing of all individuals who take part in manufacturing our products. Our Vendor Code of Ethics clearly outlines six zero tolerance policies, including forced and bonded labour. Our zero tolerance policy toward forced and bonded labour includes, but is not limited to, involuntary overtime and prison, indentured or bonded labour. We require that all work must be completed on a voluntary and legal basis. This means that employees must be free to move and/or resign from their role, be free to leave at the end of their shift or under extenuating circumstances, and employers must not engage in illegal practices that restrict their employees’ freedom of movement (such as retaining identity documents, charging recruitment fees or deposits, withholding wages, barring exits, or using physical constraints).

verification: We work with industry organizations, stakeholder groups and other brands to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Compliance with our Vendor Code of Ethics is a non-negotiable pre-condition to start and maintain a business relationship with us. All manufacturing partners, including cut and sew facilities, mills and subcontractors, are required to uphold our Vendor Code of Ethics requirements. Facility audits are done by our in-house team of experts and our third party auditing partners.

auditing: To ensure that our vendors uphold our requirements, we conduct announced, semi-announced, and unannounced audits, as well as regular follow-up visits and verification. Frequent visits and audits are an opportunity for us to strengthen our relationship, enhance transparency, and work together on preventive actions. At a minimum, we require all facilities to be audited annually. Each audit is conducted over two days, at least, depending on the size of the facility. During an audit and any follow up visit, auditors meet with management, tour every part of the site (including dormitories and canteens where applicable), review documents and interview employees at all levels of the organization.

certification: Our Vendor Code of Ethics applies to every vendor partnership that we form, and vendors must sign a Certificate of Compliance before beginning a relationship with us. In our Vendor Code of Ethics, we also have a zero tolerance policy toward unapproved subcontractors, facilities and homework, and vendors who are not open, transparent and cooperative; this allows us to know exactly who is producing our product, and how it’s being produced. All of our manufacturing partners must abide by the laws of the country in which they are doing business. In cases when there is a difference between requirements of local law, international law and our Vendor Code of Ethics, the most stringent standard applies.

accountability: If forced or bonded labour are found during a pre-production facility audit, we do not start business with the vendor and we require that they correct the problem immediately. If one of our existing vendors were found to be complicit in any form of forced or bonded labour, we would require the vendor to address and correct the problem immediately, and we would launch an investigation into the issue. Our approach to manufacturing is to establish and maintain long-term partners that share our values and, where applicable, help develop preventive action plans to address and correct issues that arise. In extreme cases of systemic non-compliance or violation of our zero tolerance policies, we reserve the right terminate the business partnership.

training and education: We work to protect the integrity of our supply chain by educating our vendors, auditors, and our internal teams about human trafficking and slavery. We regularly engage with industry organizations and other brands to stay abreast of the latest developments, issues and regulations.

We welcome your feedback on our disclosure and our efforts to prevent human trafficking and slavery; please email us at partnersustainability@lululemon.com."	Yes
189	"The following are Lutron’s response to each key point described in the The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.

The extent that Lutron:

I. Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.

Lutron’s purchasing personnel routinely conduct on-site inspections of certain strategic suppliers. Suppliers are graded on several factors, including observed human rights issues and adherence to Lutron’s Supplier Code of Conduct (available at: /supplier-terms-conditions). Verification is conducted by employees of Lutron and its affiliated companies.

II. Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit. 

Currently, Lutron performs on-site and off-site audits of suppliers for multiple factors, including adherence to Lutron’s Standard Terms and Conditions of Purchase and Lutron’s Supplier Code of Conduct (see references below).

191	"Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, affiliates of Macy’s, Inc., require all of our suppliers to comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the United States, and those of the respective country of manufacture or exportation. In accordance with the California Transparency Supply Chains Act (SB 657), Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s efforts to address human trafficking and slavery in the direct supply chain, which include both private and national brands, are described herein. In addition to the efforts described, the company maintains an open dialogue with non-governmental organizations and socially responsible investor groups regarding developments in this arena.

Verification

Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s supply and legal executives meet on an annual basis, and informally as needed, to assess the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our supply chains and to assess whether our policies and procedures appropriately address those risks.

Audits

At Macy’s, independent third party monitors conduct annual compliance audits of our private brand suppliers to identify possible areas of non-compliance with our Vendor and Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Vendor Code”) or potential risks in Macy’s private brands supply chain, while contractually holding our national brand suppliers to the same level of due diligence. Macy’s will not tolerate, and will investigate, any reports alleging human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain. Action is taken against any supplier for non-compliance, resulting in possible termination of the business relationship. Indeed, from 2011-2013, non-compliance with the Vendor Code has resulted in termination of over 70 factories. Macy’s does not conduct audits of suppliers that provide us with national brand products.

At Bloomingdale’s, independent third party monitors also conduct annual compliance audits of certain private brand suppliers under the same process outlined above. Bloomingdale’s contractually holds our national brand suppliers and certain other private brand suppliers, who supply the vast majority of the products we offer for sale, to the same level of due diligence. Bloomingdale’s will not tolerate, and will investigate, any reports alleging human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain. Action is taken against any supplier for non-compliance, resulting in possible termination of the business relationship.

Certification

All Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s suppliers must adhere to our Vendor Code, which includes language strictly prohibiting human trafficking and slavery. The Vendor Code incorporates local laws and is based on international standards, such as International Labor Organization (ILO) and United Nations (UN) regulations. The Vendor Code states that all suppliers must also comply with the country of manufacture’s labor laws, whichever is stricter.

Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s also include requirements of adherence to the Vendor Code in our Vendor Standards and Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, and we send periodic communications to suppliers making them aware of new laws or revisions to existing laws as appropriate. By accepting each and every purchase order, Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s suppliers confirm their understanding and agreement to the standards set forth in the Vendor Code.

Human trafficking and slavery verbiage is also included in the Master Contract we enter into with Macy’s private brand suppliers and certain Bloomingdale’s private brand suppliers. Suppliers that produce these private brands agree to comply with the Vendor Code through confirmation and acknowledgement in writing.

Internal Accountability

Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s associates adhere to an employee Code of Conduct that informs them about the requirements of the Vendor Code of Conduct relating to human trafficking.

Training

The issue of human trafficking is addressed annually in Code of Conduct or General Legal Compliance Training. Over the past 3 years, more than 20,000 Macy’s, Inc. employees have received this training each year. Employees responsible for supply chain-related decisions for private brands at Macy’s and certain private brands at Bloomingdale’s receive more detailed training on identifying and addressing human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain.

Our Policy in Action

Macy’s, Inc.’s commitment to addressing human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain is illustrated by our relationship with GoodWeave™ Rugs.

In spring 2011, Macy’s introduced a collection of decorative area rugs that have been certified by GoodWeave™, an international organization that works to ensure rugs made by hand in Nepal and India are free of child labor. The collection is carried in 10 Macy’s stores nationwide. By buying a beautiful hand-crafted rug at Macy’s with the GoodWeave label, shoppers are helping to support families and build sustainable communities in Nepal and India, nations where poverty is widespread. GoodWeave-certified rugs are woven by skilled adult artisans, permitting educational opportunities for children who otherwise might be required to work.

194	"Responsible Manufacturing1

As a global leader in the toy industry, Mattel believes that how we achieve success is just as important as the success itself. We strive to ensure that our toys are manufactured in a responsible manner, and our standards and oversight processes continue to evolve to reflect those expectations for ethical labor practices and environmental stewardship. 

Launched in 1997, Mattel's Global Manufacturing Principles (GMP) represent the company's ongoing commitment to responsible manufacturing around the world. Mattel's GMP address a spectrum of ethical sourcing issues designed to ensure that the people who make our products are treated fairly and with respect, including creating an environment that embraces the cultural, ethnic and philosophical differences. In addition, GMP also includes standards for workplace heath and safety practices and environmental stewardship. Our principles specifically address such topics as payment of regular wages and overtime, working hours and living conditions. A core element of GMP is ensuring employees meet minimum legal age requirements and that they are seeking employment of their own free will. Mattel has a zero-tolerance policy for the employment of underage workers and forced labor of any kind, including the use of prison labor, indentured servitude/trafficking or for the restriction of free movement. 

Right from the start of a business relationship, Mattel communicates its expectations for ethical sourcing performance to vendors contracted to manufacture finished products.2 Contracts clearly communicate our GMP and establish the obligations of the vendor to both implement GMP and comply with laws addressing safe and just working conditions in the country or countries where they do business. 

Mattel’s corporate responsibility function engages with our manufacturing and product sourcing functions to ensure awareness of GMP requirements and help develop tools to track the GMP performance of our own factories, as well as the progress of our vendors. Mattel conducts periodic unannounced audits of both our owned and operated factories and our vendors to verify and document performance.3 A factory must address a zero-tolerance finding immediately and correct other findings according to an agreed timeline and corrective action plan. 

Mattel is also an active participant of the global toy industry's initiative to continuously improve factory working conditions, commonly referred to as the ICTI CARE Process (ICP). The ICP is based on a code of ethical operating practices comparable to Mattel's own GMP. Designed to promote safe and just working conditions in toy factories, the ICP provides the industry with a unified approach to responsible manufacturing. Mattel has committed to manufacture our products in factories that participate in the ICP process. Toy factories registered with ICTI CARE are audited at least annually for compliance to the ICP Code of Conduct. Audits are conducted by an independent professional audit company that has been approved and trained by the ICTI CARE Foundation. Factories that complete an audit and meet the requirements of the ICP are then issued the ICP Seal of Compliance. 

As part of Mattel ethical sourcing verification efforts, compliance status reports summarizing the results of GMP audits and ICP audits are considered when placing new orders. Mattel maintains accountability standards and procedures for our factories and vendors that do not meet GMP or ICTI CARE standards including the monthly tracking of corrective actions and restrictions on the placement of new business. In addition, Mattel employees are subject to our Code of Conduct. Employees responsible for oversight and implementation of ethical sourcing practices receive GMP training and our factory-based human resource professionals receive specific instruction regarding the prevention of forced labor and human trafficking. 

Beyond our finished-good vendors, the current scope of our efforts to verify or obtain certification of ethical sourcing practices and related legal requirements for materials is focused on paper and wood fiber. As part of our Sustainable Sourcing Principles, Mattel has communicated a preference for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified materials. FSC certification aids in verifying that paper and wood fiber were produced by operations that comply with ethical labor practices. 

Transparency has been an important part of Mattel's social compliance philosophy for years. Summaries of ICP audits for Mattel owned and operated factories are provided so that our stakeholders can make an independent assessment of our progress. We recognize the importance of transparency as a tool to drive continuous improvement and we are working with ICTI CARE to identify means to advance the transparency of factory reporting. 

Mattel was one of the first corporations to adopt the practice of publicly reporting independent audit results of factory working conditions. For more than a decade, the Sethi International Center for Corporate Accountability (ICCA) conducted independent audits of Mattel owned and operated facilities in all countries where we manufacture toys and publicly reported its findings. ICCA also conducted independent audits of a cross section of Mattel’s vendors to ensure compliance with laws addressing safe and just working conditions. In 2009, Mattel transitioned to utilizing the ICP as the primary means for independent assessment of social compliance performance of our manufacturing activities.

Supplier Verification and Certification

As part of our supplier approval process, we have certain suppliers complete a supplier evaluation form, which helps us assess potential risks in our supply chain. Our supplier evaluation form includes questions that directly address our suppliers' compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The supplier verification process is performed by Mattson Technology personnel, and not by a third party.

Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed---signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of customers in diverse geographical locations. Our products are marketed worldwide through a direct---sales and applications organization as well distributors. We primarily manufacture our own wafers and, to a lesser extent, utilize third party foundries to produce wafers. We rely on our fabrication facilities to implement manufacturing requirements and also utilize unaffiliated manufacturing and assembly subcontractors, located in the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Maxim expects its suppliers to operate in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which they operate and to implement the principles of Maxim’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Code of Corporate Social Responsibility. The following represents Maxim’s efforts in this area:

Internal Accountability and Training Maxim’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Code of Corporate and Social Responsibility express Maxim’s commitment to promote honest, ethical and lawful conduct in the workplace as well as social and environmental responsibility. Maxim is committed to provide a safe and healthy workplace where employees are treated with respect and dignity and to have environmentally responsible manufacturing operations. All employees are required to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and violations may subject employees to disciplinary actions, including termination of employment. Maxim expects its independent contractors, consultants, agents, vendors and sales representatives to apply the same standards of ethical business practices as required of Maxim employees. Maxim is dedicated to continuous improvement and may implement measures in the future to mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking throughout its supply chain, including, without limitation, training Maxim personnel with direct responsibility for supply chain management.

Risk Assessment and Audits Maxim communicates its supplier standards and requirements, including, without limitation, the prohibition on child labor and involuntary labor, whether forced, bonded, indentured labor, on its website and in written agreements with its suppliers. Maxim performs risk assessments of its key suppliers via self---assessment questionnaires to determine compliance with Maxim’s standards and requirements, including quality and safety. Key suppliers identified as high---risk may be subject to on---site audits conducted by Maxim, including, without limitation, inspection of the supplier’s facilities, quality control procedures and environmental management systems. Maxim is expanding its current Supplier Self---Audit Program to implement a new supplier self---certification program in 2012 that will include inquiries into their efforts to eliminate slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain.

Supply Chain Verification and Certification Maxim believes that workers at its supplier’s facilities should be treated with respect and dignity with the right to freely choose employment. Involuntary labor, whether it is forced, bonded, or indentured labor, should be eliminated from the workplace. To this end, Maxim expects its direct suppliers to comply with Maxim’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Code of Corporate Social Responsibility. This requirement is included in contractual agreements and published on Maxim’s website. Ensuring compliance with Maxim’s standard and requirements is an evolving process. Maxim’s proposed new supplier self--- certification program will assist Maxim in verifying direct key suppliers’ compliance with local laws, including eradication of slavery and human trafficking for materials incorporated into Maxim products. While the focus is currently on key suppliers, Maxim is developing a process to expand its supplier certification program to include all other suppliers. Those suppliers determined by Maxim to be noncompliant will be identified and provided an opportunity to remedy such non---compliance. Failure to comply will be deemed a material breach of supplier’s obligations to Maxim and may result in termination as a Maxim supplier."	Yes

v. 20 November 2012

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the ""Act”) requires certain companies to disclose their efforts (if any) to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. As a responsible corporate citizen, Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (""Maxwell”) fully supports the elimination of human trafficking and slavery from the supply chain. Maxwell complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations where we manufacture products, and expects that our suppliers do so as well. We believe that our business relationships are grounded on a foundation of integrity, honesty and fairness. We develop relationships with carefully selected suppliers who are committed to responsible business practices. Maxwell does not condone the use of slavery or human trafficking and does not knowingly do business with any supplier who engages in such practice.

For certain suppliers, Maxwell reviews particular aspects of the business and operations practices before engaging the supplier to do business with us on a continuous basis. Additionally, for these certain suppliers, Maxwell performs on-site audits of the supplier and its facilities to determine if the business and operations practices of the supplier satisfy Maxwell’s missions and goals. Furthermore, Maxwell is currently reviewing our options in the future, as such things as particularized training, audits, and procedures become available. As stated in Maxwell’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, Maxwell has and continues to declare its support for the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (the ""EICC”) which established standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible. Furthermore, Maxwell and its employees therefore agree to actively pursue conformance of our activities to the EICC and its standards.

McCormick Statement regarding California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the ""Act"") went into effect in the State of California. This law aims to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking. 

It has always been important that materials used by McCormick in our products are obtained through ethical and fair labor conditions. In general, McCormick's agricultural products are acquired from suppliers who ultimately source raw materials from small individual farms managed by family farmers. In all countries where we process products, our products are processed in facilities that comply with existing local laws. In our processing facilities (foreign and domestic), employees are provided with fair wages, regular working hours, and a clean working environment.

McCormick's Supplier Code of Conduct makes clear our commitment to fair labor standards and helps ensure that we align ourselves with suppliers that share this commitment. This Code of Conduct states that all vendors, suppliers and contractors who wish to conduct business with McCormick are required to conform with certain principles and practices, such as the following:

Compliance with applicable laws, including those pertinent to equal employment opportunities, wages and benefits, and worker and product safety. 

Fair employment practices, including those prohibiting child labor, prison or forced labor, or any form of indentured servitude with stipulations of fair working hours and compensation as well for a safe working environment. 

Ethical business conduct based on compliance with the law, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and respect for the environment. 

We seek to ensure that quality, safety and employment standards are maintained throughout our supply chain and we review our supplier base to determine if corrective actions are needed. Our efforts so far in aligning with the Act's requirements include the following:

Verification and audit of product supply chains

While our Supplier Code of Conduct has been in place for several years, we are now designing a risk-based verification process to identify high-risk suppliers and developing an appropriate responsible-sourcing audit approach to ensure our product suppliers are in compliance with our Code of Conduct.

Contracting Practices

McCormick's Supplier Code of Conduct is designed to be embedded into our procurement practices (and thereby help assure such procurement is free from slavery and human trafficking) by:

Including references to the Code of Conduct in major request for quotations; 

Incorporating language in all supply agreements and contracts requiring suppliers to warrant compliance with the Code of Conduct and acknowledge that any known violation may result in immediate termination of any and all business; 

Providing a link to the Code of Conduct in purchase order terms and conditions stating that acceptance of the purchase order constitutes an agreement to adhere to the latest version of the Code of Conduct; 

Requiring acknowledgment of the Code of Conduct as part of an all new suppliers onboarding process; and 

Issuing the latest Code of Conduct to our current supplier community and allowing access to a website that uploads any revisions in the future. 

Internal accountability and staff training

It is the Company's policy to be a good ""corporate citizen,"" as set forth in our Business Ethics Policy (see ir.mccormick.com under ""Corporate Governance,"" then ""Business Ethics Policy). Wherever we do business, our employees are required to comply with all applicable laws. As well, a training program is being developed that will provide appropriate employees with training on how to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and slavery beginning in the first half of our 2012 fiscal year.

Industry Collaboration

In many cases, we are not the only food company working with a given supplier. One of the reasons we are transparent about our suppliers is to reach out to other food brands and organizations to see how we can work together in the factories we share. By getting the rest of the industry involved, we are able to send a stronger message to our suppliers about the importance of operating a responsible workplace.

To aid in our collaboration efforts, we are an active member of Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), which is an organization that, among other pursuits, brings together a broad range of agriculture, food, and beverage companies—including farms, processors, manufacturers, retailers, and restaurants—to help integrate corporate responsibility into core business strategies.

201	"Micrel, Inc. Statement Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 	  	 

  	  	  	 

  	

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (effective January 1, 2012) requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California, like Micrel, to disclose certain information regarding their efforts to address the risk of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains.

 

Micrel is a leading global manufacturer of integrated circuit (IC) solutions for the worldwide analog, Ethernet and high bandwidth markets. Micrel’s ability to manufacture its products depends on timely supply of IC fabrication, assembly and test services, which generally entail close interaction with our suppliers, including periodic visits to major supplier sites.

 

Micrel is committed to conducting business in an ethical, legal and responsible manner and is unequivocally opposed to slavery and human trafficking. Micrel requires its suppliers to review and comply with its Standards for Social Responsibility which follow the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct. Specifically, under the Standards for Social Responsibility, Micrel’s suppliers are subject to the following prohibitions:

 

  no forced labor is allowed and employees must be free to leave employment after reasonable notice;

  no child labor (under age 15) may be used;

  no form of harsh or inhumane treatment, including sexual harassment, sexual abuse, mental or physical coercion or any other form of intimidation may

    be tolerated or permitted.

 

Micrel has a formal review process with its suppliers to ensure adherence to the Standards for Social Responsibility. It also conducts on-site audits of its major suppliers to evaluate compliance with these requirements."	Yes
202	"While technology can be used to facilitate the insidious practice of human trafficking, technology can also help combat it.

Microsoft is applying its experience in addressing technology-facilitated crime and investing in research, programs and partnerships to support human rights and advance the fight against human trafficking.

Issues related to human trafficking are particularly complex and there is no simple solution. Effective action in this fight is possible only through strong public-private partnerships and cooperation with intervention efforts that are founded in solid research and a nuanced understanding of the implications, consequences and impacts of action.

Background

Awareness of human trafficking issues and the mobilization of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governments and socially-responsible businesses to fight trafficking may well be at an all- time high, but the world has only scratched the surface in understanding the role that technology plays in facilitating human trafficking, let alone the multitude of ways that technology can be effectively employed to help fight it. Commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor and other forms of modern-day slavery are all horrific abuses of human rights in which technology considerations may be relevant. Unfortunately, due to the lack of evidence-based research, we do not know if there are more human trafficking victims as a result of technology, nor if law enforcement or NGOs can better identify perpetrators and victims through technology. There is also limited scientific research to understand which technological interventions might be most effective in this fight and which may hold unintended consequences that could end up doing more harm than good. In a world of limited resources, such complexity and uncertainty of knowledge results in wasteful, ineffective global investments. Advances in socio-technical research, privacy, interoperability and data sharing offer great potential to better employ technology to help address trafficking across jurisdictions, borders and agencies.

Anti-trafficking advocates, law enforcement and governments have long been working to combat human trafficking globally. However, similar to the fight against other forms of technology-facilitated crime, Microsoft believes technology companies also have an important role to play in driving deeper research and innovation to employ technology in effective disruption of the human trafficking trade. It is both a technology issue and a human rights issue, making cross-sector cooperation essential.

Microsoft’s Approach

Microsoft recognizes its responsibility as a global corporate citizen to respect human rights and aid in the fight against human trafficking. Microsoft’s approach builds on the Microsoft Global Human Rights Statement released in July 2012 in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Through the breadth of its products and services, as well as Microsoft Research’s long history of collaborations with the academic community and the work of the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit and the newly established Microsoft Technology and Human Rights Center, Microsoft has a unique opportunity to work with a range of stakeholders in combating trafficking globally. This effort includes:

1. Research and Informed Innovation: The first step to effective action is ensuring a strong baseline understanding of the problem and the potential impact of interventions. Human trafficking is an evolving issue and Microsoft is committed to investing in research and partnerships to drive a more scientific understanding of the role of technology in child sex trafficking. In December 2011, Microsoft Research and the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit issued a request for proposals to advance academic research in the field. Six research teams were sponsored with Microsoft’s $185,000 grant focused on the role of technology in the advertising and sale of child sex trafficking victims and the purchase of victims by johns, with results anticipated to be released later in 2013. Microsoft is also collaborating with Harvard Kennedy School of Government and the University of Southern California Annenberg School on additional research, and is working with leading computer science institutions and NGOs on efforts such as the International Girls Only Hackathon which empower girls to be producers of technology innovation for this problem. It is Microsoft’s sincere hope that through this research and continued collaboration across academia, government, law enforcement, NGOs and industry, we can help build a stronger foundation for progress in the fight against trafficking.

2. Partnerships: Microsoft has a long history of working with organizations and experts in diverse fields to help address some of the world’s most pressing challenges and partnership will be essential in the fight against human trafficking. Microsoft has similarly been working with leading advocates and law enforcement agencies globally to help protect children against technology-facilitated sexual exploitation, and with the help of partners such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and through international initiatives such as PhotoDNA, we’re beginning to see progress in the disruption of child pornography online. Today, PhotoDNA image-matching technology is used by NGOs, law enforcement and companies like Facebook, NetClean and Microsoft to help victims of sexual exploitation. Microsoft is a member of the Global Business Coalition Against Trafficking and is also working with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Council on Women and Girls as well as with leading U.S. state attorneys general, UN.GIFT, local police agencies and others on a variety of public-private initiatives to address human trafficking. In September 2010, Microsoft also joined the Thorn Foundation as a founding member of a technology task force with Facebook, Twitter, Google and others to explore new ways technology can address the child sex trafficking problem. In addition, Microsoft provides support for NGOs who are working to combat trafficking and support victims more broadly in communities and regions around the world, such as the Polaris Project, International Justice Mission and many more. Also, through partnerships, nonprofits and businesses, the Microsoft YouthSpark program aims to positively empower youth worldwide to imagine and realize their full potential by connecting them with greater education, employment and entrepreneurship opportunities.

3. Policies and Best Practices: As a technology service provider, Microsoft has a stake in ensuring its technologies and processes are not contributing to exploitation, including in its operations and those of its suppliers. All companies doing business with Microsoft must agree to abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct, which outlines required ethical business practices, employment practices, and compliance with environmental and worker safety requirements, and explicitly prohibits use of forced labor. Microsoft has invested heavily in a supply chain social and environmental accountability program for its hardware manufacturers, which includes independent third-party auditing to help ensure the Microsoft Supplier Code of Conduct and local and national regulations are met and/or exceeded by its packaging and hardware suppliers. If these standards are not met, suppliers risk remedial action including termination of their contract. Microsoft also uses technologies such as PhotoDNA on Bing, SkyDrive and Hotmail to help mitigate use of its online services for child sexual exploitation and the distribution of child pornography.

4. Disruption: As with many other forms of technology-facilitated crime, Microsoft believes that disruptive action can and will serve an important role in shifting the dynamics that fuel the trafficking trade. Through cooperative efforts that raise the costs, risks and difficulty of doing business for traffickers, we can make it a less appealing trade. While it is virtually impossible to eliminate all crime, there exists great potential to have a dramatic positive impact on the problem. Microsoft is working with leaders in the anti-trafficking community to collaborate on creative research-founded disruptive approaches to human trafficking.



Best Practice Recommendations

Microsoft supports the enactment and enforcement of human trafficking laws that recognize and protect victims while holding traffickers accountable.

Researchers and technology companies should continue to work proactively with governments, law enforcement, advocates and others in the anti-trafficking community to help understand and address the abuses of technology to facilitate trafficking, investigate effective research-based intervention techniques and establish industry best practices and guidance. Best practices can include investment in scientific research, enforcement of codes of conduct, the provision of mechanisms for customers to report potential problems, increased visibility of trafficking hotlines and information for victims and cooperation with non-governmental organizations and law enforcement on anti-trafficking initiatives.

203	"The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (“Act”) went into effect in the State of California on January 1, 2012. The Act seeks the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires that large companies who do business in California disclose their efforts toward the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by answering the questions below.

MillerCoors was formed in July 2008 as a joint venture of SABMiller and Molson Coors, and continues to evolve and implement best policies and practices. As a company, we have adopted and utilized our Responsible Sourcing Principles since 2008, to ensure that basic human rights are acknowledged and respected by both our own procurement initiatives and the initiatives of our suppliers. The principles provide guidance regarding business conduct, working conditions, forced employment, child labor, wages, diversity, freedom of association and environmental issues. A copy of our Responsible Sourcing Principles can be found in our Supplier Code of Conduct here. In addition, in 2011 MillerCoors joined the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) program. This program provides MillerCoors the ability to evaluate select suppliers’ policies relative to human trafficking and slavery via its self-assessment questionnaire and risk reporting features.



The sustainable development of our company is a key priority in building our business the right way. Our sustainable development practices include efforts around ethics and transparency, alcohol responsibility, environmental sustainability, sustainable supply chain and people & community investment. More information regarding our sustainable development efforts can be found in our Sustainable Development Report here.



Specific responses to the questions in the Act are listed below.

Does your company

(1) Engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery?

MillerCoors assesses its Top 100 Suppliers (by spend) relative to sustainability risk, including human trafficking and slavery. Select suppliers are engaged in using the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) to self-assess and disclose their policies, enabling MillerCoors to evaluate the risk potential they present. Additionally, MillerCoors regularly reviews various categories of spend and initiates projects to source new suppliers. During these events, we evaluate potential suppliers on a variety of qualifications, including our Responsible Sourcing Principles which include prohibitions on forced or compulsory labor. The evaluations are not conducted by a third party.

(2) Audit suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains?

MillerCoors does not audit its suppliers to evaluate compliance with the Responsible Sourcing Principles. It does evaluate risk of non-compliance with those suppliers engaged in the SEDEX program. We are actively expanding supplier engagement in this program.

(3) Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business?

MillerCoors does not currently require suppliers to certify that all materials incorporated into their product comply with slavery and human trafficking laws where they do business, but we do require all suppliers to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws. Additionally, utilization of the SEDEX tool provides us with visibility to supplier practices and policies.

(4) Maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking?

MillerCoors has a robust Code of Business Conduct to educate and hold employees responsible for engaging in legal, ethical and responsible business practices. Employees must affirm their review of and compliance with the Code of Conduct annually. Our Code of Business Conduct does not currently address slavery and human trafficking and can be found here.



(5) Provide company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products?

MillerCoors does not train its employees on issues relating to human trafficking and slavery."	Yes
204	"As a company handling a diverse range of products and services across the globe, ensuring that our supply chains operate sustainably is crucial to our business. In order to reflect this, MC stipulates its requirements through the ‘Mitsubishi Corporation Policy for Sustainable Supply Chain Management’, established originally in February 2008. MC and all its suppliers take the same fundamental position towards the themes addressed in the Policy, which include human and labor rights, anti-corruption and environmental conservation.

Core Principles

Since its foundation, Mitsubishi Corporation has adhered to three corporate principles which have guided its corporate philosophy and which place considerable emphasis on the importance of its corporate social responsibilities. Moreover, Mitsubishi Corporation's Corporate Standards of Conduct state that the company will develop its business activities in compliance with all relevant laws and international regulations and that it will act responsibly and respect the highest social standards. The Corporate Standards of Conduct also underline Mitsubishi Corporation's dedication to preserving the global environment and pursuing sustainable development through all aspects of its business activities.

Mitsubishi Corporation Policy for Sustainable Supply Chain Management Updated: December 2011

Policy

Mitsubishi Corporation (hereafter ‘MC’) strives to ensure that business is conducted responsibly throughout its supply chains. In order to convey this stance to suppliers, the company has established the “Mitsubishi Corporation Policy for Sustainable Supply Chain Management,” which it expects all suppliers to understand, embrace and abide by.

(1) Forced Labor

Suppliers shall employ all employees of their own free will with no employee being subject to forced or bonded labor.

(2) Child Labor

Suppliers shall not employee people under the minimum legal working age of the country in question.

(3) Safe and healthy Working Environments

Suppliers shall work to provide employees with safe and healthy working environments.

(4) Freedom of Association

Suppliers shall respect the right of employees to associate freely and for these groups to negotiate working environments, wages and other matters with employers.

(5) Discrimination

Suppliers shall strive to ensure equal opportunities in the work place and shall not engage in discrimination with regard to recruitment and employment practices.

(6) Abuse and Harassment

Suppliers shall respect employees' human rights and must not tolerate abuse or any form of harassment.

(7) Working Hours

Suppliers shall ensure that employees' working hours and use of leave entitlements are appropriately monitored so as not to infringe upon any statutory regulations.

(8) Suitable Remuneration

Suppliers shall pay employees at least the statutory minimum wage and shall not unreasonably reduce wages.

(9) Anti-corruption

Suppliers shall engage in fair business practices, avoid corruption including bribery and extortion, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

(10) Environment

Suppliers should work to protect the environment and will consider the environmental impact of their business activities on local communities and ecosystems.

(11) Information Disclosure

Suppliers shall disclose information with respect to the aforementioned matters in a timely and appropriate manner.

Monitoring

In order to ensure that suppliers operate in accordance with the above Policy, MC requires suppliers to complete self-assessment questionnaires. In addition, the company conducts onsite evaluation of suppliers at random.

Non-Compliances and Corrective Actions

Where MC identifies cases of non-compliance to the Policy, it communicates its remediation requirements to suppliers and provides support for redressing specific issues. MC reserves the right to disengage with suppliers who do not take appropriate measures to remedy non-compliance.

Surveys and Site Monitoring

MC conducts surveys of suppliers of a range of products, including those industries where CSR considerations are particularly impactful, such as agricultural produce and apparel.

In the fiscal year ending March 2014, replies were received from 199 companies in 34 countries and regions. Respondents answered questions pertaining to matters such as the existence of regulations and legal compliance; forced labor, child labor and prohibition of discrimination; environmental conservation; and information disclosure.

No particular problems were identified by this survey, but as a measure of assurance we have also begun site visits to key suppliers. In February 2013, we visited a shrimp hatchery company and a shrimp processing company in southern Thailand to inspect manufacturing work sites, interview management and monitor the CSR activities of each company.

Supplier surveys and site visits provide a valuable opportunity to communicate MC's stance on CSR and environmental affairs and will therefore be conducted on an ongoing basis.

MC conducts transactions with a large number of suppliers throughout the world. Moving forward, the company plans to continue efforts to ensure that its supply chain guidelines are well understood by overseas offices and MC Group companies, while eliciting the understanding and cooperation of suppliers on a global basis."

Mohawk is committed to observing high ethical standards in the conduct of its business. Our Supplier Code of Conduct (“Code”) demonstrates our commitment to establishing and maintaining relationships with third parties, including suppliers, that are committed to the same high ethical standards, and that are not linked to activities that would be considered abusive or exploitive, including human trafficking and slavery. The Code supports our internal corporate values by providing guidelines intended to ensure that each of our suppliers is committed to maintaining similarly high standards. Among other things, the Code communicates that as a condition of doing business with Mohawk, suppliers are expected to meet Code requirements applicable to human trafficking and slavery.

Mohawk includes terms in purchase agreements and purchase orders requiring suppliers adhere to the Code as well as applicable laws, regulations and standards. The Code also calls for suppliers’ subcontractors to comply with the terms of the Code. The Code is intended to ensure that materials incorporated into Mohawk products comply with laws and requirements in various contexts including social responsibility. In addition, Mohawk conducts assessments of select new and existing suppliers to verify compliance with the Code – which include supplier questionnaires, management meetings and facility audits.. Those audits may be attended by Mohawk staff or third parties. Mohawk does not currently retain a third party verifier, but reserves the right to retain one and requires suppliers to agree to third party verification.

Mohawk maintains internal accountability standards such that should a violation of the Code be discovered, Mohawk will promptly address the issue with the supplier and require the issue be corrected. These controls include unannounced audits to verify correction and compliance, and the potential for termination of the supplier relationship in the event of violations or failure to adequately remedy violations.

Mohawk provides training on its Supplier Code of Conduct to supply chain employees and management and others responsible for implementing the Code on the requirements, management and enforcement of the Code, including how to minimize the potential risk of slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain."

206	"January 1, 2012


Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California, like Multi-Fineline Electronix, Inc. (“MFLEX”), to disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain to tangible goods offered for sale. The following is disclosure under the Act for MFLEX and its subsidiaries:

1. Verification / Evaluation of Supply Chains: MFLEX continually assesses various risks associated with its global supply chain, including that of its subsidiaries and business units, does not knowingly engage any supplier that uses forced labor, slavery or human trafficking. Should MFLEX ever suspect that such practices were used by a supplier, MFLEX would investigate promptly and, should such practice be confirmed, the supply relationship would be terminated or the practice immediately rectified. MFLEX's supply chain is international. However, MFLEX believes that the countries in which its suppliers are predominantly located and the vast majority of items, components and parts supplied for its products are not such that would present significant risk of slavery and human trafficking. MFLEX has not employed a third party for verification.


2. Supplier Audits: MFLEX does not believe the risk of forced labor, slavery or human trafficking in its supply chain is significant and therefore has not audited its suppliers for compliance. To the extent this belief changes, MFLEX will consider stronger measures such as auditing or third party verification for any suppliers that it determines present greater risk.


3. Direct Supplier Requirements: MFLEX works with its direct suppliers to ensure that their products are compliant with all laws, but currently does not require specific certification regarding this topic. MFLEX does not knowingly do business with any supplier engaged in forced labor, slavery or human trafficking, and never intends to do so.


4. Internal Accountability: MFLEX requires accountability for compliance with all laws from its employees and provides ethics training to employees. Part of that accountability is the expectation that employees promptly report violations of law. If such reporting is received by MFLEX, it will be promptly acted upon. 

5. Training: MFLEX provides periodic training to its employees responsible for procurement. MFLEX employees are instructed to promptly report violations of law within its supply chain."	Yes
207	"California Transparency in Supply ChainS Act

NASSCO complies with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43) (“the Act”) by doing the following.

Verification. In connection with NASSCO’s supplier qualification list (QSL) process, NASSCO requires all prospective suppliers to complete a questionnaire and provide information about their business practices so that NASSCO can assess the supplier’s compliance in general. NASSCO only does business with suppliers who successfully complete the QSL process. The verification process is performed by NASSCO and not performed by a third party.

Audits. NASSCO reserves the right to audit a supplier's compliance with NASSCO’s terms and conditions and the QSL process. Such audits would only be conducted if there was reason to believe that a supplier was not in compliance with NASSCO's standards against trafficking and slavery in supply chains.

Certifications. NASSCO’s supply chain management process was recently updated to obtain a signed certification from each supplier before the supplier can be added to NASSCO’s QSL. The certification states that the supplier represents and warrants that it is compliance with the Act and federal human trafficking regulations aimed to stop human trafficking. Additionally, NASSCO’s purchase orders also bear a standard pre-printed note that states “By accepting this PO, Seller certifies that it is in compliance with FAR 52.222-50, DFARS 252.222-7007 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43), and that Seller does not engage in forced labor, slavery, or human trafficking.”

Accountability. General Dynamics’ Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct (“the Blue Book”) governs NASSCO’s ethics and business standards. The Code of Ethics includes, among other things, that our employees will comply with applicable laws and regulations. Human trafficking and slavery are illegal, and constitute a violation of the Blue Book by our employees and suppliers. Such a violation would result in a disciplinary action against the employee. Any supplier found to be engaging in slavery or human trafficking will be terminated and removed from the QSL.

Training. NASSCO provides training to its Supply Chain Representatives on the Act and federal human trafficking regulations."	Yes

211	"Overview



On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Verification of Supply Chains



Newegg, Inc. (""Newegg"") is dedicated to conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner. It is our expectation that our suppliers do the same.

Auditing of Supply Chains



Newegg's Vendor Code of Conduct explicitly entitles Newegg to conduct unannounced [and independent] audits or investigations at any time in response to a possible violation by our direct suppliers of company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Because Newegg strives to partner with direct suppliers who are governed by strict employment laws, at this time, we have not determined a need for additional verification or independent audit.

Certification of Direct Suppliers



By signing or accepting our purchasing contract or purchase order, each of Newegg's direct suppliers certifies it conducts business pursuant to all applicable local and national laws and its failure to do so is considered a breach of the agreement.

Accountability Standards and Procedures



Every employee and contractor is required to abide by Newegg’s Code of Business Conduct. All new employees receive the Code of Business Conduct in their new hire information and sign an acknowledgement stating they have read it. Failure of employees to abide by Newegg’s Code of Business Conduct is taken seriously, and can result in corrective action up to and including termination of employment.

Training



Newegg provides training for associates and management who work with our supply chains on the issues of slavery and human trafficking."	Yes
212	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 

NHBB abhors the practice of human trafficking and slavery and applauds efforts being made globally to eliminate this practice. NHBB supports the right of all individuals to be free from slavery in the workplace and is committed to protecting workers here and abroad by promoting ethical and lawful employment practices. We include in our contracts with domestic and international suppliers a requirement that they comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. 

By signing a contract with NHBB, our suppliers certify that they conduct business pursuant to all applicable laws including, but not limited to, those that prohibit slavery and human trafficking. A supplier's failure to honor its independent legal and contractual commitment to NHBB is a violation of law as well as a breach of its contract with NHBB. NHBB sources its raw materials and other components through reputable companies with high standards. As such, NHBB does not believe that additional procedures, training, verifications or independent audits are necessary to continue to deliver our customers a quality product manufactured with integrity."

February 2013

NXP Semiconductors is committed to respecting human rights and upholding the values and high standards of ethics as expressed in our NXP Code of Conduct.

NXP shall not traffic in persons or use any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured, or prison labor. This includes the transportation, harboring, recruitment, transfer, or receipt of persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, fraud, or payments to any person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation.

As a responsible corporate citizen, we seek to ensure that safety and ethical standards are maintained throughout our supply chain. We expect our suppliers to respect human rights, including maintaining policies and procedures to prevent the use of child or forced labor. Our suppliers are obliged to comply with NXP’s Supplier Code of Conduct and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The NXP Supplier Code of Conduct uses the structure and contains language from the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition® (EICC®) Code of Conduct, version 4.0, and includes additional, NXP specific, requirements, amongst others on human trafficking and slavery.

NXP reserves the right to conduct audits of key suppliers to ensure compliance with the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct. These audits can be done either by NXP employees or by contracted, independent third parties or a combination. Unannounced audits may be part of the program. NXP has a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of forced and child labor. If zero-tolerance items are identified, we may provide such supplier with an opportunity to rectify the problem and implement a corrective action plan. Should a supplier continues to fail to meet our standards, NXP seeks to eliminate such supplier from our supply chain.

NXP routinely conducts training for employees to adhere to our NXP Code of Conduct and to ensure our employees have a clear set of standards and guidance for conducting business with integrity and compliance with the law. Additionally, we train employees whose job functions include supply chain procurement to comply with all laws in all locations, which includes laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking. NXP’s disciplinary policy permits the termination of any employee for even a single breach of its Code of Conduct. NXP continues to update its policies, procedures and training as needed to seek appropriate safeguards in its operations and supply chain.

218	"OCZ Statement on Slavery and Human Trafficking 

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657), effective January 1, 2012, requires most retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California, to be transparent about efforts undertaken to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chains. 

As a supporter of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), OCZ has adopted the EICC Code of Conduct, which prohibits the use of forced, bonded, indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. We audit our suppliers to this Code and do not tolerate any form of non-conformance. In addition, OCZ has internal policies and practices that are based on international labor and human rights standards. We partner with our supply chain to create an environment where workers have the right to freely choose employment and where slavery and human trafficking is not tolerated.

OCZ takes multiple actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in our supply chain, including:

OCZ Code of Conduct. OCZ supports the EICC Code of Conduct and has communicated our support to our entire supply chain. This Code outlines our requirements regarding workers at suppliers having the right to freely choose their employment; Forced, bonded (including debt bondage), indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons shall not be allowed.

Supplier agreements. OCZ has a master purchasing agreement in place with our supply chain partners, requiring them to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations. We have required our supply chain suppliers to adopt and comply with the supplier code of conduct (EICC Code of Conduct) which prohibits forced labor and child labor. In addition, we require our suppliers to drive the same requirements to their suppliers throughout the supply chain. 

Supplier risk assessment and audit. OCZ supports and is aligned with the EICC's collaborative audit effort (EICC joint audit). Suppliers are asked to complete the self-assessment questions on the EICC Risk Assessment Tool as well as the EICC Self-Assessment Questionnaire that has been developed jointly by EICC members. OCZ performs assessments of potential suppliers as well as carrying out regular risk screenings of our supply chain suppliers. OCZ also conducts internal audits and onsite supplier audits, as deemed necessary to verify our supply chain suppliers' conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct and related law, standards and policies. These audits are conducted by OCZ auditors and utilize the standardized audit protocols. We follow up with each audited supplier to develop corrective action plans and close out audit findings. 

Employee training. OCZ requires OCZ employees to comply with our Business Ethics and Conflict of Interest Policy, and employees certify compliance with the Policy. OCZ offers training to our employees who are responsible for supply chain management on how to identify and respond to supply chain issues according with our supplier code of conduct, which is aligned with Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code."

219	"Office Depot Corporate Disclosure in adherence to California Transparency in Supply Chain Act

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (the ""Act"") is effective in the State of California as of January 1, 2012. The general purpose of the Act is the elimination of slavery and human trafficking in product supply chains and providing transparency to consumers so that they may make educated purchasing decisions. The Act requires companies to disclose their efforts in ensuring that their supply chains are free of slavery and human trafficking. Office Depot fully supports these efforts and seeks to ensure that throughout our supply chain, high standards of safety, quality and human rights are upheld. We continuously look at ways to enhance our processes and address such global concerns. Specific to our efforts to ensure and verify the absence of slavery and human trafficking in our direct supply chain, we undertake the following measures: 

Since the implementation of Office Depot social and vendor compliance program in 2003, Office Depot has made value-based management the framework around which our global business strategy is constructed. In doing so, we have committed to uphold the highest ethical, social and environmental standards in the conduct of our business and the operation of our supply chain. Accomplishing this commitment requires a comprehensive set of policies and programs integrated throughout our business operations. 

Office Depot's Supplier Guiding Principles is an important part of our corporate responsibility underlying principles provide guidelines and standards for our business partners engaged in the manufacturing, assembly, and distribution operations of our products. We intend to work only with reputable suppliers and manufacturers who will lawfully produce our goods through fair and honest dealing, in decent working conditions without exploitation and with regard to the environment. Office Depot is committed to managing a consistent, effective and comprehensive monitoring system that allows us to measure the progress and achievements of our social and vendor compliance policies and programs. 

Supplier Verification and Certification:

Office Depot enters into trade vendor purchasing agreements or purchase order terms and conditions with our direct suppliers. Such agreements require our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as adhere to certain supplier guiding principles, including prohibitions on forced or child labor, slavery and human trafficking. Our supplier guiding principles also require our direct suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into our products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Commencing in 2012, annual certification is required of our suppliers. 

Office Depot works closely with its suppliers through a continuous process improvement approach to enhance our supply chain business model as well as address any potential issues within the supply chain. This process includes on-boarding supplier assessments and audit protocols.



Audits:

Suppliers and their factories producing Office Depot's private label and direct import products are selected for a vendor compliance audit. These audits are performed or evaluated by an independent third party to verify compliance with the Office Depot Supplier Guiding Principles and social and vendor compliance policies and programs. All of our private label and direct import product suppliers are expected to meet our requirements as a condition of doing business with Office Depot. 

The initial audits are conducted within an announced ""2 week audit window"" by an approved third party audit firm. Re- audits are unannounced. The third party auditors are required to maintain certain levels of experience and corresponding credentials to ensure that compliance issues are detected and immediately communicated. Office Depot has remediation and continuous improvement processes in place in the event of findings that are not consistent with Office Depot's standards and principles. In the event of less than satisfactory findings, Office Depot works closely with the applicable supplier to implement a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The corrections of the detected findings are validated during a re-audit, which is typically conducted within six to twelve months depending on the audit grading. Office Depot also offers supplier training on the program requirements. Office Depot has a zero tolerance policy for the presence of forced labor and child labor as well as other critical principles. In the event any zero tolerance finding is detected, we require the supplier to take immediate corrective action or be subject to termination. 

Accountability:

All of Office Depot's associates and suppliers are expected to conduct business ethically and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Office Depot's associates are further required to comply with Office Depot's Code of Ethical Behavior and failure to act accordingly will result in corrective action, including the possibility of termination of employment. Any Office Depot supplier that fails to comply with applicable laws or ethical business practices may be subject to immediate business suspension or termination. 

Training:

Office Depot continuously develops and enhances our training programs for our associates. We provide regional training to our associates and our associates are required to acknowledge and adhere to our Code of Ethical Behavior, which includes compliance with all applicable laws where Office Depot conducts business. Additionally, in 2013 we implemented Anti-Human Trafficking training for Supply Chain managers and others who are directly responsible for supply chain management, in an effort to mitigate risks in slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain of products."

220	"Our Compliance with the California Transparency In Supply Chains Act of 2010

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the “Act”) will go into effect in the State of California generally for retail sellers and manufacturers doing business in California, which have worldwide gross receipts of more than $100,000,000. The Act was designed to increase the amount of information made available by retailers and manufacturers regarding their efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. We believe that workers at our facilities and our supplier facilities have the right to freely choose employment and not be subject to exploitation as a condition of employment. Slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including forced and child labor. We plan to increase our efforts to ensure and verify the absence of forced labor and child labor in our supply chain. 

First, we are in the process of preparing a new Code of Conduct for Suppliers (“Supplier Code of Conduct”), which should be finished in 2012. We plan to distribute this Supplier Code of Conduct to our major suppliers and we plan to encourage them to comply with it. We seek to proactively combat this problem by holding our business partners accountable to take greater social responsibility for their participation in the global economy. As part of the collaborative effort to ensure forced labor and human trafficking does not occur in the supply chain, we also plan to safeguard against violations of local law. Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers affirm that their materials incorporated into their products comply with the local laws regarding forced labor and human trafficking of the respective country or countries they conduct business in.

If a supplier rejects the Supplier Code of Conduct, we will emphasize that we will not tolerate serious or repeated violations and can terminate the relationship if needed. Terminating a contract may result in the loss of jobs, so we prefer to collaborate with suppliers to improve worker conditions wherever possible. We have not yet determined to what extent, and in what manner, our Supplier Code of Conduct will provide for us or for third parties to audit our suppliers’ compliance.

Second, our employees are bound by a company-wide Code of Ethics that requires them to obey all laws, including laws against forced labor and human trafficking. In addition, we plan to train existing employees as well as new hires, who are responsible for supply chain management on how to identify and respond to forced labor and human trafficking.

We want to be a company known for ethical leadership, a company where employees are proud to work and a company with which customers and suppliers want to do business. We gain trust by treating others with integrity, respect, and fairness. We must continue to demonstrate these values every day and in all our interactions, one day at a time. 

The office of the General Counsel at our parent company, Nortek, Inc., is responsible for overseeing our program. We will continue to strengthen our awareness program to keep compliance mind."	Yes
221	OmniVision unequivocally stands against human trafficking and slavery. OmniVision conducts its own verifications and pre-set audits of its supply chain partners to evaluate compliance with anti-slavery and anti-human trafficking requirements and to assess risks (these measures are conducted directly by OmniVision rather than by third parties). OmniVision also requests certifications from its direct suppliers concerning their compliance with such requirements and that the materials which they use in their own products are similarly in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. OmniVision further conducts its own corporate governance and compliance training (although such training does not extend specifically to anti-slavery and trafficking measures within the supply chain) and requires its own employees and contractors to comply with measures related to the prohibition of slavery and human trafficking.

231	"California Transparency in Supply Chain Act

As of January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) requires companies doing business in the state of California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. This law is designed to increase the amount of information made available by companies on their efforts to eliminate slavery and human trafficking, thus allowing consumers to make more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. PacSun believes that workers at our supplier factories have the right to freely choose where they work and be treated with dignity and respect. Our efforts to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not used in the production of our goods include the following:

Supplier Certifications: Through our supplier agreements, PacSun vendors and their factories certify that their factories adhere to all terms and conditions of the agreement which includes prohibiting the use of forced labor. PacSun has also created a Vendor Code of Conduct, in line with international standards, conventions and laws which forbids the use of all forms of forced labor in the manufacture of our products. Our definition of forced labor is inclusive of slavery and human trafficking.

Verification ion and Evaluation of our Supply Chain: PacSun requires all suppliers to complete and sign a questionnaire disclosing information on all factories producing PacSun's proprietary branded merchandise. Part of this questionnaire requires that factories agree to a third party audit to verify compliance with PacSun's Vendor Code of Conduct. Additionally, whenever possible, our sourcing teams will conduct factory walkthroughs to evaluate their suitability to produce PacSun goods. Part of this evaluation includes assessing workplace conditions and notifying our social compliance team of any human rights issues observed during the walkthrough.
Third Party Audits PacSun uses independent third-party monitoring firms to audit factories manufacturing PacSun's proprietary branded merchandise to verify compliance with our code of conduct. Audits are conducted on a semi-announced and announced basis. In some cases PacSun will accept global certifications such as WRAP, SA 8000 or recent audits from apparel companies whose code of conduct include the prohibition of all forms of forced labor including slavery and human trafficking.

Accountability: PacSun has a zero tolerance policy for violations involving any form of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking. Vendors or factories found in violation of this policy will be immediately terminated as a supplier. Our social compliance team works closely with our senior leadership and General Counsel to ensure that our suppliers are in compliance with our Code of Conduct . Our executive management is accountable to the Nominating and Governance Committee of PacSun's Board of Directors who are provided updates on our social compliance program on a regular basis.

Training: PacSun has conducted training with our sourcing teams on adherence to our Code of Conduct. Additional training with stakeholder groups within PacSun is planned for 2012 that will focus on monitoring the risk for human trafficking and slavery within the supply chain. We have also met with our key suppliers and reiterated PacSun's zero tolerance policy for factories engaged in slave labor or human trafficking. Suppliers have been informed that they must make every effort possible to guarantee that workers in their factories and the factories of their subcontractors are employed at their free will. Any supplier or subcontractor found in violation of this policy will be terminated.



PacSun takes issues involving human rights seriously and we expect our suppliers to do their best to ensure that forced labor in any form is not used in the production of our goods. We will continue to update our policies and procedures as needed to make certain that the appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent any mistreatment of persons involved in our supply chain."	Yes

234	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)

“Human Trafficking is a crime against humanity. It involves an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them.” – United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime

Human trafficking is a form of forced labor, and the second most prevalent form of illegal trade in the world, just after the illicit drug trade and equal to the sale of illegal arms. Sometimes referred to as modern day slavery, it is also the fastest growing illegal business in the world.¹ International Labor Organization (ILO) data shows that there are at least 12.3 million victims of forced labor worldwide, 2.4 million of which result from human trafficking. Men are affected, but women and children are particularly vulnerable.²

Human trafficking in any industry is a result of poverty and a lack of education, government action and political will. It’s often thought of as a problem in the illegal sex trade, but human trafficking can be found in garment factories, fabric and trim mills, and even on farms in the supply chain. Factories that use third-party labor brokers or unmonitored subcontractors are particularly susceptible. Even in the United States, where foreign migrant workers may seek employment through third-party brokers, factories sometimes employ human trafficking victims.

Patagonia prohibits any form of forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain. This is a zero-tolerance issue. If this grave concern was ever to be found in our supply chain, the factory would be subject to our disciplinary policy. In all cases factories must immediately remediate the issue, and face possible termination of business.

Patagonia developed and implemented its Workplace Code of Conduct and factory auditing program in the mid-1990s, well before the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) was passed. Our Code and auditing program were meant to prevent and monitor forced labor and other human rights abuses. With the passage of the law, the social and environmental responsibility staff spent much of 2010 and 2011 identifying any gaps in what we were currently doing and what was outlined by the law. We extensively read and researched about human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain, and participated in seminars, webinars and discussions with other brands.

Our disclosure statement below includes information on how we monitor our factories for all forms of forced labor, including human trafficking and slavery, and on how we’ve enhanced our program. The new California law only requires us to disclose our due diligence in these areas, however we’ve added additional information to our disclosure statement about the steps we’ve taken to ensure there is no child labor in our supply chain. We did this to further enhance transparency in our statement and prepare for pending federal legislation similar to SB 657.

We fully support the efforts of a growing number of anti-slavery activist groups, NGOs and our state and federal government to shed light on human trafficking, slavery and child labor in the supply chain. They’ve created helpful tools that brands and suppliers can use to prevent, identify and remediate these issues. We are hopeful that these serious human rights concerns will continue to receive more attention and analysis going forward. 

The steps we’ve taken so far are part of our mission to fulfill a core company value: to lead an examined life. We hope our SB 657 disclosure statement demonstrates that we are working diligently to monitor and assist our supply chain partners in meeting our human rights standards, particularly in the areas of human trafficking and child labor. Your feedback on our disclosure statement is most welcome. Please email us at social_responsibility@patagonia.com.

Below is our disclosure statement pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657).

Disclosure of Patagonia pursuant to SB 657:

The disclosure described in subdivision (a) shall, at a minimum, disclose to what extent, if any, that the retail seller or manufacturer does each of the following:

(1) Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.

Patagonia is a founding and fully-accredited member of the Fair Labor Association® (FLA®). The sole purpose of the multistakeholder organization is to improve working conditions in factories worldwide. Our Code of Conduct is based on the FLA’s Code and states that any form of forced labor, which includes human trafficking and slavery, and child labor are prohibited in our supply chain. Our Code also has matching, detailed benchmarks in those areas that our suppliers must follow. In addition, our policies and practices must comply with the FLA’s Principles of Fair Labor and Responsible Sourcing.

These written policies and procedures outline how we identify, evaluate, address and remediate forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking, and child labor at the garment factory level and, more recently, at the fabric mill level (we hope to formally include our farms too in a few more years). Patagonia headquarters is formally audited under the FLA principles every three years by their staff, with periodic reviews in between. We are also required to submit a formal annual report to the FLA showing our compliance with the principles.

To ensure that our supply chain complies with our policies and procedures, all of our new factories undergo a four-fold prescreening audit process. The process includes screening by our social and environmental responsibility, sourcing and quality teams. The social and environmental responsibility team has the same veto power as the other departments in the final selection of new factories. This preventative measure ensures that we do not contract with factories that have substandard human rights practices to begin with. 

For current factories, we audit all of our cutting, sewing and finishing factories, and their subcontractors, for compliance with our Code of Conduct. This includes compliance with our policies on forced and child labor. This practice has been part of our social responsibility program since the mid-1990s. As of late 2011, we’ve started to audit our fabric mills too. We require immediate remediation if we find any noncompliance with our Code of Conduct, including slave labor, human trafficking and child labor, in an audit (also see next section). Reputable third-party audit firms conduct over 60 percent of our factory audits each year. In addition, the FLA audits 5 percent of the garment factories in our supply chain each year and posts the results for public viewing on their website. You can find additional factory social and environmental responsibility information on our Footprint Chronicles® site.

Our social audit tool for factory and subcontractor monitoring includes sections on migrant, imported, contract and temporary/seasonal workers. The use of unmonitored labor brokers and subcontractors in these areas can present a human trafficking risk, as they are not commonly monitored by the primary factory, or other brands. We have fully mapped our cutting, sewing and finishing factories, and have audited most of our subcontractors for Code of Conduct compliance. We hope to complete all subcontractor assessments in over the next several years. 

Audit finding and remediation data is maintained in a database, which helps us to identify and address human rights risks in our supply chain, including forced labor, human trafficking and child labor. The database is critical in prioritizing our due diligence work. This work goes beyond social audits to include factory trainings and intensive continuous improvement programs - many paid for by Patagonia. 

We have recently updated our internal procedures to identify human trafficking as a zero-tolerance issue, along with all other forms of forced labor. We’ve also created specific remediation procedures if human trafficking and child labor concerns are found in an audit. Our Code of Conduct and Benchmark document will be updated in early 2012 to meet the FLA’s revised version, and will also include human trafficking language and special benchmarks. Additionally, UL STR Responsible Sourcing revised our social audit tool in October 2011 to include a more comprehensive section on migrant and imported workers. It specifically looks for signs of human trafficking. Lastly, we’ve included a new section in our database that houses more audit data about migrant, imported and contract labor.

A copy of our internal policies and procedures on forced and slave labor, human trafficking and child labor can be found here.

(2) Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.

Human trafficking and slavery can occur in the supply chain if a factory is using a third-party labor broker or temporary agency to hire all or part of its workforce. We audit our suppliers to ensure they comply with our Code of Conduct, including the sections on forced and child labor. Our auditing program evaluates all garment factories, their subcontractors and, as of November, 2011, raw material suppliers (both fabrics and trims). Our audit tool has always included a detailed section on child labor, and since October 2011, we’ve revised it to include a more comprehensive section on imported and migrant workers, and specific questions that look for signs of human trafficking. If concerns were found, we would engage in a higher level assessment and remediation effort with a credible, experienced third party and/or labor NGO. 

In 2010 and 2011, third-party monitoring firms conducted the majority of our audits. Those audits were all announced. Our internal social responsibility team also conducts announced audits and in late 2012 we hired three dedicated CSR Field Managers in Asia to increase monitoring, training and remediation in the supply chain. The Field managers will conduct both announced and unannounced audits. In addition, the FLA audits 5 percent of our supply chain annually. These audits are unannounced and posted for public viewing on the FLA website. 

Beyond auditing, Patagonia engages in numerous activities with our factories to ensure compliance with forced and child labor laws and our Code of Conduct. These activities include special trainings, continuous improvement programs, capacity building initiatives, like the ILO Better Work program, and collaboration efforts with other brands and the FLA. 

(3) Requires a direct supplier to certify that materials incorporated into a product comply with slavery and human trafficking laws in the country or countries in which that supplier is doing business.

All our direct suppliers are now required to sign a statement that certifies the materials incorporated into their products comply with slavery and human trafficking laws in the country or countries in which they do business. We know that education and awareness can be the best prevention, so we’ve also asked all of our suppliers to learn more about human trafficking and slavery. We’ve sent our suppliers materials to educate them about areas where human trafficking can be found since it can inadvertently occur in the hiring process if factory management uses a labor broker or third party. Those materials included a summary from the FLA on SB 657, a list of activities that Patagonia will be doing to reduce the risk of human trafficking in the supply chain, a list of helpful websites about the issue and a new questionnaire that identifies human trafficking risks in hiring practices. To further enhance our education efforts, we plan to roll out human trafficking awareness training for our suppliers. The training will be given at the time of our required annual Code of Conduct training (an FLA requirement). All factory employees must attend, so we hope it will educate at-risk workers, their supervisors and hiring staff about this practice. 

(4) Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

Patagonia headquarters is formally audited by FLA staff every three years under the FLA’s Principles of Fair Labor and Responsible Sourcing, with periodic reviews in between. In February 2013, the FLA reaccredited our CSR program. We are also required to submit a formal annual report to the FLA showing our compliance with the principles. This review includes an evaluation, with our quality, social and environmental responsibility staff, of Patagonia’s progress on human rights in factories that manufacture our products. New FLA membership obligations on responsible purchasing practices have required us to create a process where our sourcing, quality, development and demand planning teams will also be evaluated on their performance to ensure our suppliers meet all our Code of Conduct standards. This includes standards on human trafficking, slavery and child labor.

Patagonia prohibits any form of forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking. This is a zero-tolerance issue. If this grave concern was to be found in our supply chain, the factory would be subject to our factory disciplinary policy. In all cases disciplinary actions include immediate remediation and possible termination of business. Aside from serious, unremediated zero-tolerance issues, it’s Patagonia’s policy to form long-term relationships and work with our contracted factories, in the spirit of continuous improvement.

(5) Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products

Patagonia’s social and environmental responsibility team conducts trainings on social and environmental responsibility throughout the year. Trainings include a new hire introduction to our CR program and updates on projects at our popular “brown bag” lunches. At the lunches, we also show social and environmental documentaries, conduct presentations or have special guest lectures. Most trainings are done at our Ventura, California and Reno, Nevada locations. Some trainings are also conducted in our overseas offices and retail stores.

On December 7, 2011, we hired a third party expert to conduct a two-hour human trafficking awareness training, together with our Director of Social and Environmental Responsibility. Over 100 employees who work directly with our suppliers attended in person. We reviewed many important subjects on slavery and human trafficking, including an update on the changes made to our program to mitigate risk. We’ve also planned follow-up webinars and on-going new hire training on this subject.

We plan to launch a human trafficking awareness training for our suppliers. The training will be given at the time of our required annual Code of Conduct training (an FLA requirement). Since all factory employees must attend, we hope to educate at-risk workers and their supervisors of this practice.

Beginning in 2012, large manufacturers and retailers doing business in California are required under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) to disclose efforts they have taken to eliminate human trafficking and slavery from their supply chains.

As a global company, PepsiCo has adopted policies and procedures to address human rights, including the issue of human trafficking, in our operations and supply chains. A brief description of those global policies and procedures follow.

PepsiCo’s commitment to respect all human rights in our own operations and in our supply chain is formalized in PepsiCo’s Human Rights Workplace Policy and our Supplier Code of Conduct. These policies are guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related international covenants. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, PepsiCo is visibly committed to its 10 principles, including those for Human Rights and Labor Standards. PepsiCo’s Human Rights Policy and our Supplier Code of Conduct expressly forbid the use of all forms of forced or compulsory labor.

To ensure ethical and legal compliance, we provide annual online training on our Code of Conduct to all salaried associates with email accounts. To reach those associates who are not online, we conduct in- person training.

Responsible and Sustainable Sourcing

PepsiCo has a responsibility to ensure our business partners operate ethically and responsibility. Our Responsible and Sustainable Sourcing Program helps us ensure supplier compliance and risk mitigation. It has two components: Supplier Code of Conduct and Risk Evaluation and Management program.

  

Supplier Code of Conduct

We have a responsibility to ensure our suppliers honor and respect the people we serve and the environments in which we operate as partners. As part of our Responsible and Sustainable Sourcing strategy, we are committed to working in partnership with our suppliers to follow a specific code of

conduct.

Since 2007, PepsiCo has employed a Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) globally, which communicates our global expectations in the areas of labor practices, associate health and safety, environmental management and business integrity.

The Supplier Code of Conduct includes 13 standards that require suppliers to adhere to the following: basic compliance with local law, respect for human rights and prohibiting all forms of forced or



compulsory labor, ensuring no child labor is used, and cooperating with reasonable assessment processes requested by PepsiCo. The Code is mandatory in procurement contracts globally.

Risk Evaluation and Management

We use our Responsible and Sustainable Sourcing program to educate suppliers, validate compliance, and facilitate continuous improvements in our supply chain. We partner with our industry peers, our own suppliers, and third party service providers like SEDEX and social audit providers to drive transparency and social accountability in our supply chain.

Overall, PepsiCo’s approach to supplier standards encompasses five levels: the Supplier Code of Conduct (policy), supplier risk pre-screen, supplier self-assessment, third-party assessment, and corrective action planning/resolution management.

Level I: Supplier Code of Conduct is required of all managed supply contracts globally.

Level II: Supplier Prescreen – The prescreen risk evaluation process focuses on four major criteria: supplier country risk; material/service; brand association; extensive use of manual labor. These prescreen characteristics allow us to identify supplier sites for initial SEDEX participation.

Level III: Self-assessment Questionnaire – We expect those suppliers identified in Level II to join SEDEX and complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire. SEDEX generates an initial Risk-Assessment score.

Level IV: Third-Party Assessment – PepsiCo reviews SEDEX-identified potentially high risk sites as well as other sites with high risk factors such as country, commodity, and environmental risks when selecting supplier sites for third-party social audit. To steward responsible sourcing with our suppliers and continue to build a relationship of trust, PepsiCo generally requests scheduled third-party audits with suppliers. However, we reserve the right to request unannounced third-party audits when deemed necessary. PepsiCo leverages the SMETA (SEDEX Member Ethical Trade Audit) methodology, a recognized industry protocol used by several other major consumer products organizations. Third-party assessment results can be shared with multiple customers via SEDEX.

Level V: Corrective Action Planning and Resolution Management. Non-compliances and timelines for issue resolution are itemized for customer review and tracking. The suppliers can then update the status of non-compliances as they are addressed, and auditors assess and validate resolution.

The PepsiCo team reviews audit issues, and encourages suppliers to use the SMETA Corrective Action Guidance to help drive timely and effective issue resolution. We recognize that issue resolution may have an impact on the communities in which suppliers operate, and we collaborate to develop the most appropriate solutions for all stakeholders, as we do in our own operations.

 

Partnering with our Peers

PepsiCo is a founding member of an industry-wide initiative called AIM-PROGRESS - PROGram for RESponsible Sourcing. As an active member of AIM-PROGRESS, we collaborate with our peer companies to develop and implement common methods of evaluating supplier CSR performance, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the evaluation process, and raise CSR performance within our supply chains. We leverage our AIM-PROGRESS membership to educate our suppliers on responsible sourcing and help them comply with communicated standards.

236	"CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT DISCLOSURE (SB 657)

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires companies that manufacture or sell products in the State of California to disclose their efforts, if any, to provide information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chains. The law was designed to increase consumers’ knowledge about products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Peregrine Semiconductor Corporation (“Peregrine”) is committed to complying with the law wherever we operate and to conducting all business activities in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We expect the same of the parties with which we do business. Our ethical standard is reflected in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (“Code”), which outlines our expectations of ethical conduct and compliance with all laws from our employees and others who work and represent Peregrine.

Upon being hired, Peregrine employees attend Ethics training and are asked to acknowledge receipt of training and the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. Peregrine maintains a 24/7 Business Conduct Helpline where employees can submit any concerns of possible ethics and compliance violations, including slavery and human trafficking, anonymously, if requested. Every submission is reviewed and handled accordingly. Any employee who is found to have violated the Code provision is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and referral to appropriate legal authorities.

To ensure that our supply chain reflects our commitment to compliance and ethics standards, our corporate business practice provides that Peregrine’s purchasing decisions with suppliers include being based on integrity. Peregrine expects its suppliers to comply with legal requirements and operate consistently with the principles of the Code when working on our behalf. Accordingly, we consider these rights issues when we assess potential suppliers. While Peregrine does not have a formal verification program, we do perform periodic audits of suppliers to evaluate and address issues relating to compliance with regulations and Peregrine’s policies, processes and procedures."

At Pfizer, responsible supply chain management is core to our business and we strive to uphold human rights in all our business activities.

Pfizer fully supports the principles in United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

As a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, we have committed to support the ten principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, including principles 4 and 5, which call for the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor and the effective abolition of child labor.

Pfizer is also a co-founder and sits on the Board of Directors of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), a group of pharmaceutical companies that have established a set of principles (PSCI Principles) to aide pharmaceutical suppliers in establishing sustainable business practices, including ethical and responsible labor practices.

Statement Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)

PVH Corp., one of the world's largest apparel companies, owns and markets the iconic Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands worldwide. We are the world's largest shirt and neckwear company and market a variety of goods under our own brands, Van Heusen, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo†, Olga and Warner's, as well as numerous nationally and internationally known brands we license from third parties.

Central to our identity is a genuine commitment to corporate social responsibility - CSR. For over 100 years, our credo has been to conduct all business in keeping with the highest moral, ethical and legal standards. CSR is a fundamental component of how we run our business and is directly linked to our strategies and practices. We continually move toward increased transparency and accountability to the public and report on our CSR efforts, performance and vision for the future. We invite you to visit our online CSR report at pvhcsr.com to learn more.

We were one of the first companies to publish a code of conduct regarding workers rights and working conditions when our A Shared Commitment (PDF) was initially published in 1991. Our commitment to our workers and workers in our supply chain was further evidenced when we became a founding member of the Apparel Industry Partnership in 1996, which has been succeeded by the Fair Labor Association (""FLA""), of which we continue to be a member in good standing. In taking this leadership role and making this commitment to human rights and compliance with labor laws, we have aligned the requirements for doing business with us with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labor Organization's (""ILO"") Core Conventions and the United Nations Framework on Business and Human Rights. More directly, the FLA has an accreditation program that is an independent external verification of each member's human rights program's compliance with the FLA's Workplace Code of Conduct. The FLA's Workplace Code of Conduct is a global set of principles based on the ILO's standards for working conditions in factories. Accreditation takes place every three years and we have been accredited by the FLA since 2005. 

It is within this framework that we make this statement under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657), which requires us to disclose our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chain for the products we sell.

How we assess the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our product supply chain. We source and purchase substantially all of the products sold by our wholesale and retail businesses. Suppliers of these products must agree to our A Shared Commitment code of conduct requirements, disclose all factories intended for production of our goods, and submit to compliance audits. The audits, which are typically conducted by members of our Global Human Rights and Social Responsibility Department but may also be conducted by reputable third party auditors identified and managed by the Department, necessarily include investigation of terms and conditions of employment that are designed to verify the risks and uncover the existence of human trafficking, slavery or other forms of compelled employment and lack of freedom.

How we audit for compliance with our A Shared Commitment code of conduct. We require that all factories intended for production of our goods be audited for compliance with our A Shared Commitment code of conduct prior to the commencement of production. These audits are typically conducted by members of our Global Human Rights and Social Responsibility Department but may also be conducted by reputable third party auditors identified and managed by the Department. All factories are re-audited every 12 - 18 months. Initial audits are typically announced, while follow-up audits are typically unannounced.

We ensure that the vendors used by our suppliers in manufacturing our products comply with our A Shared Commitment code of conduct through auditing; we are implementing a program for our suppliers to certify that the materials used in the manufacturing of our products are produced in compliance with the code. Our A Shared Commitment code of conduct requires our suppliers to ensure that the vendors they use in manufacturing our products comply with the code, including in respect of human trafficking and slavery. Direct suppliers are evaluated for compliance with this aspect of the code though our audits of the suppliers, as well as our audits of their vendors and suppliers. With respect to the materials used in the manufacturing of our products, we are implementing a certification program for our suppliers. Under this program, our suppliers will be required to certify that the materials were produced in compliance with the requirements of the code.

We maintain and rigorously enforce internal accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding our A Shared Commitment code of conduct, including standards with respect to slavery and human trafficking. Our Human Rights program includes a Sustainable Compliance Initiative for purposes of remediating violations of our Shared Commitment code of conduct that our audits uncover. This permits us to examine the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. It also enables us to serve the interests of the workers best by aiding in the development of a safe, legal and respectful workplace. If cases of non-compliance are not resolved, or at least substantially addressed, within a specified time frame, we will terminate the business relationship. With respect to the most egregious cases of code violations, we will terminate the relationship immediately and report the situation to the appropriate authority. This would be the case if we were to uncover a situation involving slavery and human trafficking.

Internally, we have extensive policies, practices and procedures that encompass the requirements of our A Shared Commitment code of conduct and ensure compliance with the standards set forth therein. This includes a constant and vocal commitment of management (starting with our CEO) to the full array of workplace issues; in-house training programs for all associates, as well as additional training for our Human Resources and management teams; reporting hotlines; audits of facilities we acquire; and safeguards in the workplace and hiring process that also serve the purpose of enabling us to identify violations, including human trafficking and slavery, were they to occur. It is clear that our commitment to human rights standards would result in the severest discipline on any employee or contractor who engaged in, facilitated or allowed forced labor, human trafficking or slavery to exist in any of our own facilities.

We conduct training on our A Shared Commitment code of conduct, including with respect to human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on mitigating risks. The associates in our Global Human Rights and Social Responsibility Department and Global Sourcing division are trained on our A Shared Commitment code of conduct, as is management at our suppliers, in order to ensure the necessary participants in supply chain management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain. Our associates also participate (both as speakers and attendees) in external training programs and seminars on social compliance issues, including on the issues of human trafficking and slavery.

Pinnacle Agriculture Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, including Pinnacle Agriculture Distribution, Inc., (""Pinnacle"") are committed to conducting business ethically and with integrity, in treating all people with dignity and respect and in complying with applicable laws and regulations. Pinnacle™ does not tolerate illegal child labor, slave labor, or human trafficking. These principles and commitments are embodied in our Code of Business Conduct, corporate policies and our Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers.

We comply with employment laws applicable to our business and expect those with whom we do business to do the same. The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires Pinnacle to disclose the following:

Verification. Pinnacle routinely assesses risk related to its supply chain. This assessment is based primarily upon supplier quality performance, the type of transaction, the specific commodity purchased, the geographic location of the source and other relevant business and legal criteria. Pinnacle follows the trade laws of the United States, including the restrictions on export or doing business with certain people, companies or countries. Pinnacle's Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers specifically identifies the expectation that our suppliers must conduct business in a way that is not complicit in any human rights abuses, including child labor, slave labor and human trafficking and reserves Pinnacle's right to investigate any discovered instances of non-compliance with our Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers. Other than the foregoing, Pinnacle has no formal process for verification of supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

Auditing. Pinnacle has audit rights in many of its supply contracts, which permit Pinnacle to audit a supplier's compliance with the terms of the contract. While Pinnacle has certain contractual rights to audit its suppliers, and has conducted routine audits or assessments of supplier performance, those assessment methodologies do not currently include specific assessments of human trafficking and slavery. Pinnacle has reserved the right to investigate instances of non-compliance with our Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers, including instances of non-compliance with laws governing human trafficking and slavery.

Certification. Pinnacle's contracts with suppliers require suppliers to comply with all laws. Our suppliers are also required to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers, which states our expectations of compliance with laws and ethical business conduct, including those laws and principles prohibiting involvement in slave labor and human trafficking. Other than these contractual obligations with suppliers and Pinnacle's reservation of right to investigate, Pinnacle does not have a formal supplier certification process.

Internal Accountability. Under Pinnacle's Code of Business Conduct, Pinnacle employees are required to follow all applicable laws and all of Pinnacle's  policies. Employees who violate laws for Pinnacle's policies are subject to disciplinary action including discharge. Pinnacle's suppliers are subject to the terms of all contracts with Pinnacle, including obligations to comply with the Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers. Pinnacle reserves its contractual rights to terminate relationships with suppliers who fail to comply with law and/or whose contractual noncompliance is not addressed in a timely manner.

Training and Awareness. Pinnacle regularly trains its employees in the standards of ethical behavior, policies, procedures and legal requirements that establish the manner in which we conduct business. We do not require our employees to engage in training that specifically pertains to slave labor and human trafficking.  If an employee responsible for procuring materials for our operations were to suspect a supplier of being involved in slavery or human trafficking, the employee would have a responsibility under Pinnacle's Code of Business Conduct not to ignore such suspicion, but to take action appropriate to the employee's position at Pinnacle."

We expect our suppliers to share our commitment in providing safe working conditions, treating workers fairly and with dignity and respect, and using environmentally responsible manufacturing processes.

Supply Chain Verification and Certification 
Our key suppliers are either members of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) or are contractually required to adhere to the EICC's Code of Conduct. The EICC is a third party organization that promotes an industry code of conduct for global supply chains to improve working and environmental conditions. Verification of a supplier's adherence to the EICC's Code of Conduct is conducted externally through the membership requirements of the EICC.

In addition to adherence to the EICC's Code of Conduct, our key suppliers represent and warrant to us that they will perform their obligations to Polycom in compliance with all applicable foreign, federal, state and local statutes and regulations. 

Risk Assessment and Audits 
We assess new suppliers and periodically review current suppliers to determine the level of risk associated with a number of issues, including quality and safety. We conduct internal audits using a self-assessment questionnaire that is sent to new and current suppliers. The results of the audit are reviewed internally by Polycom. Our questionnaire contains questions designed to assess whether a supplier may have issues with respect to slavery and human trafficking. In the event we believe a supplier is not in compliance with our standards, we will insist that they implement a corrective plan of action. If cases of non-compliance are not resolved in a timely manner, we will eliminate such supplier from our supply chain. We may in the future use unannounced independent audits. 

Internal Accountability and Training 
Polycom strives to maintain a robust internal training curriculum that is reviewed annually for new issues in compliance. Additionally, we conduct internal training on our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct to ensure our employees understand our standards of conducting business with the highest degree of ethical behavior and in compliance with the law. All employees are required to acknowledge and adhere to our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Violations of our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct may subject the employee to corrective action, including termination of employment.

We are dedicated to expanding our standards and to taking any other measures in the future deemed critical to our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain.

California law requires UTC to disclose its activities regarding monitoring its supply chains to prevent human trafficking and slavery. 

Section 24 of UTC’s Code of Ethics states: 

“UTC is committed to good citizenship and believes that engagement with others improves the human condition. For our employees worldwide, UTC assures safe and healthy work environments, based on the more stringent of U.S. standards, local standards, or UTC policies. UTC does not use child labor or forced labor. For our communities worldwide, UTC works to protect the environment, maximize the efficiencies of our products, and reduce wastes, emissions, energy consumption, and the use of materials of concern. As affirmed in other sections of the Code, UTC obeys the law, does not discriminate in personnel practices, and does not engage in corrupt practices. In addition to its own commitments, UTC expects direct suppliers to adopt suitable codes of business conduct. See UTC's policy entitled ""Corporate Citizenship."" 

UTC’s “Corporate Citizenship” policy requires direct suppliers to adopt a suitable code of business conduct that specifically addresses “fair employment practices, including prohibitions on harassment, bullying, and discrimination, use of child or forced labor, or trafficking in persons for whatever purpose.” 

As described above, UTC addresses labor standards in its Code of Ethics, and expects its officers, employees and others to report actual or alleged failures to meet the Code’s standards. An annual certification required of all salaried employees worldwide includes a requirement to certify adherence to UTC's Code. 

UTC makes training available to company management, employees, and certain third parties regarding human trafficking and slavery issues, including training with respect to recognizing and mitigating risks within the supply chain. Those with direct responsibility for supply chain management are required to take this training. 

UTC has robust supplier selection and administration criteria that it expects its direct suppliers to adhere to; however, UTC does not verify or audit its product supply chains specifically to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery, nor does it require its direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into its product comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which they are doing business.

December 30th, 2011

Pride Mobility Products Corporation (“Pride”) supports the right of all individuals to be free from slavery in the workplace. Pride will not, as a matter of principle, support or condone, either directly or indirectly, any form of slavery or human trafficking in connection with Pride’s business operations. Pride strives to establish and maintain contractual relationships with only the most reputable international suppliers of materials, components, subcontract manufacturing and other services. Consistent with this goal, and in addition to other forms of vetting and verification that Pride has and continues to undertake to assure the quality and integrity of its supply chain, Pride, reasonably contemporaneous with the issuance of this disclosure effective January 1, 2012, is commencing steps to verify that participants in the Pride supply chain have both an appreciation and respect for the need to prohibit and disavow acts of slavery and human trafficking in connection with business activities This verification is being conducted by Pride itself rather than a third party.

249	"P&G Information Regarding California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 

P&G’s policy is to operate within the spirit and letter of the law and to maintain high ethical standards wherever we conduct business. P&G does not condone or tolerate efforts or activities to achieve results through illegal or unethical dealings anywhere in the world.

P&G’s suppliers know that the Company is concerned not only with results, but also with how those results are achieved. We expect all of our suppliers to conduct their business with the same high standards. We will actively seek business relationships with suppliers who share our values and promote the application of these high standards among those with whom they do business.

The State of California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the Act) requires that manufacturers and retailers disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from the supply chain. The following describes P&G‘s efforts (the numbered topics are taken directly from the Act):

Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party. 

Every two years we evaluate our suppliers and identify high-risk suppliers on a number of parameters including known risks and country location. Forced and child labor is included in the known-risk category, and we use the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) “List of Goods and Countries” (PDF) as an aid in the evaluations.

Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit. 

P&G requires that high-risk suppliers are audited by an independent, third-party auditor at least every two years. These audits are announced beforehand, and the auditors utilize the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) Best Practice Guidelines and audit report format.

One area that the auditor assesses is whether “employment is freely chosen,” i.e., there is no forced, bonded, or involuntary prison labor, and workers are not required to lodge “deposits” or their identity papers with their employer and are free to leave their employer after reasonable notice.

Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

P&G’s Standard Global Purchasing Contract (PDF) requires that suppliers be in full compliance with all applicable governmental, legal, regulatory, and professional requirements, specifically including P&G‘s prohibition on employing children, prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, and using corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical coercion as a form of discipline.   

P&G is beginning to utilize several third-party certification standards, e.g., Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), that provide third-party certification that raw materials we purchase are produced without the use of forced labor.

Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. 

P&G’s Worldwide Business Conduct Manual (PDF) (WBCM) explains the global standards to be followed in our daily business activities as well as our legal and ethical responsibilities. The WBCM applies to all employees and members of the Board of Directors, regardless of location, seniority level, business unit, function, or region. P&G also expects suppliers and other business partners to comply with the relevant aspects of our WBCM. The relevant aspect of the WBCM states: 

We do not use child or forced labor in any of our global operations or facilities. None of us should tolerate any form of unacceptable treatment of workers in our operations or facilities. This means, among other things, that we do not permit exploitation of children, physical punishment or abuse, or involuntary servitude. We fully respect all applicable laws establishing a minimum age for employment, in order to support the effective abolition of child labor worldwide. Workers under the age of 18 shall not perform hazardous work.

Employees understand that they must know and follow our WBCM, as well as the policies and procedures that apply to their job. Employees are expected to report known or suspected violations. Finally, failure to follow the law, the WBCM, or Company policies will subject employees to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

P&G’s Sustainability Guidelines for Suppliers (the Guidelines) is our expected code of conduct for all suppliers. The Guidelines state:

P&G does not use child or forced labor in any of our global operations or facilities, and we expect suppliers or contractors with whom we do business to uphold the same standards. More specifically, we will not conduct business with suppliers employing child, prison, indentured or bonded labor, or using corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical coercion as a form of discipline. 

The Guidelines also state, “Should a pattern of violation of these principles become known to the Company and not be corrected, we will discontinue the business relationship.”

Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. 

In addition to the child and forced labor prohibitions aspect that are covered in the WBCM, P&G Purchasing employees, including management, receive additional training on slavery and human trafficking. The training covers:

The definition of human trafficking and forced labor

Why it is important to the Company

The steps the Company takes to prohibit forced labor

Steps employees can take to combat forced labor

Qualcomm􏰀s Commitments



At Qualcomm, we are committed to encouraging an environment of inclusion where employees see their differences as an asset and a strength and thrive on the unique, creative and innovative ideas generated by our employees, who are changing the world every day. Rather than engaging in unlawful discrimination or harassment, which will not be tolerated, we instead choose to show respect to each other and collaborate in ways that appreciate our similarities and celebrate our differences. We encourage the exchange of unique ideas and perspectives; we believe that both employees and business results benefit from valuing diverse experience, backgrounds and ideas.

As part of our commitment to an inclusive and diverse work environment, Qualcomm provides equal employment opportunities for all applicants and in all aspects of employment without consideration of race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, age, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, veteran status, disability or any other basis prohibited by law.

We are committed to encouraging participation and providing equal opportunities for socioeconomic small and diverse businesses to compete for contracts that are within their capabilities to perform. Including such suppliers in our supply chain makes us a stronger company. Not only do we benefit from a variety of capabilities and perspectives, we also gain the value of unique, entrepreneurial, customized services that many of these suppliers provide. 

Qualcomm􏰀s Commitments



Forced, bonded or indentured labor and human trafficking are prohibited, and we are always free to leave our employment upon reasonable notice. We also prohibit the use of child labor, although legitimate workplace apprenticeship or intern programs that comply with all laws and regulations are permitted and supported. We will never knowingly use any suppliers who engage in child, forced or slave labor, nor will we condone such practices. As stated above, we have adopted the EICC Code of Conduct as our Supplier Code of Conduct. The EICC Code requires compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to ethics, labor and environmental health and safety, in addition to forbidding forced, bonded or indentured labor and child labor. We assess key manufacturing suppliers to evaluate their conformance to our Supplier Code of Conduct via risk assessments and audits.

Because we rely on suppliers for nearly all of our manufacturing, we generally do not encounter issues with child labor, forced labor or human trafficking in our direct operations. Our manufacturing suppliers, in all of their activities, must operate in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules of the countries in which they operate.



We respect the rights of employees to associate freely, join or not join labor unions, collectively bargain under local law, seek representation and join workers􏰀 councils in accordance with local laws. We are compliant with all collective agreements regarding significant operational changes as required by country laws and regulations. Qualcomm does not have formal agreements with trade unions.



Qualcomm maintains a healthy, safe and productive work environment where employees treat each other and third parties with respect. Our Injury and Illness Prevention Plan provides clear, consistent and regulatory- compliant policies and protocols for managing health and safety. It describes our standards and specifications for training, safety audits, incident investigation and communications and helps us integrate safety practices in every aspect of our business.

 

It is our policy to comply with anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), other applicable U.S. laws and the anti- corruption laws and regulations of the countries where we do business. Qualcomm􏰀s FCPA and Anti-Corruption Policy applies to the entire company, including all employees, agents, consultants and representatives, wherever they are located.

Qualcomm􏰀s anti-corruption commitment and program applies to all persons/entities that provide goods or services to Qualcomm through contract provisions and/or our supplier code of conduct; Qualcomm monitors and performs anti-corruption due diligence as needed on such persons/entities. Qualcomm regularly reviews its FCPA and Anti-Corruption Policy and program for suitability, adequacy and effectiveness, and improvements are implemented as deemed appropriate.

254	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

        

Effective January 1, 2012, the state of California requires companies to disclose what they are doing to address human trafficking in their supply chains. Referred to as SB 657, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act seeks to “educate consumers on how to purchase goods produced by companies that responsibly manage their supply chains, and, thereby, to improve the lives of victims of slavery and human trafficking.”

Under no circumstance is it acceptable for child, forced or trafficked labor to be used in the production of any Quidel raw material, component or end product. We believe that no person should be subject to a situation where basic needs and fundamental rights are denied. The points outlined below in bold highlight each of the five pillars of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, followed by an explanation of what Quidel is doing to address each pillar.

		The company engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.  Quidel engages in verification of its raw material and component supply chain to evaluate and address risks of slavery and human trafficking. Preliminary risk assessments are performed by Quidel on potential suppliers with assessment questionnaires. Upon review of the questionnaire, as determined appropriate, Quidel may follow‐up with an in‐depth assessment conducted by either a Quidel supplier assessment team, or a third‐party auditing firm. Suppliers are periodically reviewed based on the risk as related to the potential for human trafficking and slavery. 

		The company conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit. 

From time to time, Quidel conducts audits of direct material suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with Quidel’s standards for human trafficking and slavery. Direct material suppliers are evaluated through audits on their compliance with the terms of our supply agreement. Our audits may be announced our unannounced depending on the risk assessment for human trafficking at the supplier and any notice set forth in our supply agreements. The audits may be conducted by either a Quidel supplier assessment team, or a third‐party auditing firm. Following audits, suppliers are required to produce a corrective action plan to outline how the supplier will resolve any issues uncovered in the audits. Quidel has zero tolerance for human trafficking or slavery.

		The company requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. 

		The company maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. 

		The company provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. 



Quidel’s purchase order and supply agreements require all direct material suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, including those regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country in which the suppliers are doing business.

Quidel maintains and enforces internal accountability standards and procedures for employees through our code of conduct regarding slavery and human trafficking. Our code of conduct emphasizes that employees who engage contractors are obligated to report any suspected human trafficking or slavery. In the case of non‐compliance or suspected non‐compliance, Quidel reserves the right to review the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non‐ compliance are not resolved within a timely manner, Quidel may terminate the business relationship.

255	"QUEST / California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 went into effect in the State of California. This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including forced labor, bonded labor, indentured labor and child labor.  Specifically, we have implemented the following action steps to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking as well as other potential labor concerns within our supply chain.

In 2004, Quiksilver Inc. established a global program for all its affiliated brands tasked with ensuring that all facilities involved in the production and supply of products for Quiksilver Inc. and its licensees adhere to the principles set out within our Quiksilver Ethical Standards of Trade (“QUEST”) program.  In this regard, Quiksilver Inc. created a Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct, in line with recognized international standards, labor laws and International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions. The “Code” requires that all suppliers and their respective factories that are manufacturing product on our behalf comply with these standards and laws.

To maintain the independence and international consistency of the QUEST program, Quiksilver Inc. works with independent third-party monitoring firms.  Under the QUEST program, all global factory assessments are conducted on an unannounced basis and monitoring is ongoing. Throughout the assessment process, factory management is educated and assisted on any noncompliance issue encountered during the applicable audit.  All factories are required to complete a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) in order to remain an active supplier within our supply chain. Audit time frames are based on assessment finding. In the event that a factory assessment yields results in which they are unable or unwilling to meet these expectations, Quiksilver Inc. reserves the right to terminate the relationship with the supplier and respective factory.

Quiksilver Inc. expects its licensees, vendors and suppliers to act reasonably in all respects and to do their best to eliminate and prevent any abusive, exploitative or illegal conditions at their workplaces.  As part of these efforts, our QUEST department conducts ongoing internal employee and management training sessions on our code and human rights concerns including human trafficking and slavery associated with a supply chain.  As we expand our business activities abroad and work with suppliers globally to meet customers’ needs, we recognize the importance of preserving our collective commitment to human rights in the workplace and are committed to doing our part in the eradication of slavery and human trafficking.

As one of the most recognized brands in consumer-electronics retailing, RadioShack Corporation has developed policies that reflect responsible business practices across the organization and throughout the global community of business partners and stakeholders. 

RadioShack has a longstanding corporate Code of Ethics Policy and a Supplier Code of Conduct that set clear boundaries for the relationships and practices with our suppliers and other business partners. Under these policies, RadioShack strives to do business with high moral, ethical and legal standards. RadioShack’s goal is to forge relationships with those suppliers who share our commitment to these standards.

In compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, effective Jan. 1, 2012, RadioShack is providing consumers with a summary of our practices covered by the Act so they are equipped to make informed choices about supporting RadioShack as a community-based retailer of innovative technology products and services. 

Disclosure

RadioShack is committed to compliance with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that apply to its business. This compliance extends to RadioShack’s efforts to require that its suppliers comply with all applicable laws and, likewise, participate in the global effort to eradicate human trafficking and other instances of forced labor.

RadioShack enters into binding, written supply contracts with suppliers who wish to conduct business with RadioShack. The primary document used for this purpose is RadioShack’s Vendor Agreement, which incorporates RadioShack’s applicable policies in the Vendor Guide and Supplier Code of Conduct. As required by these policies, suppliers must comply with all applicable U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and rules. RadioShack has the right to refuse any product offered by a supplier that fails to comply with all such laws and regulations.

As required by the Vendor Guide’s Supplier Code of Conduct, RadioShack’s suppliers must provide safe working conditions, treat their employees with respect and dignity, must not subject any employee to any physical or other form of abuse, and must engage in fair and reasonable practices relating to hiring, training, wages, benefits, discipline, termination and retirement, consistent with local standards and applicable law.

RadioShack’s Supplier Code of Conduct explicitly forbids use of forced, bonded, indentured or prison labor by its suppliers and also includes requirements concerning minimum age and compliance with other related local laws.

RadioShack requires that its suppliers must not employ or conduct business with any persons or entities that are blocked by U.S. agencies, including purchase of components, products or services from those countries or vendors that may be blocked or embargoed as a result of labor practices. RadioShack requires our suppliers to monitor changes in status on various lists published by federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Further, RadioShack’s suppliers are to implement, maintain and enforce appropriate policies, record-keeping practices and procedures to promote compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct and applicable laws.

Supply Chain Verification and Audits

RadioShack retains third-party auditing firms to evaluate and verify compliance with its Supplier Code of Conduct. RadioShack reserves the right to conduct these visits and audits unannounced, and will do so should the need arise. RadioShack is committed to ongoing dialogue with our suppliers concerning local labor practices in the interest of continuing to improve the quality and transparency of our global supply chain. 

Internal Accountability

If any of these facility visits or audits identifies deficiencies, the supplier must promptly develop and implement corrective actions to eliminate the identified deficiencies. RadioShack closely monitors the implementation of the necessary corrective action plan. The supplier’s failure to eliminate any identified deficiency in accordance with the Vendor Agreement, Vendor Guide and Supplier Code of Conduct may result in RadioShack’s termination of any and all applicable business relationships. 

Training

In addition to annual employee training on its ethics standards, RadioShack also conducts annual training sessions to inform all employees who are directly involved with global sourcing activities of the definitions of forced labor, human trafficking, common illegal labor practices, and RadioShack’s policies and procedures, as well as RadioShack’s reporting responsibilities concerning these activities. Properly educating these employees is a key element of RadioShack’s efforts to maintain and promote responsible practices in the global supply chain.

RadioShack is committed to conducting its business and operations consistent with legally recognized standards for corporate responsibility. RadioShack expects each of our suppliers in our direct supply chain to similarly conform to these standards and to fulfill the goals of responsible corporate citizenship.

ThalesRaytheonSystems is committed in our business practices to reflect our company’s values, including treating people with respect and dignity. ThalesRaytheonSystems values set the foundation for its Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (the “Code”) and its policies, procedures and business practices.

Our Code and our terms and conditions with domestic and international suppliers, require compliance with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations (including laws prohibiting human trafficking and forced labor). Suppliers are expected to act proactively, raising concerns about ethical issues, violations of the Code, or governmental rules and regulations.


The United States Government has adopted a zero tolerance policy regarding trafficking in persons. Accordingly, Government contracts for acquisitions of goods and services:

 

(a) Prohibit contractors, contractor employees, suppliers, and supplier employees from—

(1) Engaging in severe forms of trafficking in persons during the period of performance of the contract;

(2) Procuring commercial sex acts during the period of performance of the contract; or

(3) Using forced labor in the performance of the contract;

(b) Require contractors and suppliers to notify employees of the prohibited activities and the actions that may be taken against them for violations; and


(c) Impose suitable remedies, including termination, for failure to comply with these Government contracting requirements.


In accordance with its Code and terms and conditions in applicable Government contracts, ThalesRaytheonSystems complies with these requirements regarding trafficking in persons and forced labor and it “flows down” such requirements to ThalesRaytheonSystems suppliers.


Training on Trafficking and Forced Labor Issues: ThalesRaytheonSystems has taken steps to ensure that our employees are aware of these critical issues so that they may communicate such information to ThalesRaytheonSystems suppliers. ThalesRaytheonSystems also provides its suppliers with access to a toll-free Ethics Line, which enables suppliers to communicate questions and concerns about compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations (including laws prohibiting human trafficking and forced labor), when the proper course of action may appear to be unclear.


Supplier Accountability: ThalesRaytheonSystems has retained the right under its contracts with its suppliers to terminate a contract with its supplier for the supplier’s failure to comply with the requirements of ThalesRaytheonSystems Code. For international procurements, ThalesRaytheonSystems also reserves the right to gain access to supplier records and facilities for the purpose of auditing the supplier’s compliance with ThalesRaytheonSystems Code requirements and compliance with law requirements under the contract.

REI Support of Human Rights in Our Business Practices

REI is a national outdoor retail co-op dedicated to inspiring, educating and outfitting our members and the community for a lifetime of outdoor adventure and stewardship. We are known for our commitment to social responsibility, both as an employer and in how we do business. REI promotes environmental stewardship and increases access to outdoor recreation through volunteerism, gear donations and financial contributions. We have been recognized as one of Fortune Magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work for” for 18consecutive years.

Our goal is to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain, and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. A supply chain includes every phase of the process of bringing a product to market, from raw materials through purchase by the customer. Companies doing business internationally have learned that relying on local laws and enforcement is not always enough to achieve specified standards for human rights throughout the supply chain.

This document describes REI’s actions to support human rights, including our actions in response to disclosure requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the “Act”).

Overview of REI’s actions to support human rights

REI’s supply chain relies on sources around the world. The raw materials used in our merchandise are produced globally. Manufacture of our merchandise occurs domestically and internationally, including our REI private labels and merchandise produced by independent, outdoor industry companies whose products are sold by REI.

REI recognizes fair labor practices as being an inherent part of human rights. Much of our focus on human rights in business practice has centered on our own private label suppliers and on the Tier One phase of manufacturing, when previously manufactured materials are assembled in a factory. We also sell goods in our stores produced by our merchant vendors (other outdoor industry companies). While many of our merchant vendors have fair labor compliance programs in place, REI’s Vendor Guide also stipulates that all vendors must apply REI standards in their production facilities.

Since 2006, REI has reported to the public on our actions to support human rights in the workplace. This information is part of our annual Stewardship Report, available on our website http://www.rei.com/aboutrei/about_rei.html

REI’s key actions in support of human rights include:  A rigorous process for evaluating potential supplier factories. Every facility that wishes to work with REI, whether contract or subcontract, must qualify as an REI vendor. REI first evaluates factories on fair labor practices and other considerations important to our business. Each supplier factory must complete a rigorous Fair Labor audit that examines the facility’s fair labor practices. Once a facility is approved, the organization must sign a Vendor’s Agreement to Comply form. Signing the compliance form authorizes the specific facility to produce REI-brand product in compliance with the REI Factory Code of Conduct. Signing this agreement does not mean that a supplier is authorized to produce REI-brand product at any other facility.

 Abiding by a Factory Code of Conduct. REI first introduced a Factory Code of Conduct in 1993. Our Factory Code of Conduct addresses human rights principles and sets standards of workplace conduct for the factories that produce products we sell. The Factory Code of Conduct applies to factories producing our own private label products and the products of other brands that REI sells in its retail locations. REI’s Factory Code of Conduct is supported through regular assessments of the suppliers that we work with, including an ongoing audit and capacity-building program.

 Support and use of our industry’s Fair Labor Tool kit. In 2006, we began an on going partnership with the Outdoor Industry Association (OIA) to develop, publish and maintain the Fair Labor Toolkit. The Fair Labor Toolkit is designed to help companies get started on the development of a social compliance program. The OIA Sustainability Working Group is currently restructuring the toolkit to better accommodate the needs of smaller companies.

 Information-sharing across industries. In 2009, we joined the Fair Factories Clearing house (FFC) to promote and participate in deeper collaboration across several industries. FFC members often work with the same suppliers to manufacture their merchandise and share fair labor compliance audit results. This information sharing helps retailers as a whole set consistent expectations with their suppliers and share very detailed information on factory environments.

 Direct involvement and accountability of senior leadership in our commitment to human rights. REI has a dedicated team responsible for our Fair Labor Program. This team is a part of our Private Brands Division under the Product & Supply Chain Sustainability Manager who reports to the Divisional Vice President of Operations. In addition to dedicated staff, REI’s Fair Labor Oversight Committee (FLOC) oversees the development of the Fair Labor Program. The FLOC is chaired by the Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Its membership includes REI’s Divisional Vice President of Private Brands, the Associate General Counsel, the Vice President of Corporate Strategy, and the Vice President of Public Affairs. The FLOC reports to the Audit and Finance Committee of REI’s Board of Directors.

A concern for human rights is an inherent part of REI’s approach to fair labor practices. The following pages describe REI’s response to the human rights legislation passed by the State of California. This report includes our actions, our progress and areas where we are improving our vigilance.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

In 2010, the California Legislature passed The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, a law which applies to large manufacturers and retailers doing business in California.

As described in a bill analysis prepared by the California Senate Judiciary Committee, the goal of the Act is to ensure that retail manufacturers and sellers develop, maintain and implement policies related to their compliance with federal and state law regarding the eradication of slavery and human trafficking from their supply chainsi. Human trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation or sale of people for forced labor.

The Act applies to larger manufacturers and retailers with annual worldwide gross receipts over $100 million. Beginning January 1, 2012, the Act specifically requires retail sellers and manufacturers doing business in the state to “disclose their efforts to eradicate human slavery and trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for saleii.” The Act requires that the information be posted on the company’s website, with a conspicuous and easily-understood link on the company’s homepageiii. The company must also disclose its specific actions in relation to five key points, as described in the Act:

Number 1: Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.

Number 2: Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.

Number 3: Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Number 4: Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

Number 5: Provides company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.

REI’s Response to the Act

The following are REI’s actions related to each key point described in the Act.

Number 1: Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party. REI regularly evaluates and addresses human rights issues as part of our commitment to fair labor practices within our supply chain. This begins with our evaluation of new countries of origin and new factory partners. Cross-divisional collaboration involved in this effort includes our Fair Labor, Customs Compliance, Quality and Sourcing teams. Executive management also has a role in this process, and that role is exercised through the FLOC (see page 2).

Our process for establishing a supplier relationship

Many REI divisions are involved in evaluating new countries to source from and new factory partners. When considering a new country, the REI Sourcing, Customs Compliance and Fair Labor teams vet it for political stability and port safety, the government’s backing of labor law, known labor issues, percentage of migrant labor, REI employee safety and travel and other factors. At the factory level, REI assesses the workforce profile, the manufacturing processes and the associated health and safety risks. Third-party monitors always conduct initial audits prior to REI issuing any production orders. We continue to assess supplier factories on a regularly basis using a risk matrix. After the Fair Labor team assesses the findings of any audit, the factories are ranked by a color-coded system and prioritized for corrective action remediation.

To date, the primary focus of our efforts has been REI private label apparel, camping gear, bicycles and accessories. In recent years, REI has established relationships with reputable and experienced third-party auditors, who work directly for us to audit suppliers’ factories. In assessing the REI supply chain, our third-party monitors cross reference factory policies and procedures against the REI audit scope, based on the REI Factory Code of Conduct. The audit process involves both announced and unannounced audits; observation and walk-throughs of each factory and related facilities such as dormitories; and interviews of factory workers, both on the factory floor and in private interviews outside of factory grounds. REI fair labor or private brand employees are onsite for the audits when feasible.

REI’s Factory Code of Conduct addresses the prohibition of trafficking and/or slave labor in four code elements: Harassment or Abuse; Recruitment and Hiring; Compensation; and Health and Safety. The code elements read as follows:

HARASSMENT OR ABUSE

Employers will not use physical or psychological disciplinary tactics. Furthermore, employers will not subject employees to threats of violence, sexual harassment, or psychological abuse

RECRUITMENT AND HIRING Voluntary Employment Employers will not use forced labor, including imprisonment, indentured, bonded, or any other form of compulsory labor. Minimum Hiring Age Employers will not use persons younger than 16 years of age (or who are younger than school compulsory age, if that is older than 16 years) in any of their facilities.

COMPENSATION

Employers will meet all legal requirements for wages and benefits in the country in which they are conducting business, or local industry standards, whichever are higher.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Employers will provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The same standards will apply to residential facilities, where they are offered.

REI’s audit scope includes the following Forced Labor provisions, which are verified by REI’s third-party auditors:

		Factory ensures that the workplace is free from any type of violence, harassment, or abuse, be it physical, sexual, psychological, verbal, or otherwise. 

		Factory has a written non-harassment or abuse policy in place which has been communicated to all workers. 

		Factory provides training to managers and supervisors in appropriate disciplinary practices and monitors their behavior. 

		Factory does not employ anyone under the age of 16 or under the age for completion of compulsory education, whichever is higher. 

		Factory has an effective age verification system and maintains proof of age documentation. 

		Factory complies with all relevant laws that apply to young workers (workers between the ages of 16 to 18) including regulations relating to hiring (government  4 110715.3 

permit/registration, health check, etc.), working hours, and not working in hazardous

positions.

		Factory does not use any form of forced labor in which workers’ freedom of movement,  ability to willingly leave work, and human rights are denied or severely restricted. This  includes: prison labor, trafficked workers, and indentured workers. 

		Factory does not bind workers to employment as a condition of fulfilling terms of a debt  to a third party or to the employer. 

		Factory complies with all national laws, regulations, and procedures concerning  compensation. 

		Factory provides reasonable meal and rest breaks, which, at a minimum, must comply  with all local laws. 

		The overtime working hours (per day, per week, and per month) in the factory meet legal  requirements. 

		Workers can keep all of their original documents, such as passports, identity papers,  travel documents, or any other personal legal documents. 

		Workers are free to leave the factory premises when their work shift ends, at non-paid  rest periods, and in the event of a personal emergency during working hours. 

		Workers are allowed free access to bathroom facilities and drinking water. 

		Workers have the right to end their employment at any time.  Currently REI does not audit or monitor factories producing goods for REI merchant vendors (other outdoor industry companies) whose products are sold by REI. REI’s Vendor Guide, however, requires that merchant vendors apply REI’s Factory Code of Conduct standards in their production facilities.  The REI Factory Code of Conduct is included in the vendor on-boarding packet. The precise language states:  “Based on REI’s commitment to practicing business with Vendors who share our basic values, we consistently apply the following standards as we select REI vendors, domestic or international. It is REI’s expectation that every vendor who supplies REI will monitor their own sourcing processes to ensure that they meet or exceed these standards.”  In addition to the language contained in the Vendor Guide, REI includes the following language in the Purchase Order Standard Terms and Conditions (for Product Resale):  “Products shipped under the (specific) PO were purchased in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders and ordinances of the country of origin and of the United States, and any state, or an agency or political subdivision thereof.”  Number 2: Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit. Currently, REI audits 25% percent of our supplier sites per year on average. These sites account for approximately 40% of production volume. We participate in additional, shared audits through the Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC). REI selects third-party service providers that utilize the most progressive methods for detecting noncompliance with the REI Factory Code of Conduct. While some audits are announced, REI conducts unannounced audits as well. When a supplier is asked to remediate a violation of the Factory Code of Conduct, unannounced audits enable REI to confirm if remediation has occurred.  5 110715.3 

REI’s auditing and remediation practices reference and rely upon guidance from the International Labor Organization, the Fair Labor Association and recognized, credible labor rights organizations dedicated to promoting fair labor practices and safe working conditions worldwide.

Number 3: Requires direct suppliers to 

y that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. REI recognizes the importance of protecting the human rights of workers who produce the raw materials for our products. We are focusing on two efforts:

		Developing better industry-wide measurement tools to uphold human rights throughout the supply chain, including the raw materials phase. 

		Providing clear guidance to our suppliers on our human rights standards.  Measurement  REI’s Fair Labor Program was merged into the Product & Supply Chain Sustainability team in August of 2014. This merger has strengthened visibility into our supply chain, tracking a product to the raw materials stage. Good measurement capabilities can help retailers better assess fair labor issues at the raw materials stage. As a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, REI helped create a sustainability measurement tool (the Higg Index), an evaluative protocol used to identify the environmental and social impacts of product manufacturing. The Higg Index has been in use since 2012, including at many of our material suppliers.  Suppliers  REI specifies in our Factory Code of Conduct Agreement that manufacturing partners must associate with suppliers that comply with legal requirements in any country in which their business is conducted. Below are examples of REI’s Contractual Terms Applicable to REI Purchase Orders:  “Based on REI’s commitment to practicing business with vendors, who share our basic values, we will consistently apply the following set of standards as we select vendors, whether domestic or international, for products carrying the REI label. These standards will apply to all vendors, including contractors and / or manufacturers, of products carrying the REI label. These standards also supplement, amend and apply to all purchase orders and other agreements between REI and each vendor accepting these standards.  Each vendor shall be provided with a copy of the REI Code of Conduct Standards and shall be responsible for ensuring that every facility used by such vendor to produce REI product, packaging and labeling meets or exceeds the requirements in each area of the standards below.  Vendors must maintain current sufficiently detailed records to substantiate their compliance with this Code of Conduct. These documents must be made available to REI employees or anyone acting on behalf of REI on request. Such documents should include: (i) Personnel files on each employee reflecting proof of age; (ii) Working hours and payroll records by employee; (iii) Local health and safety evaluations; (iv) Employee grievances and suggestions and employer responses; (v) Documentation of exemption from local law; (vi) Payroll records; (vii) Terms and conditions of employment.”  6 110715.3 

Qualifying Factories

Each qualifying factory is to fulfill these three obligations as a part of the Vendor Onboarding Process:

		Listing all factory or facility locations. At this point REI does not require a complete listing of each materials supplier. 

		Providing a signature by a principal of the company contracting business with REI and by the resident general manager of the factory or facility. 

		Completing the General Information page of the Fair Factories Clearinghouse Self- Assessment.  Number 4: Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. REI has an escalation process in place in the event that we identify a potential violation of human rights. To date, we have never encountered a violation related to slavery or trafficking in any of our supplier facilities. We have used our escalation process to work with suppliers to remedy potential fair labor violations.  Escalation process  REI considers fair labor practices an important part of human rights. REI’s approach to fair labor violations focuses on working with suppliers to remedy the violations, uphold workers’ rights and improve the overall workplace environment.  In the event of a potential violation, REI promptly addresses the issue with the supplier and sets expectations for how the situation is to be addressed, based on internationally recognized best practices and standards for fair labor compliance. Any potential violation is reported to the REI FLOC.  We then conduct unannounced audits to confirm that the supplier has addressed and remedied the potential violation. If a supplier does not correct the violations, we are prepared to end the relationship with that supplier. We would also share information on the situation with other retailers doing business with that entity or considering a prospective partnership. The primary purpose of sharing information with other retailers is to collectively apply leverage on the manufacturer to encourage compliance.  REI understands the importance of eradicating slavery and human trafficking. In the event of a potential incidence of slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain, we would use our escalation approach, but also seek broader support.  Internal accountability  As previously described in this disclosure, REI’s senior leadership has direct involvement and accountability in supporting our commitment to human rights. The FLOC meets on a routine basis and is provided regular reports on audit findings and trend analysis. The standard operating procedure for the program also defines an escalation plan for certain Factory Code of Conduct violations whereby the FLOC is notified immediately. Violations of the forced labor section of the Factory Code of Conduct fall within the bounds of the escalation plan. In addition to program reporting to the FLOC, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is provided with periodic program updates.  7 110715.3 

Number 5: Provides company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. Before the Act was ratified, our Fair Labor team and the Director of our Corporate Social Responsibility program received training on human trafficking and slavery issues. In 2012 REI hired the Cahn Group third party to develop a training program on human trafficking and slavery issues for a broader audience at the REI headquarters in Kent, Washington. The training included the use of online modules, break-out sessions and group discussion. In September, 2012 we hired the same resource to provide an adapted training for the Asia-based REI Quality team and office staff. The Asia-based REI employees are now trained to identify potential human rights violations and to seek assistance from colleagues in Fair Labor Compliance.

REI has since implemented a Visual Observation Checklist. This tool is used by employees who frequently visit production sites. It provides guidance on topics to observe and/or discuss with the factory management. Questions include:

		Did there appear to be no physical or verbal abuse and/or harassment during the factory tour? 

		Do the workers have free access to the toilet and to clean drinking water? 

			Do all workers appear to be over the age of 16?  While not as robust as a full audit, the Visual Observation Checklist serves as both a training tool for internal staff and as a means of verifying factory conditions between audits. When a Visual Observation Checklist is completed, the results are automatically uploaded to FFC and, if necessary, a corrective action plan is established.  Conclusion  REI is committed to upholding human rights as we conduct every aspect of our business. We will update this document to reflect our progress in preventing and addressing potential human rights violations in our supply chain, particularly in the areas of slavery and human trafficking. We encourage our members, customers and the public at large to review this document and our Stewardship Report in the About REI section of our public website, www.REI.com.  i Bill Analysis, SB 657, California Senate Judiciary Committee ii Bill Text, SB 657, Chapter 556, Filed with Secretary of State Sept. 30, 2010 iii Bill Text, SB 657"	Yes

ResMed Inc. (and its subsidiaries, collectively “ResMed”) is dedicated to conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner. It is our expectation that our suppliers also conduct themselves in such a manner.

To this end, we issue to our suppliers ResMed’s Supplier Manual which, among other issues, sets out the requirements and expectations we have for our suppliers (and in turn their suppliers). We evaluate the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our own supply chain, rather than using a third party to do so, and include policies in our Supplier Manual to address those risks. Our anti-slavery and anti-trafficking policies include specific requirements and warranties for:-

		Prohibition of child labor based on the International Labor Organisation’s Minimum Age Convention, 1973; 

		Compliance with applicable local occupational health and safety and labor laws (including slave, prisoner or any other form of forced or involuntary labor); and 

		A right for ResMed to request a higher standard of compliance where we believe that the local laws are not in line with our corporate values.  The ResMed Supplier Manual includes an acknowledgement that the supplier must sign to indicate their responsibility for knowing and adhering to the standards of ResMed’s Supplier Manual and ResMed’s overall Supplier Management Process. Through this acknowledgement, our suppliers certify that the materials incorporated into ResMed’s products comply with local laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Failure to comply with any part of the manual or the process can result in removal of the supplier from ResMed’s Approved Supplier List and termination of our relationship with them.  Specific training related to identifying and reporting human trafficking and slavery will be conducted for those employees and contractors linked to supply chain management. ResMed’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is issued to all ResMed employees, clearly states the commitment of all ResMed employees to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the conduct of our business activities. This extends to laws regarding slavery or human trafficking in the countries in which we do business. Failure to comply with ResMed’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can result in disciplinary action and or termination of employment.  ResMed will conduct audits of its suppliers to monitor the suppliers’ ongoing compliance with ResMed’s Supplier Manual. At this time, a formal audit will not be conducted unannounced by an independent third party, however, ResMed’s Internal Quality/Supplier Audit Department will implement announced audits during the normal course of business with the supplier. Those employees that will be trained to identify non-compliance will be expected to report any potential unlawful or unethical conduct within the supply chain.  ResMed’s Vice President of Global Supplier Alliance has overall responsibility for compliance with this Act."

2. 	REI strives to do business with suppliers of sound business character and reputation. Currently REI does not audit or monitor factories producing goods in its supply chain. REI’s Supplier Code of Conduct, however, requires that vendors adhere to REI’s Code of Conduct standards which prohibit engaging in human trafficking and/or slave labor in their production facilities. We will continue to promote fair labor practices and safe working conditions throughout our supply chain as we evaluate the best methods and tools for detecting noncompliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct.

  	 

3. 	REI recognizes the importance of protecting the human rights of workers who produce the goods and materials for our products. We require direct suppliers to certify in writing that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

  	 

4. 	REI considers fair labor practices an important part of human rights. We specify in our Supplier Code of Conduct that business partners must conduct their business activities in a manner that scrupulously adheres to our principles of business, which are grounded in concepts of integrity, good judgment and the highest ethical standards. Failure to comply with legal requirements in any country in which their business is conducted, including laws related to slavery or trafficking, will trigger an investigation by senior executives, including our corporate general counsel, into the potential violation and may result in the suspension or termination of the supply agreement.

  	 

5. 	REI has established a corporate training program on human trafficking and slavery issues. Our Procurement/Sourcing team, who has direct responsibility for both our domestic and international supply chain, has already received the training. We will provide training as appropriate for other company employees and management with supply chain involvement.

265	"Disclosure of the Company pursuant to The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010:

Through the use of a third party verification service, the Company conducts a verification of its direct supply chain. That verification includes, but is not limited to, evaluating and addressing compliance by the direct suppliers with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

The Company conducts regular audits at selected suppliers on an announced and unannounced basis through the use of a third party verification service which verification includes, but is not limited to, evaluating and addressing compliance by the direct suppliers with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

The Company strives to continuously improve and enhance the scope of its supply chain management efforts and has developed the Rite Aid Ethical Sourcing Principles for its suppliers which outline the ethical principles and commitments we expect of our suppliers concerning social responsibility. Through these principles, we ask our suppliers to develop and implement appropriate mechanisms to promote them internally and within their supply chain. That is the extent to which we ask our suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into their products are produced in accordance with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

A commitment by our direct suppliers to comply with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, is expected to maintain good standing as a supplier to the Company. However, due to the current practical limitations on verification beyond the first tier in a supply chain, the Company’s verification process is limited to first tier suppliers. As part of the Company’s efforts to continuously improve and enhance its supply chain management systems, the Company expects to conduct annual training for those employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management. Such training is expected to include, but not be limited to ensuring supplier compliance with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

Approach to Sourcing and Human Rights

At Ross Stores, Inc. (“Ross”), which includes Ross Dress for Less and dd’s DISCOUNTS chains, ethical business practices are at the core of our culture and can be seen every day in the way we treat our constituents, from customers and associates to vendors and investors. This focus on ethical business practices is also reflected in Ross’ policy that we will not knowingly purchase merchandise from any manufacturer involved in the use of child, slave, prison, or forced labor.

Ross is an off-price retailer with more than 1,000 stores across the country. The majority of the apparel, footwear, accessories, and home-related merchandise sold in our stores are purchased from suppliers after they have been produced and imported to other retailers’ specifications.

Though Ross does not have direct control over the manufacturing processes for these products, we require suppliers to uphold our ethical standards, both contractually and through enforcement. While Ross orders and imports some products directly through its international buying agents and from manufacturers, they represent the minority of merchandise sold in our stores. For these items, we have additional requirements in place to further compliance.

Ross’ standards and requirements related to sourcing and human rights are incorporated in various Company documents, including Ross’ Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Vendor Compliance Manual, Purchase Orders, Vendor Indemnification Agreements, and Buying Agent Agreements. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is located under Corporate Governance in the Investors section of www.rossstores.com and our Vendor Compliance Manual can be found at http://partners.rossstores.com.

Ross communicates its standards and requirements to vendors, buyers and overseas buying agents during our purchasing processes

Ross’ Sourcing and Human Rights Standards

Vendors, manufacturers, and other business partners of the Company are required to comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws relating to the manufacture and production of products sold to Ross, including compliance with all applicable laws relating to labor compensation, working conditions, child, slave, prison or forced labor, environmental protection, product safety, corruption or bribery (including foreign corrupt practices), building and working condition safety, and similar obligations.

Ross will not knowingly purchase any product whose manufacture involved the use of any child, slave, prison or forced labor; any labor where workers are not provided wages or safe working environments as required by law; or products made in violation of established environmental or consumer product safety requirements.

To the extent contractors or subcontractors are involved in the production of goods supplied to Ross, vendors must ensure that these parties adhere to the laws and regulations.

Training and Enforcement of Ross’ Standards

Ross provides initial training for new buying associates, as well as ongoing training and updates to buyers and other associates involved in our product sourcing. Further, Ross monitors and assesses our supply chain for compliance related to product safety and local, national and international labor, and human trafficking laws.

For products sold in our stores for which Ross is the direct importer, the Company requires the following:

		Ross trains and instructs overseas buying agents, shippers, product testing lab resources, and associates involved in imports, on Company standards, and on policies and protocols relating to import products. 

		Buying agents are required to conduct in-person inspections of vendor factories, whether announced or unannounced . 

		Ross conducts audits of buying agent inspection reports to verify that they are complete, comprehensive and up-to-date. 

		Ross also requires its overseas buying agents to request available third-party factory inspection reports of direct import suppliers, and to review those third-party reports and disclose any concerns to Ross compliance personnel in the Legal department.  If Ross becomes aware that any vendor has been found to be out of compliance with Ross' requirements or procedures regarding the above, including any applicable local, national or international labor or human trafficking laws, Ross will take appropriate responsive action, which could include suspending shipments of a vendor’s merchandise and/or terminating the business relationship.

Corporate social responsibility is core to our operating philosophy, and that commitment drives our dedication to People, Products, Community and the Planet. That commitment extends to our supply chain, and our suppliers play a critical role in ensuring that we manage our business in a responsible manner.

In 2010, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (also referred to as SB 657) was signed into law, and statutes enacted under the Act went into effect on January 1, 2012. The Act requires disclosure of particular efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking.

We are committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner and expect our suppliers to conduct themselves in the same manner. We have implemented various policies and procedures in our efforts to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. This disclosure will describe some of those efforts.
With the assistance of a third-party consultant, we survey our merchandise supply chains in order to evaluate and to address risks of slavery and human trafficking inherent in those activities. This survey forms the basis for additional anti-slavery, anti-human trafficking efforts, including targeted supplier requirements and third-party audits.

We have long used contractual provisions prohibiting the use of involuntary labor and child labor, and requiring compliance with applicable labor and employment laws, in the production of merchandise that we sell. We have a stringent Supplier Code of Conduct (“Code”) that sets out specific standards and requirements for any supplier we do business with which includes provisions to protect workers. Among other things, the Code requires our suppliers to allow factory inspections for contractual compliance, as well as for compliance with laws and regulations dealing with child or forced labor and unsafe working conditions.

In our efforts to confirm compliance with such contractual provisions and to document compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, each of our merchandise suppliers has been asked to certify that the materials incorporated into the merchandise they supply complies with applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Suppliers are also required to ensure that any subcontractor used in the manufacturing or distribution of any merchandise to us complies with the same standards.

Any supplier that is not able to provide the foregoing certification will be required, as a condition to continuing to supply merchandise to us, to submit an action plan to achieve such certification within a reasonable period of time. Those suppliers that fail to comply will be subject to increasing levels of discipline, up to and including termination of their relationships.

In an effort to verify supplier responses and to help us identify areas of increased risk of slavery and human trafficking, we are requiring that our suppliers complete a survey identifying measures they have taken, or intend to take, to prevent these abuses.

We have reviewed the risks of slavery and human trafficking presented by various parts of our supply chain and has inspected the factory premises of the suppliers of our own-branded merchandise for evidence of non-compliance with slavery and human trafficking laws. In addition, we have, on a risk-based basis, engaged third-party auditors to review compliance of certain suppliers with international social accountability standards.

Responsible employees have been advised of our prohibitions against the use of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. Additionally, we have implemented training requirements for employees with sourcing responsibilities."	Yes
268	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)

Updated on April 30, 2015

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) requires many companies, including SanDisk, to disclose on their websites the efforts they take to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for goods offered for sale. SB 657 requires disclosures regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability and training.

SanDisk’s core business philosophy is to conduct business under the principles of fairness, integrity and transparency. We strive to continuously improve our supply chain to support our Supplier Code of Conduct, Worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and corporate social responsibility efforts.

SanDisk has been a member of Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) since 2013. The EICC is comprised of leading electronics industry companies that have joined together to promote freely chosen employment, safe working conditions, ethical business practices, and environmental stewardship globally throughout the electronics industry supply chain. EICC members adhere to a common EICC Code of Conduct, which addresses supply chain performance expectations for labor, health and safety, environmental practices, ethics and management systems. SanDisk’s own Supplier Code of Conduct aligns with that of the EICC, and we, in turn, require similar commitments from our suppliers.

Verification

SanDisk provides manufacturing suppliers with a supplier survey, which, among other things, includes questions to help identify and assess risks of human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain. Survey responses are tracked, and upon SanDisk’s request, relevant documents, procedures and records are reviewed.

In addition, manufacturing suppliers receive and must acknowledge adherence to SanDisk’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which among other things, does not permit human trafficking and slavery by the supplier or in the supplier’s supply chain.

Auditing

SanDisk’s supplier supply chain audit program includes, among other things, evaluation of manufacturing suppliers’ compliance with respect to the prohibition of human trafficking and slavery set forth in the SanDisk Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct is available on our website at http://www.sandisk.com/assets/umbraco/aboutsandisk/corporate-social- responsibility/sandisk_supplier_code_of_ethical_conduct.pdf. Non-conformance upon audit is recorded in our corrective and preventive action system and monitored for correction and closure.

The above mentioned audits are conducted either by SanDisk and/or an independent third party based on the human trafficking and slavery standards set forth in the SanDisk Supplier Code of Conduct. Audits are typically announced prior to being conducted.

Certification

Most SanDisk manufacturing suppliers certify by contract or in terms and conditions that the materials and services incorporated into SanDisk products are made or provided in compliance with the relevant laws, including laws against slavery or human trafficking, of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Internal Accountability

SanDisk procurement and quality functions are responsible for administering the programs to ensure that manufacturing suppliers affirm compliance to the SanDisk Supplier Code of Conduct, including provisions regarding anti-trafficking and slavery.

In addition, SanDisk employees are required to annually acknowledge adherence to our Worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) available at https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/2536/code.pdf. The Code of Conduct requires employees to comply with the applicable laws of the places where SanDisk does business. SanDisk also provides an anonymous hotline in which to report any actual or suspected violations regarding, among other things, slavery and human trafficking. SanDisk policy is to not retaliate against persons bringing forward actual or suspected violations.

Training

SanDisk provides training on mitigating the risks of human trafficking and slavery in supply chains to our employees and management with direct responsibility for supply chain oversight. Such training is available as instructor-led sessions or online through our internal learning and development system. A refresh of the training is expected in 2015."	Yes

It is with this greater sense of community that we are developing policies and practices that support the eradication of slavery and human trafficking.

Save Mart expects its vendors, distributors, and business partners to adhere to the same high standards of ethical and legal conduct. We are putting in place a more in-depth vendor assessment and approval process that will include self-verification of the vendor's compliance with anti-slavery and human trafficking regulations.

Each of our vendors will also be required to certify that any materials incorporated into the products they supply to Save Mart, do comply with applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

Save Mart wants to ensure that its managers and employees, in particular those with direct responsibility for its supply chain, better understand how to evaluate and identify risk in this area. We will be developing and implementing training that will broaden this awareness, and provide knowledge of how to help mitigate such risks.

Save Mart does not currently conduct audits of its vendors to monitor their ongoing compliance with Save Mart's policies and standards.

271	"SciClone Pharmaceuticals California Transparency in Supply Chain Act

On September 30, 2010 SB 657, “The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010” was signed into law, for the purpose of eliminating the existence of products sold in California that are made with slave labor at any point in the supply chain. The Act requires certain businesses to disclose the extent and efforts taken to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from each business’ supply chain.

SciClone’s Suppliers

To produce its proprietary products, SciClone has determined to contract only with manufacturers in the United States and Western Europe. SciClone’s primary reason for this practice is to ensure the highest standards of quality for its pharmaceutical products. SciClone also believes that this practice minimizes the possibility that any kind of potential slave labor is used by these direct suppliers in the manufacture of its products. In particular, retention of direct manufacturing suppliers in the United States and Western Europe ensures that our direct suppliers are subject to the labor, health and safety laws and regulations in those jurisdictions.

Supplier Approval

Prior to approving and entering into contracts with manufacturing suppliers, SciClone evaluates suppliers for suitability as a SciClone business partner, and in particular compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Our supplier approval activities are based on our assessment of risk and may include supplier written responses to our inquiries, and on-site inspections of supplier facilities.

Supplier Verification, Auditing and Controls

Once a supplier is selected, SciClone utilizes contract terms, quality agreements, and regular certifications and audits to confirm suppliers’ compliance with SciClone’s supplier performance and quality expectations. Supplier compliance certification and audits are performed by SciClone employees. The frequency of supplier certifications and audits is based upon our assessment of risk as well as the supplier’s performance. Our on-site audits in the United States and Western Europe do not specifically include assessment for human trafficking and slavery activity.

Our agreements with manufacturing suppliers include commitments from our direct suppliers to comply with laws and regulations applicable to their services and the material provided by the supplier, which we believe includes compliance with local labor, health and safety requirements.

Internal Accountability

SciClone requires that all our employees comply with our Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as well as all company policies and procedures, and all laws and regulations that apply to company business operations. Compliance with laws would include compliance with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Any violations of SciClone’s policies are subject to disciplinary measures including dismissal as appropriate. For any supplier not meeting SciClone’s requirements under its contractual arrangements, SciClone reserves the right to terminate the agreement.

Click here to review this publication.

Supplier Audits. Factories that produce our merchandise are audited when we believe there is high risk for slave labor and human trafficking. The audits are conducted either by our own full time auditors or by approved 3rd party audit firms on our behalf. All auditors are trained to understand our Program, our expectations, and the specific local language and laws in each country. The audits are conducted on site, and involve discussions with workers, management interviews, a review of pertinent factory records, and a physical inspection of the factory and dormitory. After the audit, any violations of our standards are documented, and a detailed corrective action plan is required. Regular follow-up visits are also conducted to ensure efforts are made to correct any violations.

Supplier Training. We provide our vendors annual training to review and reinforce our Global Compliance Program Requirements in detail. Our training specifically reviews our Requirements related to slave labor and human trafficking, and how to identify high risk situations and potential non-compliance. As further reinforcement of our training, in December of 2011, we issued a notification to all of our merchandise suppliers outlining our policy related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, and our right to terminate a supplier if violations related to slave labor or human trafficking are cited.

Internal Training. We provide routine training on all of our Program Requirements both to auditors employed by Sears Holdings, as well as auditors employed by 3rd party audit firms who conduct social compliance audits on our behalf. In addition, Sears Holdings employees who visit factories as part of their job responsibilities are made aware of the indicators of slave labor and human trafficking, and are required to report any potential issues for further investigation."

SPI’s commitment extends to acting on any known credible information of any actual or potential trafficking or slavery in supply chains sourced in the United States or from other countries. SPI has conducted its own assessment of its supply chain for purposes of identifying risks associated with slavery and human trafficking. In this regard, SPI's primary business segment produces and sells lumber and lumber products sourced from trees grown in the Pacific Northwest of North America, areas that prohibit human trafficking and slavery of individuals. SPI’s supply of logs comes from the United States and Canada. Notwithstanding the source of our raw material, which SPI has considered in its assessment, SPI requires those contractors involved in the harvest and delivery of logs to company locations to certify that their practices comply with all legal requirements. The manufacturing process involves the use of a variety of supplies as well as maintenance items. Vendors supplying materials to the company will be educated about SPI’s policy through this website and are encouraged to certify that items made available to and used by SPI come from sources that are free from human trafficking and slavery. SPI will periodically monitor and share information with employees and suppliers about current developments in the area of human trafficking and slavery. Currently, SPI does not use the services of an independent outside auditor to specifically monitor compliance and verify supply chains with regard to human trafficking and slavery, nor does SPI intend to perform audits of suppliers . In the event that SPI receives credible information indicating that there is any possibility that human trafficking and slavery may be an issue in its supply chain, it will assess whether or not it should engage a third party to assist with an audit.

The Silgan Containers Supplier Code of Responsibility for Compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Silgan Containers maintains a valuable reputation in the business community for honesty and fair dealing by acting ethically and in accordance with the laws applicable to its business. It is Silgan's expectation that each of its suppliers will likewise conduct its business in a legal and ethical manner.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (""California Law"") addresses issues of slavery and human trafficking, which are crimes under state, federal and international laws. In support of this law, Silgan requires that its major manufacturing suppliers comply with their obligations under the California Law. Specifically, in supply agreements executed after the effective date of the California Law, Silgan requires certification of compliance with the California Law by those suppliers that are covered by the law, and that the supplier comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which the supplier produces its products. Silgan verifies such compliance in periodic contractual compliance audits that Silgan conducts. At times of contract renewals, Silgan reviews the certifications from these suppliers as it assesses their performance and determines which suppliers it will continue to do business with. Thus, Silgan maintains internal standards and procedures for its employees and contractors that fail to meet Silgan's standards regarding slavery and human trafficking. Silgan conducts training sessions on a periodic basis for Silgan purchasing managers with respect to the California Law."	Yes

Updated: March 2, 2012

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (the ""Act"") went into effect January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have gross worldwide sales of over $100M USD, to be transparent about the efforts they have undertaken to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. The Act requires disclosure regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability, and training.

Verification

Silver Spring Networks (“Silver Spring”) engages in verification of product supply chains through 1) the use of turnkey contract manufacturing partners whom comply with the Act, 2) the use of supplier questionnaires and 3) inspection of supplier facilities. Silver Spring requires its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws. Supplier verifications are not conducted by a third party.

Auditing

Silver Spring regularly conducts audits of its critical suppliers to evaluate overall supplier performance, their ability to meet product standards, and compliance with various laws. These audits are not performed by independent auditors and they are not unannounced.

Certification

Silver Spring requires its direct suppliers, in its agreements with direct suppliers or via purchase order terms and conditions, to certify their compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, conventions, ordinances and standards that relate to the manufacture and supply of products and services purchased.

Internal Accountability

Should Silver Spring be made aware of any violation of a law by an employee or supplier in the manufacture or supply of products and services purchased, Silver Spring will investigate the suspected case of non-compliance and will terminate such employee or a supplier agreement when a serious breach is found to have occurred.

Training

Silver Spring has adopted its own Code of Conduct (""Code"") for its employees and

contractors. The Code explicitly prohibits unethical or illegal business practices and directs employees and contractors to deal fairly and honestly with suppliers based on normal commercial considerations.

Skechers products are manufactured at independent factories around the world. Skechers USA, Inc. is committed to working only with vendors who conduct their businesses ethically and are socially responsible. It is never acceptable for any Skechers products to be produced using forced or child labor. Every factory producing Skechers products is required to comply with local labor laws, International Labor Organization conventions and Skechers’ standards regarding ethics and social responsibility.

Skechers USA, Inc. strives to ensure that all of its products are sourced, produced and delivered to our customers in a manner that upholds international labor and human rights standards. In order to ensure the absence of forced and child labor within its supply chain, Skechers USA, Inc. has undertaken the following efforts:

Supply Chain Verification and Evaluation

It is a requirement for all manufacturers doing business with Skechers to comply with Skechers’ Guidelines for Responsible Factory Operation. Compliance with the Guidelines for Responsible Factory Operation is mandatory and is required in order to do business with Skechers. Manufacturers are also required to post these Guidelines, as well as all labor laws and other internal policies in the workplace, in both English and the local language(s) where they may be seen by employees. Skechers further requires that all manufacturers certify that they do not employ, in whole or in part, convict labor, forced labor, indentured labor or child labor at any stage of the manufacturing process.

Skechers uses the manufacturer certifications as well as audits of all manufacturers’ conformity with these Guidelines in order to verify its product supply chains and to address and reduce risks of human trafficking and slavery. Skechers does not use any third parties and performs this verification internally.

Auditing of Suppliers

Manufacturer factories are regularly audited by Skechers employees. Factories are audited for a number of issues, chief among which is verification of the absence of forced or child labor. The presence of forced or child labor would mean the immediate failure of the audit and the right for Skechers to terminate any relationship with such manufacturer. These audits are done on both a scheduled and an unannounced basis, and include interviews with the manufacturers’ employees themselves.

Skechers additionally audits its manufacturers for health and safety conditions and eco-friendly initiatives in their factories. These additional items are audited on the basis of Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA) guidelines.

Certification of Materials Incorporated into Skechers Products

Skechers requires that all manufacturers certify that they do not employ, in whole or in part, convict labor, forced labor, indentured labor or child labor at any stage of the manufacturing process.

Additionally, all potential vendors of materials used in the manufacture of Skechers products must certify on their applications that they do not use underage, involuntary, prison, convict, slave, indentured, bonded or other forced labor. All vendors must comply with FDRA guidelines, as well as all applicable local and national laws. Failure to comply will result in Skechers’ ability to terminate any business relationship with such vendor.

Internal Accountability Standards and Procedures

Skechers maintains and enforces internal accountability procedures for employees, and contractors regarding company standards in slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non-compliance with company standards, including those regarding the use of underage, involuntary, prison, convict, slave, indentured, bonded or other forced labor, Skechers may terminate the business relationship.

Training of Employees and Management

Skechers requires that all internal employees whose job functions involve overseeing production and/or auditing of manufacturers, as well as all manufacturers themselves, attend workshops held by the FDRA twice a year. These FDRA workshops include the Overseas Labor Practice Workshop where some of the most important issues related to footwear sustainability, social compliance and product safety are discussed. Skechers additionally provides internal training to ensure that those employees whose job functions involve overseeing production and/or auditing of manufacturers are knowledgeable and aware of the most current issues and concerns regarding convict labor, forced labor, indentured labor, child labor and human trafficking. Skechers makes materials available such that its employees have a clear understanding regarding Skechers’ policies on these issues."	Yes

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (hereinafter the “Act”) requires certain companies manufacturing or selling products in the State of California to disclose their efforts (if any) to eradicate forced labor and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for goods they offer for sale.

Smart & Final Inc. and its subsidiary companies (“Smart & Final”) fully support the purpose and goals of the Act and oppose the use of slavery or human trafficking in the manufacture and distribution of our products. Although our policies are currently under development, we are continually exploring effective methods to ensure compliance with the Act and eliminate the presence of slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain.

We have adopted a company policy condemning the use of slavery and human trafficking. We are developing this policy to include effective processes that identify, prevent and mitigate the impact of forced labor in our supply chain.

We maintain open lines of communication with our suppliers, managers, employees, investors, customers, and other stakeholders on a regular basis. Our policy against slavery and human trafficking, as well as measures we are taking to ensure monitoring of risks associated with the same, will be an important part of this communication. We are also considering how to properly provide training on our policy to our employees and managers, which we intend to include in our regular staff meetings.

We are evaluating our supplier agreements as well as the terms and conditions found in our standard purchase agreements to determine ways to ensure our suppliers are complying with our policy against slavery and human trafficking. For example, we intend to contact our suppliers to request that they provide certification that the products provided by them, and the materials incorporated into those products, are manufactured in compliance with our company’s policy and the slavery and human trafficking laws in the countries in which the suppliers do business. We are also exploring the possibility of requiring direct suppliers to be responsible for monitoring the compliance of their own suppliers.

We plan to conduct a risk assessment of each of our direct suppliers, based on a variety of factors such as geographic location, the type of product provided, the amount of manual labor required for production, and any other publicly-available information regarding the supplier’s reputation and operations. Any supplier identified internally as “high-risk” will be subject to further review by the company. We hope this review will initiate a dialogue between our company and the supplier, such that a proper plan may be developed for monitoring and correcting any possible deficiencies in the supplier’s processes.

Although we do not currently conduct audits of our suppliers, we are considering the role of internal audits and self-reporting by suppliers as a method of compliance, as well as any mechanisms that the company can implement to monitor compliance with our policy. Independent auditors are not currently used but will be considered if the circumstances require. Any time we evaluate new suppliers for our corporate brand labels we conduct an on-site audit of their facilities. We are considering adding compliance with the Act to these on-site audits."	Yes

Spansion Compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Beginning in 2012, many companies selling or manufacturing products in the state of California will be required to disclose information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains.

Spansion requires all suppliers to comply with its Supplier Code of Conduct. This document was adopted directly from the Electronic Industries Code of Conduct, which was developed by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Specific standards addressing forced labor and human trafficking in Spansion’s Supplier Code of Conduct are:

1) Freely Chosen Employment

Forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor shall not be used. All work will be voluntary, and workers shall be free to leave upon reasonable notice. Workers shall not be required to hand over government-issued identification, passports or work permits to the Participant or Labor Agent as a condition of employment.

2) Child Labor Avoidance

Child labor is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing. The term “child” refers to any person under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programs, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported. Workers under the age of 18 shall not perform work that is likely to jeopardize the health or safety of young workers.

Spansion will introduce a self-assessment audit program in 2012 that will evaluate compliance of our Tier 1 suppliers with the Supplier Code of Conduct. The above standards will be included, along with an evaluation of whether such suppliers impose similar standards on their suppliers. This audit program is part of a larger assessment program that includes corporate social responsibility, business continuity, security logistics, and environmental resource conservation efforts. Suppliers that continue to fail to meet the Spansion Supplier Code of Conduct requirements will be eliminated from its supply chain.

Spansion believes that continued education of our employees is an important means to reinforce Spansion’s commitment to the highest ethical and compliance standards. This commitment was reinforced in 2011 through a corporate-wide training class specifically addressing Spansion’s Corporate Social Responsibility program. This mandatory course



emphasized responsibility in meeting Spansion’s commitment to ethical behavior, both as individuals and as a corporation.

Spansion’s Code of Business Conduct supports the company’s commitment to high ethical standards and compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies, and applies to all employees, officers and directors of the company. The Code of Business Conduct requires each employee to act in a professional manner towards other employees, contractors, vendors and customers that will reflect positively on the company. It also states that one of the company’s core values is respect for people: “We treat all people inside and outside the company with fairness and dignity. We conduct our business with a spirit of empathy, compassion, and cooperation.” In this regard, unprofessional conduct, including without limitation the promotion of slavery or human trafficking, is considered unacceptable conduct that will subject an employee to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment.

Overview

Sport Chalet is a leading operator of full service, specialty sporting goods stores offering a broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment, apparel and footwear. Our stores offer over 50 services for the sports enthusiast, including climbing, backcountry skiing, ski mountaineering, avalanche education, and mountain trekking instruction, car rack installation, snowboard and ski rental and repair, Scuba training and certification, Scuba boat charters, team sales, custom golf club fitting, racquet stringing, and bicycle tune-up and repair at its store locations. In addition, we have a Team Sales Division and an online store at sportchalet.com.



Our strategy is to be first to market with performance, technology and lifestyle merchandise for the serious sports enthusiast. Our merchandise assortment includes traditional sporting goods merchandise (e.g., footwear, apparel and other general athletic merchandise) and core specialty merchandise such as snowboarding, skateboarding, mountaineering and Scuba.



We purchase merchandise from over 1,000 vendors. Our largest vendor, Nike, Inc., accounts for approximately 10% of our total inventory purchases, and our ten largest vendors collectively account for approximately 40% of our total purchases.



In general, we believe that our emphasis on higher end specialty items produced by the world's leading brand names helps to ensure that our product supply chain is relatively free of human rights abuses compared with other sporting goods retailers who are more dependent on value pricing.





Policy

Sport Chalet is committed to sourcing its products only from vendors who have agreed to operate their supply chains in a socially responsible manner. In particular, Sport Chalet condemns the use of child labor, slavery and human trafficking.



Evaluation of Supply Chain

We evaluate of our product supply chain to determine the likelihood that our direct product supply chain is tainted by human rights abuses, including child labor, slavery and human trafficking, in light of the specific circumstances of our operations. This assessment segments our vendors into a limited number of risk weighted categories based on such factors as country of origin, type of product produced, publicly available information concerning the vendor's human rights record, reports of human rights organizations, and the annual dollar value of purchases. Based upon this evaluation, we determined that we have no principal vendor who presents a substantial likelihood of child labor, slavery or human trafficking. This evaluation was conducted solely by our own product sourcing experts and not by a third party.



Vendor Audits

It is a condition to doing business with Sport Chalet that each vendor agree to comply with the laws of the countries in which they do business (including laws against child labor, slavery or human trafficking, and unsafe working conditions). This condition is included in our Vendor Partnership Guide which is incorporated into our standard terms and conditions governing every purchase order issued by us. In addition, we require each vendor periodically to acknowledge in writing its understanding of our policy requiring full compliance with all applicable laws. In developing effective verification mechanisms, we strongly encourage each vendor to implement an anonymous employee grievance procedure administered by an independent third party.



We reserve the right to inspect factories for compliance with applicable laws and to suspend or terminate the relationship with any vendor for a failure to comply with applicable laws or to cooperate in any such inspection. In general, we will not conduct audits of vendor compliance using independent third parties or unannounced inspections because we do not believe that the substantial costs of such audits or inspections would provide meaningful protection for workers within our supply chain which is comprised primarily of the world's leading brand names.





Certification of Compliance with Laws

We require vendors periodically to acknowledge in writing their understanding of our policy requiring full compliance with all applicable laws (including laws against child labor, slavery or human trafficking, and unsafe working conditions).



Internal Accountability

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the relationship with any vendor for a failure to comply with applicable laws or to cooperate in any inspection of its factories.



Training

289	"Transparency in the Supply Chain



As a manufacturer doing business in the state of California, California State law requires us to provide disclosure regarding our efforts to address the issue of slave labor and human trafficking in our supply chain.



Stanley Black & Decker is actively committed to eradicating human trafficking and slavery from its supply chain. Suppliers are prohibited from using prison, forced, or child labor, and must provide a work environment free from physical punishment of any kind. Rates of pay must comply with the national laws of the countries in which the suppliers do business. Employee work hours must be limited to those authorized by applicable laws, and employees must be properly compensated for overtime. All suppliers must respect the right of workers to freely associate and organize. Stanley Black & Decker’s suppliers are not permitted to use bonded laborers. Suppliers’ employees must be free to leave manufacturing facilities and not subject to unreasonable restrictions on their movements. Suppliers’ employees must be free to terminate their employment at will.



Stanley Black & Decker trains its managers and employees concerning these standards and verification of compliance by suppliers. While no written certification of compliance is currently required from our suppliers, supplier compliance is ensured by annual supplier self-assessments, followed by on-site audits and requalification audits. These audits are conducted personally by Stanley Black & Decker auditing teams and include confidential employee interviews of individuals selected by Stanley Black & Decker. The audits are announced to the suppliers only with as much lead time as minimally necessary to ensure that all required documentation is available to the auditing team. These on-site audits include verification of time and pay records. Suppliers are rated for compliance with Stanley Black & Decker practices and standards. Deficiencies found during supplier audits can result in graduated penalties, ranging from requirements for corrective action plans and follow up audits to termination of the business relationship."

Staples is committed to providing our customers with top-quality products at a reasonable price, but that are also manufactured responsibly. That means we expect workers making Staples® Brand Products to be treated fairly and with dignity and respect, and that the products themselves are made in an environmentally sustainable manner. In addition, we demand adherence to any and all appropriate international and U.S. laws, regulations and industry standards applicable in the countries where Staples operates.

Staples® Supplier Code of Conduct



To establish clear guidelines for responsible operation, we developed the Staples Supplier Code of Conduct to help ensure every relationship we enter — whether it’s with a supplier, factory or vendor — consistently operates in accordance with Staples’ requirements. The Supplier Code of Conduct (or its equivalent) is included as an appendix to each manufacturing agreement and each supplier is required to comply with its provisions and post the Code in all factory locations manufacturing Staples® Brand Products.



In general, the Code is based on international social accountability standards and contains 10 specific areas of conduct which are each evaluated during on-site audits. The Code is regularly reviewed and reinforced as business needs and requirements change.

Social Accountability Audits



The Director of Product Quality oversees supplier auditing to ensure compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct. All audits are carried out by external, independent third parties. The Director of Product Quality works closely with the Vice President of Product Development, Sourcing and Quality, who is in charge of producing goods, and with the Director of International Supply Chain, who is in charge of shipping goods from the supplier to the end destination and maintaining compliance with all security provisions. Both individuals report up to the SVP for the Staples® Brand Group.



All suppliers in “at-risk” geographies are required to be audited prior to starting production and are recertified every year. For example, Staples currently designates the following countries as “at-risk” in accordance with industry assessments: China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, The Philippines, Egypt, Argentina and Brazil. Each audit is designed to allow the factory to demonstrate adherence to our Code through onsite verification by a trained auditor. The auditor conducts employee interviews and document reviews to substantiate factory operating practices and rates the factory on a point scale.

A summary of the audit sections and requirements can be found here.



Certain requirements are deemed “Critical” to create minimum standards for each supplier to consistently achieve. Suppliers failing to meet the minimum requirements are required to sign a Letter of Commitment which states their intent to continuously improve and requests a probationary period to implement the necessary changes. They are also required to complete a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) documenting the steps they will take and the timeline for the necessary improvements. Suppliers who meet the minimum requirements but have violations in other areas receive a conditional pass and may also be required to submit a CAP. All CAPs must be approved prior to Staples continuing business with the supplier. Follow-up audits are scheduled at regular intervals to ensure suppliers stay on track while on probation and when all CAP plans have been implemented."	Yes
291	"Starbucks Disclosure in Compliance with

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)

Starbucks believes we have a responsibility to advocate policies that support not only the health of our business, but of our partners (employees) and the communities in which we do business.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (the “Act”) requires large retailers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale.

Starbucks has a long history of promoting Ethical Sourcing of its products, which are produced in countries all over the world, and has been publicly recognized on several occasions for its programs in this area. We have devoted considerable resources over the last several years to mapping our supply chain and developing and implementing appropriate ethical standards applicable to suppliers and those involved in the production, processing and manufacturing of the products we sell.

Our Ethical Sourcing programs consist of: C.A.F.E. Practices (Coffee and Farmer Equity Practices) concerning the sourcing of coffee; Cocoa Practices concerning the sourcing of cocoa; and our Manufactured Goods and Services Standards which govern our acquisition of manufactured products. Starbucks works with Scientific Certification Systems, an independent third party, which assists us in maintaining both the C.A.F.E Practices and Cocoa Practices indicators set forth in the scorecards and in retaining third party verifiers to evaluate supplier performance against these indicators. Third party verifiers are also used in the Manufactured Goods program. Starbucks uses announced audits, rather than unannounced audits, to ensure that appropriate management personnel are present during the audit. This approach also provides an opportunity to offer best practices training to the appropriate personnel when non-compliance with Starbucks ethical sourcing standards are noted.

In compliance with the Act, Starbucks certifies that its Ethical Sourcing programs include zero tolerance provisions prohibiting the use of: forced, bonded, indentured or involuntary convict labor (in the case of C.A.F.E. Practices); involuntary, forced or trafficked labor (in the case of Cocoa Practices); and slave labor, bonded labor,

indentured labor or involuntary convict labor (in the case of Manufactured Goods). If it is determined that a supplier is operating outside of Starbucks policies, Starbucks or its third party representative and the supplier will develop and implement a corrective action plan including a mutually agreed upon schedule for resolution of all issues. Any failure thereafter to meet a corrective action plan commitment is considered a material breach of Starbucks agreement with the supplier and may result in cancellation of any current orders and/or termination of Starbucks contractual relationship with the supplier. Gross violations or illegal activities are cause for outright and immediate termination of the contractual and business relationship.

In addition to our Ethical Sourcing programs, Starbucks also implements and further discloses the following corporate policies which address anti-slavery and human trafficking: Global Human Rights, Supplier Code of Conduct Overview and Standards of Business Conduct.

Since Starbucks programs and policies pre-date the Act, the language and implementation may not exactly match the prescriptions of this new law. It is our opinion, however, that Starbucks programs go well beyond what is required by the Act. Starbucks is currently in the process of requesting that each of its suppliers certify that the materials incorporated into the products they produce comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country in which the supplier is doing business. In addition, Starbucks employees with direct responsibility for supply chain management are specifically trained on Starbucks Ethical Sourcing standards. As part of our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement, we will be reviewing our programs and policies on an ongoing basis for possible additions or amendments where needed to address the specific topics described in the law.

We encourage you to learn more about Starbucks responsible business practices at www.starbucks.com/responsibility which discloses at length and in detail, our various Ethical Sourcing programs and policies. It is Starbucks intention to make its customers, as well as other interested consumers, aware of all that we do to ensure that, among other things, our supply chain is free of forced or trafficked labor."

The act declares that slavery and human trafficking are crimes under state, federal, and international law and requires that retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chain. The statements below are Stryker’s response to this requirement.

1. Stryker will conduct a risk assessment in order to evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and slavery when we conduct our annual comprehensive assessment of our product supply chain. We do not use a third party for verification.

2. Stryker conducts audits of our suppliers to assess their compliance with our standards for suppliers, including those meant to eliminate trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The verification is not achieved via independent unannounced audits.

3. We require that our direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

4. We maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or suppliers failing to meet our company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

5. We plan to provide company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products."	Yes
294	"SunPower Human Rights Statement

SunPower Corporation and all of its subsidiaries (collectively “SunPower”) are committed to human rights and, as such, are focused on the elimination of human trafficking and slavery from its direct supply chain. Accordingly, SunPower requires its direct suppliers to ensure that they do not engage in any form of human trafficking and slavery. In order to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and slavery occurring in its supply chain, SunPower has adopted the measures discussed below.

Product Supply Chain Human Trafficking Risk Assessment: SunPower is in the process of conducting a human trafficking risk assessment of its supply chain. Information obtained from such an assessment will be mapped against the US State Department’s list of locations at high risk for human trafficking. Such an analysis will be conducted internally through our supply chain organization without a third-party organization or company.

Supplier Audits: SunPower intends to retain the right to conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier’s compliance with SunPower’s standards regarding human trafficking and slavery in supply chains. SunPower may audit suppliers deemed as high risk based on applicable factors and on the US State Department’s list of high-risk locations for human trafficking. If such audits are conducted, SunPower will conduct a preliminary audit of the supplier and, if warranted, a third-party audit firm would be retained to do a follow-up audit. In both scenarios, audits will likely be announced in advance.

Supplier Certification: SunPower requires its first tier direct material suppliers to sign a contract amendment verifying that they are not engaged, either directly or indirectly, in human trafficking or slavery. In the event that SunPower has a business relationship with a direct material supplier but no master contract agreement in place, suppliers are required to sign a policy statement demonstrating their commitment not to engage, either directly or indirectly, in human trafficking or slavery. 

Fundamental to complying with SunPower's requirement that its direct suppliers do not engage in human trafficking and slavery, a supplier, in all of its activities, must operate in full compliance with laws, rules, and regulations applicable to human trafficking and slavery in the countries in which it operates, as well as any other related applicable laws. Indeed, SunPower expects its direct suppliers to go beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognized standards, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact, to ensure that human trafficking and slavery do not occur in SunPower's direct supply chain. Further, SunPower expects its direct suppliers to undertake the necessary measures to ensure that their direct suppliers do not engage in human trafficking and slavery. Violation of any of SunPower's standards, regarding human trafficking and slavery, set forth above, may result in the termination of SunPower’s business relationship with Supplier.

Accountability & Management Systems: In addition to having the right to audit suppliers to evaluate suppliers’ compliance with SunPower’s standards regarding human rights and slavery, SunPower has also explicitly stated in its contracts with suppliers and in SunPower’s Commitment to the Elimination of Human Trafficking and Slavery that any violations of SunPower’s standards, regarding human trafficking and slavery, may result in the termination of SunPower’s business relationship with a supplier. 

SunPower holds its employees to the same standards as its suppliers. Human rights violations by our employees are unacceptable and impermissible pursuant to the principles and values embodied in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”). SunPower has also formalized our commitment to human rights by adopting the UN Global Compact. An employee’s conduct (or failure to act), which is inconsistent with the principles and values embraced in SunPower’s Code of Conduct and the UN Global Compact, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including, termination of the employee’s employment.

Anti-Human Trafficking Training and Communications: SunPower will review human trafficking concerns in the context of its supply chain with executive staff through the Sustainability Council and with employees who manage suppliers.

296	"The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 now requires that companies manufacturing or selling products in the State of California disclose the scope of their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain for goods offered for sale. Our Code of Basic Working Conditions expressly forbids the use of illegal child labor and forced labor, regardless of its form (e.g.,slavery and human trafficking). Moreover, slavery and human trafficking are crimes under state, federal and international law.
 




In support of California’s effort to identify and eliminate slavery and human trafficking from supply chains, we as a company have initiated or will initiate programs in the following ways to help ensure that no slavery or human trafficking exists within our direct supply chain:

We request our significant suppliers to provide information on their operations so that we may evaluate and address the risk of slavery and human trafficking. These suppliers in aggregate represent approximately eighty percent of our supply chain expenditures.
 

Although, based on current information, our supply chain is unlikely to incorporate slavery or human trafficking, if serious risks are identified, we will conduct audits and/or retain third-party investigators.
 

As we place new orders, our purchase orders require our suppliers to affirmatively represent and warrant that it is in compliance with applicable laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking.
 

Our company policies require our employees to operate in accordance with the law and to report any violation of laws by our suppliers and others of which they become aware. Accordingly, we have internal accountability standards and procedures in place in the event of any instances of slavery or human trafficking.
 

Supply Chain employees are trained with regard to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, including mitigation of risks of slavery and human trafficking within the direct supply chain.
 

Through our efforts and those of our suppliers, we strive to enable responsible purchasing decisions throughout the supply chain as we work together to eradicate slavery and human trafficking.

We are providing this information pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 to educate consumers on how we manage our supply chains, and, thereby, to improve the lives of victims of slavery and human trafficking.



Supermicro engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery by requiring that all suppliers to Supermicro sign a vendor compliance agreement whereby they agree to comply with certain standards of conduct. Among the compliance requirements is a strict prohibition of any use of forced labor or human trafficking in violation of applicable laws. Vendors must further assure us that they are in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The vendor compliance agreement must be in place before Supermicro accepts any product from the supplier and may only be signed by an authorized signatory of the supplier. This verification is conducted internally by Supermicro and not by a third party.



Supermicro intends to conduct random audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. These audits may or may not be announced and will be conducted by Supermicro, not an independent party.



Supermicro requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.



Supermicro does not currently maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. We are, however, at this time evaluating the proper standards and procedures to implement, if any.



Supermicro believes that it has established a culture of responsibility and ethical and moral behavior. However, Supermicro does not currently provide company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. We are evaluating what formal training to implement.

301	"￼Teledyne’s Disclosure under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

December 14, 2011 Updated: November 8, 2013

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California, like Teledyne, to disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain to tangible goods offered for sale. The following is disclosure under the Act for Teledyne and its subsidiaries:

1. Risk Assessment/Verification. Teledyne has periodically assessed risks associated with its supply chain, including that of its subsidiaries and business units. Its Supplier Risk Mitigation Procedure reminds Teledyne companies to consider a combination of selection criteria, apart from price alone, when selecting suppliers. One such question to be considered is whether the supplier has a written policy barring the use of forced labor, slavery or human trafficking or has otherwise certified to Teledyne that it will not engage in any such conduct. Nonetheless, while Teledyne’s supply chain is linked globally, Teledyne believes that the countries in which its suppliers are predominantly located and the vast majority of items, components and parts supplied for its products are not such that would present significant risk of slavery and human trafficking. This belief is based in part on information contained in the Trafficking in Persons Report 2013 published by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor issued on September 26, 2012. Because of this low risk, Teledyne has not employed a third party for verification.

2. Auditing. Because Teledyne does not believe this risk in its supply chain is significant, Teledyne has not audited its suppliers for compliance. To the extent this belief changes, Teledyne will consider stronger measures such as auditing or third party verification for any suppliers that it determines present greater risk.

3. Supplier Agreement. In November 2011, Teledyne issued a Supplier Bulletin alerting suppliers to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Teledyne publishes a booklet entitled “Ethics – Code of Conduct for Service Providers,” which sets forth various policies of Teledyne and standards of business conduct expected from our suppliers. Among other things, these guidelines expressly require suppliers to comply

with applicable laws and regulations. Teledyne has now revamped and is replacing these guidelines with a Code of Conduct for Service Providers. Such Code of Conduct makes it clear that Teledyne does not intend to do business with suppliers that are engaged in slavery and human trafficking. Additionally, such Code restates Teledyne’s expectation that its suppliers provide a workplace free from harassment and discrimination, as well as a safe and sanitary workplace. In its terms and conditions on purchase orders, Teledyne also added a sentence asking its suppliers to represent and warrant that they do not and will not knowingly engage in any forced labor, slavery or human trafficking.

4. Internal Accountability. Teledyne requires its employees to sign a booklet entitled “Global Code of Ethical Business Conduct” and provides periodic ethics training to its employees. It also requires its consultants, sales representatives and distributors to sign its “Ethics – Code of Conduct for Service Providers.” Teledyne makes it clear in these Codes, and in Teledyne‐sponsored training efforts, that Teledyne does not intend to do business with suppliers that are engaged in slavery and human trafficking. Additionally, as part of its training efforts, Teledyne will advise its employees and it service providers to bring any suspected supplier issues involving slavery and human trafficking to the attention of Teledyne’s Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer, local ethics personnel or management. Employees are periodically reminded that the failure to comply with laws and Teledyne’s policies and guidelines may be grounds for disciplinary action, including termination. Agreements with consultants, sales representatives and distributors provide for termination for noncompliance with laws and standards of conduct.

5. Procurement Training. Teledyne’s provides periodic training to its employees responsible for procurement. Teledyne has undertaken to familiarize its buyers with identifying slavery and human trafficking issues and mitigating such risks, among others, within its supply chain of products. As noted above, one of many questions procurement personnel are to consider when selecting a supplier relates to slavery and human trafficking."	Yes
302	"Chevron Disclosure Statement | February 2012

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires many companies manufacturing or selling products in the state of California to disclose their efforts (if any) to address the issue of forced labor and human trafficking in their supply chains. The law was designed to increase consumers’ knowledge about products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Chevron’s Commitments

Chevron’s commitment to respecting human rights wherever we operate is embodied in The Chevron Way, our Operational Excellence Management System, our Business Conduct and Ethics Code and our Human Rights Policy.

Our Business Conduct and Ethics Code provides information about how we conduct our day-to-day business activities according to the principles of The Chevron Way. The Business Conduct and Ethics Code, which also includes our Human Rights Policy, is required reading for all directors and employees. Failure to comply with company policies and procedures may result in disciplinary actions up to and including termination.

As part of our Human Rights Policy implementation, we have refreshed our human rights training programs. We have also broadened the training population to include relevant employees and contractors in the Procurement/Supply Chain Management organization.

Supplier Engagement

Chevron encourages contractors, suppliers and service providers to conduct their business in a manner consistent with Chevron standards. These expectations are communicated through a variety of channels, including Chevron’s contracts.

We have specific language in our policies related to engagement with suppliers on labor issues. We require that our suppliers adhere to all applicable domestic laws and encourage them to be consistent with the International Labor Organization’s core labor principles.

We have begun the process of updating supplier contracts to reinforce expectations related to labor standards that address the use of forced or involuntary labor. We also are working to raise awareness of potential labor issues with our key suppliers through supplier forums and other efforts.

Through our Contractor Health, Environment and Safety Management and Supplier Qualification processes, we work with suppliers to increase accountability and continually improve their performance. Major suppliers are selected for periodic audits based on a risk ranking determined by the nature of the work to be performed and responses to a questionnaire on supplier policies, processes and performance. Business units may use internal, external or third-party auditing resources, depending on the audit strategy. The audits cover health, environmental and safety standards and compliance. Particular labor issues or concerns may be emphasized as part of this process, depending on the business location.

304	"The Clorox Company

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure Statement

The Clorox Company has programs to effectively manage the risks of slavery and trafficking throughout our supply chain.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct (“Business Partner Code”) addresses business practices of our third-party business partners, including suppliers, distributors, consultants, joint ventures, licensees, and other business partners (“business partners”). Our Business Partner Code contains specific provisions addressing human rights, labor, and business conduct, including verification of our product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

To that end, we regularly ask our Business Partners to self-certify their compliance with the principles in our Business Partner Code (either in a contract and/or a Business Partner Code of Conduct self- certification form). Suppliers are expected to designate management staff to monitor their factories, production facilities and compliance with our Business Partner Code. Our supply agreements also contain representations that our business partners are in compliance with all applicable federal, state and/or provincial, regional, municipal, and local laws, codes, regulations, rules, ordinances, decrees, permits, registrations and orders, which would include laws addressing human trafficking and slavery. In addition, Clorox may conduct semi-announced visits and/or have third-parties monitor visits to ensure compliance with the Business Partner Code, including compliance with prohibition on slavery and human trafficking. Clorox also requires in the Code that business partners certify that materials incorporated into Clorox’s products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

The Clorox Compliance Hotline, where permissible under local laws, is available to all employees, directors and contractors, as well as our business partners, their employees or their subcontractors. The hotline, where permissible, enables the reporting of noncompliance by Clorox’s business partners, their employees or subcontractors. Clorox employees who do not act promptly to report noncompliance matters may be subject to disciplinary action.

We provide all non-production employees regular training regarding compliance with the

Clorox Code of Conduct, which also includes provisions prohibiting the use of forced labor. We have conducted global training for our product supply leadership, internal team members with direct responsibility for supply chain management, and have begun training our business partners to identify and address risks of slavery and trafficking in our supply chain.

Finally, as part of our Responsible Sourcing & Sustainability program, we evaluate (and may use third parties to evaluate) our supply chains for risk, including human rights and labor risks such as trafficking and slavery. We support our Business Partner Code with site visits, self-assessments and third-party audits. We are active members of AIM-Progress and the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex) through which have started engaging our business partners in Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audits. We support mutual recognition platforms for audits to encourage our business partners to focus on remediation and improvements rather than re-audit by multiple customers. In the event concerns arise, we will investigate the matter and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk by either terminating the relationship or remediating to ensure our business partner is in compliance with our Business Partner Code."

305	"Forced Labor and Human Trafficking

Our Human Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principles expressly prohibit the use of all forms of forced labor, including prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, military labor, slave labor and human trafficking.

The Coca-Cola Company's Human Rights Policy applies to all of the entities that it owns, holds a majority interest in or for which we have management responsibility. Our Human Rights Policy is guided by international human rights principles, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The policy provides a consistent approach to workplace rights worldwide and embeds it as an integral part of our culture, strategy and day-to-day operations. We conduct independent third party assessments of our operations to validate compliance to our Human Rights Policy. In the past year, we have trained thousands of Company associates on our Human Rights Policy. This training has now been incorporated as a standard training module for all employees.

Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) communicate our values and expectations of suppliers and emphasize the importance of responsible workplace practices that respect human rights and comply, at a minimum, with applicable environmental and local labor laws and core international conventions. The Supplier Guiding Principles reflect our commitment to respect human rights across our business system and global supply chain.

These minimum requirements are a part of all agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and all of our direct and authorized suppliers that make up our global supply chain. We expect our suppliers to develop and implement appropriate internal business processes to ensure compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles. The Company routinely verifies compliance by using independent third parties to assess suppliers' compliance with the SGP; the assessments generally include confidential interviews with employees and on-site contract workers. If a supplier fails to uphold any aspect of the SGP requirements, the supplier is expected to implement corrective actions. The Company reserves the right to conduct unannounced audits at is discretion and to terminate an agreement with any supplier that cannot demonstrate that it is upholding the SGP requirements. Company employees are required to report any violation of Company policy or law, including WRP and SGP. The Company maintains a third-party service to allow employees and vendors to report violations 24 hours a day. In all of our Purchase Orders, suppliers certify that all product supplied is in compliance with all applicable country laws and regulations, including those regarding forced labor, including human trafficking.

The Coca-Cola Company is a founding member of the Global Business Coalition Against Human Trafficking (gBCAT), a group of global corporations that recognize the critical role business can play in ending human trafficking and all forms of modern-day slavery.

The mission of gBCAT is to mobilize the expertise, resources and collective voice of its members to eliminate human trafficking and other forms of forced labor in supply chains. Other founding members include: ExxonMobil, Microsoft, Delta Air Lines, Carlson, ManpowerGroup, LexisNexis, NXP and Travelport.

The Coca-Cola Company expressly prohibits any form of human trafficking within our system or by any company that directly supplies or provides services to our business. We conduct more than 2,000 audits each year of our Company, franchise bottlers and supply chain to ensure compliance with our workplace and human rights policies, which include provisions prohibiting human trafficking.

In February 2012, we hosted a conference on human trafficking in labor sourcing, which was attended by more than 75 business leaders, human rights experts investors, NGOs, legal experts and others. The conference focused on exploring solutions to eliminate human trafficking in labor sourcing. 

In January 2013 in Atlanta, we sponsored a panel discussion on human trafficking that was moderated by former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin. In May 2013, in conjunction with our human rights conference, we hosted a one-day multi-stakeholder meeting on human trafficking sponsored by the Institute for Human Rights and Business and Humanity United to address two key contributors to human trafficking: holding of passports and payment of recruiting fees.

Recognizing that migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking, in 2014 we reviewed our policies and due diligence activities with the aim of better protecting such workers throughout our supply chain.   We publically committed to three principles related to the recruitment and employment of migrant workers: 

Employment terms are represented in a truthful, clear manner and in the language understood by workers prior to employment

Worker does not pay recruitment, placement or transportation fees (including transportation to and from host country)

Worker has access to personal identity documents (2 hours)

These principles, along with our strong overall prohibition of forced labor, align with the recent Executive Order 13627 and create a framework for responsible and transparent recruitment and employment practices."	Yes
306	"The Container Store seeks to ensure that the people working throughout our supply chain are treated with fairness, dignity and respect - an aspiration that is borne out of our commitment to the individual in our own employee-first culture. And, even though The Container Store neither operates the factories where our products are manufactured, nor do we directly verify our supply chains, we expect our suppliers to be aware of and prevent human trafficking and slavery.

 

The Container Store will not do business with any company in which we know utilizes slave labor or engages in human trafficking. Through agreements, our suppliers certify that the finished products they sell to us and the materials used to create them were not produced from child or forced labor and comply with the local laws in which they operate. Our employees conduct announced audits of those suppliers with whom we acquire goods directly from the factory and in which we have a direct cross-dock process in our distribution center. Finally, we have instituted training of employees who have a direct responsibility for supply chain management to raise awareness and help to identify slave labor.

 

Through building close, mutually beneficial relationships, we know that our suppliers have the ability to focus on their own employees, pay them fairly and ensure that they work in a safe and healthy environment that fosters an inclusive and respectful workplace."	Yes

DISCLOSURES REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010 

The Dow Chemical Company (""Dow"") is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and is committed to promoting socially responsible conduct that aligns to the 10 universally accepted principles, including those related to human rights and labor: (4) the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor and (5) the effective abolition of child labor. These principles are woven throughout The Diamond Standard — Dow's Code of Business Conduct (the ""Code""). All employees of Dow and its subsidiaries, including those with direct responsibility for supply chain management, are expected to know and abide by this Code. Rigorous training on the content and application of the Code is mandatory for each and every employee, and each employee must periodically acknowledge that they have read and agree to comply with the Code. Dow takes seriously and fully investigates all potential legal or Code violations, in a respectful, confidential and fair manner. When an allegation of an employee Code violation is substantiated, an appropriate management team is convened to review the investigation findings and determine a final outcome. Consistent with the severity of the violation, discipline can include verbal or written warning, suspension with or without pay, loss or reduction of bonus or stock options, demotion or, for the most serious offenses or repeated misconduct, employment termination. Dow's Code states: 

Respect for human rights and dignity is a cornerstone of our business. 

We do not use forced or involuntary labor. 

We comply with all applicable child labor laws. 

Dow's commitment, however, does not end here, as Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Liveris, states, ""We believe it is also our responsibility as a corporate citizen to extend these Values [reflected in The Diamond Standard] well beyond our corporate walls."" To this end, in March 2011 Dow unveiled its Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers (the ""Supplier Code""), which clearly articulates the basic principles for supplier conduct when working with Dow. The Supplier Code was sent to over 35,000 Dow suppliers worldwide in March 2011 and posted on Dow.com. Among other things, the Supplier Code sets forth Dow's expectations with respect to Human Rights and Labor: 

No Forced and Compulsory Labor: Suppliers will not use forced or involuntary labor, including prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or slave labor. 

No Harassment and Abuse of Labor: Suppliers will ensure that their employees are not subjected to psychological, verbal, sexual or physical harassment or to any form of abuse, and will comply with all applicable laws on harassment and abuse of employees. 

No Child Labor: Suppliers will comply with all applicable child labor laws. 

The Supplier Code also details Dow's expectations concerning Suppliers' systems and procedures to ensure compliance for itself and for its suppliers, and the potential consequences of non-compliance: 

Compliance: Dow expects suppliers to implement systems and controls to promote compliance with applicable laws and the principles set forth in this Code, including policies, training, monitoring and auditing mechanisms. Suppliers also should apply these or similar principles to the subcontractors and suppliers they work with in providing goods and services to Dow. Dow reserves the right to assess and monitor suppliers' compliance with this Code. Suppliers who are not in compliance with this Code are expected to implement corrective actions or may not be considered for future business. 

The majority of Dow's standard purchase orders and contract templates have been updated to include new provisions to require suppliers' compliance with the Supplier Code, with the intent that all new Dow suppliers must abide by the Supplier Code. As existing contracts come up for renewal, Dow intends to add similar provisions. In addition, as part of the next phases of Dow's roll out of the Supplier Code and as Suppliers become more familiar, Dow is currently evaluating whether to require compliance certifications, self assessments and/or compliance audits. Currently Dow does utilize a stringent internal supplier qualification process for new suppliers. No decisions have yet been made as to whether future assessments will be verified, or supplier audits conducted by independent third parties, or if audits will be unannounced."	Yes

Effective Date: October 12, 2012



The Fresh Market holds itself, its employees, and its suppliers to high standards of personal ethics and responsibility. 

We consider slavery and human trafficking abhorrent to the fundamental ethical principles which governour business. We do not currently conduct verifications, risk assessments or audits focused specifically on labor practices, nor do we require certification of compliance with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, for the majority of our suppliers.

We do require third-party audits of working conditions from certain non-U.S. suppliers, which maybe announced. These audits cover areas such as child labor, prison or slave labor, working conditions, wages, hours and safety. We also work very

closely with many of our vendors and frequently develop relationships that allow us to assess their business practices.

We are working to increase the awareness of issues within our supply chain. If we become aware of a vendor or supplier participating directly or indirectly in slavery or human trafficking, we will take reasonable measures to address the situation in an appropriate manner. We do not currently provide specific training on mitigating the risks of human trafficking and slavery to our employees who are responsible for supply chain management, but we expect them to remain informed on all issues of importance within their industry.

We stress to all our employees the importance of compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as the higher standard of conduct set forth in our Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics. We make our Code available on our external and internal websites, and a summary available in

our stores and in our Employee Handbook, which all

employees are required to read and sign annually. We also provide methods by which employees, suppliers, or customers may report concerns by secure web form, telephone, e-mail, or fax.

Key Takeaways:



-        Forced, child, and trafficked labor are unacceptable practices that are not allowed to be used in the production of any Gap Inc. product.



-        To address this urgent issue, in 2012 we monitored 96.4 percent of the factories that produce our branded apparel, and we partner with expert stakeholders including the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the Not For Sale Campaign, the Responsible Sourcing Network, and the UN Global Initiative to Fight Trafficking.



 



On January 1, 2012, California enacted a new law requiring companies of a certain size to publicly disclose the steps they are taking to identify and eradicate forced labor in their supply chains. Gap Inc. supported this legislation, and we see it as a policy lever that will assist in the global fight against human trafficking.



Under no circumstance is it acceptable for child, forced, or trafficked labor to be used in the production of any Gap Inc. product. We believe that no person should be subject to a situation where basic needs and fundamental rights are denied.



Our efforts to address human trafficking in the apparel industry are guided by our Human Rights Policy, which is founded on the principles outlined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (often referred to as the “ILO Core Conventions”). Our policy applies to both our wholly owned operations and our branded apparel supply chain.



Gap Inc. has a Code of Vendor Conduct (COVC or “code”) that explicitly states that forced labor of any kind is strictly prohibited. All Gap Inc. branded apparel vendors must abide by this code. Our COVC and the enforcement behind it is an important mechanism that brings our Human Rights Policy to life within our supply chain. We have a Monitoring and Vendor Development team, comprised of approximately 50 people located in more than 20 countries, that monitors working conditions in these factories and works with management to help ensure that they abide by our code.



The United States’ Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protections Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2000 defines human trafficking as:



“Any recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.”



We have additional requirements designed to protect foreign contract workers employed by vendors. We monitor how foreign contract labor is used at factories producing Gap Inc. branded apparel to help ensure that people are free to work as they choose. On the ground, our Social Responsibility Specialists have a deep knowledge of the issue from interviewing workers, gaining their trust, and learning over time which agents and factories have good or bad reputations and practices.



The majority of our Social Responsibility Specialists are locally-hired and speak the local languages in the regions where they work. In 2012 alone, our team monitored more than 923 active, full-year factories, seeking to ensure adherence to our COVC.  Comprehensive data on our monitoring can be found in the Human Rights data section of this report, which is available here.



Our efforts to address human trafficking are not limited to our factory monitoring and remediation program. For example, we are members of the multi-stakeholder network seeking to end forced child labor in Uzbekistan’s cotton sector. We have also supported handwork centers in Northern India where at-risk women can work safely, and a regional education initiative that helps raise awareness of how to avoid traffickers. 



Due to the complexity of this problem, we know that confronting it requires collaboration across industries and must include partnerships among the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Accordingly, we have a long history of working with a number of entities that are actively addressing various facets of human trafficking problems, including the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the Not For Sale Campaign, the Responsible Sourcing Network, and the UN Global Initiative to Fight Trafficking. We encourage you to visit their websites and review their initiatives to fight various forms of human trafficking.



Human trafficking is an issue that crosses nearly all sectors, and is an exploitative practice that occurs outside the production of goods. For the apparel sector, it will take a sustained and collaborative effort to bring an end to this global issue. We continue to work with NGOs, companies, and other entities to ensure that we are effectively contributing to the global fight against human trafficking.



Highlighted below are the five pillars of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, followed by the actions we are taking to address each one:



1.       Company engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.



In 2012, we monitored 96.4 percent of the active, full-year garment factories that produce Gap Inc. branded apparel. We verify our product supply chains through both unannounced and announced visits to measure factories’ compliance with our Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes strict prohibition of “forced labor … or involuntary labor of any kind.” Most of Gap Inc.’s audits are conducted by our own internal team of Social Responsibility Specialists. A number of factories producing our branded apparel participate in the Better Work program, a collaborative factory monitoring initiative led by the International Labour Organization, which is currently operating in seven countries. Factories participating in Better Work are audited by specialists employed by the International Labour Organization. More information on the Better Work program is available here.



2.       Company conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.



Gap Inc. conducts both announced and unannounced audits in the factories we monitor. These audits are primarily conducted by Gap Inc. staff. Gap Inc.’s company standards on labor laws and human rights are outlined in our COVC and our Human Rights Policy. Our COVC, with which all facilities producing Gap Inc. branded product must comply, explicitly states that vendors must not use “forced labor … or involuntary labor of any kind.” Human trafficking and slavery fall under the category of “forced labor” and “involuntary labor.” Our COVC further states that factories must allow “Gap Inc. and/or any of its representatives or agents unrestricted access to its facilities and to all relevant records at all times, whether or not notice is provided in advance.”



3.       Company requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.



Prior to accepting any order for Gap Inc. branded product, our suppliers are required to sign our Vendor Compliance Agreement and agree to be bound by our COVC. Gap Inc.’s COVC states that:



“Factories that produce goods for Gap Inc. shall operate in full compliance with the laws of their respective countries and with all other applicable laws, rules and regulations … including those relating to labor, worker health and safety, and the environment.”



In signing Gap Inc.’s Vendor Compliance Agreement, which also incorporates the COVC, Gap Inc. suppliers agree to comply with the following:



“All applicable laws, rules and regulations … these laws include, but are not limited to, laws relating to the employment conditions of their respective employee such as: (1) wage and hour, labor, child labor, and forced labor requirements; (2) health and safety; (3) immigration; (4) discrimination; (5) labor or workers’ rights in general; and (6) environmental laws and regulations.”



4.       Company maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.



Failure of employees to abide by Gap Inc.’s Code of Business Conduct can result in corrective action up to and including termination of employment. Failure of vendors to abide by Gap Inc.’s COVC and/or Vendor Compliance Agreement can result in corrective action up to and including the “termination of all existing and future business.”



5.       Company provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.



Gap Inc.’s Monitoring and Vendor Development team works directly with factory management and workers in the factories we monitor. Gap Inc.’s COVC explicitly states that facilities producing Gap Inc. branded product must “not use involuntary labor of any kind,” of which human trafficking is one kind. Our COVC also has stringent requirements around “contract labor,” which can sometimes be exploited to create instances of indentured servitude for workers. Our Social Responsibility Specialists are trained to identify these potentially abusive situations."	Yes

This document describes The Gymboree Corporation’s (“Gymboree”) response to The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. For additional information about our ongoing efforts to support human rights and fair labor practices at the factories that we contract with, please go to our Social Responsibility page.

Verification of the supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery 

We are committed to making a difference inside and outside of our company, and this begins with giving kids a chance to be kids and producing quality products that make us proud.

Gymboree regularly monitors and addresses human rights issues as part of our commitment to fair labor practices within our supply chain. Prior to sourcing products from new countries, our social compliance team evaluates the country for any known labor rights and human rights issues. Additionally, we collaborate with our third-party monitoring firms to further identify potential “high risk” issues, such as vendors that are operating in regions within countries that are known to have a high percentage of migrant/guest workers or debt bondage.

If any risks are identified, our social compliance team works directly with our Senior Vice President of Production to determine if we should proceed with sourcing from the new country. 

Furthermore, our customs compliance team is responsible for ensuring that Gymboree abides by all importation laws, including the U.S. law that prohibits the importation of goods produced by forced labor or child labor. If forced or child labor were to be discovered at one of our vendor’s factories, Gymboree would not, in addition to seeking to remediate the situation, take possession of goods that were manufactured under these conditions 

Audit of the supply chain to verify compliance with standards for human trafficking and slavery 

Gymboree uses independent third party auditors to conduct unannounced social audits on all of our factories. Gymboree will not work with any factory that will not allow Gymboree’s third party auditors to conduct unannounced audits. All of our factories are required to comply with our Terms of Engagement and are responsible for ensuring that they meet or exceed each of our monitoring standards. During the audit, our auditors measure the factories against the Terms of Engagement.

Verification that suppliers of materials incorporated into Gymboree’s products comply with laws regarding human trafficking and slavery

In our Terms of Engagement, we require that our factories only source raw materials that are incorporated into our products from suppliers who comply with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

Accountability Standard

In the event that we identify a potential violation of labor or human rights, Gymboree promptly addresses the issue with the factory and outlines specific steps for correcting the issue as defined in our remediation process. To date, we have never encountered a violation related to slavery or trafficking in our supply chain. In the event that we ever do identify a potential incident, we would implement our remediation process. 

Training on human trafficking and slavery

Gymboree provides training to all company management and employees with supply chain responsibilities on human trafficking and slavery and how to identify and mitigate risks within our company supply chain. 

The Gymboree Corporation is committed to upholding fair labor practices and human rights in every aspect of our supply chain. We will continue to enhance our social responsibility program as we learn from our experience on how to best address labor and human rights throughout our supply chain and we will continue to align our program with industry best practices, including in the areas of slavery and human trafficking."

The Walt Disney Company is committed to fostering safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces—in our parks and resorts, in our Disney-owned stores, in our distribution centers and offices, and in facilities around the world where Disney-branded products are made. In support of this commitment, Disney's Standards of Business Conduct for employees include an expectation of respect for all employees. In addition, Disney has established a Code of Conduct for Manufacturers and operates an International Labor Standards (ILS) Program designed to help address working conditions in facilities around the world where Disney-branded products are made. These facilities are not owned or operated by Disney and are instead mostly engaged by or associated with the independent vendors and licensees with whom we do business. As a condition of doing business with Disney, our licensees and vendors agree to observe the standards established by our ILS Program. In 2010, Disney also adopted a Human Rights Policy Statement. 

Prohibition of all forms of forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking, is a core principle of our Human Rights Policy Statement and is prohibited by our Code of Conduct for Manufacturers. Our Code includes specific provisions on Involuntary Labor that prohibit the use of forced or involuntary labor—whether prison, bonded, indentured or otherwise—in the production of Disney-branded products. Our Code also includes provisions on Coercion and Harassment that prohibit the use of corporal punishment, threats of violence or other forms of physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse against employees. We have been reporting on the extent of compliance with Involuntary Labor and other provisions of our Code each year since the publication of our first Corporate Citizenship Report in 2008. 

We expect all of our independent licensees, vendors and manufacturers to uphold the standards set forth in our Code and in our ILS Program and to implement any necessary corrective actions to ensure compliance. Our independent licensees and vendors agree, represent and/or warrant that they will comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations concerning the manufacture of Disney-branded product, which would include compliance with laws regarding human trafficking and slavery. Disney also requires our independent licensees and vendors to disclose to us all the facilities that they intend to use to produce Disney-branded products, including any permitted subcontractors. In 2013, we had approximately 25,000 facilities in 100 countries that were permitted to produce Disney-branded products under our ILS Program requirements, and we maintain a dedicated facility database to store this information. 

The company routinely verifies labor conditions in the facilities in our supply chain. This includes assessments with respect to various forms of forced labor. These assessments are conducted by our global, dedicated ILS staff, by independent third parties engaged by Disney for this purpose and by or on behalf of our independent licensees and vendors. In our fiscal year 2012, we conducted and received approximately 6,500 social compliance audits, including unannounced audits. Our assessments evaluate compliance by interviewing workers and facility management, reviewing documents and inspecting the facilities, including dormitories where present. For any known violations of our Code, our independent licensees and vendors are required to take appropriate corrective action and failure to do so can result in removal of authorization to produce Disney-branded products. 

Also as part of our ILS Program, we provide training to our employees and management on our Code, ILS Program requirements and on internal processes and management systems to evaluate compliance. We enhance our internal knowledge by using data from external resources, such as the World Bank's Governance Indicators, to help us prioritize areas of highest risk for further evaluation. As needed, we consult with external experts and additional resources such as the U.S. Department of State's Human Rights and Trafficking in Persons Reports, the U.S. Department of Labor's Trade and Development Act Report and List of Goods Made with Forced and Child Labor, and the International Labor Organization. This helps us to be better informed and to direct our resources to those areas where the risk of non-compliance with our Code and ILS Program requirements may be greatest. In 2013, we worked with industry experts on the development of an expanded training and development program to increase awareness among staff and business partners of supply chain issues and risk mitigation. 

The Walt Disney Company is committed to working with our business partners and external stakeholders to find solutions to address working conditions and worker exploitation, including forced labor and human trafficking."	Yes

316	"About Our Supply Chain

About Our Supply Chain – Standards for Business Partner Conduct – California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Toys“R”Us has developed and maintains its Standards for Partner Conduct which require that anyone working on behalf of our company, including business partners (including vendors and suppliers), service providers, independent contractors and each of their subcontractors (jointly “Partners”), comply with all laws and regulations in each country in which it operates, or in which Toys“R”Us operates, as well as with company procedures and policies. As such, our Partners must adhere to the same policies as Toys“R”Us employees when it comes to the treatment of workers. 

In particular, the Standards for Partner Conduct require that all Toys“R”Us Partners adhere to an absolute prohibition on the use of involuntary labor of any kind, including child labor and indentured labor. Partners must comply with all  applicable  laws, whether they be at the national or local levels, concerning age requirements, child labor, working conditions, hours worked, and wages earned. Working conditions must adhere to all applicable laws regarding safe, healthy and clean work site conditions; these requirements extend to any housing provided to workers by Partners.

In many instances, Toys“R”Us requires its Partners to certify and warrant their compliance with these standards. For example, the company’s standard purchase orders and agreements expressly require its Partners to warrant that the products they provide are manufactured, produced and packaged in accordance with all applicable laws and employment requirements and without the use of forced labor of any kind, including child labor and indentured labor.  Toys“R”Us employees undergo regular training regarding these Standards and their enforcement requirements.

Partners who produce exclusive-brand items for Toys“R”Us are subject to random, unannounced assessments by both Toys“R”Us teams and third-party conformity labs. All other Toys“R”Us Partners are required to arrange factory assessments through an accredited third-party lab, and assessments must be conducted in accordance with the Toys“R”Us Standards for Partner Conduct.

Toys“R”Us has the right to monitor compliance with this policy through the unannounced inspection of facilities by third party monitors as well as by Toys“R”Us representatives. Partners are required to maintain on site documentation regarding their compliance with these Standards and permit full access to facilities for the inspection of worker records. Partners must also make workers available for confidential interviews without fear of retaliation.

In addition, as part of our Standards for Partner Conduct, business partners, contractors and service providers may not harass, discriminate against or retaliate against any worker because of his or her race, religion, national origin, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, personal characteristics or beliefs or other category protected by applicable law.

The company also engages an independent auditor to ensure that Partners who produce exclusive-brand items for Toys“R”Us adhere to the standards set forth by the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, which includes processes to guard against human slavery and trafficking. Partners who use raw materials in the manufacture of exclusive-brand products must maintain records certifying that all raw materials used are sourced in compliance with the applicable laws on forced labor.

In addition to ensuring the ethical treatment of workers at all points in our supply chain, we take very seriously the trust parents place in us to provide only the safest products for their children. As such, all Toys“R”Us exclusive-brand products are tested by accredited third party labs to standards that meet or exceed federal requirements related to each individual product. Other Partners must have their products tested by accredited laboratories, and Toys“R”Us can request verification of such testing at any time. All testing documentation must be provided to Toys“R”Us within 48 hours of such a request. 

To maintain internal accountability for ensuring these standards and procedures are upheld, these policies are documented and available online for the company’s employees and Partners. Special attention to these standards and procedures is required for Toys“R”Us employees with responsibility for sourcing and supply chain management.  Furthermore, company employees and Partners who supply exclusive-brand products for Toys“R”Us are regularly provided with training on the company’s standards and requirements from accredited third-party labs, as well as the company’s internal teams.

Compliance with all provisions of these standards is mandatory for Toys“R”Us Partners. We reserve the right to assess any business partner, contractor and/or service provider, and their facilities, to ensure they are in compliance.

12/29/11

The following are our thoughts related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) and work done to address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

We have great concern for the rights of all who work to provide products sold in our stores. We address such matters in our agreements with our suppliers; in fact, the code of conduct in our agreements requires that our suppliers:

…represent and warrant that the goods sold to TJ's were produced, harvested, manufactured, processed, packaged, labeled, transported, delivered, and sold in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the United States of America and all of its subdivisions and, if applicable, the laws of any other country, state, or international governing body… that the goods sold to TJ's were not produced, harvested, manufactured, processed, packaged, labeled, transported, or delivered using forced or prison labor or forced or illegal child labor.

We monitor compliance with our agreement through scheduled and unannounced visits and audits of our suppliers' facilities, using our own crew members and third-party groups.

If any of our suppliers are found to be not in compliance with our agreement, we will terminate the relationship.

As we expect our suppliers to abide by these requirements, it also our expectation that Trader Joe's Crew Members follow suit. We hold ourselves accountable to these standards and work to inform and train our people covering the supply chain of the products we offer our customers on the risks of human trafficking and slavery."

The Company conducts its business in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and expects all those accepting a position with it or providing services to it to be accountable for compliance with the law. 

The Company does not currently: (1) engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery; (2) conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains; (3) specifically require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into their products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business, but the Company’s agreements with many of its suppliers require the supplier to warrant and represent that all products supplied to the Company and all business practices of the supplier in connection with the products shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations that govern such products and business practices;

 

(4) maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and human trafficking; or (5) provide employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery. Since May 2011, the Company, in conjunction with Truckers Against Trafficking, has been providing its employees with training on the prevalence of human trafficking and what to do if the employee suspects human trafficking is occurring on its premises."

True Religion Apparel, Inc. Corporate Responsibility



True Religion Apparel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Company”), is dedicated to upholding fair and legal employment practices and environmental sustainability requirements.

As an integral component of this commitment, we have developed and implemented an Associate Code of Conduct (the “Code,” available here), which applies to all vendors, manufacturers, contractors, and suppliers (“Associates”) that form a part of our supply chain.

The Code advises our Associates of their obligation to adhere to all applicable local, state (including the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act) and federal laws as well as the standards established by the Company and set forth in the Code.

The core elements of our Code are prohibitions on discrimination, forced labor, and child labor, insistence on fair wages and hours and the provision of safe and healthy working conditions, as well as guidelines for minimizing each Associate’s environmental footprint.

As a condition of doing business with the Company, each Associate must execute the Code and implement the principles contained therein.

The Company will continue to develop Associate monitoring systems including, but not limited to, independent, unannounced third party audits to assess and ensure compliance with the Code.

If the Company determines that any Associate has violated the Code, the Company may either terminate its business relationship or require the Associate to implement a corrective action plan.

By espousing the foregoing principles, the Company strives to ensure integrity of its supply chain while continuing to uphold and exceed the quality of our branded merchandise.



2012 California Transparency in Supply Chain Act (SB 657) (the “Act”)

The Act, which became effective January 1, 2012, requires certain retail sellers and manufacturers to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. It is intended to provide consumers with the means to determine which companies have an active social responsibility program and thereafter to make conscientious purchasing decisions.

The points outlined below highlight the Act’s mandatory disclosures, followed by an explanation of how the Company is addressing each of them:

(1) Verification

The Company continues to develop monitoring systems to assess and ensure Associate’s compliance with the slavery and human trafficking prohibitions set forth in the Code through various means, including, but not limited to, independent, unannounced on-site third party verification visits.

(2) Audits

The Company relies on independent third party vendors to conducts unannounced audits of Associates, which assist in the evaluation of Associates’ compliance with Company’s supply chain standards for trafficking and slavery.

(3) Integrity of Components

By executing the Code, every Associate certifies that materials incorporated into goods and merchandise manufactured for the Company comply with labor and trafficking laws, and with all other applicable laws, rules and regulations of the respective country or countries in which they do business.

(4) Accountability

Associates must manifest their commitment to the implementation of the Code’s stated anti-slavery and human trafficking principles by maintaining or establishing an appropriate management system (with adequate documentation and record-keeping in place) to address compliance with these principles and detection and correction of any non-compliance.

(5) Training

In connection with its commitment to enforce and uphold the principles set forth in the Code, the Company provides training on recognizing the warning signs of human trafficking and slavery to those employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management."	Yes
320	"Ultratech expects its direct suppliers and supply chain to meet the minimum required global principles of human rights that include; abolition of forced labor, elimination of child labor, equality and anti-discrimination rights, freedom of association, payment of minimum wages, and provision of legally mandated employee benefits.

Ultratech expects that suppliers and their supply chains adhere to these standards, as well as compliance with their own local and national level statutory requirements.  Ultratech uses a variety of techniques in determining (1) Supplier selection, (2) Contractual supplier requirements and (3) Supplier review and ratings.

Sourcing & Supplier Selection

Evaluations normally include supplier visits and/or supplier quality audits of the supplier’s people, processes and capabilities against pre-determined evaluation criteria. During the course of these assessments, the team qualifies how well the supplier meets Ultratech’s standards. Only the suppliers that meet Ultratech’s standards and that optimize or meet the overall selection criteria are selected. Those suppliers then become part of Ultratech’s supply base and are, as appropriate, managed for continuous improvement.  Ultratech employees, instead of a 3rd party, directly use a variety of methods to evaluate and address many potential supply chain risks, including that of human trafficking and slavery.

Contractual Supplier Requirements 
Purchase Order Terms and Conditions: As a condition of doing business and as a means of self-certification, our purchase order standard terms and conditions stipulate that “Seller warrants that it complies with all applicable laws related to slavery, human trafficking and child labor in the countries in which it does business and that it requires producers of goods and materials used in products sold to Buyer to comply with laws related to slavery, human trafficking and child labor in the countries in which they do business..”

Supplier Review and Ratings: 
Key Ultratech suppliers, as appropriate, participate in the Ultratech Supplier Evaluation program. The evaluation includes several qualitative and quantitative measurement criteria.  Ultratech works with suppliers to ensure compliance with Ultratech policies.   The Supplier Management program includes planned business reviews, site visits, and performance audits that include adherence to human rights policies. Site visits and performance-related audits occur when and if a supplier’s scorecard performance is declining and/or if supplier risk is determined through the course of normal supplier visits.  Ultratech employees, evaluate supplier compliance with company policies including human trafficking and slavery through multiple means including possible on-site audits, some of which may be unannounced.  These audits are performed directly by Ultratech, instead of relying upon Third party auditors.

Ultratech provides training to company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply-chain management including the review and mitigation of possible human trafficking and slavery."	Yes

California law requires UTC to disclose its activities regarding monitoring its supply chains to prevent human trafficking and slavery.

Section 24 of UTC’s Code of Ethics states:

“UTC is committed to good citizenship and believes that engagement with others improves the human condition. For our employees worldwide, UTC assures safe and healthy work environments, based on the more stringent of U.S. standards, local standards or UTC policies. UTC does not use child labor or forced labor. For our communities worldwide, UTC works to protect the environment, maximize the efficiencies of our products and reduce wastes, emissions, energy consumption and the use of materials of concern. As affirmed in other sections of the Code, UTC obeys the law, does not discriminate in personnel practices and does not engage in corrupt practices. In addition to its own commitments, UTC expects direct suppliers to adopt suitable codes of business conduct. See UTC's policy entitled ’Corporate Citizenship.’""

UTC’s Corporate Citizenship policy requires direct suppliers to adopt a suitable code of business conduct that specifically addresses “fair employment practices, including prohibitions on harassment, bullying, and discrimination, use of child or forced labor or trafficking in persons for whatever purpose.”

As described above, UTC addresses labor standards in its Code of Ethics, and expects its officers, employees and others to report actual or alleged failures to meet the Code’s standards. An annual certification required of all salaried employees worldwide includes a requirement to certify adherence to UTC's Code.

UTC makes training available to company management, employees and certain third parties regarding human trafficking and slavery issues, including training with respect to recognizing and mitigating risks within the supply chain. Those with direct responsibility for supply chain management are required to take this training.

UTC has robust supplier selection and administration criteria that it expects its direct suppliers to adhere to; however, UTC does not verify or audit its product supply chains specifically to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery, nor does it require its direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into its product comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries where they are doing business."

322	"Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California, like Universal Electronics Inc. (UEI), to disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain to tangible goods offered for sale. The following is disclosure under the Act for UEI and its subsidiaries:

1. Risk Assessment/Verification. UEI has periodically assessed risks associated with its supply chain, including that of its subsidiaries and business units. While UEI’s supply chain is linked globally, UEI believes that the countries in which its suppliers are predominantly located and the vast majority of items, components, and parts supplied for its products present minimum levels of risk of slavery and human trafficking. This belief is based in part on information contained in the U.S. Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor issued on October 1, 2013. Because of this low risk, UEI has not employed a third party for verification.

2. Auditing. Because UEI does not believe the risk in its supply chain to be significant, UEI has not audited its suppliers for compliance. To the extent this belief changes, UEI will consider stronger measures such as auditing or third party verification for any suppliers that it determines to present higher risk.

3. Supplier Agreement. UEI has periodically assessed risks associated with its supply chain and considers there to be a low risk that its suppliers, either knowingly or inadvertently, engage in the practices of slavery or human trafficking.  To the extent this belief changes, UEI will consider measures such as requiring certifications from any suppliers that it determines to present higher risk.

4. Internal Accountability Standards For Employees. Since the Company was founded, UEI’s business practices have been governed by integrity, honesty, fair dealing and full compliance with all applicable laws. UEI requires its employees to review the company’s Code of Conduct and sign a Code of Conduct Acknowledgment Form annually, and provides periodic ethics training to its employees.

5. Procurement Training. UEI has periodically assessed risks associated with its supply chain and considers the risk that its suppliers engage in the practices of slavery and human trafficking to be low.  Because UEI does not believe the risk in its supply chain to be significant, UEI has not undertaken formal training programs for slavery and human trafficking issues. To the extent this belief changes, UEI will consider developing relevant training programs for employees responsible for procurement."	Yes

Strong values guide everything that we do - particularly our relationships with the associates and workers around the world who comprise the VF family.

We work hard to ensure that every individual enjoys a clean, safe work environment, free from discrimination and harassment. We believe that workers at supplier facilities have the right to freely choose employment.  We support the right to fair compensation, the right to associate freely and bargain collectively. These and other rights are embodied in our Global Compliance Principles or GCP, established in 1997.

Consistent with internationally recognized labor standards, the GCP specify working conditions for our employees and those of our suppliers and vendors, helping to ensure that wherever our products are produced, each and every item reflects our values.

In addition to the GCP, factories that we own and operate directly must comply with our Ideal Plant Model (IPM) guidelines, which include rigorous safety requirements, adherence to our Code of Business Conduct and an ethics helpline. Our owned factories also undergo certification by Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, a non-profit organization that promotes global ethics in manufacturing.

And while we understand that that there are different legal and cultural environments in which factories operate throughout the world, potential suppliers and vendors must meet our GCP requirements in order to do business with us.

In order to become a VF Authorized Facility, each of our suppliers must sign and abide by our Terms of Engagement document, indicating their acceptance of both the GCP and our detailed Factory Compliance Guidelines. And to ensure that compliance is ongoing, each location must undergo a thorough on-site audit process on a regular basis.  Disclosure of our efforts to verify the absence of forced labor and child labor in our supply chain in accordance with the CA Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 is contained in our factory audit procedures & GCPs.

Over the years we have learned that improving compliance is an evolving process, one that can be challenging. Yet we do not hesitate to walk away from suppliers who do not share our commitment to providing an ethical and responsible work environment. Ultimately, we know that the quality of our products depends on the strength of our principles.

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (“Act”) went into effect in the State of California. The Act was designed to increase the information made available by large manufacturers and retail sellers doing business in the State of California regarding their efforts (if any) to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains thereby allowing consumers to make more informed choices regarding the products they buy and as a result improving the lives of potential victims or victims of such crimes.

Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and its worldwide subsidiaries (“Vishay”) are committed to ensuring that quality and safety standards are maintained throughout our supply chain by well treated and fairly compensated work force in accordance with applicable laws. We believe that workers at supplier facilities have the right to freely choose employment and a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination.

To this end, Vishay has established supply chain standards that meet or exceed industry standards. Among other things, we have obtained ISO 9001 certification for the majority of our manufacturing operations and are pursuing such approval for other facilities. Vishay actively supports the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) which established standards to ensure implementation of human rights, ethical labor practices and environmental protection standards in the electronics industry supply chain (available at www.eicc.info). We strive to integrate these standards and commitments in every aspect of our activities including our supply chain. To ensure objective measuring of compliance with EICC standards, Vishay has entered into an agreement with EICC under which EICC will perform comprehensive on-site audits of specific facilities.

Vishay has undertaken the following efforts to ensure absence of slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain:

• Risk-Based Supplier Assessments: Vishay currently evaluates potential suppliers according to risk-based approach. These risk criteria include a preliminary risk assessment related to, among other things, geographic locations, information about the suppliers and relevant procurement categories.

• Supplier Audits: While we believe that high-risk suppliers make up a low percentage of our supplier base, it is these suppliers that we intend to focus on in order to ensure compliance with our standards. Vishay will conduct, either by itself or through third party providers, on-site audits to ensure compliance with EICC standards which, among other things, prohibit forced labor and child labor. A finding of a non-conforming supplier will result in implementation of a corrective action plan. In the event the supplier continues to fail to meet Vishay’s standards, Vishay will seek to eliminate this supplier from the supply chain.

• Supply Chain Certification: High-risk suppliers will be required to certify that materials procured by Vishay comply with local laws on slavery and human trafficking.

• Professionals Training and Compliance: Vishay trains employees responsible for supply chain and quality assurance on how to identify and respond to supply chain issues such as forced labor or child labor and human trafficking. Vishay intends to expand these programs beginning in 2012 and increase attention on human trafficking and forced labor issues. Additionally, all employees are required to acknowledge in writing and adhere to our worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This Code requires compliance with all laws in all places where Vishay does business and a violation of this Code is thoroughly investigated and acted upon."	Yes

 The third column defines our physical auditing process that consists of two parts: a self-assessment (SAQ) to be completed by suppliers and a physical audit. As Flextronics works with thousands of suppliers, almost all of which are sourced and approved by our customers, it is impossible to physically audit all of them. As such, the decision on whether or not to audit, and the type and scope of audit, is based on several factors. These factors include Flextronics involvement in approving/qualifying the supplier, the level of trust we have with the supplier, and careful analysis of the SAQ. Audits are conducted by Flextronics employees and are generally announced.

 Finally, we complete the CSER risk validation through metrics management and identifying corrective actions carried out by the supplier. By early 2012, we intend to add key metrics to our integrated Supplier Rating System (SRS) to ensure CSER improvements within our global supply chain.



5.1. Flextronics Supplier Code of Conduct Compliance Program

5.1.1. Compliance Process

Flextronics has integrated elements of the Flextronics Supplier Code of Conduct into the Supplier Qualification Process.

The Flextronics Supplier Qualification process covers several key aspects: Business, Quality Systems, Operations, Design, Product and Process Environmental Compliance, Supply Chain Security and Corporate Sustainability.

As illustrated in the pie chart, 37 per cent of questions asked in the audit revolve around Corporate Sustainability and “Product & Process Environmental Compliance”, demonstrating Flextronics’ commitment to supply chain Corporate Sustainability compliance.

￼￼Compliance Process

￼5.1.2. Due Diligence Process

A comprehensive due diligence process is used to identify high risk suppliers and high risk areas in the suppliers’ premises. It is also used to drive corrective actions in order to eliminate identified deficiencies. The due diligence process consists of supplier training on process expectations, a supplier self- assessment, a risk-based onsite audit to identify both critical and non- critical findings, and an integrated supplier corrective action process. Flextronics may conduct a follow-up onsite audit to verify the supplier’s correction action plan (CAP) implementation.

￼￼Due Diligence Process

￼www.flextronics.com



￼￼5.1.4. Compliance with Freely Chosen Employment (including Human Trafficking and Slavery)

To date, all the suppliers audited are in compliance with our Freely Chosen Employment policy: “Our employees work in Flextronics at their own free will and are free to leave the Company upon reasonable notice under the terms of their labor contract. Our employment contracts are voluntary agreements and are free from forced, bonded, any form of slavery or involuntary imprisonment jobs. We will ensure that any risk of human trafficking is mitigated at our operations and at our supply chain.”

5.1.3. Due Diligence Assessment

An independent audit team from the Global Procurement Organization is tasked to carry out Corporate Sustainability due diligence assessments of high risk suppliers.

Flextronics’ Corporate Sustainability Supplier Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) requires suppliers to answer 91 questions covering areas such as Labor, Ethics, Environment, Health, Production Processes, Material and Finished Goods Stores, Inspection Areas, Dormitories, Wash Rooms and Canteen. Audit results are evaluated and scored based on pre-defined criterion in order to eliminate any subjective findings. Each question asked during the self-assessment or on-site audit are assigned a 5-point grade scale, with 1 representing the lowest score and 5 as the best. 3 is the passing mark.

While we do not require suppliers to separately certify that materials incorporated into products comply with trafficking and forced labor laws, successfully passing Flextronics’ assessment and being qualified to provide products to Flextronics indicates that Flextronics sourced and approved suppliers comply with such regulations.

If suppliers are found to have any deficiencies, they will be requested to implement a CAP within a specified time frame. Our Global Procurement audit team will then monitor the CAP progress closely. Armed with a comprehensive evaluation system, we are able to generate statistics on the various audited attributes and rank suppliers based on their performance and CAP implementation.

￼Flextronics is a leading Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) provider that offers complete design, engineering, and manufacturing services to aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer digital, industrial, infrastructure, medical and mobile OEM customers. With a network of facilities in 30 countries, Flextronics helps customers design, manufacture, distribute and service electronics products worldwide.

330	"California Transparency in Supply Chain Act

As part of Viterra's core values of honesty, integrity, trust and high performance, the Company's Sustainability Commitment, and in support of the corporate Code of Business Conduct, Viterra Inc. and its subsidiaries doing business in California are committed to complying with the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act.  Viterra also supports the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains. 

Viterra's raw material suppliers are primarily producers/farmers with the vast majority of grain origination volumes coming from Canada, Australia and the United States where legal requirements regarding elimination of human trafficking and slavery are robust.  On this basis, the Company believes the current risk of these issues within the supply chain to be very low. 

Viterra's Code of Business Conduct supports and promotes the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Viterra is currently updating its training program for the Code of Business Conduct.  The Company does not currently require direct supplier certification, conduct supplier audits or third party verification with respect to human trafficking and slavery but is considering what steps it may take in the future in this regard."

331	"VMware’s Commitment to Prohibit Slavery and Human Trafficking

January 2013

VMware is committed to acting ethically and responsibly and to use its position as a market-maker in virtualization and cloud computing technology to improve conditions within its communities. Not only do we firmly support and comply with the slavery and human trafficking laws in the countries in which we do business, but we work actively within our business circles to prohibit the use of slavery and human trafficking.

VMware’s Partner Integrity Initiative: The VMware Partner network is numerous and vast, so it provides an optimal opportunity to communicate ethical business standards. As such, in addition to requiring its Partners take compliance training and submitting to due diligence and background checks, VMware requires its Partners to agree to the principles embodied within its Partner Code of Conduct (“Partner Code”). The VMware Partner Code expressly restricts unethical labor practices including the use of forced or involuntary labor of any kind.

VMware’s Procurement Integrity Initiative: The VMware Supplier network is as equally vast and varied as its Partner community. For this reason, VMware has implemented a Procurement Transparency Initiative to engage suppliers with similar high ethical standards. Key components of VMware’s Procurement Integrity Initiative include:

		Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”). VMware’s Supplier Code addresses issues such as human rights, environmental protection, workplace safety and ethical labor principles. Specifically, these principles reinforce and strengthen our commitment to the rights of our employees, workers in our supply chain, and workers in the global community. 

		Certifications: VMware requires that its direct suppliers certify compliance with all local laws, including but not limited to those regarding the eradication of slavery and human trafficking, and suppliers must affirmatively commit to not use forced or involuntary labor. 

		Risk Assessments: While VMware does not “manufacture” in the traditional sense with the use of factories or labor houses, VMware evaluates its supply chain for its products to identify which suppliers pose the greatest risk for engaging in human trafficking and slavery as well as those who source from conflict mineral locations. 

		Verifications: For higher risk suppliers, VMware engages a third party to perform due diligence to verify compliance with the principles in the Supplier Code. 

		Audits: VMware is embarking on a process to verify compliance with its Supplier Code through periodic audits. These audits will be conducted by VMware's internal teams and are typically done on an announced basis, although VMware reserves the right to conduct unannounced audits as well.  VMware’s People Integrity Initiative: VMware procurement personnel are trained at regular intervals on the principles embodied within the company’s Business Conduct Guidelines, Partner Code and Supplier Code. Additionally, VMware procurement personnel receive training with regard to prohibiting slavery and human trafficking and the associated legal requirements. Importantly, VMware employees are held accountable for their actions and are subject to disciplinary action for failing to adhere to company standards.  For more information about VMware’s Commitment to Prohibit Human Trafficking and Slavery, please contact the VMware Ethics and Compliance Office (ethicsandcompliance@vmware.com) or VMware’s Ethics Helpline at www.etica.ethicspoint.com."

332	"CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN DISCLOSURE

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. As a result, many companies manufacturing or selling products in California are required to disclose their efforts to address the issues of human trafficking and slavery, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Volcano Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Volcano"" “us’ or “we”) strive to achieve and maintain the highest possible standards of corporate integrity and ethical behavior. We expect our direct suppliers of tangible goods we offer for sale (“suppliers”) and other business partners (collectively, “Business Partners”) will conduct their businesses not only in a lawful manner but also in compliance with the same high standards of integrity and ethics. It is our expectation that our Business Partners will not support, promote or engage in the practice of slavery or human trafficking. Our Business Partners are further expected to take reasonable and necessary steps to help ensure that their sub-contractors and sub- suppliers conduct business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. To that end, we disclose the following:

Verifications:

As of February 23, 2015, we have required our suppliers to complete a Supplier Survey as part of our initial intake process and are currently in the process of updating our supplier surveys to require suppliers to self-certify specifically regarding eradication of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, we are in the process of enhancing our Supplier Survey to require our suppliers to evaluate, address and certify that they comply with all applicable laws including:

o Eradication of human trafficking and slavery including forced, bonded, indentured, involuntary, convict or compulsory labor, by any of the following means: (i) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of physical restraint to that person or another person; (ii) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or another person; (iii) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; (iv) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or (v) by means of acts involved in the recruitment, abduction, transport, harboring, transfer, sale or receipt of persons within national or across international borders, through force, coercion, fraud or deception, to place persons in situations of slavery or slavery-like conditions, forced labor or services such as domestic servitude, bonded sweatshop labor or other debt bondage.

o Eradication of illegal child labor, including compliance with all minimum age requirements as determined by applicable local laws and regulations and by not producing goods for Volcano with: (i) the sale and trafficking of children; (ii) debt bondage and serfdom; (iii) forced or compulsory labor; (iv) use, procuring, or offering of a child for illicit activities; or (v) work which is likely to harm the health, safety, or morals of children;

o Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing labor and employment, including wages, hours, days of service, rest period, overtime, non-discrimination and freedom of association;

o Compliance with all applicable occupational safety and environmental laws and regulations; and

Verifications are conducted through Supplier Survey and self-verifications and certifications. Volcano however reserves the right to engage in its own verification process of its suppliers or by engaging a third party to conduct such verifications.

Audits:

Volcano does not currently, but is in the process of expressly reserving the right to conduct onsite audits of its suppliers to evaluate the supplier's compliance with Volcano’s Supplier Survey and supplier’s self- certifications. Volcano may conduct such audits through its own personnel or through a third party independent auditor, on an announced or unannounced basis.

Materials:

Volcano’s Purchase Order terms and conditions currently require our suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into their products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Accountability Standards:

Our global Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (our “Code of Conduct”), which applies to all of our Business Partners, sets forth our statements and beliefs regarding the manner in which our employees and Business Partners must conduct themselves when performing functions for or on behalf of Volcano. The Code of Conduct specifically requires that our Business Partners comply with all laws and regulations relating to human trafficking and slavery.

Our Code of Conduct also provides that if guidance on a legal or ethical question is required, or if an illegal or unethical activity has been witnessed (including activities pertaining to human trafficking and slavery), the applicable Volcano employee or Business Partner representative should consult with or report the matter (i) to his or her supervisor or Volcano senior management, (ii) to Volcano’s Chief Compliance Officer (or his designee), Legal Department, or Human Resources Department, or (iii) otherwise as contemplated by our Code of Conduct, depending on the specific circumstances and consistent with local data privacy laws. All reports of alleged violations will be promptly investigated by us. If the results of an investigation indicate that corrective action is required, the relevant party or parties will be held accountable and we will decide the appropriate steps to take, including discipline, dismissal, termination of contractual relations, and/or possible legal proceedings. If appropriate, the investigation may be turned over to the applicable outside authorities, and outside investigators may assist in the inquiry. We expect our Business Partners to take prompt and decisive corrective action to address any deficiencies identified with respect to their compliance with applicable laws, regulations or internationally recognized standards of conduct applicable to slavery and human trafficking. Disregard or deliberate ignorance of the law is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.

Training:

Volcano is in the process of training and educating our employees and Business Partners on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We will continue to highlight and discuss Volcano’s intolerance of any form of slavery or human trafficking, as well as our position that all of our employees and Business Partners must refrain from engaging in, facilitating or supporting any such practice. We will be placing a particular focus on our employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, with respect to mitigation risks within the supply chain."	Yes
333	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 - Disclosure

The Walgreen Co. Vendor Responsibility Program and third parties engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Vendors doing business with Walgreen agree that they shall not use any form of convict, bonded, forced, indentured or other illegal labor, or any form of slavery or human trafficking. Vendors also agree to require the same of any subcontractor used in the manufacturing of Walgreen products or product components. Based on the results of risk assessment evaluations, Walgreen engages third party audit firms to conduct audits to evaluate compliance with these requirements. The audits are conducted on both an unannounced and announced basis. Walgreen employees directly responsible for supply chain management in the California market are required to complete Vendor Responsibility Program training which includes awareness of human trafficking and slavery risks in the supply chain of products and ways to mitigate those risks. Walgreen maintains accountability standards and procedures for any employee, contractor and/or vendor who is determined to have failed to meet these requirements."	Yes
334	"Corporate Disclosure in Compliance with SB 657 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (Human Trafficking and Anti-Slavery) 

Walmart strives to conduct business in a manner that respects its three core beliefs – respect for the individual, service to customers and striving for excellence. Holding the same expectations of our suppliers in contracting, subcontracting and other business relationships is one way we believe we can be a more responsible company and a better advocate for the men and women in our suppliers’ factories who manufacture the products we sell.

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect, requiring retailers and manufacturers above a certain size that are doing business in California to disclose measures used to track possible slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. The disclosure is aimed at providing information to consumers, allowing them to make better, more informed choices about the products they buy and the companies they support.

As part of our commitment to be a responsible company, the Responsible Sourcing program was established in 1992. A key part of that program is our Standards for Suppliers, which are Walmart’s fundamental expectations of its suppliers on social and environmental practices. The Standards cover topics including: compliance with laws, voluntary labor, labor hours, hiring and employment practices, compensation, freedom of association and collective bargaining, dormitories and canteens, and the environment. Walmart requires every supplier to sign an agreement that they, their contractors and subcontractors will abide by these Standards. Factory audits are used to verify suppliers’ compliance with the Standards in those facilities producing merchandise for Walmart 

While auditing had been the primary focus of Walmart’s Responsible Sourcing program, it was soon realized that responsible sourcing goes far beyond monitoring and should also confront the complexities that are at the root of noncompliance, and drive improvements in working conditions globally. To help address these concerns, Walmart is working to increase collaboration with other stakeholders and find ways to transform the sourcing process across the industry to identify and address barriers that may contribute to noncompliance.

Verification 

Walmart’s Standards for Suppliers require suppliers to refrain from the direct or indirect use of forced labor or any forms of human trafficking and to verify/certify that their supply chains address these issues. Walmart further requires suppliers to certify implementation of procedures to manage the materials, including all labor-related process incorporated into their products, to ensure they comply with laws on slavery and human trafficking.

Dialogue and partnership can be an effective way to drive positive change and to address root cause issues that are persistent within the supply chain. Walmart continues to participate in collaborative efforts with external stakeholders that advance the goal of building a more transparent supply chain. Additionally, Walmart participates in industry working groups that serve as a vehicle to share experiences and gain new information that can help improve operations and the supply chain.

Auditing 

Walmart requires suppliers for all Walmart retail markets to disclose all facilities producing direct import, private label or nonbranded merchandise. Facilities are required to demonstrate adherence to Walmart’s Standards through social and environmental audits. As of April 2009, all of our standard audits are conducted by approved third-party audit firms. All factory audits, except for the initial audit, are unannounced and typically conducted every 6 to 24 months depending on previous audit findings.

Upon completion of all audits, the identified issues and recommendations to rectify violations observed are discussed and documented with the audited facility. Factory management is expected to address all identified issues as noted. The corrections of the identified issues are validated during the follow-up audit.

For more information regarding Walmart’s audit requirements please read our Standards for Suppliers. 

Certification 

Through signing Walmart’s Supplier Agreement, suppliers agree to comply with the obligations stated in the Standards for Suppliers, which have been amended to require suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into their products comply with laws on slavery and human trafficking.

Internal Accountability 

We require all Walmart associates to comply with our Statement of Ethics. Suppliers, contractors and service providers are expected to act ethically and are required to comply with Walmart’s Standards for Suppliers and our Responsible Sourcing Program Standards. As with all alleged violations of policy, we investigate issues and take the appropriate action up to and including termination of associates and termination of agreements for suppliers and contractors.

Training 

How Walmart manages its purchase orders has a significant impact on suppliers and factories. Responsible Sourcing is training Walmart supply chain decision-makers (merchandisers, buyers and sourcing managers) on how their decisions can potentially impact factory working conditions, and equipping them with the necessary knowledge to reinforce to suppliers the importance of positive factory labor practices. At Walmart, we believe that associate education is fundamental to fully integrating labor compliance and social responsibility into all purchasing decisions and to building a socially and environmentally responsible supply chain."

335	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) requires many companies, including Western Digital, to disclose on their websites the efforts they take to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains.  SB 657 requires disclosures regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability and training.

1.  Supply Chain Verification and Auditing 
Western Digital’s commitment to global citizenship is strengthened by its commitment to the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and its adherence to the EICC Code of Conduct.  This Code of Conduct addresses supply chain performance expectations for labor, health and safety, environmental practices, ethics and management systems.  
 
Western Digital requires that its suppliers make a commitment to adhering to the EICC Code of Conduct and requires that suppliers perform periodic self-assessments.  Western Digital also performs periodic audits of key suppliers.  These audits are coordinated with these suppliers.  While Western Digital does not engage third parties to conduct these audits, some suppliers have been audited by third parties retained by other EICC member companies.

We believe that our suppliers' compliance with the EICC code reduces the risks of human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain. Western Digital and its subsidiaries expect suppliers to comply with the EICC code regardless of local business practices or social customs, and as may be requested by Western Digital, to demonstrate adherence to those codes. 

For more information on the EICC and to view the EICC Code of Conduct, visit http://www.eicc.info/. 

2.  Compliance with Slavery and Human Trafficking Laws
Suppliers contracted to Western Digital are required to comply with all laws applicable to their business operations.  Suppliers are also required to make a commitment to the EICC Code of Conduct.

3.  Internal Accountability 
Western Digital requires employees to follow its Global Code of Conduct and Code of Business Ethics.  Violations of the Code of Conduct or Code of Business Ethics may be the grounds for employee discipline, up to and including termination of employment.  Contractors are also expected to conduct themselves in a manner consisted with these principles.  Contractors who fail to comply may be dropped from Western Digital’s supply chain.

4.  Training 
Western Digital provides managers and its employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with knowledge and information regarding Western Digital’s requirements, including EICC compliance.  Western Digital also regularly conducts training for suppliers on EICC related issues.

Other Supply Chain Initiatives 

Western Digital Corporation is working with its suppliers to support participation in the EICC Carbon reporting system survey.

We also work with business partners to prepare them for early ISO 14064 Certification and have partnered with local universities to further this goal."	Yes
336	"California Transparency
in Supply Chains Act



On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (also referred to as SB 657) became law. The Act requires that companies disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains.

West Marine does not condone the use of slavery or human trafficking and does not knowingly do business with any supplier who engages in such practice. Long before the passage of this law, West Marine’s Supplier Agreements contained contractual provisions prohibiting the use of involuntary labor and child labor, and requiring compliance with applicable labor laws, safe working conditions and employment laws.

West Marine Associates who work as merchant buyers and in our resourcing and quality teams receive training on how to recognize and mitigate the risks of slavery and human trafficking. To assist in verifying our Supplier’s operations, West Marine Associates --our merchant buyers and our resourcing and quality teams-- periodically visit third party Supplier facilities. West Marine has also previously engaged third party auditors to monitor certain of its supply chains in order to evaluate and to address the risks of slavery and human trafficking inherent in those activities. West Marine will again look to engaging a third party independent firm to make unannounced visits to Supplier facilities in the future.

We are currently taking additional steps to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. Those measures include requiring each Supplier to acknowledge an understanding of their obligations with regard to these laws and to certify that materials incorporated into the merchandise they supply West Marine is compliant with applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

West Marine expects its suppliers to conduct themselves in a lawful and ethical manner. West Marine is free to take its business elsewhere should a supplier fall short of these expectations. If a Supplier is found to not be compliant with its obligations, West Marine would have the option to terminate its business relationship with that Supplier or take other actions to remediate any problems that had been identified."

Factories producing products for Whalen are required to comply with all requirements of C‐ TPAT.

.

WHALEN AUDIT PROCESS

Factories will undergo internal Whalen audits, or Whalen customer audits, generally at a time mutually agreed on between the auditing company and the Factory. An audit report will be generated by the auditing company within two weeks of the audit. This report will list any violations to the Whalen or Customer Code of Conduct standard.

The Whalen Global Compliance team will then work with the factory to create a Corrective Action Plan for all violations, and will work with the factory to define steps necessary to correct the violation; identify the individual responsible in the factory to resolve the violation, and to provide a target date when the violation will be resolved. Whalen partner factories are expected to implement these corrective actions within the anticipated time frame and Whalen looks to the factory to continually improve from one audit to the next.

COMMUNICATION

For specific items of concern related to the above sections, factories should refer to the complete

340	"California's Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010

 

Overview

 

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.



Wintec Industries, Inc. is dedicated to conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner. It is our expectation that our suppliers do the same.

 

Verification of Supply Chains

Wintec strives to establish close working relationships with its suppliers. Wintec does not employ or rely on third parties to verify its product supply chains in order to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

 

Auditing of Supply Chains

Wintec's conducts non-third party audits or investigations at any time in response to a possible violation by our direct suppliers of company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains.

 

Certification of Direct Suppliers

By signing or accepting our purchasing contract or purchase order, each of Wintec's direct suppliers certifies it conducts business pursuant to all applicable local and national laws and its failure to do so is considered a breach of the agreement.

 

Management Training and Accountability

In addition to the requirements placed on our vendors, Wintec communicates its commitment to elimination of forced labor to applicable employees in its own workforce. Wintec provides training for associates and management who work with our supply chains on the issues of slavery and human trafficking. Wintec will promptly address and remedy any circumstances of which it becomes aware of employees who fail to meet Wintec's standards regarding forced labor."	Yes
341	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act


*The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) becomes effective on January 1, 2012. This California state law is aimed at making large retailers and manufacturers transparent about their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. 

Xerox Corporation and our affiliates and distributors do business in more than 160 countries. Our employees work with customers and suppliers from around the world. Being a global enterprise brings heightened responsibility to act in a manner that is consistent with our human rights ideals. 

Xerox is guided by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which prohibits slavery, servitude and the slave trade. Xerox’s commitment to freely chosen employment is embedded in our Code of Business Conduct, in our position on labor relations and in our employment practices. 

Additionally, Xerox is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a group established to improve social, economic, and environmental outcomes in the electronics industry. Xerox adopted the EICC’s Code of Conduct on corporate social responsibility as its code of conduct for suppliers (“Supplier Code of Conduct”). The Supplier Code of Conduct includes labor standards based on recognized principles on international labor and human rights. Freely chosen labor is a primary standard in the Supplier Code of Conduct, prohibiting forced, bonded or indentured labor. Further, the EICC has a Freely Chosen Employment task force designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the EICC and make recommendations on available tools and training. Xerox actively participates in EICC meetings and events. 

The following are highlights of our efforts in this area:

Supplier Code of Conduct Compliance Program: Xerox has implemented a compliance program with its direct/technology suppliers to monitor their compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct. 

As part of this program, Xerox requires such suppliers to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct (which includes the provisions on freely chosen labor). The terms and conditions in Xerox purchase agreement and purchase order forms incorporate this requirement as well as the requirement for suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Xerox reinforces the Supplier Code of Conduct in an annual communication to its suppliers.

Xerox conducts initial risk assessments of its suppliers based on objective criteria. For key suppliers and certain suppliers identified in Xerox’s initial risk assessment as high-risk, Xerox requires the completion of supplier questionnaires. While the key suppliers represent a small portion of Xerox’s total direct supplier base, they represent a significant portion of Xerox’s spend with direct suppliers. In addition to allowing Xerox to validate its initial risk assessment, the supplier questionnaire step also serves to raise suppliers’ awareness about the importance of social responsibility topics, clarify Xerox’s expectations, target areas for review and serves as written documentation of suppliers’ assessment of their performance. 

To monitor suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct, Xerox’s compliance program calls for announced compliance reviews/audits of its key suppliers if a key supplier’s score on their supplier questionnaire falls below a passing level. In addition, Xerox conducts announced compliance reviews/audits of those suppliers identified in Xerox’s initial risk assessment as high-risk regardless of their score on the supplier questionnaire. All compliance reviews/audits are on-site visits by either trained Xerox or qualified third party personnel and follow a consistent review/audit process. 

By the end of 2010, Xerox conducted over 150 first time and follow up Supplier Code of Conduct compliance reviews/audits. Areas of nonconformance are evaluated as priority, major, minor or observation and are addressed through a corrective action process. We monitor our compliance program regularly through internal management reviews.

Supplier Management: In addition to compliance-related visits, on-site visits of suppliers are routinely conducted as part of Xerox’s ongoing supplier management by Xerox procurement professionals and quality assurance engineers. 

Training Xerox Personnel: Xerox now requires its procurement professionals who are responsible for managing suppliers to complete training on awareness and mitigation of the human trafficking problem. Training of these procurement professionals and other key personnel with an active role in supplier relations will begin in 2012.

Code of Business Conduct and Training: Xerox’s Code of Business Conduct aligns our actions and decisions with our core values and compliance requirements. Our position advocating for human rights and opposing human trafficking is codified in our Code of Business Conduct. Our employees can read our Code of Business Conduct in any one of 13 languages. We require annual refresher training and ethics acknowledgement for all employees. Xerox has a strictly enforced ‘no retaliation policy’ to promote comfort in using the Ethics Helpline. All violations of the Code of Business Conduct are treated seriously, fairly and consistently. 

This focus on international labor and human rights standards is part of Xerox’s long-standing, world-wide commitment to behave responsibly as a good corporate citizen. For more information about Xerox’s social responsibility, please visit Xerox’s Global Citizenship site."	Yes
342	"Disclosure pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Xilinx strongly opposes the practice of slavery or human trafficking. Xilinx utilizes several approaches detailed below designed to ensure and verify the absence of such practices in our supply chain.

Xilinx maintains a Code of Social Responsibility which is modeled upon the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct and specifically prohibits involuntary, coercive, or unlawful labor practices. We declare that we do not use forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. Work will be voluntary, and employees are free to leave upon reasonable notice. Employees are not required to hand over government-issued identification, passports or work permits as a condition of employment.

The Xilinx Supplier Ethics & Compliance Policy details important requirements for suppliers to maintain eligibility to conduct business with Xilinx. This Policy requires that Xilinx’ suppliers meet stated requirements of lawful and ethical behavior, and that they ensure any subcontractors, agents or other third parties that they employ in work performed for Xilinx act consistently with this Policy. The standards set forth in this Policy are substantially equivalent to those in Xilinx’ Code of Social Responsibility. Xilinx generally requires conformance with this Policy from its suppliers, and has obtained written acknowledgments and/or assurances from its key suppliers of adherence to its terms. The Policy provides that suppliers are committed to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect by international standards. This includes, among other principles, that all work shall be voluntary and workers will not be required to turn over identification materials as a condition of employment, no child labor will be used, working hours and wages shall be set fairly and in accordance with local laws, all employees shall be treated humanely without threat or harassment, coercion, or unlawful discrimination of any kind, and employees shall enjoy the freedom of association.

Xilinx has taken additional steps in this regard, as follows:

Supply-chain verifications: Xilinx itself regularly conducts supply-chain verification activities to assess the risk of non-compliance with respect to the conduct of supplier business practices. These include preliminary risk assessments and questionnaires to detect unlawful or improper activities, such as conditions of human trafficking or slavery. The results of these verifications are scored so that risks can be identified for review and correction.

Supplier audits: In addition to risk assessments, Xilinx itself regularly performs on-site audits of supplier business, management and quality systems to evaluate supplier compliance with Xilinx standards, including the avoidance of any unlawful activities such as human trafficking and slavery. These audits may be announced or unannounced depending on the circumstances. Suppliers are required to perform corrective actions with respect to any deficiencies identified in the course of these ongoing audits.



Supplier assurances: Xilinx communicates with suppliers annually to ensure that our expectations are clear and up-to-date with regard to responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct. These communications require suppliers to comply with international standards, applicable laws and regulations.

Accountability: In addition to risk assessments and audits, Xilinx management conducts periodic business reviews with suppliers to address actions needed to ensure conformance with Xilinx requirements as well as applicable laws and regulations. These reviews provide a venue to reinforce the importance of social, ethical and environmental conduct.

Information and Awareness: Xilinx’ employees who manage supply-chain activities have access to information such as the Xilinx Code of Social Responsibility and associated training, and suppliers are subject to the Supplier Ethics & Compliance Policy concerning compliance requirements including prohibitions against human trafficking and slavery."	Yes
343	"Policy Against Slavery and Human Trafficking

Yokohama Tire Corporation (""Yokohama"") is committed to a work environment free from human trafficking and slavery. We oppose any use of slavery or human trafficking in the manufacture and distribution of our products and fully support the promotion of ethical and lawful employment practices within our workplace. Accordingly, Yokohama employees and suppliers are expected to abide by these same principles. All Yokohama management and staff are responsible for following these policies. Over time, Yokohama will continue to develop and clarify these policies and supplementary procedures. Willful noncompliance with these policies and procedures may be subject to disciplinary action.

What is Human Trafficking? What is Slavery?

According to the United Nations, ""human trafficking"" is ""the process by which a person is recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, or received through a use of force, coercion, or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them."" The United Nations also defines ""slavery"" as ""the status or condition of a person over whom any or all the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised,"" or ""the status or condition of a person over whom control is exercised to the extent that the person is treated like property."" This policy also covers forced labor (all work or service, not voluntarily performed, that is obtained from an individual under threat of force or penalty) and harmful child labor (the employment of children that is economically exploitative, or is likely to be hazardous to, or interfere with, the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health, or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development).

Policy Against Slavery and Human Trafficking

Yokohama is developing policies and procedures that support the disclosure requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43. Such policies and procedures may include:

Public disclosures of our policy against slavery and human trafficking, along with our activities implementing the same, on Yokohama's website;

Procedures outlining what is expected from management, employees, and suppliers to better identify, prevent and mitigate the use of forced labor in our supply chain, including, but not limited to maintaining open lines of communication between these parties;

A plan to initiate training for company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management focusing, among other things, on monitoring and mitigating risks related to the presence of slavery and human trafficking within the product supply chain;

and Supporting compliance by suppliers with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which those suppliers operate with respect to the products or materials they supply. Such compliance includes:

Not using forced or compulsory labor;

Ensuring that overall terms of employment are voluntary;

Complying with minimum age requirements prescribed by applicable laws or contracts;

Compensating workers with wages and benefits that meet or exceed legally required minimums and overtime pay requirements;

and Abiding by applicable law concerning the maximum hours of daily labor.

Yokohama may also require suppliers to certify to its compliance with the above requirements.

Yokohama will not continue to purchase goods or services from any supplier of which it is made aware to be engaging in human trafficking or using slave labor without proper cure or remedy of such practices. Yokohama is permitted to audit its suppliers' compliance with these policies. If the supplier is presenting a serious risk, the audit may be unannounced. Although Yokohama regularly monitors its suppliers for a variety of reasons, an audit is typically not performed to determine compliance with the prohibitions against slavery and human trafficking, nor are these audits typically conducted by third parties. Nevertheless, Yokohama will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim or indication that a supplier is engaging in human trafficking or slave labor.

Procedures

Yokohama Tire Company fully supports the purpose and goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and opposes any use of slavery or human trafficking in the manufacture and distribution of our products. We have adopted an initial company policy condemning the use of slavery and human trafficking. We are continuing to develop this policy to include processes that will help identify, prevent and mitigate the impact of forced labor in our supply chain and that will hold our employees and suppliers appropriately accountable for the policy's implementation. Moreover,

We maintain open lines of communication with our suppliers, managers, employees, investors, customers, and other stakeholders.

We are evaluating our supplier agreements as well as the terms and conditions found in our standard purchase agreements to determine ways to ensure our suppliers are complying with our policy against slavery and human trafficking. Although neither we nor a third party currently evaluate our supply chains for risks associated with these practices, we are exploring the possibility of requiring direct suppliers to be responsible for monitoring the compliance of their own suppliers with our policy.

We are also considering how to properly provide training on our policy to our employees and managers on our policy and processes.

Although we do not currently conduct audits of our suppliers, we are considering the role of internal audits and self-reporting by suppliers as a method of compliance. Independent auditors or unannounced audits are not currently employed but will be considered if the circumstances require."	Yes
344	"Statement Regarding California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

Packaging Corporation of America recognizes that the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires manufacturers and certain others that do business in California to publicly disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.

PCA seeks relationships with our suppliers based on mutual benefit, high and dependable performance and a joint commitment to continuous improvement. We expect ourselves and our suppliers to operate ethically and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Most of our raw materials are sourced in the United States of America, and almost all of our manufacturing activities are conducted in the U.S. We believe the risk of slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain is low, and we have taken various steps to assess and reduce risks in our supply chain, including:

PCA Risk Assessment

We conducted an assessment of our practices and our procurement environment, as well as the general, geographic and supply-chain environments in which we conduct business. A particular emphasis was placed on identifying any potential, likely or credible risks of slavery and/or human trafficking existing within PCA’s supply chain. Our assessment found that there is a low risk of slavery, human trafficking and other abuses of employees within our supply chain.

PCA’s Further Risk Monitoring (Ongoing) and Additional Efforts

PCA participates in various initiatives, such as the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (“Sedex”), in order to facilitate a comprehensive and ongoing review of corporate social responsibility and sustainability across our operations — as well as to make our information transparent to those PCA customers with appropriate interest.

Expectations of Our People

All PCA employees are required to abide by and support PCA’s Statement of Business Principles. Our personnel are regularly trained on these and other principles. Training of our procurement professionals and other select personnel on identification of risk potential and the prevention of slavery, forced-labor and human trafficking in the supply chain is ongoing.

Expectations of Our Suppliers

We apply our ethical conduct standards when selecting suppliers and business partners. Our suppliers are required to comply with all applicable laws, including safety, labor and employment laws, and to become familiar, comply with and maintain policies consistent with our environmental, employee health, employee safety, product safety, corporate responsibility and sustainability expectations.

Third-Party Forest and Fiber Certification

All of PCA’s operations in North America are certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI®) Fiber and Certified Sourcing and Chain of Custody standards. The SFI Fiber Sourcing standard contains thirteen objectives relevant to fiber procurement organizations. All of PCA’s operations are also certified to the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) Chain of Custody standard, which includes requirements (among others) to avoid sourcing from controversial sources, as well as to assure that forced labor is not used. Suppliers of timber, processed wood, wood fiber and paper products (including containerboard, white-top/mottled white/bleached printed or unprinted paperboard, labels and/or “top sheets”) are required to take steps to avoid sourcing from controversial sources in any shipments to, or on behalf of, PCA.

Controversial sources that shall be avoided (among others) currently include forest management activities that are in non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations and international agreements. Controversial sources also currently include those utilizing genetically modified organisms and converting forests to other vegetation types, as defined by the SFI and PEFC Chain of Custody standards.

Accountability

A supplier’s failure to comply with these expectations will result in termination of the supplier relationship. Employees who fail to comply with these expectations are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

Our principles and approach to corporate responsibility

At Cargill, corporate responsibility is a process of continually improving our standards, our actions and our processes. Cargill has earned and maintained a reputation for ethical business conduct ever since its foundation in 1865.  

In line with our policies, we do not accept or support the use of illegal, abusive or enforced labor. The issue is challenging and we alone cannot solve this complex problem. We believe it is essential that all parties in our supply chains work together to support rural livelihoods, raise incomes and ensure children and adults are not subject to these conditions. We work hard to provide all of our own employees with an equitable, safe and supportive work environment providing competitive wages and the rights to join a union and voluntarily negotiate, and we expect the same from our suppliers.

Our Code of Conduct outlines our company’s ethical and compliance standards for conducting business throughout the world. 

In addition to our Code, Cargill is committed to operating responsibly across the agriculture, food, industrial and financial markets we serve as we pursue our goal of being the global leader in nourishing people. We are working to accomplish this by focusing on:

Feeding the world in a responsible way;

Reducing our environmental impact; and

Improving the communities where we live and work.

Supply chain actions

Cargill's Strategic Sourcing group has developed a Supplier Code of Conduct that is incorporated into its standard contracts for equipment for its facilities and other company materials and included as part of its normal contracting process with suppliers. The Supplier Code of Conduct sets forth our expectations that our suppliers conduct their business in a responsible and ethical manner and that they comply with all applicable laws, including employment and human rights laws.  Specifically, our Supplier Code of Conduct forbids our suppliers from employing or benefiting from child or compulsory labor.

We also work in cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local governments to conduct these programs. Examples include: 

Brazil. Cargill is a signatory to the Brazilian National Pact for the Eradication of Slave Labor. Developed by the Brazilian government, the International Labor Organization and The Ethos Institute for Social Responsibility, it monitors suppliers. We will not do business with those who appear on this list.

West Africa: We are concerned about the safety and well-being of children who may be involved in dangerous, excessive, abusive or forced work on cocoa farms. We are committed to working towards a supply chain where no children are subject to these conditions.   

We joined other members of the global cocoa and chocolate industry to work with West African governments and NGOs to ensure cocoa is grown without the worst forms of child labor. 

Each year we require our direct suppliers of cocoa beans in Côte d'Ivoire to sign their adherence to the same standards. If suppliers are found to be employing such practices, their contracts are subject to termination.

Our farmer training, and our ongoing interaction with cocoa growing communities, is helping raise awareness to discourage child labor, as well as promote better and safer working practices. The UTZ Certified cocoa program – established by Cargill, along with Dutch development organization Solidaridad and others in the cocoa sector – has introduced independent certification to improve agricultural, environmental and social practices in cocoa production.

350	"Supplier Conduct

Caterpillar expects its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We disclose certain information as required by the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.

Supplier Conduct

We believe that Caterpillar’s strength is based, in part, on our ability to develop and sustain long-lasting, mutually rewarding relationships with our suppliers. In accordance with Our Values in Action, we seek out suppliers who demonstrate strong values and ethical principles. We avoid those who violate the law or fail to comply with the sound business practices we embrace.

Caterpillar’s standard purchase order terms require our suppliers to represent that they have complied and will continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations that could result in liability to Caterpillar. These include product regulatory standards, environmental requirements, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and export regulations.

We are asked from time to time about our commitment to various international human rights, including initiatives to counter human trafficking and slavery. We believe that our Code of Conduct, Our Values in Action, effectively articulates our long-standing support for, and commitment to, human rights and the dignity of all people. Our employees and management receive regular training and participate in annual assessments to ensure that they are aware of and able to apply the principles contained in Our Values in Action. We also maintain internal reporting mechanisms to hold employees and management accountable for any failure to comply with Our Values in Action.

A recent California law, the Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, requires certain disclosures regarding human trafficking and slavery, in particular. As described above, we select suppliers who support our values and expect them to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We do not currently verify our product supply chain or audit suppliers specifically to evaluate risks of human trafficking and slavery or require our direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into products comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which they are doing business. We also do not currently maintain internal standards for employees and contractors regarding slavery and human trafficking specifically or provide training to employees and management on these specific matters. Caterpillar employees and management do receive regular training on Our Values in Action and are expected to respect the human rights and dignity of all people."	No

353	"Supply Chain and Conflict-Free Minerals

Background
“Conflict minerals” – tantalum, tin, gold, or tungsten – that originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries are sometimes mined and sold by armed groups to finance civil violence. These minerals can make their way into the supply chains of products used by consumers and businesses around the world.

In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires U.S. Securities and Exchange Act reporting companies, such as Illumina, to disclose their use of such conflict minerals beginning in 2014.

Conflict-Free Minerals Policy
Illumina supports the goal of avoiding the use of conflict minerals that directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the DRC or adjoining countries.

Accordingly, Illumina expects its suppliers to commit to the EICC Code of Conduct, which was established by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) to ensure worker safety and fairness, environmental responsibility, and business efficiency. The EICC Code of Conduct includes a provision related to the responsible sourcing of minerals and requires suppliers to have a policy to reasonably assure that the tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold in the products they manufacture does not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups that are perpetrators of serious human rights abuses in the DRC or an adjoining country. Illumina expects its suppliers to establish their own due diligence program to ensure supply chains that are free of conflict minerals and to make their due diligence measures available to Illumina upon request.

Intel will not use or tolerate the use of forced, debt bonded, indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery or human trafficking in its business or supply chain. This includes recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, receiving, or obtaining of a person for labor services, or commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, coercion, abduction or fraud for the purpose of involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. There shall be no unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement in the facility in addition to unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting company-provided facilities. All work must be voluntary.

We will not destroy, conceal, hold or otherwise deny access by employees to their identity or immigration documents, such as passports, work permits or drivers’ licenses regardless of issuing authority. The one exception is where the holding of work permit by the employer is required by law. Intel will have management systems in place to monitor and track our compliance, as well as our suppliers, with all of these expectations on human trafficking and slavery.

With respect to our suppliers that may need to source and hire foreign migrant workers, the supplier shall provide the migrant worker with a written employment agreement in their native language that describes the terms and conditions of employment. The suppler shall provide this agreement to the migrant worker as part of the job offer process and the worker shall sign it prior to departing from his or her country of origin.



Migrant workers shall not pay for their employment. Any recruiters used to source workers must comply with the local labor laws of the country where the recruitment takes place. The costs of recruiting and hiring, transportation (to facility and return home), or any government imposed fees shall be paid directly by the supplier. Any fees charged to the workers must be disclosed and returned to them. Workers shall not be required to post any bond or make any deposit. The worker shall not be required to participate in any savings program unless required by law. Working conditions, pay, benefits and treatment of migrant workers must be the same as local workers. Worker dormitories contracted or provided by the supplier or a labor agent are to be maintained clean and safe, and provided with appropriate emergency egress, hot water for bathing and showering, and adequate heat and ventilation and reasonable personal space.

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 went into effect. The Act requires manufacturers to provide information regarding their efforts to prevent human trafficking and slavery.

We expect and require our suppliers to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in connection with their performance. This requirement includes complying with all laws related to the prohibition of human trafficking and slave labor. Suppliers who are not in compliance are subject to immediate termination.

As an independent aluminum fabricator, our supply chain involves acquiring aluminum for processing and fabrication into aluminum products (as well as acquiring generally available supplies and materials used in our operations) and we do not believe our supply chain is inherently susceptible to violations of human trafficking and slavery laws. Although we do not have a formal process to specifically addressing the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, we recognize and respect all labor and employment laws, including human trafficking and slavery laws and are cognizant of the geographical regions of the world where those risks are elevated.

Finally, we maintain a corporate compliance and feedback program, which we refer to as InTouch, designed to allow employees and others to make a confidential/anonymous report of issues that they believe may potentially be in violation of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or any laws or regulations related to our operations.

We support fundamental human rights for all people and expect our suppliers to do the same. Our suppliers must be committed to a workplace that is free from all forms of human trafficking, forced labor and unlawful child labor in their operations. If we determine there is a need to conduct an audit to confirm a supplier’s compliance with this requirement, we expect full and timely cooperation.

In December of 2010 the United States Department of Labor’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor and Human Trafficking published a list of 128 products from 70 countries that the Bureau had reason to believe were produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards. Lubrizol has reviewed that list and determined that those products are not in the supply chain for goods manufactured or sold by Lubrizol. Nevertheless, Lubrizol conducts training for its supply chain team to ensure that they are aware of Lubrizol’s desire to only purchase from suppliers who do not violate human rights through human trafficking, forced labor and unlawful child labor in their operations.

Panasonic has clearly stipulated the need to respect human rights and do its best to understand, acknowledge and respect the diverse cultures, religions, mindsets, laws and regulations of people in the different countries and regions where the Company conducts its business in the Panasonic Code of Conduct. Moreover, Panasonic supports the basic principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as well as other guidelines.

370	"In fiscal 2007, to help its suppliers gain an understanding of Sharp's CSR philosophy and promote CSR-related measures among suppliers, Sharp created its own Sharp Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook and distributed it to major suppliers. It was also made available on the Sharp website.

This guidebook is based on the Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook produced and distributed by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA). Through this initiative, Sharp is advancing CSR efforts throughout the supply chain by requesting that suppliers around the world step up their efforts in areas related to CSR.

Since fiscal 2007, Sharp has been increasing common understanding about CSR in the supply chain by having its suppliers fill out CSR procurement surveys based on this guidebook. Furthermore, in 2011, Sharp amended the Basic Parts Purchase Agreement signed with partners in Japan to add an article on CSR initiatives that requests adherence to the policies stipulated in the guidebook. The company worked steadily to reenter these agreements with domestic suppliers in fiscal 2013. In the future, Sharp plans to deploy these activities for its overseas suppliers.

Sharp Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook

CSR Procurement Survey Status

Since fiscal 2007, Sharp has been implementing globally a CSR procurement survey using an online response system to enable suppliers to use the Internet to enter answers to self-checks based on the Sharp Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook. Sharp requests improvement of CSR initiatives from suppliers who have ranked D in their results for a particular survey area—or who have ranked C or below for two years in a row—by having them prepare and submit a corrective action plan.

In fiscal 2013, Sharp conducted a sixth survey of suppliers in Japan, a fifth survey of suppliers in China and Malaysia, and a fourth survey of suppliers throughout the Asian region, as well as in Europe and North America. To date, the surveys have been completed by approximately 2,300 suppliers (at approximately 4,200 sites) worldwide.

In fiscal 2012, to further promote suppliers' voluntary CSR activities, Sharp began providing feedback on evaluation results to both respondent and supplier managers. Such activities have taken root in Japan in fiscal 2013 and will be deployed for overseas suppliers in fiscal 2014.

As a result of surveys carried out to date and requests for improved initiatives, the number of A-ranked suppliers is increasing each year. Moving forward, Sharp will continue administering surveys once a year in principle. By requesting improvements as needed and providing supportive measures, Sharp will use these surveys as an opportunity to improve communication with suppliers, thereby continuously raising the level of CSR initiatives throughout the supply chain.





CSR Audit Status

Sharp promotes a CSR audit structure in which the CSR procurement survey results submitted by suppliers during self-checks are verified on-site by auditors.

In fiscal 2013, auditing tools such as audit manuals and check sheets were revised and optimized in preparation for a redevelopment of the audit structure.

In fiscal 2014, efforts such as collaborations with specialized external audit organizations will be promoted in order to introduce and develop a more effective CSR auditing structure that adapts to changes in external and internal environments.

To further contribute to the global society of the future, Sharp will continue to enhance supplier-related CSR activities throughout the entire supply chain, through systems such as continuous CSR procurement surveys and audits."	No

We work with our grower-members and visit their farms on a continual basis to facilitate crop practices and navigate the challenges of producing the best quality fruit in our highly-regulated California environment.

We also source certain unique fruits and ingredients from other countries, and doing this sustainably requires that we balance the social, environmental and economic benefits and risks of all such products, including how they are procured, manufactured and used. Sunsweet is committed to ensuring that our supply chain reflects Sunsweet’s values and respect for human rights and the environment. Strategic suppliers play a key role in our efforts to ensure that we manage our global supply chain in a sustainable way.

It is important to Sunsweet, our customers and our consumers that suppliers perform consistently with these Guidelines. We believe that compliance with all applicable laws is the foundation for sustainability. But in addition to compliance, we encourage suppliers to make continuous improvement as they identify new and innovative ways to create value and mitigate risk in the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability.

Environmental Responsibility: Suppliers must meet all applicable environmental rules, regulations and laws in the countries where they do business. In addition, we encourage our suppliers to consistently look for new and better ways to conserve resources, reduce



the impact of products in use, and reduce manufacturing waste.

Economic: Suppliers are expected to develop programs to drive long-term profitability, providing products and services that are preferred, creating greater value in the healthy foods and beverages produced for our customers and consumers, supporting economies through the purchase of goods and services, paying taxes and providing other forms of good citizenship and community support.

Anti-Corruption: We expect suppliers to operate with integrity. Suppliers must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as any other anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which they do business.

Disclosure Statement: Human Trafficking and Slavery in the Supply Chain Effective January 1, 2012

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 became effective, requiring retail sellers and manufacturers with annual worldwide gross receipts over $100 million doing business in the state of California to publicly disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. Symantec supports the passage of the Act and communicates our position through our Global Supply Chain Manufacturing and Fulfilment Code of Conduct (“Supply Chain Code of Conduct,” “the Code”).

As a software company, Symantec does not have a large manufacturing footprint; nevertheless, we are committed to building and maintaining a responsible, ethical supply chain and are adopting continuous improvements toward this goal. For example:

In Symantec’s Fiscal Year 2012, we published our Supply Chain Code of Conduct. This document articulates Symantec’s commitment to ethics and integrity as the foundation for business success. Symantec suppliers commit to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community and proclaimed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s core conventions. Symantec seeks to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. Additionally, the Code states that there is to be no harsh or inhumane treatment, including any sexual harassment, sexual abuse, corporal punishment, mental or physical coercion, or verbal abuse of workers; nor is there to be any threat of such treatment. Our suppliers are required to establish a management system for documenting their adherence to the Code and their efforts to continuously improve.

Symantec’s Supply Chain Code of Conduct was finalized in May 2011, and was subsequently communicated to all Tier One suppliers. Beginning in Symantec’s Fiscal Year 2013, Tier One suppliers will be subject to audit based on the Code.

The Supply Chain Code of Conduct requires all Symantec suppliers to demonstrate high ethical standards and to avoid activities that suggest even the appearance of impropriety. Symantec reserves the right to discontinue doing business with any supplier and related parties who violate our Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Symantec’s own employees are held to the standards of behavior outlined in our Employee Code of Conduct. The Employee Code of Conduct articulates our commitment to creating and

￼￼￼￼￼￼

maintaining a work environment based on respect for the individual. Employees are expected and required to comply with all laws and Symantec policies and guidelines relating to the treatment of all workers, and to maintaining a work environment free from discrimination and harassment.

Beginning in Symantec’s Fiscal Year 2013, employees with direct responsibility for supply chain management will be required to complete training on recognizing human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain.

The above-stated position on slavery and human trafficking is only one of many issues addressed in Symantec’s Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Additional labor standards are outlined, along with standards addressing health and safety, environmental issues, business ethics, and additional considerations.

As an independent petroleum refiner and marketer, Valero’s main supply chain involves acquiring crude petroleum oil and other petroleum feedstocks for processing into finished petroleum products (as well as acquiring materials like catalyst necessary for the operations of its refineries).  Valero believes this type of supply chain is not inherently susceptible to violations of slavery and human trafficking laws.  Thus, while Valero has not undertaken action with the intent of specifically addressing California Civil Code Sections 1714.43(c)(1) – (c)(5), Valero recognizes and respects all labor and employment laws, including those addressing slavery and human trafficking, wherever Valero operates.  


Obeying all applicable laws, in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which Valero’s business ethics standards are built.  Valero’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires all Valero employees to obey all local, regional and federal laws of the locations where Valero operates, including laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.  Valero trains employees on its Code so that each employee understands the substance of the Code and how to abide by its contents.  Further,  Valero takes seriously all potential legal or Code of Business Conduct and Ethics violations, and encourages all persons subject to its Code to preserve Valero’s highest standards for business ethics and integrity by reporting suspected violations to their supervisors, human resources representatives, or through Valero’s 24/7 business abuse hotline."
