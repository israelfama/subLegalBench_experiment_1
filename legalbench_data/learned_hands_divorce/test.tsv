0	I live in Washington state.  About 4 years ago, the ex and I decided to replace the house on the property as it was in serious disrepair (had been a rental before we owned it and the ex refused to do work on it and I didn't know how, so it was in bad shape at this point).  I suggested we consider a manufactured home, we looked at what was for sale and bought one that the state inspector said was a nice one when he gave it the once-over for the occupancy certificate.  I bought 1800 square feet of well-insulated, well-built housing for $25K, and I believe I got a very good deal.   Two years later the marriage ended.  In trying to figure out how to refinance the mortgage (which has subsequently been paid off) I discovered reverse mortgages.  This looked like a good way to obtain the money to continue my education, pay bills, etc. after the money from the divorce ran out.  AFAIK, in WA all reverse mortgage lenders/underwriters are FHA approved, meaning they are required to follow the rules that the FHA (and by extension, its parent agency HUD) makes.  Nothing gave me any reason to believe I would be refused a reverse mortgage.    However, one of those rules (24 CFR 203.43f(d)iii) is that if, in the past, if someone ever moved their manufactured home from its first placement, no mortgage will be insured.  When I said to the lender in passing that I'd gotten a good deal on the house and moved it to my property, she said 'HUD/FHA has a rule that if you moved your house you can't get a mortgage.  Since I have prior professional experience with manufactured home movement, I know from that and research into this that the regulation has no basis in law, and in fact violates federal law in that it imposes a penalty without prior notice and is retroactive without prior authorization from Congress.    When I was refused, however, there was no contract signed as yet.  The process is that you go to the lender, find out how much you can get (theoretically), get counseled (and I've owned several pieces of real estate so a lot of this is I already know) and then go back to the lender to start the process of getting the house appraised, etc., etc.  Appraisers are required to report on whether or not a house has been moved, so the visual evidence, or an appraiser searching the tax roll, will give that fact away, so before I've 'signed anything', I've been refused a mortgage.  Note that in Yesler Terrace Community v. Cisneros, the Ninth Circuit said that the third-party implementation of HUD/FHA rules, even if it did not immediately apply to the plaintiffs, did not deny them standing.  How can I prove injury-in-fact when I haven't even got the chance to sign anything?  Would a formal letter of refusal from the lender citing the federal regulation do it?	Yes
1	"Long story short, my partner of [N] years, together in general (not married) of [N+2], called me back on [a recent date] to say we should get a separation. [shortly after] I drove some of her belongings to her [quite a distance] and we settled things and had a verbal agreement to kinda go our separate ways.  [there is a significant piece of ""ammo"" I have to use against her, however it is heresay, although she is the one who told me this piece of information]  In our relationship, I worked, she became sick, I told her I'd take care of us. So I'm not sure how the separation is going to work money wise. She has since picked up a job. Never actually getting diagnosed. We were not intimate for the last 8 months of our relationship (her decision).  She is recollecting a time in which we were intimate early in the relationship and she is now phrasing that I assaulted her.   I am scared, and I want to just tie things off and go our separate ways, even if I absorb all the debt and she leaves with what she came into the relationship with.  I have a consultation with a lawyer setup for next week. for 250$. We bought a house, vacationed, got in debt. So even though I have a great job now. My past has financially crippled me. The lawyers office said the retainer is 1500, at a rate of 240/hr. Of which is 6 and a bit hours. Of which if we chat and get a document together. If we send it to my ex, and she doesnt agree, then its just a waste of money? Or if she doesn't respond? or something to that effect ...   I just don't know what to do or where to start. I mean, the 250 consultation, but no legal advice until 1500$ ... and I can't do legal aid since I make too much. And I don't have cash because I'm back to back paying off loans and credit card debt.  Thoughts? need more info? inbox me?"	Yes
2	"I have been divorced for many years.  During the divorce I was ordered to pay my ex $300 a month and he was ordered to refinance and take my name off of the house and loan.  After an extended time of him not doing this I contacted my lawyer and asked why do I keep having to pay and he hasn't done anything he was ordered to do... after me nudging the attorney he finally let the judge know and the nudge put a ""Stay"" on my part of the order where I used to pay the $300 a month.  Years later and he (my ex) still hasn't done anything.  Does this mean years from now if he finally takes care of this I'm going to have to start paying him again while living on Social Security retirement or is there a time limit for someone to complete what a judge has ordered.   Needless to say I did not want to contact my attorney from years past he was worthless and I learned later he doesn't do divorces but only doors court cases for marijuana rights."	Yes
3	My mother-in-law is about to visit my wife and I for 3 days (Thursday night, leaving Sunday evening.)  We have strong reasons to believe that MiL's spouse will attempt to have her served for divorce, while she's staying with us.  (His motivations would likely be: (1) doesn't have to deal with her in the immediate aftermath, since she'll be 200 miles away (2) snubbing my wife and I for perceived past transgressions, and (3) MiL might be inclined to ask to stay with us, rather than return to a tension-filled situation at her domicile  (a request that my wife and I would unanimously deny.)  While we don't want to interfere with the court, we also don't want to be used as pawns in MiL's current-husband's game.  Asking her not to come is not an option that I am allowed to consider.  So I want to know where the legal limits are on how I can delay service until after we have returned her home.  * Are we allowed to lie to a process server, and claim that she is not present at our house, when she is? * If we decide to just put her up in a hotel room &amp; visit her there-- taking other precautions to not be followed-- can the court's process server just hand the documents over to another adult at my residence, and consider her properly served?	Yes
4	(Michigan)  Their marriage lasted from may 2015 to may 2017. He owns a pizzeria that I currently manage. He opened it with his own money in 2008. They were in a relationship at the time and she worked there with him and put all profit in their combined personal bank account. She's now suing for lost wages. Since their marriage he's allowed her to pursue her hobbies and be free from work. She had the affair in august 2016. He caught her. They gave it another shot. May 2017, she's at it again. He had to end it. She's also trying to sue for a piece of the business. Any advice would help.	Yes
5	I'll try to keep this as short as possible... Divorce in 2012 - Ex Wife was awarded the home and signed a decree agreeing to refinance the home within 60 days and hold me harmless. She has never done this and is constantly late. She is up to 120 days past due now and I finally was able to contact her through a friend's cell phone and she says she's filing bankruptcy and to contact her attorney.  Is there anything I can do or should I just go ahead and file bankruptcy.	Yes
6	I have severe anxiety issues and my father said that there should be a witness on the hearing which he read on a letter that was given to him. I don't know what I should be doing as a witness since I've never been in one and it just makes me scared thinking about it.   My step-mom is the plaintiff and she said she would not be bringing anyone.   EDIT: My father is perfectly okay of me not being there. He is just making sure if there is a need to have a witness on court.	Yes
7	My friends soon to be ex husband moved from their home in Florida to Iowa. He some how made himself an account manager on her Verizon account. Then he went and charged a $1000 iPhone to her account and split the line. When she tried telling Verizon it was fraudulent they basically told her she was up the creek. Can there be legal action taken here ?	Yes
8	"I'll start with the brief background.  My mom has been an alcoholic for just under a decade, and she dragged my dad into it for a while too. My sisters and I were emotionally abused and berated for the last 5 years or so. I was getting the most of it and would instigate to prevent it from getting to my sisters, but I was at University this last year and it got to them.  Finally, my mom got into rehab. Instead of getting better, she cheated on my dad with an alcoholic 25 years older than her in rehab and abandoned us for him after getting out. She's refusing to help with any bills, even though my dad can't cancel her off the phone plan without paying a $600+ fee. She won't help with any of my sisters' activities costs or my schooling.  I'm 19 now. I built my car up from scratch with my dad, and it was given to me for my birthday at 16. Stayed in parents' names for insurance purposes. I've got a job now and am paying my own things because my dad can't afford it all on his own, but my mom is refusing to sign anything over. She won't sign off on the title of my car to me, or even my sisters car to her. She changed our legal address on our accounts so all of our bills, which she isn't helping with at all, go to wherever she is and we can't access them.   She's literally holding everything in our life ransom because she got sober for a hot minute and ""fell in love"" with this guy and has gone completely loony on us. (Yet she keeps texting us kids how much she loves us.) As a result of this, in addition to paying my own things as I mentioned above, I'm having to send my dad hundreds of my earned money (which I desperately need because Michigan raised public university tuition prices almost 3% again this year) because he can't afford everything on his own.  She apparently wants to do an ""easier"" (I know it's never really easy) divorce that doesn't require court or anything, just filling out the documents and seeing a judge or something, I don't completely understand how it works. My dad is trying to fill out the divorce documents, but it's hard. He's been struggling massively with depression since all of this started happening. (To make it worse, my internship is 10 hours away in Minnesota, so I can't be physically there to help.)  I guess the question/advice I'm seeking, is what are our legal rights against my mom as the remainder of our family (Me, dad, sister 16, sister 14), and what are my legal rights against my mom in terms of my car, when I have my dad's backing? (The plates and everything expire this month and I don't know what to do.)  Title has MI in it, but for clarification, we live in Southwest Michigan. Even though I'm in Minnesota for the whole summer my legal address is still our home there.  Thanks everyone. I'm sorry if this was a bit too long; I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, never thought I would need to use it for something like this, though."	Yes
9	"A couple months ago out of the blue my husband(34) said he wanted a divorce. I (32)was shocked and I broke down. He was adamant about it and went the next day and opened his own bank account and moved over his direct deposits from our joint checking account.   I make my own money and it is still going into the joint account, but his money goes into his and he moves it over to the joint account.    He was ready to walk until I told him I'm not selling the house and plan to stay. He was hoping I'd want to sell and split the profit (I put 30,000 down payment from money I had gotten from retirement- gained while we were married). After that, he suddenly wants to ""work"" on our relationship. In reality, he is preparing for divorce. He has a large sum of money coming from some back pay and I believe that is why he moved his direct deposit over to his personal account. He's waiting on it before he fly's the coop-approx. a year from now.   Anyways, a month ago he got a direct deposit from some disability back pay and it went into our joint account. He wasn't expecting back pay and doesn't check our bank statements so I was able to transfer it into my personal account before he seen it.    I want to withdraw this money and put it into    a fireproof safe and hide it- just until this whole thing has blown over. I'm hoping to stay together. If he sees it on the bank statement, I'm saying I gambled it away (I never gamble, but its all I got to go with).   So I want to do this and then close my personal account, if a discovery is done will they be able to look at closed accounts?  missouri"	Yes
10	"Hi all, my wife and I bought a house in Silicon Valley almost a year ago.  I was on deployment so I was not home.  We used my VA loan, I put down $10k and she put down $72k down payment; this was after we had a joint account.  He family, mother, father, brother live in their house rent free for almost a year now.  Her uncle lives there with $1,000/month rent.  I'm back home now, and our relationship is very rocky.  I can't handle the constant verbal abuse and her caustic nature day in an day out.  I want out.    The problem is she cut down 4, 70ft birch trees in our back yard while I was gone, tore up all the grass and did the same to the front yard.  She wants to remodel everything.  I feel suffocated in this this house.  Should I wait to finish the remodeling and file divorce or do it now?  I'm going to get a divorce, but I want to hear your advices too.  I can't pull equity on the house until one year and as it is, the property price probably dropped due to her ""renovations""."	Yes
11	I don't know if he ever changed his legal/ mailing address. I never evicted him or anything like that. He was free to come and go as he chose. I filed for divorce, he signed the papers and has since cut off contact with friends and family and stopped showing up for work. His current location is unknown.   He spent most of his time in the basement. I am trying to clean it. It was filled with empty beer cans, broken glass, tobacco, and piles of dirty clothes directly on the cement floor. I want to dispose of these clothes. Can I do that legally?  He has other items in my home (a home in my name, purchased before I was married. His name is not on the mortgage.) including a couch and many golf clubs.  I live in Connecticut, USA.	Yes
12	Been married for a little over two years. She's unemployed, but collects Social Security benefits as a representative payee for her kids (the kids dad died last year). I realize that alimony laws are different from state to state. Therefore, does anyone have any specific knowledge about alimony laws for Alabama?	Yes
13	"I live in Oklahoma. Roughly a year ago, while still married, my sex life was in a rut in my marriage, and I went on The Pirate Bay, clicked on recent porn uploads, and downloaded about 15 of the most recent files. My wife found these files and went through them, she confronted me and told me she thought some of them were underage. They were mostly amateur porn, and while I didn't see anything that indicated under 18 (appeared to be in dorm-rooms, indicating college age), I deleted the files out of concern for violating the law and because my wife didn't want me to have them.    For roughly a year now, she has brought up the photos during conflicts (roughly half a dozen times). She apparently saved them to her computer right away, and has been using them to settle arguments by threatening to go to the police. In May I decided to leave the marriage, and these photos have come up several times since then to get me to back down from demands regarding material possessions and keep me from arguing.    It seems like blackmail, I don't have the best documentation though, just a few text messages (most was over the phone or in person)    6/10/17 ""I look forward to all of the underage porn of yours that I get to show in court""    5/24/17 ""I have...so much underage porn that came from your laptop!""    And then one talking about how we would discuss the porn in marriage counseling, can't quote it without butchering it to avoid sharing personal info.    I've avoided doing anything about this out of fear that I would get in trouble for potentially downloading illegal pornography. This evening she has been threatening to share it with my boss and with the police, and I'm not sure what to do. Do I contact the police? Do I lawyer up? Is this blackmail if there weren't recorded demands, only threats?"	Yes
14	Hi, I have a software company that actually doesn't have any money in it, besides a couple of hundred dollars in bank, and I'm going through divorce. (it's an LLC, solo to my name)  My soon to be ex is fine with me having all rights, etc. on the company, but how would that be legally phrased?  I have a lawyer, and he will put in something, but if there's some specific Intellectual-Property advice I can get, then we could put that statement in.  Or maybe a generic statement of me getting entire business is enough?  There's some code there, i don't think it's of value, i just don't want there to be a battle over the business later, if I continue the business and actually make a profit in the future.	Yes
15	My friend is in the process of getting a divorce. My friend moved back home in the mean time.   Her ex lives in Florida. She lives in NYC. He has been opening credit cards in her name and so far has spent more than $25,000 under her name. The ex has stopped all communication with her.   What are the next steps.   Thank you.	Yes
16	I'm in NY and preparing for a divorce and have a quick question, since I haven't been to a lawyer yet and am trying to anticipate things in advance in order to make a rough plan.  We own a house but have only about $8000 in equity. We've decided the best option is for me to keep the house. I am assuming this means he will just owe me $8000 less (since I will be receiving half of his retirement funds, etc.) but he seems to think that the court will order half the cost of the entire house deducted from what he is supposed to pay me. (So, including all the money that we still owe the bank.) That doesn't seem right to me, I'm just curious if anybody could help me out with what to expect.	Yes
17	A quick question to you brilliant legal minds since I haven't really been able to find a good answer on the Google.  In short, my brother's divorce is going to end in a trial. He has exhausted all other avenues and the case manager finally recommended trial. His lawyer, unfortunately, recently moved provinces and is no longer representing him because of that.  While he, and everyone around him, knows that it would be best if he hired representation, there just isn't money for it.  However, we're wondering if he can ask his former lawyer to be a witness at the trial or is that some sort of conflict?  Thank you!	Yes
18	She has a psychiatrist, therapist, and will be taken to a mental hospital soon. She wants to know if she can be required to give the name/s of her rapist and if she can be punished for not doing so. She lives in Ohio.	Yes
19	My stbxMIL is suing me, she already sued me for something else and won (mostly because it was considered a martial contract that was violated) but has since agreed to drop it in exchange for me relinquishing my half of ownership on the cars. This suit is for a bunch of stuff, most of it is money she gave to him for various things before we got married and the money never went through my hands. There was one thing that we were married for but there was no agreement attached to it like her first suit and a couple of other things that I probably won't be able to get out of. She is also pursuing almost $1,000 for emotional trauma. Earlier this year she kicked me out, pushed me to my limits and ended up calling the police and filing a protective order. I want to countersue for emotional damages but I'm not sure for how much and all of that. It is small claims. Any advice is much appreciated	Yes
20	Long story short wife and I are going through a separation, she will be moving out for August 1st, after telling me on July 26 that she would be moving out. Anyways the issue being is I am going to stay living in the home we own together, while the house is fixed up and some renovations are done. Am i able to change the locks so she cannot come and go in what is essentially our house but my home. She has already signed a lease at her new residence, so there will be a change in address for her.	Yes
21	So my friends sister is married to a marine. They have been married for nine months. Yesterday he served her divorce papers but would not let her see the papers. He now is telling her today that if she doesn't sign by 5am tomorrow then he is going to go to the court and say she is refusing to sign them. With a quick Google search it looks like she has 30 days before he can do anything. But he is refusing to let her even see the papers so she can't sign even if she wanted to. What's her best course of action? Thanks!	Yes
22	Hello My wife and I agreed that we need a divorce. We are aiming for uncontested divorce.  We have been married for 4 years - we have reached a point after counseling and therapy  And multiple attempts that our relationship is toxic and we need to end our marriage. This is so overwhelming to me as I am ali dealing with my ill father and finding work which adds up stress. Now we both can't afford a lawyer in the Los Angeles area and need to find legal help to do the paper work properly. Since we neither can't afford at the time to get our own place we will have to live together till divorce is final and also since we have three months on our apartments lease- can we still live together while seeking divorce? Does it really take all 6 months till we get divorce decree? Is it possible to get a Probono lawyer to help us submit the uncontested divorce paperwork?  We only share a car loan debt of 9000$ no assets or property we own and no children. This breaks my heart as I love her and it's days before my birthday as well as my fathers third surgery. I don't know what to do or how to go about this- it will definetly cause me financial hardship now that I am currently unemployed and she works part time  I can use any piece of advice or experience I can get from those who have walked down that line	Yes
23	My wife and I are splitting, we're divorcing, we're done. Not going to get into who's fault or whatever, but there's a big issue.   She took my debit card, basically taking access away from money. Basically she decided to hold the money over my head. The account is joint, I have a card with my name on it and she has one with ours and it goes to the same account. She would basically give me cash when I got paid and tell me to get another bank account, which I eventually did but the latest paycheck still went into the account. She would drop the money off and yet I wouldn't get the full amount. Basically she's leaving me with nothing and also controlling how much I can have. She told me she is closing the account so I will no longer have access to it. Fine. We need to split.   Here's the twist... I found the card. Apparently she didn't think to chop the damn thing out before throwing away (and apparently she needs to work on her skills because she missed the garbage can) And the account isn't closed. I check the balance and found she has a lot more money than previously thought. I'm sitting here with my card wondering if I have any right to withdraw whatever money I want. And I'm confused... Do I? I mean... It's our account, she took my debit card, and the card has my name on it..... What do I do? I need to pay bills, I have a mouth to feed and she just left me with nothing. I could take the loss and wait until I get paid again but during this split she's done nothing reasonable. Everything done, especially the money situation, has been uncalled for. It may sound mean, and like I'm trying to get revenge but that's not what I want. I just don't want to starve the next two weeks. So... Do I have a right to withdraw the money?	Yes
24	Hello,  I need some advice on getting out of purchasing a condo. I have put a 20k deposit down on a $408,000 condo (Mississauga, Ontario). I am still waiting to hear confirmation from the bank in regards to a loan (home equity loan instead of a mortgage). The thing is my husband who is the breadwinner has been cheating and I cannot move into a condo with him knowing this. The condo and all paperwork would be in my name. Move in date was supposed to be Sept 01/2017.  Can anyone please provide any information on whether I can get out of this?	Yes
25	"The ""tenant"" is actually my dad and my mom is kicking him out of our house. They thought they could make it work after the divorce but obviously not. This is her house 100% (bought after the divorce) and we're in Iowa.  Is there anything she can do to make sure he doesn't take anything he's not suppose to? She's already noticed some of her antiques missing.  Dad plays dirty.  Please help ease my poor mother's mind."	Yes
26	So.    My ex was arrested for child porn and i am divorcing him.  He is now filing motion after motion to delay not only his trial, but our divorce.    I can't get legal aid because of the circumstances, and don't have the money to get a lawyer.  I know Florida tends to have the spouse who has custody stay withibk 50 miles of the other parent, but I need to get out   Any ideas, info, advice....  Would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
27	Hi r/legal! Recently split up with my s/o and am now in the process of setting up a new life for myself. While with s/o, we had an arrangement for rent/bills. Basically everything was split 50/50 including mortgage. The mortgage was paid off earlier this year and since February, we have both been setting aside money to pay property taxes and insurance at the end of the year. I still continued to pay my half of utilities while putting the property tax/insurance money aside in my savings account.   S/o is now asking me to give him all the money that I've saved up for that, now that I've left.   Am I legally obligated to pay him back?	Yes
28	Question. Me and my ex got divorce about 7 years ago. In the MSA, she got the house.  The title/ deed and mortgage are still both still in my name. She wants me just sign the deed over so she can refinance, but I don't trust just signing over the deed without her promising to payoff the existing mortgage and releasing me from liability to the house and mortgage.  Do I need any other paperwork or is the MSA and deed transfer enough?	Yes
29	Throw away account used as precautionary measure.  **Short version**  Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.  **Long version**  My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have.   Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.  When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.  There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.  The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.  The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.  This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.  I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.  Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.  Any thoughts are appreciated.	Yes
30	My dad is going through a divorce in Indiana. He inherited a 50% stake in his mothers house (in Ohio) when she died. His brother inherited the other 50%. I know that Inheritance can be considered marital property in Indiana divorce law, unlike most other states where inheritance is not included as marital property.   What factor does his brother owning 50% stake in the house have in the court calculation to split inherited property in divorce?  Thanks.	Yes
31	My ex and I agreed that we would pay our fair share of taxes, in proportion to our earnings, at tax time. Because I withheld too much, and she withheld too little, I ended up paying her taxes for her. Per our divorce agreement, in this situation we agreed to pay back the other, but she is now refusing to pay. Do I have to go to divorce court, or could I take her to civil court, or even small claims court, to get my money?	Yes
32	"After a few years of suspicion, I found out my father is having an affair (still married to mother). I have a few questions, so I will be brief. Please feel free to respond to one or all of my questions.   First, I admit that I caught him by going through his emails. He wrote down his email/passwords in his journal, and I found it; I looked through his inbox and discovered many things. I discovered that he is dating a young woman with a child (not his) and he has been sending her money through Paypal (because I also discovered his paypal account). He has been telling this young woman that he is in the middle of a divorce from my mother (he is not), and that my mother is ""stalling"" by ""not signing the papers"".    He sent his girlfriend an email (fwd) from his lawyer, talking about the Judge (who does not exist) looking at the case. However, his lawyer does not really exist either; my father created this lawyer, created his email address, and proceeds to email himself, so that he can fwd the email to his girlfriend, making it look official. I apologize if that sounds confusing.  Additionally, he has told this lady that he served the Iraq/Kuwait conflict (he did not) and he created an email address for a soldier he ""served with"" who does not exist. He then emailed himself, as this character he created, and gave this detailed story, making himself look like a war hero. This story he made up was meant to serve as a character witness to the Judge (who doesn't exist) for his divorce (which is not happening).  My questions: **1)** Since I went through his emails and other accounts to find this information, have I committed a crime? **2)** Has my father committed a crime (fraud?) by telling this woman he is getting a divorce? What about the lawyer, judge, and character witness he made up? **3)** Has my father committed a crime with the ""war hero story"" he made up? He claimed to have ""turned down the medal of honor"" ..is this stolen valor? **4)** His Paypal account has a few bank cards linked to it. He and my mother run a family business, in which my mother is the owner. If he has been sending his girlfriend funds from a business account, is this a form of laundering?  Again, I apologize for the length of this post, but there is a lot to describe, and I really don't have anyone to go to with all of this."	Yes
33	"This is in Nevada, Clark county.   I am helping pay for a relative's divorce. It is not going smoothly, but I don't need to get into the relationship part of it here. What I'm concerned about is that I am not being told the truth about the legal proceedings, court dates, etc. I would like to verify a few things without relying on the word of this relative.  For instance, this relative has said he has appeared in court a number of times due to the soon-to-be-ex ""filing things against him"" and ""dragging him into court"". So there should be a record of that somewhere, right? Can I look up that kind of thing online?  There have definitely been custody hearings for their minor children. Are records of those publicly available?  Their court date for the divorce hearing has supposedly been postponed several times and is now allegedly scheduled for October. Again, is there a way I can verify this without going through my relative (or his lawyer)?  You may have discerned by now that I am not happy paying for this relative's divorce, and you would be correct. There are lots of relationship issues going on in the background and perhaps I will make another post to discuss those. This post is just to learn how I can get more information to verify if I am being told the truth or not about what is going on."	Yes
34	So my mother just called me to let me know that her tenant informed her that a man had moved in boxes to the garage and was sleeping there. Turns out its my dad! They have been separated over 20 years. He just left one day and that was that. They never divorced and the mortgage is still under both their names. I didn't see my dad after that or talked to him until maybe 2 years ago when he randomly contacted me to get money. My mom had tried contacting him before about refinancing house to remove his name from loan with no luck. We would hear about him from time to time as he remained in the area. She wants to ask him to leave but she thinks he will still stay because it is still his house. What can be done in a situation like this? Obviously she needs to divorce him.	Yes
35	We live in Ohio, and my mom said if my stepdad found out she was cheating he would get a divorce settlement and not a disillusion.  She told me he'd get half of everything she owns - her savings, her retirement fund, and most importantly the house. She'd have to sell the house so she could give him half of its worth.  The thing is, they've only been married for two years. She makes house payments to the bank, but she's not renting. We've had this house for 17 years, so I feel like he would have no right to get any of it since he only moved in two years ago, but I don't know if that's how the legality of it works.  They bought two cars during their marriage, and he's a car salesman so they came from his place of work. How would this factor into the settlement?  I'm going through a lot, so my mind is just flooded with confusion. I tried googling this stuff, but I think information attuned to my situation would be the most helpful.	Yes
36	Earlier this year, my ex husband stole money from me ($600 to be exact). We were still going through the divorce when he took the money. We ended up going to mediation for the divorce, and the money he stole was put in the mediation papers. Those papers later went into the judgement of divorce. The divorce was finalized a month ago, so now he legally has to pay me back. The agreement in the papers was for him to pay me back within 90 days of the date of mediation, which was back in April. He is refusing to pay. What should I do? Should I go through small claims?	Yes
37	"I'm trying to find a job so I can afford to leave an unhealthy marriage. My immature husband cannot handle this like an adult and is now telling me that if I'm not gone (from our apartment) in a week, he's going to call lawyers and the authorities. Because he makes 90% of our household income and pays rent etc. he feels he has the legal hand and that he can kick me out because I'm a ""squatter"" who is ""taking advantage of him"". Both our names are on the lease. I give him money monthly (we have separate bank accounts) to contribute to expenses but it isn't much. Is there any legal authority he can take with regards to living space?"	Yes
38	My wife recently filed charges on me and dropped them today after she realized they were felony charges. We are going through a divorce and she is now threatening to bring the charges back up if I don't agree to her terms of divorce. Can they be brought back up?	Yes
39	"Hi, r/legaladvice  I'm at work and on mobile so forgive any issues formatting and I'm also going to try to keep this as short as possible.  Back story: Wife and I together 5 years, only married for 3 months before we separated. She moved out because she had been seeing someone behind my back for a while, fell in love with him and moved in with him.  Prior to that I worked. When she took a new, much higher paying job that also allowed her to be home more (but on call) her hours changed and was unable to keep her kids (2 boys from previous marriage) as often as she liked. She asked me to leave my low-ish paying job so we didn't have to deviate from the kids' schedule they'd had for years. I reluctantly agreed, but did and hadn't worked in about a year.   Fast forward to us getting married then her shortly moving out abruptly. This left me with the rental lease on our home (though the lease is in both our names) and forced to somehow come up with rent money with no job on a home I could not afford by myself.  I quickly went back to work but making roughly $1600/month and paying almost $900 in rent + utilities just wasn't happening. Her and I agreed I would move out by the end of July, splitting the rent until then, and then she would move back in with new boyfriend. Fine whatever as far as I was concerned.  I have been doing my best to save up money to move while sharing rent and utilities with her for 3 months, but it's not easy to save up the roughly $1500 I need to move on my security salary.  I told her this last month and she agreed (in text message, I still have) that she would pay rent for July and August and I would be out by the end of August. Last week my landlord came by saying rent has not bee paid and she called him saying she was not going to pay it. She had changed her mind.  Now my landlord has filed eviction on me, and my court date is the 26th of this month. I do not have the money I need to move out by then, and no friends or family to stay with. My mother lives an hour away in a retirement home and cannot have overnight visitors.  My question is, assuming I'm not out by my court date of the 26th, how long do I have to be out before my landlord can start removing my belongings and lock me out? Do I have any legal protection at all considering the circumstances?   I also would like to add - and this is speculation - that I have very good reason to believe that my landlord and my ex are working together on this. He is not responding to text or phone calls from me, nor is she. I know good and well she wants to move back into our home with her new dude because he has kids, plus her and her kids and it's my understanding that his two bedroom is just too small, whereas I have 4 rooms. The landlord has had a ""thing"" for my ex for sometime and their families are close knit. He was always very rude with me and her and I used to both joke it's because he's jealous of me.  Thank you in advance for any help.  (This is South Carolina btw)"	Yes
40	A friend is married in both Brazil and California. She got married here then registered it in Brazil. Now her ex is paying for the divorce in Brazil- does she have to pay again to get divorced here? Or will California recognize a divorce that is completed in Brazil then Officially translated? Divorce in Brazil was only $200, in California over $700.	Yes
41	I got married really young and now I want to get a divorce. Ex says he doesn't want to get a divorce lawyer and wants to kinda just get papers and sign off because he's in a hurry to join the army and not allow me benefits (which I'm not fighting for). We have a house under both our names and he kicked me out a year ago and I've jumped around living here and there since.  We live in Indiana and I don't know what to do. I want to sign off on the papers because I don't want to have connection anymore to him. Even though I'm not fighting for much anymore I don't know if a divorce lawyer is still something I should do. I've never dealt with this stuff before.	Yes
42	"Location: Colorado  I'm in my mid-20s. My mom was recently served with a ""Petition for Dissolution of Marriage"" document by my stepdad. I went over to talk to her about it, and she started handing me things to bring back to my place. These include legal documents for the ownership of several valuable horses that she owns ($20k+) as well as two guns that she uses for horse-mounted shooting (if it matters, they're crippled guns only capable of shooting blanks).  I have a suspicion that this was the wrong decision, but I just took the items from her and put them in my car because she was crying and I just didn't know what to do in the moment. She also tried to get me to take my half sister's passport (she's a minor), but I refused to take that.  What sort of legal risk am I at for being in possession of these items? I believe the Dissolution of Marriage document states that she's not allowed to hide assets."	Yes
43	"Hi,  Im in the UK. Me and my wife separated when i found out she was having an affair. Her dad wants to buy my share of the house we own.  Bit of background: Her parents gave us £44k deposit for a £220k house. They said it was a gift and it was her inheritance early. Due to this, the house was split 60/40 in her favour. I have all this in emails.  As i said, she had a few affairs so we are separated, we cant afford to divorce at the min. We also have a little girl who was born after we bought the property. Her father has offered to buy my 40%. He is claiming that as the house is now worth £250k and was worth 220k when we bought it, i am only entitled to 40% of the profit (about £12k for 40% share).   I told him that it was from the equity of the property (we owe £160k so that would be £90k equity. 40% being £36k) he said that because he put down the deposit that that should be deducted and he ""isnt just giving that inherritance money away to me.""  As the property is split 60/40 in my ex wifes favour because of that inherritance am i correct in thinkong that i am entitled to the whole £36k?   12 grand for 40% of a 250k house with 90k equity seems very underhanded to me. But we are keen to do this without a  horrible divorce and court battle.  Any advice appreciated! (Sorry for all the numbers)"	Yes
44	Hi reddit.   So he gave me the engagement ring a few years ago and recently I found out he had been cheating on me for months. Now he is asking for my engagement ring back.   I looked online and found out that unless he specified when he gave it to me that he would want it back should we split up, he is not entitled to it. Well, he never informed me before the split that he wanted it back, and it was a gift, and he was the one who cheated causing the relationship to end.   So does he have any leverage at all?   Thank you for reading, any help is appreciated.	Yes
45	My father is dying of cancer and is separated from my mom. He hasn't lived with us for three years. Me and my younger brother have a complicated relationship with him, so we almost never visit him. I recently got into a fight with him and have decided that I don't want to see him again. In response, he is threatening my mom that if me and my brother don't see him once a week, he'll take our house.  He bought the house with my mother 15 years ago, but the title is in my mother's name only. Would he be able to take the house? Should my mom divorce him before he dies? What special precautions should we take?	Yes
46	"Hi guys, I had a few questions regarding property ownership rights and financial rights in California.  My wife and I are going through a divorce, we have a a house together and joint credit card, checking and savings.  In short what are my my rights to the money in the checking and savings.  Also, what should I do with the property, what does it mean for her to ""buy me out"" regarding the property?    If you're curious about the situation, please see my previous posts.  In a gist we have a house which she says I don't contribute enough, even though she knew before hand that I would be on deployment and have my own living expenses."	Yes
47	Keeping things somewhat obfuscated for safety, if you need finer details, please PM me.  This happened in upstate SC. I am now in FL.  About 4 years ago, I offered to open up my house out of the kindness of my heart to my best friend and their spouse, who have a child. The next several months after that, it became very apparent that there were things I wasn't aware of. My friend's spouse was very abusive towards my friend, mostly verbally. I found out that my friend had been raped by the spouse as well. I confronted my friend about it after witnessing abuse towards the child too, and finally my friend recognized the need to end the relationship and demand a divorce. We filed to have the spouse evicted. My friend did not leave as they did not have anywhere to go.  My friend refused to pursue charges, mostly out of fear of things not going well, potentially some Stockholm Syndrome or something going on. The spouse accused us of cheating, openly vilified myself and my friend, and claimed to be innocent of what we witnessed.  No formal divorce or custody agreement ever entered in due to the previously mentioned fears.  There was peace some time after the split. The spouse seemed to be stabilizing. There was an agreement to allow visitation. The spouse however not only has a child with another person now, but has also kidnapped my friend's child as well, and has made wild baseless accusations.  I have been asked to submit an affidavit to what I witnessed. I am concerned that if my involvement comes forward, that the target will be drawn to me and I may have false allegations filed against me, forcing me to return back to SC, which could potentially have a number of consequences for me outside of legal. However, if I don't submit my affidavit, it could potentially weaken or ruin my friend's case and the chances of my friend's child being returned to the parent who is actually a capable parent.	Yes
48	"On Jan. 31, 2012 I left my abusive (now ex) husband. The next day, I got a restraining/no contact order against him. Divorce was finalized 12/12/12.  Fast forward to 5/5/15. I was pulled over by the police and I wasn't sure why (I'm careful, don't speed, etc.). I was told there was a warrant out for my arrest for the past 3 years! I asked the officer to please double-check and re-run my license.  He did and told me the warrant was for ""Failure to pay a medical bill to [name redacted] Community Hospital"". Officer's exact words.  I was taken into custody and was in a holding cell for several hours while my son and my current boyfriend paid my bail. I was held on a $5000 bond for a $1000 medical bill.   On 5/8/15, I went to my mandatory court date. I thought I was going in front of the judge, as per my release papers. I  was actually taken into a conference room with the owner of the collection agency that was holding this medical bill. I tried to explain to him that I had no knowledge of the bill and no knowledge of a debtor's exam....I didn't go  to the debtor's exam because all papers regarding this issue went to my ex's house and I had the no-contact order. I had NO way of knowing about any contempt of court charge from missing the debtors hearing.  I was told by this man that if I missed one more payment or was late even by 1 day, that he would re-instate the warrant.   I have been paying $25/month for over 2 years now and they still say I owe over $700 on this bill. None of my $500 bail went for the medical bill....and this is a medical bill that I believe is actually my ex-husband's.   I did take the owner of the collection agency to court and was only awarded damages in the amount of $1000. I was not allowed to take the 2 police departments involved in my arrest to court. Both agencies harrassed me during my arrest even though I gave them  no problems whatsoever. For instance...when I was switched between departments,  I was put in leg irons and my wrists chained around my waist and had to ride in the K9 cruiser and I was told I was the ""new chew toy"" and they threatened to sic the dog on me for no reason. I was harrassed for ""ignoring the bill"". Mind you, my ex's father is also a bailiff in that particular jurisdiction and at the time I still had their last name.  One more point of interest....when my bail was paid, the owner of the collection agency who also posed as a judge on 5/5/15 was the one who signed for my bail! (I still have the receipt).   My question is, do I have any recourse in any of this? Is there some way to make all of this go away? I honestly cannot afford this bill and I do not believe it is mine....no one has ever sent it to me to look and no one will show me. I honestly do not know if it even exists.  How can I handle this. This bothers me and since this whole incident, I refuse to  drive alone and I  get scared to even go into the jurisdiction this happened in. This is negatively affected my life and I'm fed up about that fact. Please help/advise. Thank you!"	Yes
49	I'm an E3 in the Navy stationed on Naval Base Ventura County in California. I'm going through a divorce with my ex at the moment and we've agreed on all the terms and all the paperwork is filed.  We're still legally married until October 26, 2017, because of California's 6 month waiting period. The problem is one of our terms is that she would take half of the credit card debt, which is in both of our names, and I would take the other half, and she has yet to make any attempts at going to the bank to take her half or to even pay me back for the past couple months where I've been the only one making payments on it.   We're still legally married, but I was wondering if I could possibly have the start of a case against her? Could I sue her now? Or do I have to wait till we're legally divorced for all of our agreements to be put into place? We filed all of the paperwork back in April. I hope the information I've provided is enough to get good answers, I'll provide more if you need more details. Thank you for your help.	Yes
50	My parents got divorced when I was about 6 months old. As part of this agreement, any part of college that is not scholarships is supposed to be split 50/50 betweeen the two. Now, recently (and by recently I mean the past 4-6 years) our relationship has ceased to exist due to large disagreements between me and the rest of his family, and him, as in nobody really talks to him anymore. I just recently graduated with my Bachelors, and today received a Bill for his payment plan saying I need to pay it. In the past, he has always taken the route where he could not pay or steal what he can in regards to me. I.e. my college savings, avoiding medical bills, etc. Now that I am a completely independent adult, can I still go after him for this? Would it be worth it? For reference, its about 2 grand, and I make enough to make it go away within 3 months or so. But I have to pay back the amount of government loans i did take soon, and this may be rough if I do so.	Yes
51	I am one week from moving to a new state and out of nowhere my wife wants a divorce. We have a toddler aged daughter. She had been the one pleading for the move. Ive already quit my current job, and cannot get it back. I have no option financially but to take this job. The job pays significantly more than what I am making now. I am freaking out, if i leave the state, am i giving up all the rights to my daughter? She is hounding me now about rescinding our notice and allowing her to stay in the house we are renting. I am in shock right now. She locked me out of the house with no access to a car. I am worried ill never see my daughter again.  I am contacting lawyers and getting answering services. Hoping one gets back to me soon. Just hoping someone could give me some guidance here. I am completely stuck.	Yes
52	My friend is going through a contentious divorce right now. She has asked me to give a deposition and possibly testify for her. I really want to, but have an underlying concern holding me back.   They both have a history if drug use, and I have smoked pot with both of them in the past. The things she wants me to testify about have nothing to do with drugs, so I guess my question rests with the likelihood that I would be questioned about my own drug use and what the consequences would be. Is it possible that testifying to that could mess up job, adoption, or similar prospects for myself down the line? Also, my friend seems to think I might get drug tested for agreeing to be a witness. Is that right? I really just want a clear understanding of what I'm getting into if I agree to do this.    Do they drug test witnesses in situations like this?	Yes
53	Throw away for obvious reasons!  The gist of this is the soon to be ex wife filed a false PFA against the soon to be ex husband. Ex husband DID NOT plead guilty, but DID take a plea deal to make things easier and to avoid a battle. STBXWife currently has sole legal and physical custody, and STBXHusband is paying support on kids. Children are allowed to text dad, set up times and places to meet dad, etc.   However. Things the kids have said have made dad think the home environment has become seriously harmful and STBXWife has become uncontrollably irresponsible.  To avoid involving the kids and asking they testify against their mother, the option of a PI was brought up.  STBXHusband knows where she lives, as she's still in the marital home with no intention of leaving (which is no issue). Knows where she works as she owns her own business. The PFA is essentially a court enforced no contact. It states STBXHusband isn't allowed to contact via third party or otherwise. But this isn't contacting.  As the divorce is proceeding, is STBXHusband allowed to hire a PI to get specific information to use in said divorce and subsequent custody battle?	Yes
54	"Some background information: So my mother and father are currently going through a divorce. I'm legally an adult (18+) while my younger brother is a minor (Under 18). My father recently moved out of the house because of this divorce and is currently living in Chicago. My mother, who had been previously diagnosed with a personality disorder, left the house for 3 days without a word to me or my brother on when or whether she would be coming back or not. During day 2, we broke down the door to the house's office room in order to get more information or maybe a hint on her whereabouts. The actual act of kicking down the door was committed by my younger brother but I witnessed it and did not try to stop him. She is now trying to take me to court for ""convincing"" my brother to kick down the door. I don't think she has any legal standing as the house is under my dad's name and he pays for all the bills because my mother has been unemployed for years now. My dad understands my side of the story and doesn't care for the damage done. Can she really do anything or is she just trying to scare me and play mind games? I am now living with my dad in the city during summer break from college to get out of the house but my brother is stuck with her because he's still got a year left of high school back home.  Some other stuff she has done to me I think I can use against her to file a ""counterclaim"" (don't know if I'm using that word right) or just in general is: 1) Logged into my newly opened bank account (which was only suppose to be under my name) and taken $5,000 from my savings and tried transferring it into her personal bank account. I, foolishly, used an old username and password from a previous joint account with her when I was a minor to open the new one. She used that previous information to log into my new account and tried to steal my money. I called the bank and reversed it but I would still consider that some form of identity theft, right? 2) She has been constantly berating and belittling me over text message (calling me names, using every swear in the book, threatening me, etc.) for a little under a month now. I don't want to block her as I think I can use this as evidence as some form of abuse, correct? Yes, I find it very disturbing and am deeply saddened that my own mother thinks I'm worthless simply because I refuse to take sides in the divorce.   More info on her mental issues: She has obviously had this Personality Disorder for a while now and during my childhood would constantly go through bouts of yelling at me and my brother and acting like a normal mother. She use to see a therapist but I'm not sure how often she attends appointments now. I think the stress of the divorce accelerated/intensified this disorder as the abusive text messages have gotten more frequent. I've even come home one night (in the old house) to see dozens of holes in the wall across different rooms of the house which was very creepy to say the least.  Thank you in advance for all the help."	Yes
55	"My parents were in the process of renovating an expensive historic home when they divorced, ten years ago.   The mortgage has been paid one way or another since then, but nobody has liven in it, but both are still on the mortgage.  Parent A would like to get the home to rentable condition, and start making income. A has already invested money in restoring the home.  Parent B would like nothing to do with Parent A, hence why this issue has not been addressed for so long.   Parent A is concerned about Parent B coming after A's rental income or the value of the property, and wants B to sign a ""quit claim deed"", eliminating A's interest in the property.   I advised B not to sign anything, after some googleing suggested that this would not eliminate the responsibility to pay the mortgage.   Would it be possible to informally draft a contract that covers these concepts? Or is an attorney strongly advised in this situation?  - While A pays the mortgage, B won't make any claims or interfere. - If A pays off the mortgage (or refinances), B will sign the quit claim deed.  Both have a large amount of illiquid assets.   Any other advice?"	Yes
56	My partner and I are divorcing in San Diego California.  We agreed to go our separate ways, divide our stuff on our own, and just end it.  I moved out and filed the paperwork, and they lawyer-ed up and are now asking for more than agreeing to.  My question is can I, as the petitioner, amend what I am asking for from the court?  There are no children together, or anything too complicated like property or large 401K's.  We make almost the same amount of money, the marriage lasted 2 years.  Just dept and assets acquired during the marrage.  I have an appointment with my own lawyer next week.	Yes
57	I'm asking on behalf of my friend, so I may have some details incorrect.    As part of my friend's divorce agreement, he co-signed on his ex-wife's lease for a new apartment.  My friend has never resided in the apartment, and in fact lives out of state.  The initial year is over, and he no longer wants to be on the hook for this, however he is being told that since he was on the original lease, he must remain on any future leases if she is to remain in the apartment.  Is this true?  Does he have any recourse to have himself removed from the lease without her moving?  Thank you!	Yes
58	I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	Yes
59	My husband and I have been separated for over a year and living in different states. All finances are separate and neither relies on the other for any assistance. We have not even been in contact for over 6 months. I recently became pregnant from my boyfriend. I know my husband is the assumed father and I should put him on the birth certificate.   I have tried several times to get in contact with the husband to try and proceed with a divorce but he hasn't returned any texts or phone calls. I also know that he has moved at some point and I don't know his address or if he still works at the same job.   Could I just say that I am separated on any paper work and list my boyfriend as the father? I just want to do this with the smallest amount of stress and financial burden on myself and worried about legal fees adding up with having to try and track the husband down and having to do paternity tests.	Yes
60	TL:DR-In my “infinite wisdom” I believed it a good idea to get married at the age of 21 as a US citizen to my long-distance boyfriend who is a Canadian Citizen. It was my first serious relationship as an “adult” and while at the time I made excuses why, it was a very rocky relationship. After almost two years of being married it all fell apart and I moved back home with my parents. He jerked me around with dancing on the “Maybe I still want you” line for a bit before I finally said it was over. While back in the states it took him years but I finally got request for divorce papers in the mail. I believed that was the end of it, but after contacting him he swore up and down he still has a bunch of paperwork to work through before we can be properly divorced. I no longer believe him when he said he would handle it. I just got engaged 8 years later but I have no idea if the divorce went through or how to handle it moving forward as I plan my first proper wedding.  We were married IN Alberta and when he filed he was still there and I was (and still am ) in Rhode Island.  I’m going to preface this all by saying I’m very ashamed of the whole situation. I was a very stupid lonely kid who didn’t realize just how greatly I was screwing my life over. I’m sorry this got long, I still get pretty emotional thinking about the whole situation. If this is not the right place to post this I would really appreciate being directed to the right place.  2006 - I come from a pretty tense and dysfunctional family, so when it came time for me to go to college I chose something far away. While attending my first semester at college I did not know anyone there and spent the majority of my time by myself in the library or computer labs. It wasn’t long before I got officially involved with a long-distance boyfriend from Canada. Huge phone bills were racked up due to international calls and he even ventured out to see me on a very long bus ride.   2007 – I ended up transferring back to my home state and after a short time spent back at my parent’s home I decided I needed to get out of there. If I went straight back to school the next semester my parents agreed to help me get an apartment if I could prove I could pay for it. I worked full time and went to school full-time that semester but ended up failing most of my classes because I was just not able to handle that load on top of depression. The Canadian long-distance boyfriend came to stay with me for roughly a month where I supported him as he had no job back home and had been living with his parents. Had I been smart I would have seen that the relationship was clearly toxic at this point, but I’ve always had a quiet sappy romantic side that had me wanting to believe that this “first love” was special enough to be the one.    In the fall I moved out of the apartment and transferred yet again, this time to a college where I could live on campus, but still close enough to home where I went back to my parents nearly every weekend. My mother was convinced I would do better in this setting, and to her credit my grades were all passing even though my heart wasn’t really in it. Many Many phone conversations later he (Canadian Boyfriend) convinced me to move out there with him so that we could be together. At that point he had gotten an overnight job and a small studio apartment that I had flown out for a week to visit so I honestly believed it was a logical next step.  Spring 2008- I packed up a single bag and two carry-ons and moved to Canada. Whether I believed it might not work out, or that I would be stopped by suspicious customs folk I can no longer remember, but I went there with a return ticket that went unused. While the relationship was okay in the beginning it quickly deteriorated. As I wasn’t a citizen I could not get a job, car or really anything else that required money so I was at his mercy when it came to pretty much anything. He insisted I have the same sleep schedule he did as an overnight worker and that pretty much killed any hope of a social life outside of him that didn’t involve the internet. Sex frustrated him as we were both virgins and he came to place that blame on me. While I was willing to work through everything, he was impatient and eventually decided it was all because I was not attractive enough for him. Yes, he would explain this to my face. Believing that I was indeed the problem I did my best to try to fit into that mold he kept claiming he wanted. But I came to learn that if I improved one thing he would quickly find another fault that MUST be why he wasn’t interested in me. He would pepper in romantic conversations saying I was beautiful and he didn’t know what was wrong with him and that he loved me in between all of this so I moronically stayed.    The six-month mark rapidly approached and I was told the only way I could stay any longer is if we got married. Believing myself in love I was for it, “If I really love you and want to be with you, why now?” I’d thought. We decided that was what we would do. He did not pop the question he just called me over to the computer one day to help him pick out wedding rings from a cheap site online. I convinced myself that that was what I wanted so it didn’t matter that it wasn’t romantic. We filed for a marriage license and a short time later I was informed by him that we’d be getting married a couple days later in a park because he had already booked the officiant. I bought a dress I hated from some outlet store (It was brown and black with some green but it was the only dress I could find in that store at a low price that looked ok on me.) So on a muddy day when the trees didn’t even have enough green on them to look nice I got married. The whole affair was almost as miserable as that evening when he wouldn’t have anything to do with me because he was too tired. My family and friends were confused and more than a little upset that they were not invited or even told when this was happening and some of them stopped talking to me completely because of it.   The rest of the time (Less than a year of marriage) I spent there is a dismal blur of fights about filing paperwork for citizenship (He procrastinated for EVERYTHING. The only thing he stayed on top of was getting married to I could extend my stay) or where he said hurtful things and me falling into a depression so deep I started sleeping away the time I didn’t waste playing video games and started to rationalize jumping off a local bridge to just get out. Multiple times I caught him having long-distance relationships, the final one I knew about was some 17-year-old from Texas who he told we were already divorced. After weeks of sleeping on the couch after learning about that one (Clearly it was my fault for not being able to hold his interest on a physical level and being a moody depressed boring person. Oh yes, he said these things to my face.) I broke down and called my mother and told her it was over and I needed to go home. This was almost a year exactly after we had gotten married. I remember being on the road and laughing like a crazy person when I realized it was out anniversary.   2009- My mother has her issues and we don’t always see eye to eye, but on this occasion, she came through so hard for me. She quickly got time off work and drove with my sister from South Dakota to Alberta in two days. When it was clear that she was showing up and not leaving without me my “husband” did a lot of back-pedaling trying to explain that I had been irrational in being so quick to find a way back home. She showed up and he left while I packed my things into my mother’s car. When we were finished he came back and kissed me goodbye saying he had no idea if he wanted me to come back again.  When my family and I got to the hotel I had received an e-mail from him saying not to contact him, he needed space, he would tell me when it was ok for us to talk again. I was very broken. After getting home I spent a month so shattered I lost 20 pounds from not being able to eat much. My mother helped me get my license back (it had expired in Canada) sort my school debts out (He had refused to pay any of my school bills because it didn’t affect us in Canada). I moved in with friends for a few months before moving back home. It was at this time that my Canadian “husband” had decided he wanted me back and that some of our troubles were actually his fault. I was angry, but usually heard him out. After falling into an old fight I just stopped taking his calls after I told him I wanted a divorce. He popped up on my doorstep not long after trying to win me back. He convinced me to give it another try but it came down to me being unable to trust him. So we were over. He said he would handle the divorce, it would be cheaper if he did it himself without a lawyer. At that point I was so scarred from the whole experience I didn’t believe I wanted to ever get married again anyway so I wasn’t overly concerned and agreed he could do it.    In October, when I had been living with them, my parents started going through a messy divorce. During that time, I kept my head down, worked a lot of hours and started planning to move out. My mother and siblings had moved out due to the divorce and I guess because I was an “adult” she just left me staying at the house with my dad. I’ve never had a good relationship with my father, he’s a very angry man, with a touchy temper prone to violent outbursts. (My mother had been so convinced he would react violently she told him via text message which my father made me read aloud to him when he got home) It was pretty fucked up. Time went by, life happened and a long-distance friendship blossomed into a romance and relationship by December.   February I flew out and spent a week with my new beau trying to just move on with my life. Nothing physical happened outside of making-out because I had been completely upfront and honest about my situation and he wanted to take things slow. After coming back to South Dakota I became much more interested in the progress of the divorce, but when I contacted my Canadian Ex I would get a lot of excuses and run arounds. He would make brief progress after I threatened to get a lawyer involved from my side but it never seem to stay on track.   Unhappy with my living situation it didn’t take long for the idea of moving out to the east coast to sound really appealing. Initially I had wanted to get my own place and build into the new relationship slowly, but making minimum wage and paying for some of my parents bills I didn’t have the means to amass the money for a down payment or rent for the first few month while I got settled. In 2010 I moved to Rhode Island from South Dakota and into my new boyfriend’s apartment.   Years later my Canadian Ex got my address and sent me papers declaring intention to divorce. He had told me I did not have to do anything and the divorce would go forward soon. I was so happy that I had thought it was finally over. That stupid raincloud was going to be off of my head and out of my life.  After this in 2013 my New Boyfriend attempted a proposal at Disney World. I say attempt because I was still so skittish to the idea of marriage that in a panic I yanked him off of his knee and walked forward like nothing happened. This naturally caused tension, but he was very patient and understanding about the whole situation.  After a lot of serious discussions and talks about our future he finally got the nerve to ask me to marry him again on May 25th of this year 2017. I said yes. After a few months of excitedly planning and dreaming what our big day will look like I’ve come to realize that the raincloud of my first marriage might not be fully gone. The last time I spoke to my Ex a couple years ago (AFTER he had send me the papers) he said he had messed something up and it was going to take awhile because it cost a lot of money. (Another excuse, he gave me this song and dance after telling me he was in an upcoming magic the gathering tournament, and that man never skimped on buying cards for his perfect deck)  My Future husband believes that I shouldn’t do anything. That there is no technical record of me ever being in the United states so I should just pretend like it never happened. I have always filed my taxes as single since moving back to the states and getting back into work so as far as the system knows and cares I’m single and I have always been.   While in Canada I didn’t file any taxes, I never paid any bills, had nothing in my name save for a single credit card where the Ex used my “married name” (I never filed for a name change but apparently the marriage certificate was enough to open a joint account in that name)  I don’t want my stupid decisions of the past to have any effect on my upcoming marriage or future life with the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.   Is there a way to figure out just where my Canadian Ex is in the process? Is there somewhere where I could get this information to see if it went through or just is stuck in limbo? Or do I need to find an attorney to get to the root of this?  Or would it be better just to follow my Fiancé’s advice and pretend it never happened? What possible legal backlash could this cause if any?  I feel a little slimy at the idea of filling out a marriage certificate saying I've never been married before, but if my last marriage is stuck in a hellish legal limbo trying to get that wrapped up with proof that it's legally over sounds like an expensive nightmare.   After over 6 years separated I just want this to be over.    Frankly I have no idea how to handle this situation moving forward. Contacting my Ex would likely only lead to another set of run arounds and excuses that give me no information whatsoever.  If you’ve made it this far I am extremely grateful, I did not anticipate this would end up being so long or so…all over the place.   If I have made anything unclear or you have any questions please ask. Thank you for your patience.	Yes
61	"[Throwaway for legal reasons]  Hello everyone,  As the title says. I'm looking to divorce my wife. I've been out of the military since June 2016 and am now on Inactive Ready Reserves. We got married in October 2014. In April of 2015, she gave me 6000 dollars to put down on my vehicle. While in the military and once I got out I have been financially supporting her while she attended college full time. I am working full time and going to school full time. In March of 2016 we co-signed a vehicle which I am the primary holder. We have two dogs. I have been paying all the bills  Move Forward to now. I have moved out of the house. The house is her aunt's. I met a woman who I kissed(which will be talked later). That's it. Now she found out, and is threatening to take me to court if I don't pay her back the 6000 dollars and pay for the damages the dogs did to the house. She is also threatening to call my commander and tell them I committed ""adultery"". I am receiving VA benefits, and a disability check which she wants to take away. She wants me to pay for her bills until they add up to the 6000 dollars plus the damages. I am just looking for the best way to handle this because I'm honestly unsure of what to do. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much."	Yes
62	Essentials: Ex had a dog before we were married. After divorce, she asked me (via saved text messages) to take care of said dog until she found a place that allows pets. 18 months later, and with only one attempt to visit the dog 14 months ago, she's moved to California. I'm renting at the same house since the divorce, and the ex provided the $500 pet deposit for the dog at my house. Assuming no further contact, what do I do about the deposit money when I move next year?	Yes
63	My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	Yes
64	My soon to be ex wife is divorcing me after we got into a fight after being drunk. She stated that she is not pursuing alimony. Could she pursue alimony for one incident that did not result in any impairment? We are meeting with an attorney where we both sit down and discuss terms this weem. Do I need to lawyer up on my own? We have no assets as we are in college. Just electronics and two cars and furniture. Any advice is appreciated	Yes
65	Hi all.  My lawyer is on vacation for another week, so looking for some general guidance until she returns. It looks like I may need to make some decisions before she gets back.   I live in Massachusetts and am in the middle of an uncontested divorce with my husband. We are selling our marital home and I will be buying a new one in my name only. It looks like the house sale and new purchase will take place during the divorce nisi process. Is there something I should do to protect myself when making an offer on my new place to prevent my soon-to-be-ex-husband from having a claim to the title?   Thanks!	Yes
66	Given that in my 23 years as their son, they've hated each other for just about every waking second. And me and my siblings have had to obviously put up with it. But for some unknown reason they just won't cut ties and get apart from each other. So I ask again: Is there some way I can force them to just end it?	Yes
67	"My ex-wife has agreed to reduce the amount of monthly alimony I give to her.. courts.ca.gov says:  ""If the spouses or domestic partners can reach an agreement on a new amount of spousal or partner support, they can write it up as an agreement/stipulation and give it to the judge for signature to have it become a new court order.""  I cannot seem to find anything that really explains how to DIY this process.  Any suggestions?  thanks!"	Yes
68	We married in 2016. She has about $50k in student debt. She has family about an hour, hour and a halfish from her school, where she also works part-time. We have split rent about 75%:25% since we moved in together.	Yes
69	"Sorry I've never poster in this sub so not sure if this is the right place.  My wife and I use to work together at the same small company years ago. I left there about 3 years ago for another job and my wife still works there. The company owner is a nice person but he used to do some subtle shady shit that made me think he was scamming people. A decade ago he asked me to photoshop and change some information on a contract that had already been signed by someone. Other weird things.  Anyways.  My wife calls me the other day to tell me what had happened at work that day. Her and another co-worker were trying to remember the owner's middle name because he was really embarrassed of it and they thought it would be funny to put it on some gag gift, so they started googling his name to see if it would pull up. On the first page of results, it showed some marriage records stating that the owner had just gotten married in 2006. Um thats weird. Owner, has been married to his wife since the early 90's. They even have two kids in college. Everybody at that office knows his wife (who is a financial planner) and she is very active at office events and friendly to everybody. Some of the older employees even went to their wedding in the 90's. She is very sweet and they are very loving to each other and don't seem to have any major problems in their marriage.   Scrolling down in the google results she finds divorce records for them in about the year 2000. My wife's co-worker starts to remember that years back, when she would check the office mail, that the owner would receive child support payment notices and she never really thought about it at the time. Everybody in this office is very close and would know if the owner had divorced his wife and remarried to her years later. My wife brought this info to her manager who has been an employee there since the owner started the company. She had been at their wedding in the 90's. She had house sat for them during this time they would have been divorced. Me and my wife even house sat for them while they would have been divorced. My wife's manager was weirded out about this whole thing and told her to delete her search history and not bring it up to anyone else.  So to get to my point: We are pretty sure the owner of this company and his wife (who is a financial planner at a large financial company) officially divorced on paper, kept living together telling no one, the owner paid child support to his ""ex"" wife to keep up appearances, and then secretly re-married on paper years later telling no one.   Is this some sort of tax scam? How could someone benefit from being legally divorced on paper from their spouse while still actually being married to each other and then secretly re-marry years later? I can try to get more details if it helps solve this mystery. Thanks"	Yes
70	I have been assisting a family member (the respondent) with a separtation. I have all correspondence and pleadings to date. Some letters and emails are between the respondent and the applicant's lawyer. Some are between the respondent (or myself) and the respondent's lawyer. Legally, can I make these letters, emails, and forms public online? The application, answer, reply, affidavits, and financial statements are part of a continuing record that is already a public record, is it not? And I have the respondent's (since all of this information was mailed or emailed to him or myself) permission to do so. We are hoping to change lawyers. Until we find a lawyer who is a better fit, I thought that by sharing all of this information online, anyone who has the time can read the information and offer advise. I thought there may be legal professionals who are retired, or suffer from insomnia :), who may be interested in helping. That is my reason for wanting to make this information public.	Yes
71	"Before I start, this is not about me.  I know a certain someone, let's call this person T, who just got married.. Let's call the person T is marrying ""SO"". Maybe like 3 days ago. NOBODY approves or know about this marriage, besides a handful of people. I found out that the ""SO"" cheated on T. There are a lot of other signs that screams NO to this marriage.   I'm wondering what are the consequences of T getting a divorce. What can T do so that there are a minimal amount of consequences for T? What are some advice for this fool?"	Yes
72	I was in jail when my wife divorced me. She got granted ownership of everything we owned, custody, child support, and alimony. I live in Wyoming where alimony is rare. I don't make very much money, I am a chef with two jobs barely making it. They are going to take 50% of my income to supplement the child support and alimony, making it even harder to survive. I cannot afford an attorney and the courts have no paperwork to reopen our decree based on alimony. I don't know what to do! I will always pay my child support, but the alimony is killing me! Please, if you truly know any viable options for me, I need help!	Yes
73	Can I get in trouble for anonymously registering a domain name (let's say janesmithsucks.com if Jane Smith was my ex) and publishing true things (I could all prove in court if needed) things about my ex wife. No pictures or revenge porn or anything like that, but needless to say though they would not be things that painted her in a positive light.	Yes
74	So I am divorcing first and foremost as a preface. Awhile back my soon to be ex wife setup her child support from her first child with another man to be deposited in my banking account. I have sole access and rights on this account still. There recently was a large deposit through the state enforcement office of back child support paid out to her that was deposited into my account. I won't go into detail why but am I in a legal state if I refuse to withdraw and give this money over to her? Yes it sounds scummy but I have my reasons. I just wanted to ask. Thank you in advance.	Yes
75	(Posting this for my uncle)  Some family friends (A&amp;B) have been taking care of their family member’s (C) children for the last 8-9 years. C has not helped A &amp; B with the children (age range 8-11) and has had very little contact with them. B has quite a few children, 1 of which they are responsible for (4 children in total). A &amp; B have decided that due to the financial burden &amp; C going back on the promise to help with the children, it is time to get proper custody of the children but they are unsure of where to start.   C’s home environment is not good due to C &amp; their spouse favoring the other children in the household, (spouse has 3 other children from another relationship) the children having to move schools, and C &amp; spouse tend to be abusive to the children and each other. A&amp;B have had guardianship of the children for the last 8-9 years, have taken them to all of their appointments, and been to all of their parent meetings with school and whatnot. The children’s teachers have never met C. C has stated before that if it’s too much of a ‘burden’ they can pick up the children and A&amp;B could wipe their hands of the situation. This is not in the children’s best interests due to them being treated badly in C’s household.   Where should A&amp;B start? A&amp;B are both older, and aren’t very wealthy. The children live peacefully with A&amp;B due to them not playing favorites and they were raised by A&amp;B. C has stated that they would help financially &amp; visit the children but have not done so. It has come to the point where the children don’t care for their parent and they don’t want anything to do with them. A&amp;B do not want them to go into a toxic environment nor have them lose out socially. I was giving them the advice to see if they could find a pro bono attorney, though I’m unsure if anyone would take this case. A&amp;B fear that the legal costs would burden the children &amp; them greatly. They are also scared that one day C will take the children away due to tax benefits and government assistance. That’s another reason that A&amp;B want custody (besides concern for the children’s wellbeing) C gets a good amount of government assistance but doesn’t help with their other children. Any advice is much appreciated.   TL;DR: A&amp;B have raised C’s children for the last 8-9 years. C isn’t helping as agreed. A&amp;B want custody. The 3 children don’t want anything to do with their parent (8-11 y/os) C probably has never heard of sterilization, at this rate they’ll have enough kids to start a baseball team.  (A&amp;B are grandparents/aunt or uncle to C’s children.)	No
76	My grandfather is 86 years old and stubborn and pretty much what the title says. He lives in his own room in my parents house where he has his own bathroom, he doesn't drive so my dad drives him to the grocery store for groceries.   He will not go to the doctor even if there's something wrong like he has a cold or something like that. He doesn't shower and lies to my parents and says that he does. He doesn't wash his bed sheets or clothes and he doesn't throw anything away. A lot of his shirts are stained with holes.   He has a mini fridge and freezer in his room, but he stores items on a shelf when they should be refrigerated such as mayonnaise and eggs.   I know my dad doesn't want to physically make him do things, what else can they do?   Can my parents get in serious trouble for letting this continue? Is this considered elder neglect?   Thank you	No
77	She just told me an hour ago (it is almost 3am) that she will be coming around 9am to my apartment to pick up the rest of her things and demands that I do not be at the apartment while she's there. She mentions that she is bringing someone to help her move. I don't know who this person is.   She is no longer on the lease, yet she is demanding I leave my own apartment or she's going to call the police. Is this right? I don't feel that I should have to leave my apartment because she doesn't want me there so her and some stranger and pick up the rest of her things. I don't feel comfortable as I don't know if she's planning on taking more than she's supposed to. What do I do? I challenged it and she threatened a police escort and I really don't want cops at my house.	No
78	Hello a bit of background information.  Me and my girlfriend are tenants at an apartment complex in Kansas. We have two cats and a dog and fully comply with their two pet limitations. We originally moved in with both of out own cats, but after my girlfriend moved several states over. I convinced her to see a therapist and her therapist suggested a therapy animal. She decided she wanted a puppy as she believed it would encourage her to go out more to combat her depression and anxiety. I have my cat, and she has her dog who is registered as an ESA and her cat. She has the documentation and everything for her ESA and is still seeing her therapist.  Two months ago we received note for an inspection regarding maintenance for fire alarms and the heater in our apartment. Upon inspection the landlord discovered our ESA dog and expressed concerns on how dirty our carpets we're and informed us that we need to find a carpet cleaner and provide a receipt and provide official documentation that our dog was an ESA. I understood and agreed that we were in the wrong because the lease we signed stated we must inform the landlord of any new pets in the apartment. The least we could do is clean the apartment. She stated she would follow up with a inspection two weeks later to see if we cleaned our carpets.  Two weeks goes by and we we're in our apartment all day and the landlord never arrived to inspect our unit. Concerned I made a call to the landlord who blantantly lied to me claiming that she sent someone to inspect our unit and claimed we never hired a cleaner. I obviously denied that happened and I had a receipt emailed to me from the carpet cleaner as proof.  My concern moving forward is what I can do, as we are receiving another inspection in the upcoming week with no reason behind why we are having our unit inspected. I feel as though our landlord is trying to encourage us to terminate our lease since they have no grounds to evict us. My biggest concern is that this time the landlord will lie or make up excuses and we will have no way to prove she is lying since neither of us will be present in the apartment all day.	No
79	Yesterday I got a speeding ticket going back home to Central Arkansas from a trip to Bentonville with my girlfriend. My car was totalled in a flood a few weeks ago, so we took her car, and she wanted me to drive back home. The officer clocked me going 91 in a 70 (which I don't exactly believe I really don't think I exceeded anything more than 87ish). Im 18 years old. My court date is September 11th in London, Arkansas, but I will be in college at UofA and at the moment I have no transportation to the courthouse. Most importantly, I have not told my parents about the ticket yet. Is there any way that they will find out if I don't tell them? The officer said something about asking the judge about waiving a civil penalty and the ticket won't go on my record. I know this post is a mess and confusing, TL;DR: I'm an 18 year old who was pulled over for going 21 over in girlfriend's car, need to know approximately how much the ticket will be, if my parents will find out, any advice about how to be prepared for my court date and how to make the ticket not go on my record.	No
80	My boyfriend has to pay child support to his child's mom. He paid through Western Union the first month (last month) as per the agreement, and the money was supposed to start being taken out of his check this month. They never told his employer to take the money out, did not send his child's mom a card to receive the money on, and now today is the day she's supposed to receive the money. She's badgering him and we're not sure what to do.   Should he send the money through Western Union today and have a copy of her signature saying she got it? What do we do if he sends the money today, but next week she receives a card and they take the money out of his check?  The Child Services number for the county she lives in has not been answering their phones, and she apparently didn't have gas to go up there to talk to them in person.   Redditors, please help!!	No
81	"I will have lived in this rental property 1 year as of August 18th. When I moved in last August he prorated my rent for the rest of the month, but my lease agreements of 6 months have always been from the original move in date which falls on the 18th of the month. I've been paying my rent on the 1st of the month since September of last year. This month I paid my rent as per our agreement (agreement says by the 3rd of the month without penalty) on August 1st which covers August 1st through August 31st. On August 7th my landlord emailed me a new rental agreement (without any prior communication about the new rental terms) along with a note that said the rent would increase from $650 to $670 for the next term (which starts august 19th basically). I told him then that I likely would be moving out.  In our text messages it's clear I was interested in doing this based on what he expected and I texted back and forth with him over the next few days asking various questions about the move out process and what his expectations were for me to leave on good terms. I even explicitly asked about prorated rent and deposit if I left on the rental agreement date of August 18th (since I've already paid this entire month of August). He said ""I can refund you the amount if you choose to leave during this month. It's 22 dollars per day"" and ""The deposit is for leaving the room in clean and great condition. Once I see the room I can send the deposit back through Venmo."" I will be leaving the room clean and in good condition regardless of how this ends. We had other various exchanges about me keeping him informed on whether or not I'd officially found a place. After our conversations I believed it was understood and ok for me to move out on the 18th without any loss of funds (neither deposit owed after inspection nor prorated rent money) and was actively looking for another place with a move in date of August 18th.   Today August 10th he texted me saying that since I didn't give him 30 days noticed in our lease he would not be refunding my rent for the rest of August. This blew me away and I texted him back and told him that I'm willing to abide by the terms of our lease, but I'm curious where that leaves me? My lease agreement says August 18th, but I've paid through September 1st. So I'm not sure what happens after the 18th? I live here for 13 days with no rental agreement or I move out and leave $280 dollars on the table? Can I get that money back? Even september 1st wouldn't be proper 30 days and I'm worried he will not refund my deposit because of it even though the room is in good condition? If this becomes nasty (which I hope it doesn't) do I have any rights legally if he takes my deposit out of spite? I have text messages showing my intent to leave on good terms, his respones to that, and this his flip flop 3 days later. Is the lease agreement the only binding thing here?  tl;dr landlord is increasing rent. I decided to move. I've paid through the end of the month, but my lease expires on the 18th. Do i get my money back, am I out of $280 dollars ($22 dollars per day), or do I stay for what I've already paid for? Can i sue him if he tries to keep my deposit and prorated rent after he failed to notify me of lease agreement changes in a reasonable time?"	No
82	Hey, the STBX and I have filed and we were hoping to take care of things ourselves, but I'm getting more and more nervous about some personal decisions she is making, and may need to try to get majority custody. Either my google-fu is weak or I'm having a bear of a time finding decent listings for divorce lawyers/mediators. Is there a website out there that has a comprehensive list of attorneys in my area? To be more specific I live in central Wisconsin, near the Wausau area.	No
83	I had an issue with a landlord I had at some point, so I took it to the Landlord and Tenant Board and got an order which says that he's responsible for paying me $695. The order was served to him, but he has just ignored it.  How can I get the court order enforced? I'm somewhat in a rush to do this because if it requires going through small claims court, I only have about one month to get things sorted out.  I can provide more information if needed. Thanks in advance.	No
84	First off, yes I was fucking dumb for agreeing to take the job at below minimum. Current minimum wage is 11.40/h in ON. My current rate is 11/h.   I'm really hesitant to speak to my boss (Also the owner of the business) about this, because he's kind of a dick. Type of guy who'd slash my hours for bringing it up.   I have signed a contract with him and plan on asking for a copy for my records tomorrow.   My ask is: How should I proceed? I really need to keep on with this job. I don't have anything else lined up right now.	No
85	Under our side of our duplex there's a little door that leads to the piping, heaters/boilers, machinery of both units. Under our unit, while inspecting it with the maintinence guy, my boyfriend found a large amount of black mold.  &amp;nbsp;  For one, we've already spoken to our landlord about our AC not working properly, and we're in Georgia in the summer, so this is about as pleasant as you'd expect. They sent someone out and supposedly fixed it. They did not. They then (also on the first visit)  pointed out that there's a leak in our washing machine, to which the second maintinence guy said is probably what caused the mold.  &amp;nbsp;  We took a few pictures of the mold, and I plan on sending our leasing company an email outlining these issues, as well as the fact that we've been running our AC under their assurance that it is working and it wasn't, running up our electricity bill. I will be asking them to re-reimburse us as well as either fixing this mold issue within 24 hours or that they need to house us at another property, or something to that effect, as we just got a two-month-old puppy a day before finding this out, and black mold (which is right under our bedroom) is particularly dangerous to infants. **I've even read somewhere that this may be valid grounds to break our lease without damaging our credit and even get some sort of 500-dollar civil fee from our landlord?** I don't care about the fee so much as leaving this place, because I honestly don't feel like they're going to fix this in a timely manner, and my boyfriend and I are beginning to feel signs of the mold's effects... we have no clue how long it's even been down there, but the side effects have been felt for a month or two now (chronic fatigue, chest compression/finding it hard to breathe, etc.) and my boyfriend and I are fit, and healthy, well under weights considered to be obese.  &amp;nbsp;  What can/should we do here?	No
86	"So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.  However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.  My question is, if Steve does not receive the TV (which is seeming incredibly likely) is there ANYTHING I can do legally? Is theft by deception even a crime in PA? I don't know if Jay and Sean are their real names even, but I have ""Sean""'s phone number and the text message where it was laid out that we were meeting up to exchange the money for the TV. And they can obviously check to see that Steve has not received the TV in the jail. It's just extra complicated bc everything between Jay and Steve and Steve and I was verbal obviously."	No

88	California.   I am a landlord in a rent controlled area, making it very hard to evict tenants.   One of my tenants has been doing repeated minor lease violations - changing internal locks, painting common areas and inside his unit, leaving items in the common areas. So far he has fixed these when I find out about them (without forcing me to give a 3 day cure or quit).   It is abundantly clear that he knows they were against the lease but also knows I cannot evict him for them and must give him a chance to fix them. He does not seem to have any intention of stopping.  Is there anything I can do about this?	No
89	First off, thank you for taking the time to read over my ordeal. Basically, I have a loose gravel driveway, and my wife and I are sick of tracking in dirt in the house. It’s seriously like a sandy beach in here. So I call around to a bunch of businesses, but I couldn’t find a concrete company to give me the time of day because everyone is slammed with business. Some companies were even sending me off with “I know a guy who knows a guy, his name is Jimmy, he might be able to help”. So I’m doing some more in depth Googling (Ha!), and I come across a website called Thumbtack. You type what it is that you need, and they send contractors your way. Too easy. I get a guy and he’s out at my house immediately that afternoon. He’s eager for the job, and quotes me $3975 for a new driveway. It’s 70 feet long, and 15 feet wide, with an additional slab on the side of our carport that is 20 feet long, and 4 feet wide. I couldn’t find a consistent number online that could give me a ball park price, so when Rudy comes out and gives me that price, I was pretty happy about it.    Rudy said he was brand new to Thumbtack, so that’s why he didn’t have any ratings, but that he was licensed, bonded, and insured (he insisted that he wouldn’t be able to operate without it). I was hesitant because Rudy comes off as a fast talker, but decided to give him my business because he is a fellow veteran, and he needs the work. No biggie, I’m happy to help someone in a tight spot. Rudy explained that the job would be easy as there is no tear up (of existing concrete), and he would “take care of [me]” by pouring it 6 inches thick, and giving me wire mesh which came with a 2 year warranty. He says he’ll get his Bobcat out here, and it’ll go by real quick. I agree, so he sends me a contract, and asks for $2050 up front for materials, along with some photos of work that he’s done. I know you know where this is going, hang tight.    I signed the contract and sent the money. Let’s go over the contract. What I linked is exactly what he sent. An MS Word, piece of hot garbage. They spelled my name wrong, spelled his name wrong, so I kicked it back and they fixed it, no biggie. Shortly after, he emailed me my receipt. He then calls me back and says that he needs $25 more to cover the credit card charges, fuck it, I’m excited to get a new driveway, so I agree (I know, just hush).     The next day (13JUL2017), Rudy and his crew are out at my house at 9 am sharp. There’s a cranky old guy who’s got something like 50 years in the business, and two Mexicans who speak like 3 words of English. Everyone was cool, the Mexican guys were like a slapstick duo, talking shit to one another, and the old guy constantly bitching about them under his breath. I eventually brought out coffee, ice water, and oranges because when I used to do construction (pool enclosures), it was nice to do work for a homeowner who cared. I quickly noticed there was a lack of aforementioned Bobcat, so no dirt was getting dug, and Hose A and Hose B (that’s how cranky old man introduced them) were filling up a cracked and warped Rubbermaid tub full of dirt and sliding it back and forth between the side of the house and filling in the driveway. Again, me being an understanding person, I assumed that Rudy had his Bobcat out at another project (which I was correct), so I allowed his crew to use all my tools and wheelbarrow to make things go faster. I didn’t mind because I knew forming wasn’t going to take all day, and they’d be done in a few hours.    About that time I notice cranky old guy laying down 2x4s. I walked up to him and asked him how thick the concrete was going to be. He said 4 inches. I said no, I signed a contract for 6 inches, and showed him. He said I’d have to talk to Rudy, because he wasn’t sure. So Rudy pulls up about 15 minutes later, and I ask him again about the thickness. He reassured me that the concrete would indeed be 6 inches thick, to not worry, because when it’s poured, it’ll “SINK DOWN”, and it’ll be 6 inches when he’s done. So I kept it in the back of my head, because it sounded like some cock and balls bullshit. Around 2 pm, the crew finishes forming up and Rudy walks up to me. He explains that, since the side of the house didn’t have any gravel like the front, it’s going to cost a little extra because he’s going to need more concrete, because it’s going to sink deeper into the soft ground back there. Ok, that one really threw up some red flags. That’s twice he’s asked for more money. I told him I would talk it over with the wife. What I really did was call around to about 5 different concrete companies. Each and every single one of them confirmed what I knew deep down inside: the guy is a scam artist, he’s taking me for my money, concrete sets at the thickness in which you pour it (i.e. it doesn’t sink), and that a contract is a contract, and I am not obligated to pay more than what I signed for.    So embarrassed and downright ashamed of myself, I go online to see what can be done legally with people like him. I click on an Angie’s List article dealing with concrete repair scams, and LOW AND FUCKING BEHOLD, there is the exact same picture headlining the article that he sent to me, which he claimed was a previous project of his. Now I’m really pissed. I look back over the photos and my receipts, and wouldn’t you know it, at the bottom of the receipt is where he forged my signature. It’s so blatantly obvious that it was forged, it’s down right insulting.    Here’s my conundrum: I’m no attorney, but I believe technically he hasn’t broken the contract yet because the concrete isn’t poured. It’s just 2x4s outlining the driveway. So I don’t think I have any ground to stand on by demanding my money back, do I? Either I want a complete refund, or I (reluctantly) want him to do the job that I paid him to do. I’m planning on calling him first thing tomorrow morning and recording the conversation. I called the bank, and they said they can open a dispute and refund me my money, but the ultimate decision would be left to the case manager as to whether or not I’m in the right (seeing as how I willingly agreed to give this person my money).  Before he left, Rudy asked if he could finish the job on Monday because he had to go to Miami for the weekend, and couldn’t coordinate the cement trucks until late Friday night. So I said yes, that’s not a problem. He also asked me to call him later that night to let him know about the extra charges, and what I wanted to do. So I called twice and no answer.   What are my options?    [The Contract] (http://imgur.com/a/FPP5O)	No
90	Hi guys, I crossposted this on r/realestate &amp; r/homeowners but this subreddit was recommended to me as well. It's a strange situation, and we can't figure out who to contact or what to do to buy this house. We've never owned a house so it's all very confusing to us!  Yesterday, we watched a video about adverse possession, and a house that is in his parents' neighborhood came to mind: the common consensus is that a couple bought it from the developer when it was built (2003), lived in it for a year, then disappeared and it's been abandoned ever since. This is in Virginia, btw, and it's never been put up for sale.  We went yesterday to go look at it and there is a key lock on the door and signs from Wells Fargo saying that it was winterized in 2011. Otherwise, the trim is rotting off, the siding is moldy, etc. We asked the neighbors about it, and they said that they moved in 2 years ago, but the house has been abandoned for 5-6 years as far as they know. They said sometimes the bank comes to mow the grass and check the windows and door, but otherwise no one goes in it. We suspect that it's not the bank that does this but the HOA. We were able to look inside in the dining room/kitchen, and there's a few things strewn everywhere - a blanket on the floor, one picture left on the fridge, and literally all the cabinets open and empty.   We got the number off the notice and it led us to Wells Fargo's real estate division. The guy said that they don't own the house and that he couldn't find any record of it. So, we went to the court house to see who owns it.   It's still listed under the original owners, whose address is listed as a PO box in a different city. We were able to find documents about the house, and this is where it gets confusing. The documents state Bank of America as the trustee, who then signs it over to Wells Fargo, who then signs it over to ReconTrust, who then signs it over to Orlan. The last two are debt collector firms. At first we thought the house was indeed foreclosed (but why never put up for sale?), and so we called Orlan to find out how to buy it. Orlan told us they sold it in 2014, and they couldn't tell us anymore. We came to realize that they had just sold the mortgage, but the house was still in possession of the original owners.   The most recent documents are from the HOA releasing a $1000+ lien on the house back in 2014, made out to the original owners, whose address listed at that time was a smaller townhouse in the same neighborhood (wtf?). We went to that house and they no longer live there, if they ever did. But if the lien was released, the owners must have paid it, right?  Soooo, then we decided to see if perhaps the property tax was back paid and if we could buy the house from the county, since obviously no one was taking ownership of the house. I called the tax collectors, who told me that the property tax was all paid up to date by a loan servicing firm. I called them, and the lady was surprised by how long the house had been abandoned for, but she couldn't tell us why the firm was paying for the property tax - she said it was perhaps escrowed into the mortgage.   She told us to check with the county and see how long houses can legally be vacant for, but we're worried that if the county goes and assesses the property and decides that it is abandoned and can be auctioned off, we won't be able to afford it at auction. It's worth $500k+ and our budget is $350k. We did as much free research as we could online to find the original owners, but they seem to be ghosts. They're in their 60's now, though, so the lack of social media presence is understandable. Adverse possession is also out of the question since the property tax is paid.   At this point, I'm going to try to reach out to the HOA today to see if they have any contact number for the owners, but it seems like reporting the house to the county is the best option to free it up. But, does reporting it risk the fact that it may go to auction and we won't get it? Or will the county perhaps allow us to make an offer first? Can the county even do anything if the taxes are paid and it has a listed owner? We're entirely unsure if we should just give up or continue looking into this.   Tl;dr 6yr+ abandoned house's ghost owners live elsewhere and may still be paying the mortgage, property taxes are paid up to date by another firm, mortgage has been sold several times, house is rotting &amp; HOA put a lien on it that has since been released. How do we buy it?  Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. If anyone knows any other subreddits where I can xpost this for more advice, it would be appreciated as well.	No
91	"The flooring in my apartment is laminate/wood and there is an area that has either a stain or been stripped such that I cannot get it clean. My landlord wants to replace the panels and charge me $600-800. I would like to do the work myself and pay for materials only, but she said she is not comfortable with that and requires a professional. My main question is, does she have that right, or do I have the right to fix it myself?  Possibly relevant: I honestly have no idea what this stain is from. It looks like something spilled and then dribbled towards the middle of the room, but I am certain I didn't spill anything there and the ""dribbled"" part grew over several months (no I didn't tell my landlord when I first saw it, yes, I know I should have). My fiancé (also lives in this apartment) thinks maybe there is damage from underneath, but not sure how we would prove that and if it would still be our fault anyway.  Thanks in advance for your advice."	No
92	We haven't been looking for a place at all and in our area it is very difficult to find a place to live. Our plumbing fucked up a couple weeks ago and it was supposedly fixed but our landlord is saying it wasn't fixed all the way and that is why she is kicking us out. any advice is welcome because we are freaking out right now	No
93	Apartment complex would like me to leave a month before contract expires. Contract ends august 31, they want me to leave this weekend, and they told me today. Apparently they have a new resident for August. Might clerical error. What do I do?	No
94	I make 400 a week now. Rent is 604. No one to ask for help, don't really care though. More worried about how to not be homeless, you know? Can I take a loan or something? Papers were served today. Already wrote the letter and made a copy to send both as requested.	No
95	Hi /legaladvice  My dad died last week. He was too young. All of the funeral services and arrangements are complete and the family has gone home.  Now we're starting to get into dealing with estate stuff. Bank accounts, retirement fund, social security, car titles, etc. I think that we have most of the major things noted to take care of, but what are some of other things that people don't really think of where I should keep an eye out? What sort of unexpected hurtles may I face that I should be aware of?   We have his will and it names my mother the executor of his estate.	No
96	My sister has been bouncing around from place to place for the last eight years. She had my nephew five years ago when she was living in a very rural part of North Carolina, and spent some time in various communes or squats elsewhere in the US.  For a good amount of that time, she was with this guy “David.” David is not my nephew’s biological father but he’s as good as. My sister and David also have a 4-month-old daughter together. She was born in Washington and also doesn’t have a birth certificate.  For medical reasons, my sister decided to return to civilization. She, David, and the two kids have been living with me while they sort things out.  But I/we honestly have no idea how to legalize the kids’ existence. I’ve been talking to David and my sister about it, but it’s overwhelming and there’s no money for a lawyer or anything.  There's basically no record of either kid. No schools, hospital visits, etc. The only thing is a recent emergency room visit for the 5-year-old (which is what prompted the return to civilization in the first place).  My sister was born here in Massachusetts, but there’s no record of her residency at the approximant time of either kid’s birth. David is legally allowed to be in the US but he’s not actually a citizen. Again, there’s no record of his residency at the time of either kid's birth.  David and my sister aren’t married though they’re open to a city hall wedding if it makes the paperwork/immigration easier. David has also said he wants to put his name on the 5-year-old’s birth certificate as well, and I’m not sure if that makes things easier.  The goal is to get both kids birth certificates, get the 5-year-old in school for this fall, get medical insurance/care for both kids, and eventually get them passports so they can meet David's family.  We’re anticipating a lot of legwork on this but we don’t even know where to start.	No
97	Backstory:  Bought my home in Aug 2016.  This is a Phase 2 of a 3 phase development.  There is about 40x40 feet of common area between my property and a drainage ditch.  (see photos at bottom of post)  When I bought the property I was told by my builder that the area would be maintained and sodded to look nice and maintained by the HOA.  Fast forward to March of 2017.  We've engaged the developer and HOA to find out when this common area was going to be developed.  It was basically a wild grass field and was causing weed problems on my property and looked awful.  No response to multiple inquiries.  In May, the developer calls me and asks if I want to take over control of the property with an easement.  They would level and SOD it and extend my water/sprinkler system on to it.  I'd have to water, mow, edge, weed control, everything.  I politely declined and told them it was common area and needed to be handled by the HOA and Developer, including setting it up correctly and maintaining it.  It's already expensive to water and maintain my property, and I'm not paying to maintain HOA controlled property.  Another 2 months pass, we've been going back and forth.  I offer to let them use my water if they pay me for it and they need to maintain the lot.  The developer thinks that's ok and says he'll get back to me.  I speak to one of HOA board members and she said its not fair to compensate me for water and other common areas (Common areas behind property) are maintained at home owners expense if they want anything beyond mowing.  I told her I felt that was a poor decision and because the property is on the SIDE of my home and attached to my property it looks like MY PROPERTY and thusly if they don't properly setup this lot it makes my property look bad.  Regardless, I was ignored.  A week later, without notice, they come out and level the lot and hydroseed it.  No water hooked up to it, nothing.  2 days later, we have a storm blow through (common for OKC) and 25% of the hydroseed blows away.  Keep in mind, Common areas attached to the side of a property in our development are all SODDED with water hooked up to maintain it.  Phase 1 is like this in every case.  The two pictures attached are from May 24th and July 17th, 3 weeks post Hydroseeding.  The lady at the HOA isn't responding to me.  I'm ready to call the developer, but wondering if I should just wait until November at the HOA annual meeting to file a formal request to fix.  My options as I see it today are:  1.  redo the entire lot myself (over my dead body) 2.  Wait until November and file a formal request to fix the lot and setup water on it + RESOD. 3.  Hire and attorney and send a demand letter to resolve and if ignored, file suit to force them to resolve.  Pictures:  http://imgur.com/a/Uyqtd    Thanks in advance, Mackie	No
98	My parents decided they wanted to move closer to their youngest grandkids. Before getting a realtor they asked their neighbors if anyone wanted to buy. One of their neighbors (let's call them the Smith's) was very interested. Due to some financing issues on the Smith's part, the moving dates were agreed upon fairly suddenly. Since my parents were building a house, they had to rent until the house will be done. They asked the Smith's if they could store some tools and other things in the outbuildings. The Smith's said it was fine. There was no length of time discussed, but the Smith's knew my parents were building, and that the house would likely not be finished until the end of summer.   My parents discussed storage with my sister, and found they were able to store some stuff in my sister's outbuildings. They made arrangements with the Smith's to get some of their items. When they got there, there were some areas blocked off that my parents had items stored in. They also found some big items missing (lumber, copper wire, etc). The Smith's claimed to know nothing. My parents packed up bins that were stored there that had tools and other items, along with the last of the machinery and brought it to my sister's house. When going through the bins, my dad found almost all of the more expensive tools he had stored in them were now gone (routers, heat  guns, etc). Again, the neighbors claim no knowledge. The latest, that had my mom in tears, when they tried to pick up my mom's garden art and planters, they're also missing. Many of these items were given by family over the years, and are irreplaceable.  A few points... -the house my parents sold is in the middle of nowhere. They lived there 20 years and never had anything stolen. -we've known the neighbors for many years. There have been a few issues here and there, but nothing to suggest they'd behave like this.  Is there anything we can do to get my parents stuff back (or replacement value)? Many of the items my parents were planning on using to work on their house. Any suggestions are welcome.	No
99	Backstory,  we've been married 14 years.  We/He just bought our first house in another state.  We are moving with the intention of getting divorced in the next year. He agreed to move to my home town but said if he decides to purchase and not rent, he wants  me to not fight him for the house in the divorce.  I haven't worked significantly in the last several years to care for our daughter.   Will this document he wants me to sign hold up in court? I have no access to any money to hire legal help I'm not sure if I should sign.	No
100	The landlord for my house is in another state and is my father. As such, I tend to handle most of the operations for the house. The bills are all in my name (Internet, water, electric), and so I go ahead and pay them and have my roommates pay their share. I have a receipt book, and my roommates who are about to move in are requesting receipts for them paying their share. How do I go about this so that I don't get myself into trouble?	No
101	All of the following events took place within the last week. I live in a gated student living apartment complex for university kids. From the end of July to August is move out and in. I was moving out of one house to another in the same gated complex. I got permission to move into my new house one day early (Thursday) from one of the ladies who works in our front office (I'm not quite sure her official position but she basically deals with the kids and obviously has some authority, I will call her Sam just to help keep track. Sam gave me permission but said I'd be working around cleaners, I was fine with that. So I move some of my stuff in early, approximately one fourth, not seeing anybody at all. I left a note saying this was my stuff and I had permission to move in early. The next day, Friday, I return and all of my things have been moved into the bathroom and new carpets put in. I didn't end up moving much more stuff Friday because I thought they might've wanted the stuff left there to finish cleaning. Early Saturday, I drove by and saw Mexican cleaning ladies going in and out, I decided to wait to move my stuff so I wouldn't be in their way. When I finally returned Saturday, all of my things had been moved downstairs by the door and several valuables were missing (unopened basketball shoes, gear vr, old phone, my girlfriend's dog bet etc.. basically just things that were obvious you would take to make money on or keep for yourself). I contacted Sam immediately and she came over, apologized and promised to get a hold of the cleaning company. Sunday morning I emailed Sam and told her I was going to file a police report. She showed up at my old house with one of the people that would be moving in (there are several per house, I was the only one in my new house so far though). She told me that basically she had been trying to get a hold of the cleaning company all that time (Saturday-Approximately Noon Sunday) and that they didn't want me to file a report because the cleaning ladies were illegals. I was understanding and she said the guy who they worked for would move some money around and have it to me by Wednesday (today). Come today I email and ask about my money, instead of Sam replying, it is another lady in the office and she tells me to come in to talk to her. I go in and they basically blind side, me tell me to file a report, tell me they won't give me names of employees who were in my apartment that day (I'll have to get them from the company, who they hired independantly), and take me on a legal roundabout basically just trying to cover their butt. I got a bit upset and obviously when I brought up the fact that they knowing hired illegals she ignored it. I'm not sure if I can make an insurance claim because I hadn't switched the address yet, but frankly I don't want to. What is my legal recourse against the apartment complex. I have a friend who was in the room when Sam said they were illegals and he is willing to testify. Getting my money back for my things would be nice, but I would much prefer revenge for how they handled the whole situation and lied to me.	No
102	Ok, so the deal is my previous real estate agent wants me to pay for damages to one of the doors in my previous house. This has been a tiresome issue because the damage was ALREADY PRESENT when I had begun the lease. Being a young, ignorant first-time renter, I had neglected to bring this up, thinking that the agent already knew the damage was there.   Apparently not. Now, the landlord wants me to pay over $1000 to fix this door that I had no part in damaging. I understand now that it was my responsibility to bring this up when the lease began, but since the damage wasn't brought up in subsequent inspections, I assumed it was already a known issue.   My question: would it be adequate to write and sign a statutory declaration before a witness to prove that I was not responsible for the damage, and that it was already present when I moved in?   Would this be acceptable evidence to provide?	No
103	"I recently moved out of Tacoma for work and had to break my lease early. I understand that I am responsible for the rent until they find a new tenant but the law only says ""reasonable attempt.""   I moved out two weeks ago and cleaned the place way better than it was when I moved in (3 months before) but they have not posted a listing for the apartment yet. The WA landlord tenant act says they don't have to drop everything and post it right away but they do need to make a reasonable attempt.   At what point can I stop paying rent because they are not doing anything and how would I go about it? I assume there is some process other than just stopping payments (which would probably not end well for me).   Side note - They are borderline slumlords that don't take care of the properties or fix problems. The place was infested with mold that started creeping back in after I moved in and I am very happy to be out of that place."	No
104	Long story short.. divorced 2 yrs. minor child lives with me alone. No contact from ex in over 2 yrs. he has recently started emailing me asking for pictures of child. My Atty advised I should send. He has increased requests to every month and now every week for the past three. Each email he is trying to get me to converse with him, &amp; makes references to our past relationship. I only respond with pictures, no conversation. I had pfa against him which expired and was not able to be renewed because he moved out of state. My question is what is reasonable for asking for pictures? I mean come on, appearance isn't going to change month to month and I feel that he is just using as an excuse to try and get me to talk to him. I feel like it's just more emotional abuse and harassment.	No
105	"Roommates and I moved out and the landlord is asking for money for repairs to damages because the deposit we provided prior to move in is ""not enough"". Are we legally obligated to pay her the deficit? Below is the list she compiled and she is claiming that we owe her ~500. Do we need to pay her for the cleaning and wear and tear that she listed? We live in the state of CA. She charged us 1600 in the beginning, how are we supposed to know what 1600 covers and that the damages she's claiming are worth $470?  List: https://i.imgur.com/v6Cr3Zj.png"	No
106	Got caught with a drink at a bar and i'm underage (18) the cop took me outside, wrote up a citation and left a number for me to call for a diversion program before she sent me on my way. I was also given a court date. If that number can't help me and I go to court, what punishment should i expect? Do i need a lawyer? I violated section 4301-69(e). Feel free to ask questions if i left anything out. A friend bought the drink and I had no fake on me	No
107	In May, I hired a moving company (Company A, located in FL) to move me from WI to NJ. Our contract stated that they would move me on the 19th or the 20th of May. I (stupidly) paid $520.00 as a partial payment.   On May 19th, I get a call from someone identifying himself as a dispatcher, saying they will be picking up my stuff on the 20th in the afternoon and will call me before they come. The 20th comes and goes with no call until 10:30pm at night saying they will be there in the morning of the 21st. At that point, I had already scrambled and hired other movers because 1) they never showed up and 2) I could only pay by cash or money order which was super sketchy to me.   I called Company A and told them what happened and that I wanted my $520 back. They told me they would call me back. Unsurprisingly, they never returned by call, my multiple messages, or my emails and even stoped answering my calls.    I disputed the charge with BOA a few days after the 20th of May. I was notified today that they are closing the claim and not returning my money. They said that Company A did not break our contract because they subcontracted the move to Company B, and it is Company B that did not pick up my stuff at the date range specified in the contract.    I feel like it's not a large enough amount of money to hire a lawyer, but it's not an insignificant amount and I'd like to get my money back from this shady moving company. I'm angry that Company A did not tell me they were subcontracting and that they refused to return any of my multiple communications. They've also never provided any contact information or even a name for Company B.    In terms of next steps, I'm planning on writing a letter to the claims department to get them to return the $520. Is there anything else I should do to get my money returned?	No
108	"Would welcome your advice if I need to see a lawyer as well, and if so, what type.   I live in Virginia, and was driving in a construction zone in Washington, DC.  There was a flash and a camera recorded me speeding.  A $100 ticket was mailed to me.  However, due to health issues, I just opened my mail, and I missed the original deadline, so now the fine is $200.     But DC offers this option ""Admit with Explanation"" where I admit liability and explain by mail or in-person. An examiner will review my explanation and consider reducing my fine.     However, I can't tell if my insurance would increase if I admit fault.  This is my first speeding ticket EVER. I can write that I have a clean record and this was unintentional.  Should I mention my medical issues for my delayed response?  How do I find out if my insurance rates will increase if I admit to this ticket?  Thanks."	No
109	I'm 20 and am expecting to go to trial. I had to get a police report in before I could have my car get towed after my collision in which I took a breathilizer and managed 2 points below a dwi (0.06). I have to show up in court in a month.  So now I'm wondering what first steps I should take before the court case's consequences such as getting my license suspended, getting a restricted license etc.	No
110	Hi all,  I met with an escort at a hotel she was residing in. I went to her room and she met me in a towel, as I requested, and then she kissed me following me entering the room. She asked for her money and I told her I had none. She then proceeded to kick me out. As I was driving away she texted me my licence plate and told me she would call the police. I told her I would contact the hotel she was staying in and she told me to kiss goodbye to my car.  Any legal advice?  Extra Info: I texted her the day before asking for a 30min meet. I intended to meet her at this point. In the morning she didnt reply and I assumed it was off, it was only an hour before she confirmed. I requested a certain outfit from her but I didn't intend to carry out any services because I felt I was doing something wrong, so I brought no money. I do not know what brought me to her residence.  Truthfully guys, I'm kinda scared of this getting out and she has my licence plate for my car.  - I am new to this sub, so please help me if I have made a mistake anywhere, thank you.	No
111	"We didn't have lawyers and went the mediator route, everything was pretty standard and even got a little more than most. I pay 20% for child support, I get him all summer, every weekend and Thursdays, most holidays, rotate Christmas break etc.   We live in Central Texas and she is in school. When we were deciding where she could take him the options were this and surrounding counties or 'without regard for geographic location'. I didn't want to rule out Dallas and Austin since those are her best bets for work, that was the discussion we had and that was the understanding when I signed it - certainly no word about moving out of state. Now, however, she's threatening to move to Connecticut and laughing at me for being stupid and signing it - which....she isn't wrong. I was trying to think about her finding a good job so my son would have a decent place to live. Now it seems ""I've made a huge mistake"".   We only have the custody and child support agreement at this point and neither of us have filed for divorce (she needed an operation and my insurance so we waited for that to be over with).   What are my options in getting that one part changed in the custody agreement? Is that something that will be revisited when we get to the actual divorce? I'm retired military so I don't have a whole lot of money for a lawyer but if it's my only option is there anything I can ask for specifically to cut down some of the costs?"	No
112	*DISCLAIMER* I did not hit/run over/injure anyone. No accident occurred. This post is purely out of curiosity.   Tonight I was driving on a very busy highway in my town. I was going about 5 under the speed limit, but some homeless guy was on the grass median and then walked in the middle of the highway as I was going 60 MPH. Luckily I noticed him from about a mile away so I was already slowing down, I was going about 35 MPH when I honked at him and skidded to a stop. I was probably 10 feet away from him when I stopped. I was not under the influence of any substance. The sun was still out.   Let's say I didn't see him/couldn't slow down enough in time and hit him. Would I be liable? I have full coverage insurance and have no instances on my driving record. I was pretty shook up about almost hitting him. I keep thinking about what would have happened if I injured or even killed him.   Once again, nothing happened (thankfully), I am just wondering how this kind of thing usually goes down.  Thanks for the input.	No
113	Hey everyone. I'm not sure where to look for information, or what to search for. I've tried a bit, and found some information, but not complete.   So here's the situation.   I'm 8 months pregnant, my husband went to work for a company to go tree planting for a couple of months.   Turns out it's a shitty company and he wants to leave early. He told the boss that he needs to come back to help me, as I'm on sick leave currently.   His boss said two things that are making me scratch my head.   1. He needs me to provide a sick note detailing why I'm sick and what's wrong with me. I told my husband that in the note I provided my employer, it didn't say anything about why I am sick, just that I am sick and that I will be off work from this date until this date.   2. Then he said that if my husband leaves now, instead of paying per tree, my husband will get paid minimum wage for the hours worked. My husband also said that he can stay for one more week.   My husband doesn't have a copy of his contract, and will talk to his boss tomorrow to get a copy.   I'm just wondering about the legalities of leaving a contract early, and if the boss can change the rate of pay in this situation.   Also I tried looking into family sick leave in MB, and I found a phone number I can call to ask more. Unfortunately tomorrow is Sunday and I may have to wait until Monday to call.   Also if he is in a different province, what provinces labour laws should he be following, assuming this company is a MB company?   Thanks in advance.	No
114	Hi /r/legaladvice Partner and I are looking at settling for a brand new place tomorrow. Unfortunately it is not ready to live in with a number of issues that still require a clean up. The vendors (also the builders) have stated they will fix it up when they return from their holiday on the 22/7. I have this in writing via email. Would it still be advisable to withhold an amount of settlement? Is there any legal obligation for them to make sure everything is fixed up? My solicitor had informed me that if I trust the vendor I can let it be sorted out. I was also informed that I may request for them to pay the necessary costs for me to fix up the property, if this has not been completed within the defect rectification period.	No
115	"and i qoute   ""Your unit was professionally cleaned prior to your move in. We expect it back in the same condition with confirmation via a receipt or invoice from the cleaning service used. Please e-mail the receipt or invoice to""  It does not say this is mandatory anywhere in our lease. We moved in and the place was filthy. We complained and they sent a cleaning service. We didn't explicity request it ourselves."	No
116	So I got a mechanic's lien from a company that didn't do work on my property...but is owned by the same guy whose company DID do work on my property. We are in a dispute over the technicalities of the work...and an inspection done by 2 third parties may have elucidated he committed fraud which is why I'm hesitant to pay at this moment (coupled with the fact that he billed stuff my insurance denied and I cannot afford at the moment), but that's besides the point. The point is, we signed a contract that said he couldn't put a lien on my property prior to the work being done. Now he's filing the lien on behalf of this second company. Can he do this? Also, one thing that I thought about, can he say that he transferred the debt from company A to company B? In court, are there ethical considerations that could defend me considering it's the same dude that owns both of these companies?   &amp;nbsp;  I'm gonna lawyer up soon but I literally cannot sleep over the fact that I may lose my home...and it's making me sick to my stomach.	No
117	While delivering at work in my personal car.  I was involved in an accident that was not my fault.  I had the right of way and the other driver was cited at the scene.  Law enforcement came and I went to the hospital for minor  injuries I sustained in the accident.    If the other driver is completely at fault will my ability to accept pay out be at risk since I was delivering in my personal vehicle?	No
118	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
119	Hey guys it's me again with an update. I wasn't sure how to go about this - please excuse me if this is not correct. Update is at the bottom of the post for those that might remember it (the post was 2 weeks ago).    Hello /r/legaladvice. Please forgive me in advance for any formatting errors that will occur. As well as spelling errors - currently bumming WiFi from my wife's work :)   So now a little info. I live in Arkansas. I'm recently employed at Walmart (Jun. 12) was my hire date. And we went through orientation (by the way we was told we were getting paid for that). I attended orientation I know for sure Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 2-11 with an hour lunch. Walmart pays biweekly so I was hired the Monday before this last pay period (Jun. 15). Today (Jun. 29) was our payday.   Now when you first hire on with Walmart, I was told you're hired as part time. Which I am working 4 days a week 2-11 shift with an hour lunch. There for I should be earning at least 64 hours ( most of the time I clock out +15mins after my shift - since I've been hired I've worked an hour past my shift 3 times and one time I clocked out at 1:05 a.m) every two weeks.   But now here's the thing. My paystub only shows I worked 47.64 hours the past 2 weeks. 17 the first week and 30 the next. Which this is absolutely wrong.   Since I was hired the Monday before payday. Those hours should be added on along with the 2 - 32 hour work week as well as those times I've work past my shift.   Also do part time employs gain over time if they have worked over 40 hours (or 80 hours in my case ?)  I'm not as much as worried about the overtime. I really want to know why I was paid for 64 hours + the hours I attended orientation.   Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I'm working for a corporation like this. I plan on going to personnel in the morning and asking to see the hours I've clocked in. Because it's wrong on my paystub.   Thanks y'all. Have a great one.   [UPDATE]  I received another paycheck via the Wal-Mart money this past Thursday (July 13th). I only had 40 hours the past 2 weeks (according to Wal-Mart). Which I was scheduled for 64 hours the past two weeks. I've been there everyday that I was scheduled. And that's not including the times I've clocked out at 11:30 or later). I'm seriously debating giving them my 2 weeks notice. Something is not adding up.   To be honest, during orientation I over heard some of the salried managers speaking about the overtime workers were getting and that it was costing them too much. Or something to that affect.  My question is now - could they be doing something with my hours to cover that up? I know I'm only part-time but still..  Forgive me if that is a silly question. I've never dealt with this type of stuff. I've farmed all my life and always received a paper check. So all this is pretty new to me.  So can someone (anyone) please give me a little more advice I would greatly appreciate it. As I'm in a tight spot right now. And I don't know what to do.   Thanks yall. Have a good weekend	No
120	Howdy everyone,  So here is the setup. My wife and I bought a new home several months ago. The exterior needs to be scraped and repainted, so we hired a painter to perform the work. The painter started scraping earlier this week, and our crotchety neighbor has been threatening the painter and us that he will sue if there is any paint found on his cars.   The cars in question have all flat tires, plenty of rust, and moss growing on the roofs, but they are parked in his driveway which is next to our property line.  The painter offered to cover the cars in plastic while he is painting, but the neighbor aggressively told him to stay off his property.  The painter says he can do the work without any paint on the cars, but in case the crazy neighbor actually goes through with a lawsuit, is there anything that I should do in preparation? We've taken photos of the cars before any of the work started, and the painter is fully licensed, bonded, and insured.  Thanks for the help!	No
121	Hi there! I'm seeking advice. My husband, sister, and I are applying together to rent a condo. All three of us have great credit history, and our combined income is well over 3x the rent. My husband and I have good rental history. However, my sister is currently in her first living arrangement not with my parents. She's living with my friend-- whose original roommate picked up and moved to Germany a few months into their lease-- as a subtenant. However, I just found out that my sister and friend never made her subtenancy official. Their lease explicitly forbids subletters without written permission from the landlord.  Wtf am I supposed to put on our current condo application? What kind of legal trouble could she and my friend get in? How do I represent my sister's situation on our condo application without falsifying information? Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. :)	No
122	So, my girlfriend's ex was abusive and manipulative both emotionally and monetarily.  He is now sending her unsolicited text messages and generally harassing her.  She also needs to pick up some things from his apartment.  What is the best course of action for her?	No
123	My roommate and I signed a lease for an apartment (September-September) in Nova Scotia two months ago. Now, almost a month before we're supposed to move in, she tells me out of the blue she cannot come live with me, she has to stay at home. Her (completely legitimate) reason being she is incredibly sick, her mental and physical health issues have caught up with her, and she has to stay home near her doctors until January at the very earliest. Long story short, she has no other option but to break her lease - the lease we signed together.  From what I understand, since we signed the lease together, if she breaks it, then I am forced to break it, too. If I do that, I have to pay a $300 fine as well as pay monthly rent until new tenants can be found. My other option would be to break it, re-sign it, and be on the hook for my rent as well as hers, unless I find a new roommate. A third option would be to find a new roommate and just sublet my old roommate's room. But, seeing how I apparently need to give a month's notice for a sublet, I have two days to find a new roommate (which is an incredibly difficult, if not impossible, task, especially when I do not live in Nova Scotia and cannot meet potential roommates in person).  My question is this: are my three options I outlined flawed / false in any way? Do I have any other options that I haven't considered, that might be better alternatives? As my roommate is dumping all this on me with such short notice, do I have any protections? Or am I completely and royally screwed?	No
124	"Texas.  Spouse out earns me by double. Just found he has not paid the mortgage in 3 months. Trying to force a short sale (mortgage is not in my name , house has joint deed).   I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about ""taking someone out."" When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality. I am an educated professional and a bit disgusted with myself that I allowed this to happen.  Maybe some of that is not relevant, i'll admit I am not thinking clearly. Fundamentally, what can I do about the house???"	No
125	"I need help. Throughout the month of July, I found it pretty difficult to breathe in my apartment. I thought maybe it was due to my nose surgery about a year ago (after stupid accident). I found it odd that I hadn't had any nose complications until then, but I figured a bone had suddenly moved or something.   A week ago, I woke up and it was surprisingly easy to breathe. It was great. There was some construction going on outside my apartment, but I thought nothing of it. A few hours later and they were still working. I wondered how long it would be - a day long project or weeks? So I called my landlord and asked what they were doing. He just said they were ""fixing something with the gas"". He was also surprised to hear that I was already back from visiting my parents.   This whole week I've been able to breathe normally. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but do you think the gas issue had anything to do with my difficulty breathing? I don't have knowledge about different kinds of residential gases that can affect breathing. The only one I can think of is carbon monoxide and if that was the issue, wouldn't my landlord have had to evacuate everyone? Are there any other types of gasses or lack thereof that would have caused my landlord to have to dig through the concrete to replace some of the gas lines? My apartment is right above the area where they were fixing things. I'm on the second floor and my apartment is basically an overhang above the concrete walkway. So if there was a leak or something I guess it could affect me more than others? Possibly? Idk.   For two days after construction, I had headaches - the same pounding headaches I get when the air pressure changes (like on a plane). I could finally breathe, but I had headaches. Now, a week after the gas line replacement I feel great.   Could this all be just pure coincidence? Any advice would be appreciated.    Also, do I have the right to know exactly what the issue was? My landlord seemed vague when I asked. Is he required to tell me? Location is the state of New York."	No
126	I was a misclassified 1099 employee by a company I was with for over a year. I am in the process of filling out the ss8 and I am 100% sure I will be ruled as being an employee. However, in that case I would like the state of IL to investigate overtime wages I have been due that amount to a little over 5k.   Can I file both documents at once?  Or should I wait to file the DOL wage complaint?  In my previous post about this issue I had someone mention I didn't have to wait to file the DOL wage claim but I would like to know how they'd be able to investigate or make a determination if I haven't been ruled an employee yet?   Thanks guys.	No

A couple months in, I was offered to attach on another year to my lease, at $50 dollars less a month on the new term.

131	"I live in an apartment complex with my SO and roommate. We called just about 3 weeks ago due to some small water damage on our ceiling following a rain storm; we are on the 4th (top) floor. The first call was just to report it and there was just a small amount of discoloration. The next day it rained again, however this time it was a different spot and the drywall had become very soft and discolored. A second call was made to report this new damage. The following morning/afternoon mold had formed on the 2nd wet spot, a third call was placed for someone to come out and check the damages to repair whatever was causing the leak.    Fast forward a week and no one has come out with a couple more calls and messages left for maintanence to come out. It rains again and 2 more wet spots show up, making 4 total, another call was made reporting new damage and we demanded someone come out immediately to check all the leaks and for the mold issue. Someone comes out to check it all and tells us that it is caused by condensation forming on the AC ducts. Cool no problem someone should be out to insulate the ducts to stop that from happening anymore. ""Okay well what about the mold issue?"" ""oh well yea I guess we can have someone come out and check on that aswell."" A couple days later we found a much larger spot of mold in our pantry opposite where the AC unit is stored.    So now we are around 3-3.5 weeks out from the initial incident and thry are aware of the amount of mold in the apartment. What are our options legally? We would like to leave without cancellation fees since this is not our first issue with maintenance. Its a standard month to month contract for 12months ending in November.    Thank you everyone if you need any information or pictures let me know and I can try and upload them, I am currently on mobile at work."	No
132	"Hi /r/legaladvice,    Posting this on a throwaway.    I live in NE Ohio in a suburban area. I live in a residential area, a small city of approximately 20,000. My neighbor has lived here for many years - far longer than I.  I bought the house going on two years ago. Although I quite enjoy the city, my house and the area I live in - I can't stand my neighbor. In fact, nearly everyone around me can't.    Here's the problem with them - we live in a residential area. They run an auto shop out of their garage. They work on cars **all. day. long.**  Up until recently - they used to happen until 1, 2, 3 even 4 or 5 AM. They were ""decent"" enough to close their garage door but all that would do is muffle the noises.    Their garage is at most 50 feet from where I am sitting now and all I hear is loud talking and grinding.   My choices are to close my windows and turn on the AC or open the windows and listen to obnoxious noises all day long.   Sitting in the backyard - which should be a peaceful activity, is broken by them constantly banging on a vehicle, grinding on something, etc.    I got to the point of eventually calling the police every time they were working beyond 9 PM (quiet hours) and they seem to has ceased working beyond that time.     This has been going on for years. I spoke with another neighbor and found out that the person I bought the house from used to call on them all the time and the city has never done anything. I've called the police 3 times.     I've also contacted the Ohio EPA, who referred me to the Cleveland division of air pollution. The reason being is because a large portion of what they do is body work and there is a lot of air pollutants that I know they are not properly handling. There is also the possibility of fluid spills.     I have some concerns about going at this in a more aggressive manner - we share a fence. It's my fence and it's a privacy fence. It's in somewhat rough shape that I plan to replace in the near(ish) future. That means I'll have to deal with removing it, and standing on the other side while staining it.    More importantly, I have a dog that I am concerned about them trying to do something to while she's in the yard.    This isn't something that can just be talked about with them - they know people don't like this and they just don't care. They're really inconsiderate (and sketchy) individuals.    I'm really upset at the city for failing to do anything - it's against city law to run a automotive business out of a residential area. The city is aware of this and they refuse to do anything. I've contacted a city councilman and the law director. Both have not done much.   Right now is a ""slow"" time. They recently decided that they weren't making enough money to keep this up so they quit for 2 weeks only to start back up. However, the routinely have 12 or so cars in their driveway, garage, backyard + on the street. In doing so, they ALWAYS park in front of my house and leave their house open.    That may seem petty - but when they do this, they double park in front of my house and park as close to my driveway as possible. I've had times where I almost hit the vehicle parked there while turning in / pulling out. Which is another violation - parking too close to a driveway.     Basically - they're constantly violating city laws, the police routinely just show up and tell them to stop. The city won't do anything about it.    Looking for advice on what I might be able to do to get this to stop so I can get some peace. I'm tired of being woken up at 4 AM because they're working on their cars 6 feet from my bedroom window - in the middle of the driveway.  Thanks!"	No
133	Leased a commercial property about a year ago. A couple of months ago the utility bill got too high and couldn't pay on it anymore. Stopped paying rent around same time (3 months approx)   Landlord asked for keys back, I told him as soon as I had time to clear my stuff out. I let it go and he would message me here and there asking for keys back and I admit I should have done the right thing and gave them back.   I drove by on Friday and there was a notice taped to the door. Notice of eviction dated the previous day. Said I missed court and default judgment made against me. I was never served and was never even mailed a certified letter. Had literally no idea there was a court date to defend myself at.   The very next morning I received a text stating my belongings were on the curb. I called non emergency to speak to the deputy that I was told was there, never got a call back.   Long story short, it seems like 2 days is a very short period of time to be notified all the way to having all my belongings on the curb. My questions are is this a normal time period for eviction and if not what is my recourse?  Thank you to anyone for your advice.	No
134	I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.  First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying. I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.  I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.  As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.  Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.  **TL;DR, sick, boss doesn't believe me, what do?**	No
135	My lease expiring in four days has standard information about how tenants are responsible for professional carpet cleaning from an approved list. The approved list is an addendum piece to the rental agreement with one company listed. We signed this a year ago not knowing that this carpet cleaning company was run by the landlord's brother. I've called and he's quoting $650 to clean a 2-bedroom apartment, while other places I've called are saying it'll be more around $200. Is this enforcable/legal?	No
136	My neighbors contractor flooded their unit, which in turn caused damage to my units kitchen and carpet. I called his insurance company about their procedures and my reimbursement for moving expenses and he says they're a liability company who reimburses the owner after they submit an estimate. I take this to my landlord, and now his representative wants us to either continue paying rent while we stay in the unrepaired unit, or move all our belongings out while they do repairs without reimbursing us for moving fees or hotel charges. I had told her if they wanted to break the lease 7 months early, they'd have to give us our deposit and last months rent back (which was paid at the beginning of the lease), and allow us to stay for the month of August rent free while we searched for another home. She countered with a hard no, and said we can continue to pay rent on the damaged unit until we leave, at which point they'll refund our deposit and last month if required, or she will call the state to have the unit condemned then lock the doors and have us escorted to gather our belongings and exit the property...sans our deposit of course.  My question is, what are my options here? I'm dumb and don't have renters insurance, and believe me I'll never make that mistake again. My realtor who is a family friend recommended I go to small claims court and make my case, and they'll side with me considering the situation. I tried to be cordial with my landlords rep, but she devolved into insults and that was quite frankly the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't want to get taken advantage of here, especially for doing nothing except having the misfortune of living in the unit next to the one where the problem originated.   The unit isn't unlivable, but the condition of the kitchen cabinets and carpet is beyond repairs; should I be paying rent during a time when the apartment isn't in a state that was agreed upon during the lease? Do i have recourse in seeking reimbursement or even straight payment for my moving expenses? And what abkut the lease...can my landlord just decide to condemn the place even if it truly isnt condemned and unlivable just to have a reason to break the lease? Can I get some advice? Thank you so much reddit, it's very much appreciated.	No
137	"To preface this with a little bit of background, I have chronic migraines where I frequently get to deal with going temporarily blind, followed by several hours of excruciating pain worsened by light or sound. It sucks, but it's the hand I was dealt. Migraines, while often seemingly random, are triggered by several things for me, most notably by strobing or flickering lights and by cinnamon.   I moved recently into a new apartment close to my college campus, where the lease guarantees me the use of three assigned parking spots in a garage underneath the apartment complex. When I moved in I noticed that there were 5-6 flickering lights inside the apartment complex's garage, and I quickly called the property management company to ask if they could please fix the lights, even just by removing the ones that flickered if replacement was too costly. I called the property management company on August 3rd, and received a text from them that same day indicating that the lights would be fixed by this last Monday (August 7th). While this was slower than I would've hoped for such a simple fix, it wasn't entirely unexpected and I resigned myself to wait.   Monday the 7th came and went with no update from the property manager and no fix for the strobing lights. I asked for an update and received none. I had experienced two migraines that can be directly attributed to the lights (aura started immediately after being in the garage), but they were in the evening and I just dealt with them while I waited. On Tuesday evening the lights in the garage triggered another migraine, and I called to try and get an update on the light situation and got nothing but a voicemail. This morning I woke up to drive to work and hadn't even gotten my car out of the garage before the aura began, meaning I couldn't go to work for at least half a day (I'm preparing to leave for work when I finish writing this). This problem is costing me time and money, because each time I have a migraine I have to take two pills that cost cost over $100 each (Treximet, average price of $927 for 9 tablets) and I have currently lost $89.40 in wages for today (4 hours at $22.35 an hour). I cannot have this problem continue, for the sake of my financials and my sanity, but the landlord texted  me this morning with a real gem.  ""I do not have an exact day or time for the lights in the garage at this time.""  Understandably I was pretty upset by that and texted her to say it would be unacceptable and that a more rapid remedy was necessary. It's been almost an entire week (this is the 5th business day since my complaint) and they still can't even remove 6 light bulbs?  Her response:  ""No, I will not meet that demand. You do not have control over the building or the HOA. You are free to park street side.""  She suggests that I park street side, where there is only very rarely available parking (college town, right next to a college campus) and where my car and its contents are sitting out in plain view rather than sitting protected in a garage. I cannot park outside because, having gone for a short walk, there are no spots available on the entire street while my lease guarantees me a spot in the garage.   According to hud.gov, it would appear as though the property management company has to make reasonable accommodations for a person with a disability (chronic migraines count, and I am registered with my college's office of disability services): [link here](https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/disabilities/inhousing). I think that asking that flickering light bulbs be at least removed, even if not replaced, is more than reasonable.   At this point I'm at my wits end. I'm considering contacting the office of disability services for my college to see if they can provide me with any help to try and get this problem fixed any faster. I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable with all this, and if anyone has any advice that might help me more than trying to get someone else to step up to bat for me since the property management company refuses to listen to me. I'd also like to know if I have any grounds for a civil suit to reclaim my lost wages and the (so far) $400+ cost of medication that has been incurred just past the date they said it would be fixed."	No
138	My mother is ready to begin separation/divorce proceedings against my father. What are some general immediate steps that need to be taken to get things started? What sort of professional agency or council should she consult with first and how should she look for this? Money is definitely an issue (they are not wealthy and she has been a housewife her entire life). I feel like talking to a lawyer is probably the best first step to take ASAP on Monday morning but not sure how to go about finding a reputable lawyer for her locally. If there is something she should be doing first otherwise I would appreciate the guidance.      Thank you!	No
139	I am the home owner and rent out one of the bedrooms in my home through vrbo. My neighbor has decided they are not a fan of this happening in the neighborhood and has already filed a complaint to the city, to which they said there are no regulations against it. I have had police show up inquiring about the renting, complaints that its a rental property and now the inspector will be calling soon. Basically my neighbor is trying to take pictures or file a complaint of every little thing, including putting my trash out early.   What are some of my courses of action? Can I just ignore him knowing it is not against any city ordinance, do I need to be extra cautious with breaking any small ordinance, or is this going to bubble into something bigger and should get a lawyer involved?  Thanks for all the help	No
140	I posted something on Facebook that apparently he is upset about. Is this a threat?  [this is what he said to me](https://imgur.com/gallery/a0LiP)	No
141	The situation with my landlord has deteriorated and I'm afraid she's going to give me a bad recommendation to my next landlord out of spite. I'd like to know if this is a possible course of action to ensure she doesn't try and screw with me after I move out of her property.	No
142	Hello, Thank you. Here is the question.   I am in Florida and I just received a letter from Texas regarding child support.  I am listed as the non-custodial parent. The mother is a woman I haven't seen/heard from in 14 years.  She left 14 years ago to return to Texas. I was not aware of this child, this is the first I am hearing about this. I never signed a Birth Certificate.  I don't know this childs name or birth date. Doesn't there have to be proof I am the father? What are my options? How does this cross-state child support work? Do I find a lawyer in Florida or Texas? If mine, can I contest for custody?  Or Joint?  Please, any words of advice.  Thank you in advance.	No
143	I have a pending suspension on my NJ license for misstatement of information to obtain a license; I applied for and received an NJ license but was not aware my license was already suspended in FL (my vehicle did not have insurance while it was waiting to get repoed). My move to NJ was sudden so I didn't prepare to have my mail forwarded to me, so I didn't find out about the suspension until later. I'm just now getting my FL license reinstated. I've spoken to a couple lawyers and I'm being told at least 750$, 1,000$ (currently unemployed full-time college student). What are the chances I can prove I didn't know my license was suspended in another state?	No

145	Hello,  The company I am having issues with are holding my account that I have them under certain restrictions (one of which is quite serious, money related) due to a claim of theirs to which I do not agree. They want to video interview me over the internet. Not sure why they wanted to do that but there is no such thing explicitly written in their ToS. I find this rather intrusive regarding my privacy, not to mention unprofessional and quite barbaric. And no, there have been no reports of any sort of fraudulent activity on my account that I know of, my track of record is excellent there, and they have already verified my account about 8 years ago. The company is based in California, USA, I am based in the EU, Romania.  Are there any USA / EU / international laws protecting my privacy over the internet that I could enforce upon them ? Do I stand a fair chance of winning such a lawsuit ?  Thank you	No
146	My fiancé and I live in California and after shopping around for a while, we decided on an engagement ring that was from an Etsy shop in WA.   We were led to believe that the ring would be 18k gold and after having it on my finger for less than 24 hours, it turned my finger green.   We are a young couple, he is still in grad school, so between student loans and living expenses, (although we were budget conscious when looking at rings)  $500 + is a lot to us right now.   I know that this seems like a stupid thing to post/be upset about, however, I don't want any other couples to be duped like we were.   If any of you have suggestions as to how to deal with the seller or how to proceed going forward, please let me know.   Thank you.	No
147	Hello, I'm posting this for a friend who's too old to probably post here and handle the situation.  He's been at the apartment for 6 months, it's actually an extremely small room that violates a few codes I'm sure but he's paying low rent so has been dealing with it.  The landlord snapped last week (we think he might be crazy) and started making outrageous demands including an immediate $500 security deposit and bump in rent to $700 or more (it keeps changing).  Obviously my friend doesn't know what to make of this and can't really afford paying $1200 in one go and given the place, it's probably not worth it.  He and I have tried looking for a new place to live but it's hard finding something for $500 (unless some people have ideas?) and under such short notice as well.  My question is, doesn't the landlord need to provide at least 30 days written notice even despite there not being a lease?  Ideally he could stay there for at least another month or longer so he can at least make other arrangements.    The landlord reminded him today that he needs to be out this Sunday (and also made physical threats apparently - but I wasn't there to witness it).  Thanks so much for your help!	No
148	"So my dad is trying to evict me, he doesn't have anything legal. He wants me to work for him, and is consistently harassing me until I do (I'm in between jobs and I'm looking for one ACTIVELY.) He was harassing me this morning in his room, yelling into mine. I went to his bedroom calmly. I asked why I have to work for him and why he is trying to take my car away (he bought it, pays for everything for the car), when I am actively looking for a job. He got angry. Shouted, charged me, and I backed up. He was pushing my hands away and spitting into my face. I backed up into my room next door, and he was still in my face arguing with me so I threw a punch and it landed. It busted his lip open. He's trying to file a police report. He took my phone and my car away from me.   This is not the first time we have had a fight. Last time I accidentally closed the door on my mom's finger during an argument, so he dragged me out of the bathroom by my hair and stomped on my back - knocking the wind out of me. The police that came searched my room for drugs, and they ultimately told my father he has every right to put his hands on me if I'm ""being disrespectful"".   So the police WILL take his side. They told me if I don't like it, get out.   He IS verbally abusive. EXTREMELY so. But he rarely fist fights with me.   How do I avoid going to jail?"	No
149	My grandfather died about 6 months ago and left all of his assets to his recent wife and made her the executor of his will. The one exception to this was my grandparent's house which he left her in a life estate.  Before his death he and his wife co-signed on a loan for several tens of thousands of dollars against the house. This past week I started getting calls from a debt recovery company asking about his finances. I know from my research that my family and I can't be chased down for his debts as we haven't received anything from and have no control over his estate, so I am not concerned about that.  Ideally we would like to sell the house ourselves and pay off the loan or take over the loan and rent out the house so it is not foreclosed on. I checked with my family and the deed was never updated to indicate the remaindermen he had described in his will so the first thing I am doing now is making sure that happens ASAP.  What are our best steps forward after that? Since she was on the loan can they even come after the house as part of the estate? We were thinking of calling the debt collection company and seeing if we could work with them directly, although we are not the executors so they may not even talk to us.	No
