0	So, this is about my grandfather in New Jersey. about two years ago, we were browsing on amazon when we found something strange. A book my grandfather had published... kind of. You see, he was going to run a business a few years ago republishing old books, however the initial cost proved to high so the idea was shelved. that said, before he stopped, he sent one of those books to the PoD service lightningsource to do a small run of a few test copies (iirc, the count numbered less than 10). so, imagine our supprise to find this: https://www.amazon.com/New-Yorks-Awful-Steamboat-Horror/dp/097150590X on amazon one day.  Out of curiosity, I ordered it, and the book that arrived was a perfect match to the test-print he had. somehow, it had gotten printed and sold without his knowledge. Its been two years since then (and who knows when they started and stopped printing the thing), yet even now copies are floating around. Amazon was very unhelpful as we couldn't find a good way to contact somebody outside the customer service department, and obviously Lightningsource never replied to our questions. Was there anything we could have done? his name is even on the book as the editor, as is his company name. it has all the edits he made too.	Yes
1	"Every day at 4:00pm my college campus posts available on-campus housing contracts for sale at an online webpage. There is a huge shortage of contracts for students (and nearby off-campus housing is expensive) so the demand is huge and getting one of these contracts is like winning the lottery. I attend a private university.  I wrote a internet bot that refreshes the housing page 30+ times per second and reserves a contract the instant it appears. I successfully used it on myself to get a housing contract. I feel like if I released my bot as a service there would be a big demand for it. Something like ""Pay $50 to guarantee a contract"".  What things should I consider from a legal perspective before launching this type of service? I would need to collect their login information, log in on behalf of the student, and use my bot to put the contract on hold. I wouldn't need to actually pay for or sign any sort of lease agreement for the student. They would finalize the contract after later logging into their account.  In other words, could this be illegal? How should I know if this could get me in trouble with my college? Is it a bad idea to talk to the college directly? Are there other business models that could minimize my risk to legal repercussions?"	Yes

3	I'm making a short documentary to submit to my university, and was wandering how I can keep within copyright laws. Im already getting music composed, but was looking at other options for some sequences.	Yes
4	I recently signed a contract with Jukin Media granting them the rights to license my video to other media outlets. I was offered $200 up front for signing and 70% of all revenue made from the video.      I didn't research the company as much as I should, and now I'm wanting out. I have not filled out any personal info that would allow them to pay me, so as far as the contract states, they can't use the video. The contract said this about terminations:      &gt;T4. Termination. Licensor may seek to terminate this Agreement at any time; however, this Agreement shall only be terminable upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of which may be granted or denied in Jukin’s sole discretion. No termination shall impact any prior license of the Images by Jukin prior to termination, which shall continue in full effect under the terms of this Agreement.      Since I cannot be paid and they cannot use the video because of that, I don't see why they would want to deny the termination request, since the video would seemingly be in limbo.      But I was wanting to ask about the wording of that excerpt. Does it imply that if the contract is terminated, they will still retain rights to use the video, despite the fact that the contract associated with it was cancelled?	Yes
5	I want to get a business license for a home based business I want to start. The application for a license asks for my home address. Would there be any ramifications if I use a mailbox that has a street address (from a local store not a PO box) instead?	Yes
6	"My SO (we are in the UK) crochets amigurumi plushies, and sells them on etsy, as a side hobby (by no means does she really EARN from it per se).  One of her listings on etsy is a pattern for an animal amigurumi, which she posted in the last month. Today she received an email from another etsy seller (from Canada) telling her to take it down as she is infringing on her copyright, as she also has a pattern for the same animal on etsy, and has done since 2016.  the seller notes that she can tell the patterns are not identical, as the stitches are clearly different (at least from a crocheters perspective), but cites that the finished amigurumi is still very similar in appearance, and thus this is where her copyright has been infringed.  is this a thing?  this woman literally says ""Copyright laws protect the appearance of an amigurumi design, even if the actual pattern isn't identical"".  i know my SO didn't copy her pattern, or even use images of her amigurumi for the inspiration. it is purely coincidental. this isn't the first pattern she's made by herself."	Yes
7	"I am currently in FL, but the corp exists in AL.  tl;dr- In the late 90s, my dad created a ""Domestic Corporation"" (has the .inc at the end) when I was a minor, used it to do some masonry work, and then passed away in the early 2000s. Thanks to Google, I just found out that I'm named as an officer (incorporator) and it still exists.  --------------------------------  Setting: small semi-rural town in Alabama.   So, back in the late 90s my father had an opportunity to take the masonry he worked as a 9-5 job and use it to form his own company and take on some really big projects. I was in 8th grade at the time. He created the corp with the help of a lawyer friend, rented a little shed somewhere for cheap and got to work with my grandfather on the first project. It didn't make massive money, but it made enough for him to quit his day job and keep the lights on, and that's all that mattered.  For the most part, I never got involved except for helping him work out at his shop after school some days, and sometimes during summers in high school. He had a lot to do, it was hard work to do alone and he had no help (never hired anyone; it was always just him), so I was happy to lend a hand.   That said, I was never officially paid in any capacity. This was just the ""family business"" and I was doing my duty as his kid to help keep the lights on. I didn't mind.  By college, in the early 2000s, I pretty much went on about my own life, and the help I could offer decreased pretty greatly because of my own responsibilities.  Around that time, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and stopped working. He kept his warehouse, just paying rent to keep it around (I guess to keep the hope alive that he would be able to do it again one day), but in 2008 he passed away. After his passing, his widow (my stepmother) mentioned that the shop was still around and she was going to have to pay rent on it if it wasn't cleaned out, so I took some friends down and sweeped/washed it out, threw out the old tables, and brought whatever was left over back to her (the vast majority of the equipment he used was rented, so all that was left over were some old pallets, old wooden tables he cobbled together to do work on, and mechanic hoist that I took back to her).   That was the last I ever thought of his corp.  Well, last night I was just sitting there being somewhat sentimental and thought to myself ""I wonder if anyone talks about the work he did anymore..."" and Googled his corp name. While looking, I ran across a Google business listing and clicked it. According to the site- the corp is still listed as ""Exists"" and it has 2 officers... my father and ME (both listed as ""incorporator).  After some panicking, I went to the AL corp lookup and looked the company up via ID there, and sure enough the information was legit. It is listed as a ""Domestic Corporation"" and has a "".inc"" at the end of the name.   I had always assumed that it was his company alone, and that when he passed the corp would be shut down. And yet there it is. From what I can tell, Alabama will never administratively shut down a corporation on its own.  After looking, I realized that Alabama requires a minimum $100 annual filing fee each year (subject to fines each month you don't deal with it). Obviously no one has dealt with this since at LEAST 2008, and that's assuming he kept it up as he should have up until 2007. The registered agent is still listed as him, and pointed to his shop. The mailing address is some PO Box I don't even recognize (I guess he got his work mail there).   Now, before anyone jumps to the obvious conclusion of ""This could have been nefarious"" - that wasn't something my father would do in ill will. The man would have taken a bullet for me, and DID sacrifice a lot of his own personal life and happiness to care for me. Also, I am intimately familiar with my credit, and nothing has ever shown up out of the ordinary on it. When he did this, I'm sure he did it for no other reason than he thought it would be ""cool"" for his son to be a part business owner at such a young age. And, unfortunately, I can't remember that conversation at all (it's been some 20 years...), so 8th grade me probably thought it was really cool, too.  In short- kinda freaking out. There is this corporation out there, somewhere, that I am an officer in which has been sitting derelict since at least 2008 amounting what I can only assume is a lot of debt. I have none of the paperwork (that I am aware of), and know little more than the name of the company and that it's my responsibility now.  I'm pretty sure this is lawyer territory, but it's Sunday afternoon and my stomach is doing cartwheels, so I wanted to ask what you all thought since I have literally nothing else I can do right now about the situation.  Thanks!"	Yes
8	"Hi r/legaladvice,   This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.   I'm gathering preliminary sources and images for a book idea that I have. This book would consist mainly of images, illustrations, and hand-drawings that _mostly_ come by way of the Library of Congress or government agencies. The Library of Congress states that the government works hosted on their site *""are also available for worldwide use and reuse under CC0 1.0 Universal.""* However, they also state *""you should determine for yourself whether or not an item is protected by copyright or in the public domain, and then satisfy any copyright or use restrictions when publishing or distributing materials from our collections.""*   My concern is that second snippet.   - How can I verify that a work is truly in the public domain (or equivalent license)?    - If I do publish an image that I find out is not in the public domain after publication, what options do I (and the copyright holder) have?    - What sites or services can you recommend that will ensure I only use works that are in the public domain?   Thanks for any and all information.  PS: I'm in the USA."	Yes
9	Have a small service business (similar to plumbing, electrical) and am starting it with another person that has decades of experience forming and running companies (i have none).    We are equal partners at this time.    He told me he was going to have his lawyer draw up the paperwork, and that he would be listed as President, and I would be Secretary.  Is it unusual to list the second person as Secretary?  I told him i thought it would be more appropriate for me to be listed as Vice President, and he said okay... but when i received a draft of the paperwork, i was still listed as Secretary in it.  So should i be concerned about this, or are the titles more or less arbitrary?  I assume that two people cant be President, so I am fine conceding that to him due to his experience, but should i insist on having the title of Vice President for legal reasons?  As a side note, i dont believe anything malicious was intended by not changing it in the paperwork, it's more likely that he just forgot to do it.  He had a multi-million dollar company with nearly 100 employees in the past, and is extremely knowledgeable about tax codes and legal partnerships, and such, so i pretty much trust his judgement... but i am still curious.	Yes
10	I filed this patent with her in September of 2015. I have tried everything I can to reach her. As of recently I received a mass email from her law firm stating that they have new contact information. Something seems off and feels like they are covering something especially due to the way the email was written and phrased. I just want my patents out of this hole.	Yes
11	Hey Legal Advice, I'm working on putting together a crafts business.  I know I need to register for a business license/tax ID from the state, but it's not clear to me if I also need to trademark my business name federally.  It's an extra fee I'd sort of prefer not to incur, and I am not making unique enough things to worry about copycats.  If I were to start selling unique patterns or instructions, I would definitely trademark. Mostly, I'm looking forward to a tax-ID that allows me to pay wholesale/tax free for supplies.   I have verified that my company name is not taken (in VA or on the federal database), so that is not the issue.  If anyone can provide clarification, I would appreciate it.	Yes
12	Let's say I write a book about a now pretty unknown legend. The word has had various different meanings over the years. And if I ever make a movie I don't want the studio to be a dick. And take down other works people might make. What's the best way to make sure I can legally do that, before any studio  gets their hands on the script?	Yes
13	I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	Yes
14	"Greetings from Pennsylvania!  I would like to make a series of media channels under the umbrella title ""Highly Questionable."" It seems that the only major use of this title is a discussion segment on ESPN. Since it's not the name of a major show, I'm not sure if this is likely to be protected under some form of IP law.  On the off chance that the blog or channel started making money, I would hate to build an entire ""brand,"" only to be forced to change it later.  Any advice?  Edit: Added where I'm from."	Yes
15	"Hi guys, this is my first time on Reddit but I figure if there's one place that I can get some answers without hiring a lawyer, it'd be here. So to start out I am a small time YouTuber looking to use viral videos in my channel in the context of ""Videos of the Week"". I contacted the publisher of this video 'Jukin Media' in hopes in receiving permission to use a specific viral video. However they told me it would be $1000 just to be able to publish in my video. So the most logical thing is I obviously cannot use it unless I am willing to pay them. However, I have seen this video all over the place, and I know for a fact that these channels did not get permission from Jukin. Also, YouTube has contentid which puts your video through a system that allows publishers to put claims on your work for using certain works in your videos. It also does not allow you to monetize. I would be fine with not being able to monetize and all of that, I just want to use the video. However I do not want to get a copyright strike when I post it or in the future. Am I legally allowed to post this video and just let the ContentId catch it, which would allow Jukin to monetize on my behalf, or am I violating copyright rules? Thank you"	Yes
16	I am a social media employee for a venue in northern California. Normally, we have cheap local bands come in and perform. All our concerts are free, used to gather the community together. Recently we had a singer who is actually signed to a label come and perform. Nothing big, but I want to use his performance in an ad. He performed both his own songs and more popular songs. Legally speaking, what music copyrights might I be breaking?	Yes
17	I've had this great and unique idea for a business for a while, and i want to pursue it later in my life when i actually have the capital to do so. But right now i'm a broke intern, and i want to have some sort of protection on it. Is this possible at all?	Yes
18	"I run a small social network that lets users register usernames as their handle. A company which I'll call ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" (not its real name but similar) sent me an email accusing one of my users of committing a trademark violation because she registered the name ""illusionalsunrise"" on my site. But when I search for ""illusionalsunrise"" (again, not the real name) on http://tmsearch.uspto.gov, I see that the word mark is for ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" and not ""Illusionalsunrise"" by itself.  The email sent to me also contains this paragraph:  ""From the information that we have received regarding your use, our use of this Trademark has priority over yours based upon earlier and continuous use, as well as the above federal registration. Therefore, your use is a violation of our company’s rights.  We are requesting that you remove the use of our trademark described in the provided link or any other name or mark confusingly similar.""  Their actual trademark filing states: FIRST USE: 20160401. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 20160401 with a filing date of July 21, 2016 whereas my user registered her account on Oct 14, 2011. My user also doesn't sell anything and is not a business entity so they shouldn't even be in the same industry (it's just a username).  Lastly, that specific user does not reside in the United States (the social network itself is a registered company in the United States).  I don't think this company has any ground to stand on. It would be easier for me to just change that user's name but they are currently active and I don't think it's right to do so especially when I think this company is overreaching. I'm going to bring this up to a lawyer regardless but I just want to get /r/legaladvice's opinion so I can have a general idea on where I stand."	Yes
19	I am in the process of a legal name change, although it can take anywhere between 60-90 days.  At the same time I am also trying to start a business. I don't know if I should just sit tight and wait for the name change to happen, or if this wouldn't matter anyway because I need to get things to match with past IRS tax returns, etc. I also don't like sitting still if I don't need to, since this is time I could be using for my business.  So I'm not really sure what I should be doing. Wait for the name change and then file the paperwork, or use my current legal name to get the ball rolling and then try to register my name change with the proper places later?	Yes
20	This past week we have noticed people selling one of our t-shirt designs through some online print on demand platforms. These companies are the sort where anyone can submit artwork and get it printed. I believe these companies are in the US. One company we contacted and they have removed the listing, and the other we are contacting right now. Between both listings, these people have earned a few thousand dollars from my design. Since it's relatively a low amount I understand that it might not be worth dragging lawyers into the situation...but it annoys me that there are US companies that are aiding these a$$holes and profiting from stealing my design.   I can post more specific information if it would be helpful.	Yes
21	"Can anyone help me out? What legal action should I take?  I co-founded a business in 2013 in freshman year of college with a friend of mine where girls step on insects. We usually sold our stuff using xxxfetish-media, which is a good place to sell bug crush and femdom content. I used their official OCMB forums to help figure out what people liked best when I started out. Early that year I saw a legit filesharing website (we'll call it fetishare) where people made accounts to trade videos and got points for it, so I figured that it'd be a good way to spread my store's name around. Well soon after that I found out from the admin on the OCMB forums that they were spying on customers, farming IPs from 'known pirate websites, and in some cases placing malware to track people. I figured I'd stop using the fetishare site and just sell normally.   Well last year in June when I was waiting for a payout from them, I didn't get it and started wondering why it didn't hit my bank account. I contacted them but the customer service wasn't good at fixing it. I eventually got a response saying: 'Your account has been suspended for copyright violations'. So basically I got locked out of my store for something that happened three years ago. Notice I said 'locked out' and not 'closed down'. My store is still up. People can still buy from it and they can make money from it while giving none to me. They don't respond to any of my emails either, except for one when I ask for how I can restore access to my store they said: ""We will for forgive this if you sign a statement saying you will never again share videos.'   I made about $41k/yr from that store. In hiatus/hibernation mode with no updates it at least made $10k from last year to now. I'm owed money, and this isn't right. They're not only hurting me, but other producers by banning customers left and right from being able to buy and lowering profits.  Since then I started my own e-commerce store and hosted on Clips4Sale and Kinkbomb instead. However I would still like to know what to do about this.  I live in Alabama.  Any thoughts? Should I take legal action?  - tl;dr: Possible embezzlement with my store on a fetish hub. What do?"	Yes
22	My sister runs a semi popular African American natural hair blog and instagram. She interviewed with a hair company in order to join their sponsorship program, which would require her to post images of her using their products on her instagram in exchange for monthly free products. After going through the interview process she was informed several weeks later that she had not gotten into the program. Flash forward to today, I am scrolling through my Facebook page and see that this company has posted one of her pictures taken from her instagram without permission. Are companies allowed to Take images from instagram without giving any sort of compensation or obtaining permission from the owner?	Yes
23	I am asking about nonprofit organizations that arent registered in the state of WA, I giggled the name of their org and found nothing. I know someone who just started a Facebook page claiming to be a non profit organization and is accepting donations, the donations are toys and kids clothing and items for children, I do not think any money is involved but am not sure. They claim none of the things they get are new, but the basically take donations and give them out to people, but for free and some pictures look like new in box toys. My question is they aren't registered, is this legal? Are they supposed to keep books of the items they receive for tax purposes and such? I don't understand and want to know if anyone can help me understand and answer my questions and if they are violating any codes or laws. Thank you for your time and if you need any more information please ask!	Yes
24	I want to make a clothing company that my get me into legal trouble and was wondering if I could be sued or if I'm fine. For example the company supreme has a plain white shirt that says supreme within a box, would I get in legal trouble if I made a similar shirt that said sub-par? The reason I think I will get in trouble is because The North Face company sued a company called the South Butt and switch their sign. So I just want to know if they would be able to sued?	Yes
25	So I know there are tons of gaming news websites out there and all of them use screenshots, but I'm a newbie when it comes to the legal aspect.  Am I required to ask the game developer/publisher for permission? Do I have to reference the source?   Or can I just freely publish any screenshots I took myself of the game in the context of news or updates to the game.  Any help would be appreciated.	Yes
26	I'm working with a company on an eCommerce site as general help (customer service, manufacturer communication, photos, etc.).   It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out.   Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor.   The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily.   I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.  Any resources or thoughts are greatly helpful!   States involved include CO and DC.	Yes
27	I know this isn't as important as some other matters on here, but I haven't found a solid answer on it.   I work as a news reporter at a regional newspaper in Minnesota. Our local radio station has been reading my stories, with exact quotes, on air without giving any credit.   The radio station has a news reporter, but she doesn't show up at most events, or cover any of these stories. I hear shortened versions of my stories being read pretty much every day and it's mildly infuriating.   I've asked them to stop, or give credit, but get no response. My company doesn't do anything about it.  I'm having trouble understanding the grey areas of fair use law. Basically, is there anything I can do about this?	Yes
28	I'm trying to put out a piece of hardware that would be used by laboratories, so I guess it falls under the umbrella of lab equipment. Obviously, I would like to comply with all regulations, but was wondering what relevant organizations/documents I should take a look at. I was thinking along the lines of FDA/FCC maybe? Any help would be appreciated!	Yes
29	Say I created a transcription service, where people payed me to transcribe their audio. Instead of hire people to do it 'myself', i just passed the audio files on to other companies who costed less, and took the price difference.  This *seems* like it should be wrong, but also seems like it'd be awkward to make laws for (outsourcing to 3rd party companies might be part of the process, like how sliced bread manufacturers don't grow their own wheat).  What would be the 'official verdict' behind this, or is it more of a grey area?  Thanks!	Yes
30	"I'm not sure if this question is acceptable in this subreddit. So I will ask my question, and if people suggest hiring a lawyer, then I request advice on how to find the right type of lawyer for my situation.   After graduating from college, I spent six months working on a startup which was unsuccessful. Then I began searching for a job, and I put my accomplishments during my startup on my resume. After six months of job searching, I received my first job offer with a company in the same field as my startup, but it's a 3-month consulting agreement. The CTO of the company said if it's a good fit I will be offered a full-time position afterward. I read the consulting agreement and analyzed it with a plagiarism checker. I discovered over 90% of the contract came from two online contracts, and one major difference I found was the removal of a phrase in a statement. To summarize the statement, the online contract says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc, that I develop while performing my services under this agreement"". The contract I received does not have the last phrase so the statement says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc."".  I spoke with the CTO about this, and he said I could make changes to the contract, and they would consider it. At the moment, I had doubt in negotiating and told him I sought a permanent position. So I declined the offer. A week later I regretted not negotiating and asked for another opportunity. He said they might give me another opportunity, but they will be unable to change the wording of the contract. If I sign the contract, is it possible that I will give them rights to all my accomplishments I achieved during my startup?  Let me know if you need additional information. I am on the fence about hiring an attorney/lawyer to help me with my situation, but I would like to get advice from this subreddit first. Thanks."	Yes
31	Hey guys. I'm currently cofounding an app startup which revolves around the on demand gig-economy.(App in the same market as TaskRabbit,Uber, etc.) We're currently at a crossroads of what type of insurance coverage best fits our business model. There would be a wide array of services offered on the app including at home services (workers will be entering homes), deliveries (transportation involved,) miscellaneous personal requests (beauty care, massage therapy, etc.) It seems as if we would be needing a different type of commercial insurance than the average company. So if anyone on here has any insight with insurance law, your advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!	Yes
32	Small-time punk rock band based in Monmouth NJ here.  So long story short, my band recorded an album a couple months ago with a drummer we'd been running for the past year. 9 out of the 11 songs on the album (yet to be released) were already written before we added him to the lineup, so he would technically have writing credits on those 2 remaining songs.    The issue is that due to a myriad of reasons, we kicked him out a few weeks after recording. It was not very amicable, but he said at the end of the day it was okay to use his studio recordings on the album as long as he got proper credit. But now, on the precipice of this release, he wants his fair claim on the copyright to the album.    Two of the members of our band, which includes me, feel it is not worth the hassle to fight for full ownership of the songs against him. The other two members want to keep him out of the copyright at all costs, but still credit him textually.    I have no legal background and probably phrased some things incorrectly regarding copyrights, but my question is what are the ousted drummer's options for fighting us, and what are our options defending against his claim, if that's what we have to do? Thanks in advance.	Yes
33	I have had an eCommerce business for about a 1.5 years and never filed for the LLC, but I have the branding, domain name, etc.  I just went to check the Secretary of State's site to lookup my name, and I found that just this May a corporation from Las Vegas, named **United States Corporation Agents, Inc.** filed for my exact name.  I know for a fact that no one would have picked the name of my eCommerce store randomly in my state, so I'm guessing they are doing this to try and make money off me.  Just look at how many other LLCs they've filed randomly: https://www.sosnc.gov/search/regagent/6542001  What can I do? Can I still get my name if I've had the domain name and branding for over a year?	Yes
34	So this guy has owned a trailer based business washing windows for awhile, every now and then on big jobs he has had college aged kids come help him complete those jobs. He files as an sole proprietor and pays the kids in cash. He is leaving for a couple years, and bought another trailer. While he is gone he wants me and another guy to run the trailers. He calls us independent contractors and asks for a 30/70 split of profits. We use his client base, and primarily he does scheduling. His name remains on the trailers, and we do not own the equipment but to dodge legalities I would be leasing the trailer from him.  He had no idea what a 1099 is, and has claimed all wages he paid to people that helped him as business expenses. What problems exist here? I can provide more non-identifying information if that helps. He also has called me a foreman in a video he put in social media.  The reason I ask this is that I believe this is an employee/employer relationship and could get troublesome fast, but there are some gray areas that could prove it possible to make work.   I'm not really interested, but he's also a friend and I want him to know why I'm turning it down and that he needs to fix some things. I'd also like to understand the situation better, and I don't think he even knows there's problems. Thanks!	Yes
35	My brother and I recently created a card game (it's awesome). We were wondering the best way of going about protecting the game itself as well as the images and logos used in the game. We have also used stylized drawings of world leaders (not referring to specific images) which our research shows is fine but please let us know if you know otherwise. We have had the prototype printed which I believe gives us immediate copyright. Please let us know what is the best way to go about this. Thank you.	Yes
36	I'm currently finishing up a part time position and a large bank/financial institution and I was thinking of doing as I described in the title. However, I know that the finance and investment advice field can be heavy in regulatory and legal burdens.   One of the main focuses at my part time job was researching and presenting on cryptocurrencies (i.e. Ethereum and Bitcoin) and blockchain/distributed ledger technology. I have participated in briefings for high up executives, including presidents. In my spare time, I have given advice/feedback on the cryptocurrency investment sphere for friends of friends (making sure to state that I don't know for sure the price will rise, they are taking their own risk, yada yada...) so I have a few references, as well as a letter of recommendation from a high level executive at my bank/institution.   My plan was to use these references and experiences to start a small consulting company to help advise people on investments in cryptocurrency, best practices for keeping your currency safe, provide weekly newsletter/debriefings on the markets, etc. Any idea of how I need to go about making sure I'm following regulations?	Yes
37	I live in California, client is in Europe. We only had email agreements to do a 3k video project. The resulting video was not professional quality. It was so low quality it started going viral a bit since filmmakers were enthusiastically denouncing every aspect of it.  I gave the client a full refund, but now I have this video which to me is a silly (and expensive) reminder of a project gone terribly wrong. Can I make it public on YouTube? I removed all reference to the company in the Title/Description, and note that the client is not affiliated with it and was given a full refund. But the video itself still contains their name/brand.  Is this fine to publish, or can I be sued for liable, brand infringement, or some other offense I'm unaware of. At this point I feel like it's mine, I paid for it, and should be able to publish it. I even refunded the fee for the script, which their whole team had signed off on and already paid for. I had hoped to retain them so was being nice there, and then they bailed.	Yes
38	I'm a US citizen (land living in the US) and also a partner of a company based in Australia.   What is the best way to handle distributions in my case -- would it make the most sense to create a subsidiary in the USA for tax purposes, or is there a better option?   While we have a few customers in the USA, we don't plan to pursue the market here and will not open any offices in the US. We'd like to remain focused on the Australian market. If we did open a subsidiary company in the US in order to pay distributions, would that open us up to US law and liabilities? We'd prefer to remain under Australian law since most of our customers are there.  I plan to speak to a lawyer about this, but thought it would be nice to get a few different opinions to prepare in case anyone else has dealt with a similar situation. Thanks in advance for your help!	Yes
39	So I thought up an idea and I would like to build it and sell it to people on craigslist or online or even to companies that will have me. Others thought of [this](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040189246A1/en?q=mouse&amp;q=charging&amp;q=wireless#legalEvents) as well in 2002. Will I get sued if I follow through?	Yes
40	Like everybody and their brother in this town, I too, am an aspiring screenwriter on the side.  I am about to start a tech job at one of the major studios, and in my offer letter it has the boilerplate stating that as of the day of my employment I assign any and all IP to them.  I don't really have any choice about signing this if I want to work there.  This job is not creative, but I could be exposed to creative projects at various stages of development.  I have developed to a reasonable degree one TV project (pilot written, season 1 outlined) and on film script (fully outlined with 20 pages of dialogue).  I've never really done much with either project other than have my friends read them.  I have no representation, nor am I a member of any trade union.  Obviously I'd love to have the film studio pick up either of these projects, but I don't want to have gifted these work (nor anything else that I create) to the film studio just because they've hired me as a code monkey.  What are my rights here?    I know in CA that as far as tech is concerned as long as you don't develop the IP with the company's time or resources and it is not substantially related to their business you can own it.  Does the same thing apply to creative works?  Can I continue to create works on the side?  Obviously, I can't steal ideas from anything I get exposed to at the studio.  What precautions should I take to avoid any appearance that I've done so?  You can find a lot on Google advising independent creatives about sharing stuff with studios, but I don't see anything pertaining to individuals with an employment contract.  Thanks for reading.	Yes
41	Hi,  I currently run a technology tutoring service for the elderly. I meet one-on-one with them in their homes and am paid hourly.

42	12/01/2017: Applied for LLC with name &lt;X&gt; with the Arizona Commerce Commision  12/27/2017: LLC was approved as &lt;X&gt;  01/08/2018: Signed first contract work as &lt;My Own Name&gt;  01/16/2018: Received letter that LLC was approved  When I signed the contract I was not aware the LLC was approvied. Did I at that time do business as a Sole Proprietorship or as the LLC even though I did not specify?  I talked to my City and they said I should only apply for a LLC with the city not for a Sole Proprietorship because of the contract.  I'm trying to figure out if I should have the contract corrected to include the LLC or if I can just let everything go as is. Am I going to run into any complications come tax time? Opinions?	Yes
43	I'm looking to start a online head shop (bongs, glass pipes, etc) based in Canada, shipping all of North America. Now from what I have read it is better for me to start a Canadian Corp instead of an American LLC, because I would be double taxed, is that Correct? If it is, besides filing for to start a corporation online, what would I be looking for locally to go in and be able to talk to about the legalities about selling such items online? Would an accountant or lawyer be better, because I seem to find different answers for that online.  Basically, who do I find locally to start a corporation, and be able to answer questions about the type of business I am looking to start. Thanks in advance for any help.	Yes

45	We are in Pennsylvania.   We are starting up an e-commerce store that will also sell on Amazon. We are committed to this long term but need to limit costs up front.   I have an accounting background so am somewhat familiar with incorporating, sales tax, IRS requirements etc., and possibility to incorporate in other states that are not our home state.   What we're stuck on is wondering whether we actually should incorporate or just file for a fictitious name in PA. Filing for a fictitious name in PA requires posting a legal notice of such, which alone is a $90 cost in our county. As such I'm thinking that money would be better spent towards incorporation fees and that way we also get legal protection from personal assets in case someone misuses a product we will sell.   Our question is which state would be best to incorporate in and should we incorporate as an LLC or regular corp or what. We're highly focused on minimizing costs up front and the ease of required filings etc. Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
46	Hello, Im in Ontario, Canada.  I have an idea for a business (a solution to the adblock problem).  I am not in a position to make my own company or pay for a prototype to be built.  I was considering using the idea as leverage (lets assume the idea is good) to get a job with an advertising agency that could actually utilize it.  My issue is if I reveal my idea and the company just runs with it without me, would I have any legal recourse? (I am assuming not)  And if not, how could I approach this in a way to cover myself? Would provisional patent be relevant?  The idea in question is pretty basic (in fact I am shocked that no one is doing it) so it would be very easy to steal.  Any advice?	Yes
47	Hey guys, I'm a musician that knows only the side of law that covers things like copyright and trademark and sampling (audio).   I'm trying to make the release of my next couple of singles as professional as possible, with all bases covered on grounds of copyright and terms of ownership. I've got a song finished and I drafted up artwork for the song using a picture of a friend of mine.  I'd like to write up a Work For Hire contract concerning the picture I'm using and the model in the picture. I basically just want the contract to cover ownership of the song, the model's permission to use her likeness with the song and promotional material of the song, as well as being distributed online with her picture attached to the song.    I don't want the contract to include any sort of royalties to the model as 1. We aren't trying to pull in large sums of revenue from this release and 2. She did not have any creative involvement with the creation of the song.  Do you guys have any pointers and/or clauses that I should include in the contract? Or any advice as to the best possible way to go about writing the contract for the model?  Thank you in advance	Yes
48	I'm designing a product which moves a bed out of the way to enhance a small room space.   It uses motors and a controller. Unless the CRAZY happens 4(1500lb) cables breaking it will be safe.   It will not allow anyone to be on the bed when moving and will move slowly as not to injure. It will also stop the motor if there is an obstruction.  I'm unfamiliar with liability law/insurance so I'm wondering how to go about getting this started.   I understand developing an LLC to separate the company liabilty from my personal assets but I don't understand how much coverage I should get when taking costs into account.   Thanks R	Yes
49	Hey all! I've recently started an NBA blog. I'm currently writing posts to fill up the site before I begin to promote it a little bit, and, I use images (which don't belong to me) in posts. My parents have mentioned that this might get me into some legal trouble, but I wouldn't think so as I don't profit off the blog.  A lot of NBA YouTubers use images such as the ones I use on my website. As well, many use real footage of the NBA. These are monetized videos with hundreds of thousands of views. If they never get into trouble for using the material, is there any reason I would?  I'm planning on getting this site to be fairly big (I have the ability to promote the site pretty well, so there's a decent chance it can get pretty popular -- that sounds kinda braggy, I don't mean it in that way though haha). I figured I should mention that because I'm guessing it's a bigger issue legality wise if the website is popular.  Thanks so much for any help! Feel free to ask any questions in case I left anything important out.	Yes

51	What are the rules regarding quoting/summarizing news articles from other websites for your own website? I assumed if you quote only 1-3 sentences, credit the source and link to the original article that you are in the clear.   However I read on the New York Times website the following:   &gt; 3. May I use portions of New York Times articles, such as quotes or excerpts? May I edit or adapt New York Times articles? Back to top Under certain circumstances, it is permissible to make direct quotes from New York Times articles.

52	I purchased a website about 6 months ago, however the website was not as described, and does not have the capabilities that were promised (such as a fully functional shopping cart with integrated payment processing).

54	Hello r/legaladvice,   I am from NY. I established an S corp with my business partner. I am a minority share holder in the corporation, and my partner is the majority. He just recently got divorced(?) even though a lot of what he is saying is not matching up. I have an EIN number if that matters for anything. I am looking to get out of this partnership. I still have the contract which states everything that I said above. I placed about ~$7500 into the business. I currently reside in a different county than he does, so I am thinking about taking him to court, because he won't buy me out of the partnership. Should I take this man to court, because supposedly he is getting divorce.   Personally, I fell out with this man and I am not sure if he is even telling me the truth.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks!	Yes

57	Basically an obese customer was denied service since we didn't have the proper equipment to handle someone of her size. (weight limit on machine is stated as 250lbs)  She writes a bad review claiming that we really denied her because she was black since she saw another large white woman in the store (but she fails to mention the other woman was half her size)   Since her review was framed in such a way to make this seem like a case of discrimination based on race, her fb post has been shared by a few thousands and as a result we've taken a hard hit on our online reviews/scores, harassing phone calls and what not.   I feel like we could have a libel case on our hands, but I'm not sure. How do these cases usually go? I ask if it's worth it since I also don't know the process of investigation for them, and I don't necessarily know if inciting this case somewhat more publicly like that would also be good...	Yes

60	I just noticed that another website probably copied one of my site's more popular posts (responsible for about 20% of my traffic). Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:  - The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.  - It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective  - This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.  - I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains. This kinda adds insult to injury.  Now since I can't proof anything I don't want to throw around accusations, but it all seems pretty clear to me. I'm placed higher on google, so I doubt I'm losing too much traffic to them because of this, though it may be some, but it's more about the principle. I link to their site because I like their service and recommend it to my readers, and they steal my content and a chunk of traffic.  So, what do you think I can/should do about this?  My first instinct was to write them an email, politely requesting they link to my site since its contents my interest their readers of that particular article, but maybe you have a better idea?  Thanks in advance for your input :-)	Yes
61	I am aware of an organization that has filed Articles of Incorporation declaring 501(c)(3) status.  However, there is no record with the IRS or their state of incorporation that suggests that they operate as a 501(c)(3).  I am a member of the governing body of this organization, but am not an officer.  I would like to see that the organization is closed, but the rest of the governing body is a large group, and it would be difficult to get the vote needed.  Do I have any recourse considering how they have incorporated?	Yes

We're currently talking to a well-known artist about licensing his work to use on our merchandise.   The artist's licensing people have asked for a proposed royalty, advance, and guarantee. I'm trying to calculate these figures in a way that makes sense. In the last 30 days, our top 400 products generated a total of $1900 in sales per product (over $20k annualized). We plan on licensing over 500 designs from the artist. What sort of calculation needs to happen here?   My understanding is that a royalty of about 15% is appropriate give the fame of the artist and the fact that I operate a sort of ""specialty shop."" I've heard a $25k advance for an artist's catalog makes sense. But what about the guarantee?   We only have an online presence (only retail, no wholesale).   Does anyone have any experience in this area? Many thanks in advance."	Yes
68	"Ok so i own a hair extension company and I hired a photographer to take some photos for the front page of my site. I picked 2/3 models that we used and I had an agreement with them that in exchange for their time modeling they would be compensated with being able to keep the hair I put in their hair (around $500 worth) and being given an affiliate code where they can earn commissions. They would also be able to use the photos for their portfolio.    Exactly 2 weeks before the shoot the photographer lets me know he found the perfect girl and asked me what I thought of her and i approved and he said he would ask her if she wanted to do it as well as discussing how we were doing anything. 1 week before the shoot she says she wants a contract (she contacts the photographer) and I asked the photographer, ""a contract for what?"" and he seemed confused about what she wants and she wouldn't let him give me her contact info so I could discuss it with her and she didn't want to give her address so I could mail a copy of the contract I drafted so she can have it ready and signed by the day of the shoot. So I said fine as long as she understands what she is getting out of the shoot.   So the day of the shoot rolls around and I finally meet and speak to the model for the first time. Everything is fine, all 3 models shoot and everyone seems to be happy. At the end of the shoot the model asks me about the contract and I told her I am still confused about what she wants out of this ""contract"" and she talks in circles and I get the impression that she just wants a contract to have one and doesn't necessarily need one. She told me she would have her  mom-ager look it over and send me any issues with it. I told her if she needed time for her mom to look it over I would send her the contract over email and once we reached an agreement I would send her a DocuSign. So I sent her the contract and I got a response 4 days later with some demands: 1) she wants shared rights to the photos 2) she wants to be able to approve of all photos before i use/post them 3) she wants a personal hair stylist to make wigs for her at my expense on a regular basis 4) a 6 month term for the contract.   WTF. 1) I don't have a problem with sharing rights but I don't have the rights to give her since the photographer owns the photos. 2) I cannot give her the right or power to control the photos I use from a  photoshoot that I paid for. Basically signing my rights away. 3) The girl is bald and basically wants me to give her new wigs to wear all the time in different colors. 4) 6 months for what? There is no ongoing relationship implied besides the affiliate codes with is optional for the model and is just an opportunity for her to make money off of the promo of the hair.  So upon reading this I was taken back and trying to decide if I was just going to say NO or if I was going to negotiate further. I am very busy in general and sleep about 4 hours a day so i only have time to deal with this on the weekends. so a few days pass by and I let her know she will get a response by the weekend and she says okay. so she calls me first thing saturday morning and i was sleeping so she sent me a long message about how she isn't going to chase me down and I need to remove her photos and I can't use them now. This is all because I didn't answer the phone because i was sleep. As soon as I woke up I returned her call and she says I have been dodging her calls (she NEVER called me outside of this one day and I spoke to her mom TWICE so I am confused about what she is talking about). She says I have had months and months to respond to her. she is delusional because me and the photographer didn't even know she existed until June 15 so it hasn't even been ONE month yet. And I didnt have her contact info until the day of the shoot (July 2). So I am not sure what months and months she is talking about. She has called everyone and basically cursed everyone out saying everyone is lying to her and we are all confused. so i have a couple of questions:  1)since she never signed the contract or a model release, can she say that me and the photographer can't use her photos even though it is what we initially agreed on? 2) Who owns the photos : me, the photographer or the model? 3) does she have any recourse for me posting her photos on social media after she posted them first?  I am just over this chick and I am completely ready to sever the relationship but I do not want to do so if it means I have to pay the photographer to remove her out of all the photos but I am strongly considering it. She hasn't had a problem until literally today (July 15)"	Yes
69	I've been writing some episodes of an animated series I plan to post on YouTube in the future, after my animation skills improve. A few of the episodes, however, have scenes that take place in an amusement park. My animations are hand-drawn (I never could figure out computer animation, and I think traditional/2D looks better anyway).  To hopefully avoid the tremendous work that would be animating these rides from scratch, I briefly considered building a replica of the amusement park in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, taking some videos, and tracing the images to use in my animated series. But before I decide to do this, would it get me in any legal trouble?  A few notes:  1. Credit would be given to the makers of RCT3.  2. I would only be tracing the rides themselves (and possibly some scenery)  3. I don't plan on making money off of this series	Yes

A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results.   2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.    After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.  Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.  He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..    My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.    We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.  We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.  Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.   TL;DR client hired us and did a chargeback which we won, now is threatening legal action in the form of criminal complaints if we do not refund him."	Yes
73	My friends and I love watching movies and making fun of them. It was suggested that we make a YouTube series of us doing this, and so I did some reasearch at this seems like it could be a fun hobby. I was going to have us sitting around with mics, and then show the movie as we are watching it at the bottom of the screen. It occurs to me though that the movie is under copyright, but I don't know exactly what that protects.  So what does the copyright prevent me from doing. Can I show the movie? If not, is there another way to do it that will make it legal?  Thank you in advance.	Yes
74	I want to make a brand of cat plush toys and coloring books. I was planning on naming it Mushu, but the dragon from the Mulan movie has that name. I searched the trademark website and it said the trademark for that is 'dead.' So would it be okay to use that name for the company and the products?	Yes
75	"Most of the ""fair use"" discussions that I've seen on here focused on either musical parodies or graphic IP's but I'd like to see if ""fair use"" extends to things like a plot structure. Here's some context:  Right now, I'm hoping to make a comedic puppet series that bases it's plot on Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" In doing so, I will certainly rename the characters/locations but will most likely use the archetypes (doctor, judge, church lady, etc.) and the general plot structure (10 people go to an island where one is killed off each day). It would be a comedic riff on the book and not much outside of it thus disqualifying for satire (as I understand it) and I can't imagine it would have any positive or negative affect on the original copyrighted material. So is there any sort of legal precedent any of you know might know of that addresses comedic literature-to-film adaptations?   For what it's worth, the book was published in 1939, Agatha Christie is no more, and I'd say most people are familiar with it. I doubt that makes a difference but I thought it might.  Oh, and I live in the United States and may post it on YouTube which I understand has its own set of rules n such.  TL;DR version: Is a re-named comedic adaptation of an old, well-known IP a bad idea or not? Thanks, friends-in-law!"	Yes
76	I'll try to keep this short and keep as little reference to names or job titles as possible. Basically, about 6 years ago I met a girl who had semi-famous parents and I ended up marrying. During the course of our relationship, I suggested starting a YouTube channel and various social media with her father who was a professional athlete. My intent was to build a brand around it under the idea that eventually my wife and I would take over once they retire and that we could live off of the fame and publicity (my wife also became a pro athlete after I convinced her to let her father mentor her). Everything was fine, until she decided it would be a good idea to cheat on me and move to a completely different state with the dude randomly. I waited and tried to reconcile with her for over a year with no luck and it tore me up extremely badly. She also ran off with the majority of our assets and money and left me with very little. So not only did my wife disappear over night but also my career. She and her family also refused to give me my filming equipment back until just recently we had it court ordered back to me next month. Over the period with the drama between my wife and I, my in-laws approached me about buying me out in both person and through text. I informed them that I still wanted to wait and see if my wife returned before I made any big decisions, and I was also concerned about whether she would try and claim it as community property or not and if I would get in trouble for selling before we reached a settlement. Everything was created before we were married, so that's not the problem. The problem is that eventually they texted me wanting to buy me out still and after consulting with my family lawyer they thought that if I could get an offer that we could draft up a contract that would legally absolve any possible right my wife had to the stake in IP and social media. I asked them to give me an offer and they did not. After a couple of weeks I was then informed that they were suing me and placing a restraining order against me (even thought I had not voluntarily contacted them in over a year). Since we were family, we had no formal contract- But the agreement always was that I kept the revenue from the channel in exchange for building her dads fame and increasing his value  (which it did EXPONENTIALLY). The YouTube account and all contracts associated are all under my name. The Logo was also created by me and I have all original photoshop, sony vegas, and over 7 TB of footage and pictures to show my ownership- But hiring an IP lawyer is going to cost me a minimum of a $20,000 retaining fee. And I have very little money thanks to my wife taking everything with her and my inability to get my equipment back to be gainfully employed normally. I feel like they are trying to back me into a corner so that I settle for much less than it's worth or just give it up. But this is the last 6 years of my life work and I would prefer if I could at least get some startup money for a future venture of my own so that I can start new. What should be my next step? We're talking potentially millions of dollars worth of value in assets and I know that he is feeling the hurt and pressure from his sponsors otherwise he wouldn't be trying to get it so badly. Especially given the fact that he always belittled my work and acted as if it had no actual value to him (even though he always wanted to continue doing it).   Hopefully this is easy to understand. This is a throwaway account just for the record because I'm not sure if names getting out would hurt me or just them.	Yes
77	After 5 long months (3 of which I was backpacking), I finally got my logo finalized with said company.  When I asked them to send me the logo, they said I legally can't use the logo because it has not been copyrighted and technically they own the logo however I paid for the design.  Now they want me to pay $250 dollars for the copyright.   My question is, if they send me the finalized logo (which some reviews say they wont unless you pay for the copyright), can I use it as a image for my company.  I will be selling to some online retailer platforms and want to make sure they do not sue me in the future.  The company itself has been reviewed as a scam but they seem legitimate.  However, when you actually deal with them, all the things they say they would do in the package you bought, they will either sluggishly do it or not do it at all. Definitely the most frustrating experience I have ever had. Total lack of commitment and so much dishonesty with this company.  All I want is the logo so I can move on with my life and not do anything to have them bother me in the future	Yes
78	"**USA/Louisiana**  I really don't know anything about LLC/trademark/copyright. In all likelihood, the app won't take off. But let's just assume it does. What should I do legally for protection against whatever it is that could happen? I've read some answers around the web about how I should create a second Google account to release on (if Google had a problem with my app they could disable the account it was uploaded with, and that could be my personal account). So I know to do that. But what else should I be doing? I want to be making revenue from the app via ads + in app purchases, but I have no idea how that works legally.   **Do I need to be a ""company"" (LLC?) and not an individual to receive the money?**   **Would it be BEST if I released the app as company and not an individual?**   **What do I need to do to prevent someone from taking my unique app/brand name? (trademark/copyright?)**  **Is there anything else I should be thinking about doing to best protect my creation?**  Hopefully these questions aren't too basic for this sub. Thanks for your time"	Yes
79	As a naive recent college graduate, I came upon an opportunity to work on a side project for a small business owner. We agreed that it would be a side project and I had to get permission from my full-time boss before I could take the project on (proactively avoid any conflict of interests situation).          My boss said he thought it wasn't the best idea because he didn't want my focus being pulled away from any client I would be working for at my full time job, but ultimately was okay with me doing the side project (with the caveat of no phone calls for side project while at a client site, and my full time job always comes first). I communicated this situation to the small business owner and he was okay with the situation.         Long story short, I completely underestimated the project (right out of college, estimation abilities weren't based on reality) and had to enlist the help of 3 other acquaintances to help. We all were working on the project on and off for over a year and there was still some minor development work to be completed plus user testing/bug fixes at the time of him deciding to call off the project.         Over the course of the year he paid me two payments of equal amount and he paid me as a 1099 employee (the second payment only for the sake of being able to include it in his 2016 taxes). From the first payment I used almost all of it to pay 3 work friends for their help. Almost half of the second payment ended up going towards paying my own taxes from the 1099 income.         At the end of 2016/beginning of  2017 his business took a huge hit after losing a major client, and he had to downsize to the point where he might be quitting altogether/finding some other opportunity. In the stress of his business falling apart all of the sudden, he burned a lot of bridges and took a lot of his stresses out on others. During this time he told me that we were going to have to scrap the project because he no longer really had a use for it.         Now, about a month later, he calls me and basically says that he doesn't have a finished product to show for his money and he wants it all back, even if we have to come up with a monthly payment plan. I brought up my time and energy spent on the project and he basically told me that my time doesn't matter, I was supposed to give him this product and I didn't so I owe him everything back. I even told him how half what he paid me had gone to outside help for his project, a large portion to taxes, and I only had a small portion left to show for my own efforts and time; to which he basically replied that that was on me and that my time and efforts are worthless and that if I didn't pay him back he would have no choice but to get his lawyer(s) involved.   So, r/legaladvice, am I pretty much screwed in this situation, or would I even stand any kind of chance in court? He decided to give up on the project and he paid me as a 1099 employee, does that matter in this kind of scenario? I know he is trying to recoup from losses in his business, but just because my efforts are less tangible in his mind (lines of code), it shouldn't discredit my hundreds of hours of effort.  Any help or advice would be appreciated!	Yes
80	I formed an LLC with a couple of friends last year. My two partners now wish to leave and give me full control over the LLC. What documents do I need to get them to sign to gain full control over the LLC? Thank you!	Yes
81	"A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him.   I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers.   The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on.   Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon.   A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design.   Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success.   We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.   We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either).   Would love some advice! Thank you in advance."	Yes
82	Like the title states a friend and I have come up with a fun little idea and we want to build it and try market it. It would be named after a video-game character.  Any advice on whether or not this would be legal? Or any good resources on where to see if the name is still trademarked?  Thank you in advance!	Yes
83	Hi r/legaladvice,   I'm considering forming a travel management company in New York State, helping individuals and possibly small businesses research, plan, and book travel arrangements (air, hotel, ground transport, activities, etc).  Instead of being viewed as a full blown travel agency, I prefer to position myself as a consultant/assistant and would essentially be booking these arrangements direct with the suppliers (airlines, hotels, etc) on behalf of the client.   I plan on getting errors &amp; omissions insurance, as well as forming an LLC to protect my personal assets, and also have the clients sign a credit card authorization form or something of the like when I go to book for them. My question is, do I need some sort of legal terms and conditions that my clients have to agree to before making arrangements for them?  Any advice or info is appreciated, and let me know if more info is needed.   Thanks so much!	Yes
84	Hello I previously worked at a organization that had an IMax theater where we showed Star Wars Episode 7. One day after work I went to throw something in the dumpster and found the entire movie in 70mm film. I quickly loaded about 500 feet of film into my car, took it home, cleaned it, and boxed it away. I no longer work at this organization.  My question is if there are any legal issues that could arise from me selling individual frames of the 70mm film online.	Yes
85	Hello, curious about IP in the US and have a few questions. Whenever you visit a convention (Comiccon etc) there are always a ton of artists selling fan-art.   What's the legality behind that? Is it just a matter of companies not going after small time artists and hoping they don't notice you? Is there a difference between selling a drawing of a companies character in their original costume vs designing a costume with that character in it? Does it matter?  What about accepting commissions to draw a companies IP?  With those out of the way - I plan on selling original artwork of my own design at conventions starting next year. What can I do to protect myself? How would you go about income tax (Specifically MO/KS tax laws regarding artwork sold)or licensing original content? If someone stole artwork from me what would be my best course of action?  Thanks for your help!	Yes
86	"Hi r/legaladvice,   This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.   I'm gathering preliminary sources and images for a book idea that I have. This book would consist mainly of images, illustrations, and hand-drawings that _mostly_ come by way of the Library of Congress or government agencies. The Library of Congress states that the government works hosted on their site *""are also available for worldwide use and reuse under CC0 1.0 Universal.""* However, they also state *""you should determine for yourself whether or not an item is protected by copyright or in the public domain, and then satisfy any copyright or use restrictions when publishing or distributing materials from our collections.""*   My concern is that second snippet.   - How can I verify that a work is truly in the public domain (or equivalent license)?    - If I do publish an image that I find out is not in the public domain after publication, what options do I (and the copyright holder) have?    - What sites or services can you recommend that will ensure I only use works that are in the public domain?   Thanks for any and all information."	Yes
87	Hello Reddit. I wanted to see if someone could give me some steps to follow to begin work on expunging my felony record in Wyoming? I was charged with delivering a schedule 3 substance and also conspiracy about 15 years ago. I received 2 yrs probation (completed with no issue) for the charges and have not even had a speeding ticket since! I am a totally different person now with a great paying job and a family of 4 that I support. I want to put this behind me for good and would like to be able to vote or have a gun to protect my family if needed. I looked it up and it seems that in Wyoming I would not be disqualified from expungement with my charges but I do not know the first step in getting started. Of course I could start calling lawyers but I thought I would check here first to see if there is anything I can do on my own to save that expense. I am now living in a different state (thank god!) that is far away from there so I can’t just stroll into the local courthouse for help. Thanks in advance for any tips!	No
88	Basically I have a friend who is determined to legally change her name every 5 - 10 years. Her reasons are not nefarious but bizarre. She has already changed her full legal name three times and intends to continue. I think, even though she's not doing it for criminal reasons, that she is opening herself up to problems down the road.  The following is a fictitious example of what kind of name change has occurred:  Lauren Miriam Brown to-&gt; Elizabeth Jadzia Tolson to-&gt; Ava Vivian Grimes	No
89	I don't know if this belongs here or if any of you can help me but I live in Florida, I got married in November of last year, and I recently decided to change my name. My husband has two last names and I only wanted to take the first of the two names. I got it taken care of at the Social Security office last week, my name is changed on my SS card and it is exactly as I wanted, it went great.  Well,I had my appointment with the DMV to change my license today and they told me I absolutely cannot do that, Social Security shouldn't have let me just take one of his last names because he has two last names on our marriage license. They told me either I need to take both names, he has to change his name, or I have to petition the courts.  He's an immigrant and can't change his name in this country without a ridiculous amount of problems, I don't want to take both last names for personal reasons, and It's like $300 to petition for a name change here.   Something about this feels not quite right; I'm not changing his last name, I'm just electing to take only one of the names. Is there anything I can do or any law about names/changing that I can reference to hopefully prevent me from having to petition the courts? Is this fishy to anyone else? Do I need to just bite the bullet and petition for the change?	No
90	Okay I was driving on the far left lane left lane from a 3 lane street. I see a driver in my rear view and side mirrors driving like a f***ing maniac so I keep my eye on him. Once he is done swerving in and out of traffic he now has a complete clear road in the lane he is in (the middle lane). I see him accelerating SUPER fast as we are approaching a red light and immediately I know he is about to cause an accident: either he is going to rear end the truck in front of him or he is going to try to overtake my car and swoop in front of me but theres no way that he could make it. I couldn’t get out of the way because this all happened in a matter of seconds. So I’m still in the left lane and he car is slowly passing mine and I see his car coming closer to mine and literally he just switches lanes as if I wasn’t there and pushed my car into the curb then swerved back out to the right after impact (there was nowhere to go as he was literally squishing my car against the curb). Now here is my issue: this accident is clearly his fault but he is telling his insurance that I swung out from behind him and got over when he was starting to merge. My issue with his statement is that either way it goes (even though my story is what TRULY happened) both stories indicate that I was 100% in the left lane as he was merging. Wouldn’t he be at fault either way? His insurance is saying it’s a dispute of facts but its really just two different versions story which ultimately have the same point: Driver failed to yield when merging. Am I misunderstanding something. I honked at him for a few seconds which I guess he didn’t hear. I drive a BMW (small car) and this guy drives a Ford F-150 which huge tires. I am almost positive he didn’t even see me at all.   Please help.	No
91	So my family and I are have been living in this apartment for a about two and a half months. We have had many maintenance issues since we have lived here, the worst of which has been a build up of mold in our air vents. We have reported this issue to management several times. Recently they told us they are were contracting a company to clean the air ducts. The day that they supposedly cleaned our air ducts no body was home. When I got home that day the maintenance man was still here and told me that the vents had been completely cleaned. I had a feeling that he was not being truthful so I decided to check the vents for any signs of mold. Sure enough the vents were still full of mold. I have documented all of the moldy vents with video and photographs. We plan on contacting corporate about this issue. What other legal options might we have in this situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!	No
92	"Would welcome your advice if I need to see a lawyer as well, and if so, what type.   I live in Virginia, and was driving in a construction zone in Washington, DC.  There was a flash and a camera recorded me speeding.  A $100 ticket was mailed to me.  However, due to health issues, I just opened my mail, and I missed the original deadline, so now the fine is $200.     But DC offers this option ""Admit with Explanation"" where I admit liability and explain by mail or in-person. An examiner will review my explanation and consider reducing my fine.     However, I can't tell if my insurance would increase if I admit fault.  This is my first speeding ticket EVER. I can write that I have a clean record and this was unintentional.  Should I mention my medical issues for my delayed response?  How do I find out if my insurance rates will increase if I admit to this ticket?  Thanks."	No
93	My former roommates and I rented a house for one year, and we moved out at the end of May as the lease said.  Only days ago we received separate invoices telling us how much money we would get back after damages to the house, late fees, etc.  We want to go to small claims and get either our full security deposit back or double the amount as per NH law.  Am I correct that the law says we should get double our security deposits back because we received no deposit or invoice within a month of us leaving the premises?   My only concerns are that they might argue the damages took longer than 30 days to fix (a couple fist sized holes in the wall) or our lease didn't specify how long they could take to return our deposits, but are those points legit?	No
94	I used to live in a house with 4 other people and we finally (after 2 months) received a bill from the previous landlord of the damages we owed. I moved in last year and took the room from a friend and when I moved in there was no walkthdough or anything. My former roommates had moved in two years prior and there was no walk through at all when they moved in. The previous tenants before there were friends as well, and they had left a lot of stuff in the house before they had moved in. They landlord actually charged us less rent because the carpets were already so bad and she was going to replace them anyway.

We expected not to get our deposit back and we she did the final walk through with us before we moved out she did not mention anything major to fix or clean and she said was don't expect your deposit back. This house is a modern house, probably built early 00's but still has seen a lot of wear and tear over the years and we did not cause all this damage. Any help would be appreciated, thank you all in advance!	No
95	Hello, I just changed my name and got my updated license and social security card with all the new information. I plan to update my bank accounts and credit cards next. I just want to cover my bases and make sure I'm not forgetting anything important.  Is there any sort of checklist after a name change? I graduated from college a few years ago, do I need to contact them and have them send me an updated diploma or something just in case I need proof of graduation in the future?   Thank you for your help	No
96	So I am divorcing first and foremost as a preface. Awhile back my soon to be ex wife setup her child support from her first child with another man to be deposited in my banking account. I have sole access and rights on this account still. There recently was a large deposit through the state enforcement office of back child support paid out to her that was deposited into my account. I won't go into detail why but am I in a legal state if I refuse to withdraw and give this money over to her? Yes it sounds scummy but I have my reasons. I just wanted to ask. Thank you in advance.	No
97	I'll start at the beginning. My boyfriend &amp; I moved out of a crappy apartment in North Dakota. We moved into a nicer apartment with the same company, different offices. So my boyfriend drops off the check for rent ($700) at new apartment. A few days later, we get a call we owe late fees and rent. We show them we gave them the check for rent. They say they'll figure it out. That was almost 2 months ago. So now they called and said they messed up and gave the rent check to the old apartment. On our move out check, we got back $644. (They took over $800 for cleaning, replacing blinds, etc.) So now they're saying it's their fault for losing the check but we still owe them the $700 for first month rent. We barely scrape by as is so finding another 700 is beyond me. Is there any legal binding for me to pay the rent that they used and misplaced? They did use the money, they just accidentally gave it back a portion.	No
98	This summer i moved in with some randoms at a college townhouse.The were terrible roomates.They were so messy and nasty that i was too ashamed to invite anyone.I decided to sign a lease at another apartment.I told the roomates but they claim i didnt tell them ahead in time enough.They want me to sign this next years lease so they wont loss there deposit. Even though they already found someone else.(they want me to sign so they wont loss there. Deposit)The lease ends tommorow and i just want to move out and not have to deal with them .Im starting to think that they might be plotting to get me stuck in a contract.	No
99	Hello,  2 days ago I leased an apartment, got everything paid for, and this friday i was going to move in everything I owned from my current apartment.  I live with my girlfriend (now ex) and she has become a complete nightmare. Even physically abusive (lots of scratching) and instigates verbal fights at least 3 times a day. I wanted to remove her name from the lease and not let her move in to my new apartment. I'm the only one paying for every single one of our expenses (she doesn't contribute a single cent) so I'd still be able to afford the apartment anyways. She doesn't want to move out because she would have to go back to her moms house and she wants to stay in the apartment where she can be a a tyrant and be extremely abusive to get things her way (her mom controlled her instead when she lived at her mom's house). I want to know what I can do to kick this person out while avoiding having to sue her or taking her to court on abuse charges. The reason for that is that I just want to get a far away from her as possible and never have to deal with her again.	No
100	I'm a new small business in Pennsylvania and tenant that was transferred ownership of an existing business franchise. We discovered building maintenance using our private internet business network for the separate apartment residences above, building security cameras and keypad entry for tenants. Can I face eviction for cutting off lessors unauthorized use of our business internet?  After discovering the internet use I cut them off because it was causing massive malware and email problems which shut our business down intermittently over a period of two weeks or more as our corporate representative was setting up our store, and it stopped after blocking their IP address through our service provider router software.  I contacted maintenance via text message of my findings with a photo of the unknown cabling on our network, which lied to me about my finding, saying it was only for power until I finally asked a series of questions (because it didn't make sense) and he finally admitted that it was for internet use and claims he had an verbal agreement (not in lease) with the previous owner and after following up on that claim, the owner never would have agreed to internet use. It turns out they were connected to our network switch 3-4 years prior without consent of previous owner, and used our service as new owners for a period of about 30 days.  Since then they've harassed, retaliated and stonewalled us by not maintaining the building, physically and verbally threatened us inside our business space twice and police reports have been made.  The first time the mainentance came in without notification and got in my face in front of my customers, who saw what was happening and responded by getting up to defend me, claiming we were now using the buildings electricity to power our network equipment.  The second time we called a formal meeting between property manager and maintenance to discuss responsibilities of both parties as new tenants and clarification as we are riding out the existing lease on the previous owners personal guarantee and landlords and franchise consent. The maintenance manager nearly came across the counter at me in anger and called me out to fight in the street. The property manager asked maintenance to leave the meeting afterwards. I called the police a few hours later after calming down. Ultimately, we agreed to put the equipment in our space to stop use of building electricity. We made arrangements hired IT service and requested equipment move from our service provider to relocate the equipment to our space.  Service provider was able to do their move and the IT services later that day was locked out of the area and not allowed to finish which left network cabling running on the high-traffic floor which creates a trip hazard which property manager admits in an email that should suffice and doesn't need to be bothered anymore. We tried all avenues to bring this matter to a close; IT services was told that we are not the tenant and never returned their calls or email requests; Previous owner was not able to reason with property manager; our attorney who is a customer called on our behalf; city police also called maintenance from our storefront and nothing will make them comply.  The property manager has high level position (we assume managing partner of building) with a large commercial real estate company who is responsible for that individuals brokerage license. This individual has a web page with many accreditations, but after following up on many of them we've discovered that we couldn't even file a complaint with the realtors associations because there was no current licences under that name. Also we've discovered that our rent checks are deposited to an entirely different account number and name than the LLC on the lease. The building maintenance and property manager are clearly in a relationship, but not openly, which is possibly a conflict of interest among the other ethical violations we've experience from this property manager and staff.  The property manager is now trying to get me to sign an assumption of lease after 6 months of us taking over the lease and the previous owner did notify her of the business transfer, introducing us partners as new business owners. We pay our monthly rent on time, are for responsible in the lease, among other things, for an HVAC unit with a value of about $10,000 however we are afraid they won't let our HVAC technician in to service the unit since they refused to let the IT technicians finish the job that was at their request. We only want to run our new business and are happy with the location and didn't want to disrupt the relationship with the property manager and maintenance.	No
101	"I'll try to be as brief as possible.  It's my senior year. My school is trying to make me get on a mandatory meal plan. They changed to a new provider with a new requirement that all students purchase it (it makes the school money). I already lived off campus so I could cook my food and because of my mental health am not always able to go to a huge dining hall with hundreds of other people every single time I want to eat. I would just eat at home but I can't both pay for the plan and buy food.   I have anxiety and depression as diagnosed by a medical professional. The school knows this and has known it for three years because they give me accommodations.  When I spoke with a woman in the accessibility office (who has not answered any of my questions in a timely or complete manner), she told me there is no longer a medical meal plan option and that students who used to have one would have to work with the dining company in the first week of school to work out a good solution. I know for a fact that since my refusal is rooted in a health issue this could be breaking HIPAA among other things (please let me know). It smells really illegal and discriminatory.   Does the Americans with disabilities act make it illegal to force me to go to the dining hall? Title 9? What legal language should I use? Interested in any and all suggestions.  One girl said the school wouldn't help her until she used the words ""eating disorder"" so I'm thinking about trying that. But I still have a diagnosed mental illness and can get a medical professional to request accommodations accordingly, so it still feels like they should not be able to sweep me under the rug legally even though my illness' connection to food might fall in a grey area according to some people.   Please help me fight my school that only cares about my money and not my health. I'm mad."	No
102	Basically as title says. Got my son a contract with sprint, hes 16 so I pay for everything, got him a brand new LG V20 with a lease style contract under the condition that he worked for his uncle on the weekends.   Well 16 year olds will be 16 year olds and he skipped out on more than 7 days worth of work. So punishment was I returned the phone to sprint and got him a basic flip phone with no data.   I returned the phone to a corporate sprint store and paid a 35 restocking fee. I have a digital receipt from the store that shows the model and serial number of the phone returned.   Somehow sprint lost the phone between the time I was given a receipt and now.   They sent me a bill for 423.72.   100 of that is my monthly payment and the other part is the cost of the phone I returned.   I called last month when this happened and filed a dispute. Heard nothing back from them.   This month I receive a pay or disconnect notice for the outstanding balance of 320 for the price of the phone. So I called very mad  but kept my cool. Talked with a supervisor and she seemed very helpful until the end. She said she would start another claim and it would be a week for the resolution.   I asked her what happened with the first dispute and she said there was no resolution. I asked her what that means and she said she was unsure. She said she would place a hold on my account for the 320 to make sure it does not disconnect my service, but that hold would expire at the end of the claim.   Well that happened today. I called again and made sure to speak to the same lady. I even waited on hold for 45 minutes to make this happen. She tells me that the claim was denied. No reason for the claim being denied was given.  I asked her if she had the receipt. She said no. I sent her my digital copy of the receipt. She agreed that his was an official receipt and was able to verify it in the system. But that I still owe for the phone.   She has a receipt that she agrees is legit showing I returned the phone. So I did my part here. How can she claim I owe her money for a phone I followed procedure with? IS there any legal ground for her to say I owe for an expensive phone they lost?  Texas if that matters.	No
103	I'm sure there are a ton of posts like this on here but non of my searches turned up anything. So to start off with I reside in the state of Nevada. My SO and I are currently separated. I have moved out of our apartment and am currently in custody of our infant son my SO visits with him a couple times a week but is pushing for more visits. We are currently in marriage counseling but it is not going well and I am thinking of divorce. What would I be getting myself into as far as custody goes if we divorced and I sought sole custody? Is there such a thing as having majority custody of him? I would like to move with him out of state, would I be able to do that if we shared custody of him?	No
104	In my lease you're encouraged to have staff do a walkthrough when you're moving out of the apartment. I called to make that appointment and they basically said they don't usually do that. They didn't say they wouldn't, just that it wasn't something they thought was necessary, I guess.    Should I insist and have them come anyway? If I do, what do I have them do/sign so it's not pointless? I'll be taking pictures either way.	No

106	My roommate and I recently moved out of a rent home and our landlord is deciding to keep our entire $1300 deposit. Her reasoning is that we didn't provide a 30 day notice, which technically is true, but we provided a 26 day notice. This is primarily because our lease was weird, and so there was some confusion on when our lease was up. We moved in the middle of July 2016, but we didn't actually sign our lease until September or October, because our landlord was out of town. I had assumed our lease started when we signed the lease, but my roommate and I weren't sure of the exact date, so on July 5th we contacted her to ask when our lease was up and she said July 31st. My roommate gave his notice on the 5th and I gave mine on the 6th (I assumed since we were both on the lease only one of us needed to give notice, but I decided to be safe and give my notice as well). She seemed cool with it and even asked me to show the house for her while she was out of town, which I did. However, now that we are out she is claiming that because no one has rented it yet and our late notice she is keeping our entire deposit. We left nothing there and the house was clean when we moved out, which we have pictures and videos of. I should mention, my roommate cannot find our copy of the lease. I was thinking about asking her to send me a copy? I'm not entirely sure this makes a difference, but we live in Oklahoma. Any advice would be appreciated.	No
107	"My wife and I recently got married and headed over to the social security office in our city to change her name. She decided that she ""hates"" her middle name and thus requested it to be changed to her mothers first name. Normally, they don't ask you questions about a maiden name change if you have your marriage license on you.   Long story short the name got changed and about a month later, which is today, we headed into the DMV to update her license to a newer version with her new name on it. They told us at the DMV that the name was changed without a petition of the court indicating a lawful name change. How can I get this fixed? Why did the social security office allow us the get the name changed if it is unlawful? What course of action should I take?    Thank you for reading my long post.    TL; DR: Wife and I got married, tried to change her middle name to something unrelated, social security did it, DMV told us we messed up and sent us to the clerk court, now we either pay money to fix it, or change her name back."

109	Backstory:  Bought my home in Aug 2016.  This is a Phase 2 of a 3 phase development.  There is about 40x40 feet of common area between my property and a drainage ditch.  (see photos at bottom of post)  When I bought the property I was told by my builder that the area would be maintained and sodded to look nice and maintained by the HOA.  Fast forward to March of 2017.  We've engaged the developer and HOA to find out when this common area was going to be developed.  It was basically a wild grass field and was causing weed problems on my property and looked awful.  No response to multiple inquiries.  In May, the developer calls me and asks if I want to take over control of the property with an easement.  They would level and SOD it and extend my water/sprinkler system on to it.  I'd have to water, mow, edge, weed control, everything.  I politely declined and told them it was common area and needed to be handled by the HOA and Developer, including setting it up correctly and maintaining it.  It's already expensive to water and maintain my property, and I'm not paying to maintain HOA controlled property.  Another 2 months pass, we've been going back and forth.  I offer to let them use my water if they pay me for it and they need to maintain the lot.  The developer thinks that's ok and says he'll get back to me.  I speak to one of HOA board members and she said its not fair to compensate me for water and other common areas (Common areas behind property) are maintained at home owners expense if they want anything beyond mowing.  I told her I felt that was a poor decision and because the property is on the SIDE of my home and attached to my property it looks like MY PROPERTY and thusly if they don't properly setup this lot it makes my property look bad.  Regardless, I was ignored.  A week later, without notice, they come out and level the lot and hydroseed it.  No water hooked up to it, nothing.  2 days later, we have a storm blow through (common for OKC) and 25% of the hydroseed blows away.  Keep in mind, Common areas attached to the side of a property in our development are all SODDED with water hooked up to maintain it.  Phase 1 is like this in every case.  The two pictures attached are from May 24th and July 17th, 3 weeks post Hydroseeding.  The lady at the HOA isn't responding to me.  I'm ready to call the developer, but wondering if I should just wait until November at the HOA annual meeting to file a formal request to fix.  My options as I see it today are:  1.  redo the entire lot myself (over my dead body) 2.  Wait until November and file a formal request to fix the lot and setup water on it + RESOD. 3.  Hire and attorney and send a demand letter to resolve and if ignored, file suit to force them to resolve.  Pictures:  http://imgur.com/a/Uyqtd    Thanks in advance, Mackie	No
110	The situation is my sister was enrolled in a dual enrollment high school program at a local university where she went and lived on campus to take classes. My parents were not involved in any of the application or enrollment process and neither saw nor signed any paperwork. For context, She is not on good terms with my parents and has a long history of behavioral issues. They weren't really told anything about this program.  My sister told my parents when asked about how she would pay that she had money saved from working at Starbucks and had taken a student loan.  My parents later found out that there was in fact no loan or money and that the huge tuition bill was due. My sister is 17 (18 in two months) and is still technically a minor.  The university is making lots of threats to my parents if they don't pay. However, they never knew about any of this or signed any paperwork to make them liable for a $10,000+ bill.   Legally, can the school come after my parents for this?	No
111	"Hi, I'm in the UK currently, and I'm 18 years old. My mum and dad had a really bad breakup.Me and my Dad are moving to Canada in a few weeks, and while my dad is in Canada looking for a house, I've been staying with my Mum. Long story short she let me borrow a laptop, and she left her Facebook logged in when I went to use it. I saw a message that mentioned my name so I used the search bar in the messages to find other messages mentioning me.   She mentioned to two separate people that she wants to 'Go buy some illegal drugs and stuff them in (dad's) suitcase.' Obviously intending to cause issues at the airport and stop us from flying, possibly even worse.   She also mentioned ""Someone left their keys here by accident... Must have had the wrong ones cut when I went to get a copy of our own house keys made"", implying that she purposely had a copy of my dads house key cut. She also says that she used this to find documents in my dads house that told her what part of the new city we will be living in, and where my dad will be working.  She explained to a friend how she was planning on putting a satellite tracker in my camera bag, talking about how its battery is good for 5 days, and how it is accurate to 5-15 meters.   IN this conversation she also mentions wanting to find where to get drugs to plant in my dads suitcase.   Other more minor things she talked about were an IP grabber to find our new IP and using this to find our new location, and giving me essential oils without me knowing to help me sleep. Obviously the oils are not as concerning as the other problems but still makes me uncomfortable.  Screenshots to see what I'm talking about:  http://i.imgur.com/IgGHwpe.png?2 Illegal key cutting, finding documents in my dads house leading to our new adress and his new workplace  http://i.imgur.com/ozSoLnx.png?3  Wanting to plant drugs in my Dads suitcase, the satellite tracker  http://i.imgur.com/ZtT4P6e.jpg?1  Another conversation where she mentions putting drugs in my dads bags  http://i.imgur.com/TClYiXv.png?1  Family friend telling her how to use grabify to get our new ip/find our location  Any help would be appreciated on what to do, is it possible to get a restraining order based on this? There are screenshots for proof in case she deletes the chat logs, she's also taken away the laptop and told me that I will have to find a place to stay until my dad is back and we move to Canada."

112	Hey all. Sorry if I come off as a noob when it comes to legal matters.  About 2 months ago, someone left a threatening note on my door. I was pretty certain it was my roommate's friend (let's call him michael) who I got kicked out of the apartment because he was staying there while my roommate wasn't. I filed a police report just to have it on record and notified the private security company that works for the apartment complex I'm staying at.  Just recently, while I was away for the weekend, someone broke in through my window and took my guitar and my speaker (roughly $500 - $600 in combined value). Also some of the walls are slightly damaged. I filed a supplemental police report. I strongly suspected it was Michael.   When I notified the security company, they sent one of their officers over to my unit just to ask me some questions. The officer said that he saw someone who fit Michael's exact description messing with my window and approached him and asked if he lived there. Michael told the officer that he was the one living in my unit. Then the officer just kept making his rounds around the complex.   Just this week, the apartment complex switched to a different security company. Idk if that's relevant or suspicious or anything like that. Just thought it was weird.  Really all I want is to be reimbursed for my losses, and to not be charged for damages to my apartment. Can I do anything about it? Would I have to go after the apartment complex or the security company?  Any input would be appreciated. Cheers!	No
113	We live in Virginia for starters. A little background I'm 24, my husband is 32. We've been together for 4 years and married for 3. We have one child together and have purchased a home while married.   He has been verbally and emotionally abusive to me for a long time now, and has cheated on me in the past. In recent events he's brought it to my attention that he's miserable and that this isn't the life he wanted for himself.   I've made it clear to him that the only thing I want out of this marriage is our daughter, I don't want spousal support, child support, none of the property. Just her.   The problem I've run into however is I currently don't have any means of acquiring any money, he's our sole bread winner.   So my question is, what the hell do I do.   I can't keep doing this with him, I'm at the end of my emotional threshold.	No
114	Ok, so the deal is my previous real estate agent wants me to pay for damages to one of the doors in my previous house. This has been a tiresome issue because the damage was ALREADY PRESENT when I had begun the lease. Being a young, ignorant first-time renter, I had neglected to bring this up, thinking that the agent already knew the damage was there.   Apparently not. Now, the landlord wants me to pay over $1000 to fix this door that I had no part in damaging. I understand now that it was my responsibility to bring this up when the lease began, but since the damage wasn't brought up in subsequent inspections, I assumed it was already a known issue.   My question: would it be adequate to write and sign a statutory declaration before a witness to prove that I was not responsible for the damage, and that it was already present when I moved in?   Would this be acceptable evidence to provide?	No
115	"About a year ago there was a fire at the house I rented. I smoke and I was honest with the fire department when they asked. The damage was mainly on the facade of the home with minimal damages inside- just mild smoke damage in one room. The neighbor reported hearing an ""explosion"" before noticing the fire outside. I was in the other part of the house when the fire started and I heard what I assumed was someone knocking on the door. When I went to open the door, my porch was on fire.  I did not have rental insurance. I had never rented before and I was not aware there was such a thing. Please do not tell me how stupid I am for not having insurance. I even asked my parents at one point in the moving process what to do if the area flooded (it is an area that floods every few years) and they said the homeowner's insurance covered my loss. I have since moved and I have rental insurance in my current place.  Anyway, I just checked my mail and there is a collections bill in the amount of almost $15,000. The bill says I was found responsible for the fire and that I need to pay the bill in full, immediately. I am a college student working 20 hours a week making barely enough to cover rent and food. I have no way to pay this and no way to afford a lawyer. My family isn't able to help me out either.   After the fire the person I rented from had me evicted to terminate my lease and stated the reason for eviction as I refused to give her back the property when she requested. This wasn't true, as the eviction was filed the day after the fire and I was staying with friends. It's not relevant, but I was never informed of anything that would cause me to be held responsible for the fire. I never spoke with anyone and I never stated I caused the fire. A fire fighter asked me what happened, I told him I was in the other side of the house when I heard someone knocking at the door and when I opened the door I saw flames and called 911. He then asked if I was using a grill or other source of fire and I said no. Then he asked if I smoked. I said I did.   I don't know what, if anything I can do at this point. It seems like there has already been a judgement against me even though I was never informed of it.   What are my options here?"	No
116	I had some misdemeanor charges expunged at the start of the year.  I know at the county level it's complete. They made mention that it can take a bit more time at the state level.  I'm being offered a job and I need to fill out background check info. Im not sure if I should put it on there or not.  I know that some BG check companies 'cache' backgrounds so it might still be listed, but I can't find any info online about my case. The TN site doesn't show anything, but I'm not sure it ever did.  What should I do?	No
117	Hi everyone, hope I'm posting in the right place  We closed on an older (~35 years) home in early July, so we were expecting some issues. The owners was gracious enough to leave us receipts for some of the work they had done to the home. One of these receipts were for some foundation/crack patchwork they had done in the laundry room and the installation of a sump pump.  We had the home inspected and the inspector didn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary that we couldn’t see with our own eyes. There were some patent defects (i.e visible defects) so we made the informed decision to proceed with the purchase.  Fast forward to when took possession of the home.  We removed the basement carpet and noticed it smelled and there were some wet spots. We figured this was normal with an older home/older carpet so whatever. Then we explored the option of installing a window in the basement, so we took off the drywall and saw a big problem…a large crack in the foundation from top to bottom (where foundation meets the attached garage). When the house was being sown, this room had boxes and furniture in the area of the wall which made it impossible to see or feel the carpet  We called some foundation repair guys to fix the crack, which they did. But in the process, they noticed that the entire weeping tile surrounding the home was clogged with roots, which they said would be the reason the old owners installed the sump pump this past spring (right before they listed the home for sale)  So what was originally a ~$3000 crack repair job has turned into a ~$30,000 crack repair/excavation around the home/waterproof/weeping tile replacement job. They even had to break our garage floor and excavate down to the bottom to replace that piece of the weeping tile system  So, my question is…anyone have success with latent defect lawsuits (Ontario, Canada)? I know “Buyer beware” is at play in all real estate transactions, but with a crack big enough to put my hand in and the fact that they installed a sump pump prior to putting the house on the market leads me to believe they or the plumber or even the real estate agent  knew something was up.  TL;DR…Bought an older home only to discover a cracked foundation and clogged weeping tile system. We’re in for  ~$30,000 worth of repairs so far	No
118	I am a tenant at will on a month to month lease in LA and have lived in my apartment for 2 months. Recently the lease holder of my apartment had given a 30 day notice to one roommate and has made the living situation uncomfortable for me and my other roommate by sending aggressive texts, asking for bills they won't show us, and more recently taking the modem and router completely out of the apartment and leaving us with no internet.  This all seems extremely petty. Since I'm not on the lease I know I don't have much rights, but I'm worried about paying rent when I'm planning on leaving at the end of the month. At this point, I do t trust her to give back my security deposit.  The landlord is a bit mia and I haven't been able to contact her via phone. Would it be better to send her a certified letter stating my concerns and offering to pay her directly? If I do so can I ask her to sign an agreement that I will get my deposit back  by 9/21/17, which is Los Angeles law for returning a security deposit? Can I just not pay rent and stay until the end of the month? I'm not sure if I'm entitled to the same 30 day notice without a lease? Or do I just cut my losses and try to leave as soon as possible?   Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.   Tl;dr: lease holder is being extremely petty and trying to make all roommates move out. I moved in 2 months ago and am not sure what's the best way to get my security deposit back.	No
119	So we have a truck that recently broke down. It was moved less than a month ago when they decided to paint new parking space lines. My roomate had it set up to have a family friend pick up and get it fixed today. But it was towed yesterday before they could come.  We just talked to the managers, and they said that they let a tow company patrol here and tow whatever car they see fit.  But on our lease it says that they have to give us a ten day notice before towing a vehicle. I suspect this is not the first lease violation on there part.  They recently decided to stop taking money orders without sending us a notice, and we almost got screwed out of 1300 on rent.  They also refuse to fix a hole that was here before we moved in, that let's rain in. It was so bad, it ruined some of my roomate's things.  So are they repeatedly breaking our lease, or are we screwed until we move?	No
120	"throwaway account, I'm a guy.    Saskatchewan, Canada--I have had troubles with the tenants above me since October 2016 when I moved in, have had to request repeatedly in writing they stop harassing my family and so forth. The landlord can't do anything, he's not doing anything wrong himself and is an excellent guy. Other tenants and neighbors are flawless.    The people upstairs have gotten themselves some sort of heat-sensitive camera and are following my every move, down to my every little hand gesture. I can 'control' them from below by putting on a show. They follow me around. If I use the range or oven they react, if I light a lighter they all run over and see what's up.    Previous to their new toy, they would send their little 4-year-old girl out to try and see me naked when I got out of the shower. They would listen for the water to stop, then as soon as I stepped out of the tub they'd send her out to look in my window. My landlord said to 'get it on tape' but I don't want to be filming some little girl outside my window either.    Now I can't be myself in my home, they watch when I pee, when I jerk off (and the little girl squeals ""Ewww!"" when I do), then she gets all excited and runs outside and runs around to my window again. The tenants upstairs are abusing their little girl but I just want peace and quiet, quiet enjoyment of my suite, etc.    Is what they're doing legal? Is it child abuse if they're only watching a high-resolution heat signature? I am in a province where child abuse is swept under the rug, Social Services does nothing, police do nothing. I don't even know how to comprehend what is going on but they are disgusting, perverted people.    It's all-women upstairs and they come and go on schedule like employees. There's the retarded mom (fat with a mustache), her screetchy autistic perverted/abused daughter, and 2 or 3 big fat care workers ladies who rotate on a fixed schedule, arrive in taxis, leave on schedule. I think the single mom isn't allowed to be alone with her daughter but you get that much crazy all in one spot, no men, and the bored catty bitches amuse themselves by harassing the downstairs tenants.    The Landlord has done all he can, to the point where he said if we can't all get along he would evict the entire dwelling and start again, which is an empty threat--I have done nothing but avoid and react to this continued crazyness and I replied to him in writing saying I'd fight it and win because ""getting harassed by other tenants"" won't be grounds for eviction.    I want to build a heated faraday cage to block them out or take apart toasters and use the elements to create a heat shield or something, I mean... what can I even do? Are they breaking the law? If so, how can I even prove it? I don't know what to do, how would I even call the police to report it without sounding like a crazy person?"	No
121	"Hello, sorry for the poorly worded title.  My girlfriends sister is married to a sergeant on the local police force.  I don't know the full story between her sister and the husband, however he was extremely verbally abusive/manipulative last night.  He took her phone, her money, cards, purse.  Unsure how, but she got out of the house with the kids, borrowed a phone and called my gf to help her.  They went to a hospital because the sister was having a panic attack.  She was cleared and the doctor told her to leave our city because she cannot use our police if something happens.  She is in a neighboring city and is staying in hotel with the kids.  The husband called my girlfriends home, her dad answered.  The brother in law repeatedly said ""where is she"".  The dad repeatedly told him that she's safe and that he will not tell him.  I don't know anymore detail on the call other than that it was a long call and the son in law kept repeating ""where is she"".  This was at 1230am.  Then at 130pm the son in law shows up at the home and tries to enter!  Luckily the doors were locked.  He did not break anything but was there for an extended period of time shaking door knob! He's about 6'5"" 250lbs, so he could easily break it if he wanted.  A little more backstory on him.  He has an ex-wife that he always told us was crazy.  Never met her, don't know anything else about her except that he got everything in the divorce and their daughter is at his home every single time I've seen them.    I just found out about him showing up.  My girlfriend said in the text that she is afraid he is going to do something.    So far I have told her that the sister needs to contact a divorce attorney as soon as possible, but that was prior to him trying to enter my girlfriends home at 130am.  With him being a sergeant, will the police even do anything?    We don't know what to do, please help."	No
122	"So this is all happening right now and I'm looking for advice. My cat was lethargic and seemed pale so I took her to the vet. She needs a blood transfusion and they think she got into rat poison. My landlord came on July 21st to ""spray for insects"" but that's all the note said. I'm currently trying to get ahold of him to see what they sprayed. Would they be liable if it is what harmed my cat. The bill will be 1200+ and as a college student that will definitely hurt my current financial status. Any advice is appreciated thanks."	No
123	Ok so somewhat of a long story so bear with me! My younger brother has been dating this girl for a couple years and they have a 16mo old son together. They currently were living with our mother to save up some money. Normally they text all day while he's at work and one day he noticed she wasn't responding or answering any calls so he panicked and went home to check on her (she's a school bus driver and currently isn't working) and when he got home all of her and their stuff was gone and her phone was wiped clean and left on the counter. No note, nothing else left behind. Immediately he panics because his child and the person who he thought was the love of his life had vanished with no idea where or why they were gone. I advised him to go to the police (obviously) to which he had been sent back and fourth from CT police to Massachusetts police because they live in MA. Although their licenses say CT (a bit of a confusing mess because the baby technically lives in mass) So both PD'd basically tell him because they were never married that it's a civil matter and needs to file for a court date. He also decides to report her vehicle that she has stolen because it is legally his, registered and insured in only his name, or so he thought. CT police determine that its registered to her now, which means she forged his signature on the title and registered it in her name. After learning that he decides to file criminal charges for forgery, so an officer begins to help him with that. He also calls dcf to try and see if they will help to find out that she has claimed that he's is abusive, which is a lie, she has already admitted to falsely claiming abuse from him once before. She was arrested back in February for hitting him with a car, to which he felt bad and decided to drop the charges and take her back. He attempts to go to MA court and they tell him because they have licenses in CT that he needs to file there, and dcf had been in contact with her but cannot tell him where she is. He believes she might have gone to Virginia to be with a guy she cheated on him with once before. He decides to go through her phone she left and managed to find a way to contact her and they started talking through messenger in instagram. This whole time before that he's attempting to contact people who he knows would be in contact with her to relay messages that she's going to have felony charges in the hopes of her just deciding to return. It sort of works because he ends up getting a call from her saying basically, how can we make these charges go away, so he tries to say, bring my son to my house tonight and I'll call the officer and see if we can get the forgery charges stopped (he called the officer after to tell him she said she'd bring him home and told the officer to move forward with the charges still). So later he tried to contact her again to find out she blocked him again and changed her number, so it was all a ploy to get him to drop the charges. The CT officer advises him to apply for emergency custody at the court so that way the police can get involved with finding his son and maybe even put out an amber alert.  He goes and applies and is denied the emergency custody and receives a court date (August 10th) and here comes the next problem. He has to have her served, he needs to know where she lives to have her served. The dcf officer knows where she is but cannot legally tell him. The police tell him if he calls the marshals that they can get in contact with dcf to determine where she is to have her served. He contacts the marshals but they say that they cannot do that and he needs to give them an address. Today he receives a call from the police department that she had returned and dropped the vehicle off at the station and took off (she parked it and then called the station later to tell them it was there) so we know at least as of the last 12 hours she's back in the state, he calls the dcf officer and she was not aware she was back and tried calling her but the number was changed. The last time she spoke with her they video chatted and she claimed she saw the baby and he appeared to be ok, but she hadn't heard she was coming back and can't get ahold of her.  Today he called a lawyer and she claimed that if he can't get her served they'll just drop the case and he will have to re file, but that will be futile unless he can get her served, so basically she can just disappear with their child and there's nothing he can do about it because even with the warrant for the forgery he can't do anything, the officers told him it wasn't a charge thy would go over state lines for. He can't even manage to hire a lawyer because it's just too expensive. He's feeling a bit deflated and beaten down because he keeps basically not getting any help at every turn. All he wants is his son back. We are all so worried about the baby and I truly feel like if the situation was reversed there would have already been an amber alert and authorities everywhere looking for him.  She has a history of depression and other issues and we are honestly worried about the child. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the extremely long post!	No
124	"Texas.  Spouse out earns me by double. Just found he has not paid the mortgage in 3 months. Trying to force a short sale (mortgage is not in my name , house has joint deed).   I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about ""taking someone out."" When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality. I am an educated professional and a bit disgusted with myself that I allowed this to happen.  Maybe some of that is not relevant, i'll admit I am not thinking clearly. Fundamentally, what can I do about the house???"	No
125	"My wife, 1 year old and I recently moved into a house for rent in Pennsylvania. The landlord is an older man who owns multiple single family homes that he rents out in the area. Before signing the lease we informed him (in person) that we have a two dogs (70 lbs Goldendoodle and a 15 lbs mini weiner dog). At the time of the lease signing he had no issues with allowing the dogs to live in the house. Within the lease it includes that two dogs are allowed to live in the house with us. We never tried to hide the size of the larger dog and even made sure twice that he was aware of his size.   On the day of moving in the landlord expressed concern (without ever seeing the dog) that he wasn't sure if he wanted the dogs in the house (he said this to my wife as I was at work). Today, he showed up to the house to ""trim the hedges"" while we were not at home. My very well behaved and friendly, but protective dog was barking at the landlord through the back door. The landlord promptly called my wife saying that he does not want the dog in the house anymore and we are meeting this Sunday to talk about options in regards to the dog. When I called him back he said that he was afraid the dog was going to ""come out the window after him"" and was ""scratching the door"". I know my dog and all he does is bark and look out the window at strangers. I checked the metal door and there are no scratches on it at all, not even dirt marks.   The advice I am looking for is can he force me to remove the dog from the house. The lease was signed by my wife, the landlord and myself. The dogs were written in the lease that they were allowed to be on the premises. The lease also says that verbal changes are not authorized and that only what is written in the lease is legally binding. If he tries to force me to remove the dog (which I will not do as he is part of the family) can he evict us for that? If he does, am I legally entitled to get my deposit/first month rent refunded? Also, could I demand that he pays for any moving fees that I accrue if I do have to move out.   I do have access to a group legal through my employer. Would it be worth contacting an attorney if he tries to force us out of the house?   Thank you for your advice and I apologize for the choppy/bad writing."	No
126	Hi /r/legaladvice Partner and I are looking at settling for a brand new place tomorrow. Unfortunately it is not ready to live in with a number of issues that still require a clean up. The vendors (also the builders) have stated they will fix it up when they return from their holiday on the 22/7. I have this in writing via email. Would it still be advisable to withhold an amount of settlement? Is there any legal obligation for them to make sure everything is fixed up? My solicitor had informed me that if I trust the vendor I can let it be sorted out. I was also informed that I may request for them to pay the necessary costs for me to fix up the property, if this has not been completed within the defect rectification period.	No
127	He has an attorney.  There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her.  Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	No
128	"First time posting here:   I work as a purchasing agent. Yesterday, a salesmen who is the boss' son believed a 6 figure order I had placed was wrong (it wasn't). While things were being figured out on my end he screamed in my ear and my coworkers ""I SWEAR TO  GOD GUYS IM GONNA GO OUT TO MY CAR RIGHT NOW AND GET A GUN""  He calmed down. The order turned out to be fine and he was fine. But it made me feel very uncomfortable - and I'm a bit on edge. What happens if next time the order is not correct?  I have not gone to human resources because, well human resources is his sister and that will be a brick wall. He frequently verbally abuses the employees. The owner of the company is his father. It is a small 10-15 person company.   I'm not sure if I should get police involved? OSHA? Or what steps I should take here, any advice appreciated."	No
129	My sister and her husband are getting a divorce and he told her he enrolled their kids in public school and will be sending the orders in the mail. Right now they home school and the kids are VERY smart. She fulfills all the state requirements and they score very well on the standardized tests. Also neither of their work schedules would work very well with dropping them off and picking them up. He was the big proponent of homeschooling and is just doing this to be a jerk.   He has an attorney but my sister can't afford one. She has tried calling the number for free legal advice but hasn't been able to get through. The hours they are open are limited. I could help pay if an attorney would take monthly payments and wouldn't be horribly expensive.    Can he even do this without her permission? What can she do? She already filed for divorce but I guess the next step in the process (court date?) isn't until September. School starts in August. My sister is trying to be agreeable and wants joint custody. We don't know what he's even after.   I know there may be negative comments on homeschooling but it has nothing to do with me and wouldn't be very helpful. Oh also we are in Washington state. Thank you in advance for your help!! I will be at work so probably can't respond.	No
130	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
131	So my buddy just called me, he had been on a dating app and been talking with this girl. She was posted as 19 and going to college in a few weeks and was just looking to mess around. Things happened and nudes were sent. After a few days she wanted to meet up and he was trying to figure out the logistics. Before that happened she told him she was actually just turning 17 in a few weeks. He said the hell with this deleted the nudes and cut contact. The next day he gets a call from a supposed lawyer and the lawyer said the father was an understanding guy and just wanted to talk to my buddy and figure out what happened. He got a weird vibe asked about the law firm and got vauge answers so he said he can't verify the lawyer he won't talk to him. Me and another buddy have been looking into the supposed lawyer and the name given doesn't show up on the MN and ND lists. I called the number and got a different last name that was a lawyer. The cellphone number doesn't match the lawfirms number. We are all confused and this smells of scamming... anyone have any similar situations or advice we would greatly appreciate it.	No
132	Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	No
133	Hi there! I'm seeking advice. My husband, sister, and I are applying together to rent a condo. All three of us have great credit history, and our combined income is well over 3x the rent. My husband and I have good rental history. However, my sister is currently in her first living arrangement not with my parents. She's living with my friend-- whose original roommate picked up and moved to Germany a few months into their lease-- as a subtenant. However, I just found out that my sister and friend never made her subtenancy official. Their lease explicitly forbids subletters without written permission from the landlord.  Wtf am I supposed to put on our current condo application? What kind of legal trouble could she and my friend get in? How do I represent my sister's situation on our condo application without falsifying information? Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. :)	No
134	Hello,  I am facing a situation where I decided to move in with two roommates in Massachusetts that I met them through a Facebook Housing Group. I met them in person, and they seemed like decent people I could live with. We all submitted an application and put the money down on this place, and were e-mailed the lease to sign. Me and one other roommate have signed it; however, the third has been hesitant. She says due to health reasons she may not be able to work, and does not want to commit to signing the lease without first getting results from a specialist (this appointment could take many weeks past the due date of the lease signing to get). There is a broker's fee also, so we'd potentially lose both our down payments and the lease entirely if she does not sign it by the appropriate date. I care about her health and don't blame her for being hesitant, but at the end of the day I do not want to lose my money or this apartment. What are my options if she doesn't sign, or is that entirely at the discretion of the lease office? Thanks for any advice!   TL;DR My third roommate won't sign a lease, and it may be too late by the time she does. My concern being is I can lose the first month's rent I put down as a deposit if she does not sign it by the date. What should I do? Would this mean I lose both the lease and the deposit (there is a broker's fee)?	No

136	Today I found out that my company didn't contribute to my 401k for 3 years ever since I started working there. Even though I elected to have it maxed out and Fidelity has that on record, my employer simply has never carried out the contributions. When I asked HR about it they only said that there is nothing they can do. Is this true or am I legally entitled to some compense or solution to catch up on what I missed?	No
137	"Hi Reddit! I posted a similar thread a few weeks ago over in a relationships thread - but I have a follow-up post as well as sneaking some advice. We live in Santa Monica, Los Angeles.   In short, my boyfriend and I just moved to a nicer, higher rent area. We were disappointed to find out that upstairs neighbor (""Alexandria"") is AirBnB'ing her place and the high traffic of guests make us feel uncomfortable. The guests have to walk in front of our front door/bedroom to get to our neighbors' place. There was like a new family/guest almost every three nights. While the guests are mostly quiet, they always seem to come in and out at weird hours which gets annoying. We have approached our neighbor but nothing has changed. She doesn't seem to care about our comfort.  I should also mention that AirBnB'ing is also illegal in Santa Monica, not to mention violating the terms of our agreement.   Since nothing changed - my boyfriend and I decided to email the AirBnB listing to our landlord and her husband. The immediately called us, appreciated our efforts, and said that they would shut this down. They confirmed that the listing has been removed. They also said that they would leave our names out of it.  Alexandria has since moved back in and we have seen a lot more of her these last few weeks.  So apparently Alexandria also has a dog and smokes on property. Again, she's violating MORE terms on the lease agreement. It's also illegal to smoke in apartments in Santa Monica.   We live in a little enclave environment - so we can hear the dog all the time and smell the smoke.   Honestly, my boyfriend and I wouldn't care if she smokes or has a dog or even Air BnB *if she kept it more secret*. Instead, we have to deal with the smoke, the dog, as well as random people walking by our front door almost every other day (until the AirBnB was shut down). I want to reiterate that we just moved to the neighborhood and pay much higher in rent; if we knew this was happening we wouldn't have moved here!  Anyways, my boyfriend and I decided to stay quiet about the smoking and dog.... until a few days ago. Alexandria left her dog out in the little courtyard area right in front of our apartment. She left it there for a good while (over an hour). It was barking and whimpering. My boyfriend works from home and got fed up. He sent Alexandria a text that said:  ""Hi Alexandria. Your dog is barking right outside our window. I am trying to work and this is very distracting. I would appreciate it if you collected your dog. Cheers""  No response. Alexandria came down 15 minutes later, got her dog, and went back upstairs.  An hour later, she knocks at our front door and proceeds to go on absolute tirade at my boyfriend. Here are some the highlights from her incoherent outburst:  - She told us to lose her number and that we will need a lawyer ""for harassing"" her so much. (THE FUCK?)  - She told us that we need to move out and live on a farm if we can't handle ""the typical happenings of a neighbor""  - She repeatedly told us that we were evil and that we need to ""GET OUT""  - She said that's she's going to be the miserable neighbor and make our lives a living hell  - She said we complain too much - to which my boyfriend responded, ""What are you talking about?"" She goes ""You know - the dog, the smoking, the AirBnB!"" My boyfriend replied ""What AirBnB?"" She goes ""Whatever.""  My boyfriend remained calm the entire time (bless his heart). We were both trying to stifle laughter because we couldn't believe how ridiculous she was being.  The only correspondence we've with Alexandria is on two occasions 1) We offered to buy her a rug to help quell the noise upstairs from all her guests; she gladly took our $100  and 2) a text message about the dog. That's it. The correspondence has been nothing but polite. Lots of ""thank yous"" and smiley faces.   ANYWAYS. Here's the kicker. About a month ago when we noticed the AirBnB ramping up - **we decided to purchase a security camera.** Thank goodness we did that, because we got her whole outburst on video.  From the looks of it, it appears that she basically ADMITTED on camera to smoking, having a dog, and AirBnB'ing. (BTW, we have never complained to her or the landlord about smoking or the dog...)  We immediately sent the security footage video to our landlords. They called us immediately afterwards and said that they will ""deal with it.""   Interestingly enough, Alexandria left for vacation the very next morning.  We suspect that Alexandria will get evicted at this point. That issue is between Alexandria and the landlords.  My boyfriend and I are wondering what else we can do to protect ourselves in the event that Alexandria tries to sue us for harassment. Should we make the first move here since we have documented proof of her acting crazy? Should we send this footage (of her threatening us) to the police? Should we try to get a retraining order first? Should we send all the evidence of her AirBnB'ing illegally? We realize that we have some ammunition here, but we want to make sure we use it in the smartest way possible. We are also worried about her retaliating. The previous tenant was never around so Alexandria was able to get away with having a dog/AirBnBing/smoking/etc. for many years until we moved in. I worry that she will try to seek revenge (she just seems like that type of person, we have a gut feeling about this).  My boyfriend and I have somehow NEVER had to deal with a crazy neighbor in all our apartment-living in Los Angeles. We appreciate all your help."	No
138	"Got in an accident a while back.  Sought legal assistance.  The lawyer I found dropped my case after a month and I felt they wasted my time.  I left them a single negative review online containing hard facts, all of which were true. I can back up any of my claims with evidence from multiple sources.  I settled with the driver on my own and figured it was time to move on.  The lawyer felt otherwise.  Since our ""falling out,"" the lawyer has taken the following actions:  * Called me to threaten legal action against me if I do not take down my factual review * Called my employer to try to convince them to fire me, saying he knows their business partners etc. * Called various family members of mine and made them feel harassed. * Has emailed me countless times threatening multiple lawsuits. * Has emailed me threatening to employ a private investigator for the situation. * Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false. * Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer) * Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident * Is threatening me with lawsuits, again  I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.  what do you think?  1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment? 2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since. 3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?"	No
139	A few weeks ago I bought something online.  The seller hasn't shipped and refuses to refund.  It it extortion if I tell the seller I will call my bank and do a chargeback if they don't ship or refund by a specific date and time?	No
140	One of my roommates is moving out on August 5th. She hasn't been the most courteous person through the leaving process. A few days ago, we got the utility/internet bill and everyone was told their money was due yesterday so I can pay the bill on time. The roommate in question hasn't paid yet and hasn't answered my texts following up.   I can't cut her off from utilities, but it's not illegal in my state to cut her from from internet. If she isn't paying her share, it's stealing, and I don't want that. The internet is in my name only, so no issues cutting her off from that perspective, whether that be changing the wifi password, blacklisting her devices via MAC, etc. However, the router currently being used is hers. This is where I fear any kind of legal complications. Am I subject to any legal ramification if I change the wifi password? It's my internet, but her router.  Due to budgeting, I can't afford to buy a new router until she moves out, so buying a new one isn't an immediate option.	No
141	"State: CA / City: Los Angeles  Hi, I am a tenant of this apartment in LA area which was recently purchased by a new owner/management. For the past 7 years living in this apartment, I've had some great experience with the management and never had any issues with them. But this time, I am frustrated with this new apartment manager who is not willing to give us what we've initially deserved when we first moved into this apartment.  For the past few months, I've asked the manager on duty to provide us an additional parking space to park our newly purchased car. But, before I go ahead and proceed with anything, here is a little bit of a background story. As a tenant who lives in a 2 bed/bathroom unit, we were initially given 2 parking spaces when we first moved into this apartment. However, since we only had one car, the apartment manager, at the time, has asked us if they can spare one of our parking spaces to our neighbors who were in need of an additional space which we gladly let them use it without any compensation. (My parents and the manager, at the time, got along pretty well.) The manager has promised us (verbally) that we would get the space back whenever we would purchase an additional car and now with this new owner/management, they are not willing to give us another space which was something that we've originally had been granted.  I've spoken with the current apartment manager numerous times in regards to this matter and all I get from her is ""That was something that you have dealt with the previous management. There are no more spaces available and I can't give you additional parking lot for whatever reason."" I have friends and neighbors who live in a unit with 2 bed/bathrooms with 2 parking spaces (same apartment) and when I inquired about them having 2 spaces, the current manager said ""It all depends on how many cars you have."" The manager did not even care to say they would try or would get us a space when something becomes available and our family is very frustrated with this parking situation now. My little brother has been finding parking spaces on the street late at night after his work, walking great deal of a distance, after finding a space blocks away.  From the contract of ours with the apartment, the only section that mentions parking states: ***""Subject to the provisions of this Lease, the Tenant is entitled to the use of parking (the 'Parking') on or about the Premises. Only properly insured motor vehicles may be parked in the Tenant's space.""*** (As it doesn't specify how many parking spaces can be used, I don't know if I can use this statement to back up our request.)  I am about to write a formal request letter to the HQ of the management and try to explain the frustration of the current situation.  Are there anything that I can do to get our initially given space back?  Add: The previous manager who we dealt with has fled back to his country and is no longer available."	No
142	My roommate took a trip to California last month, leaving his cats and all his things for me to take care of. We didn't sign a lease, I just moved him in. He hasn't paid for this month or next.  What steps do I have to take to get his things out of my house and out of my life?  Thanks in advance!	No
143	"I live in an apartment complex with my SO and roommate. We called just about 3 weeks ago due to some small water damage on our ceiling following a rain storm; we are on the 4th (top) floor. The first call was just to report it and there was just a small amount of discoloration. The next day it rained again, however this time it was a different spot and the drywall had become very soft and discolored. A second call was made to report this new damage. The following morning/afternoon mold had formed on the 2nd wet spot, a third call was placed for someone to come out and check the damages to repair whatever was causing the leak.    Fast forward a week and no one has come out with a couple more calls and messages left for maintanence to come out. It rains again and 2 more wet spots show up, making 4 total, another call was made reporting new damage and we demanded someone come out immediately to check all the leaks and for the mold issue. Someone comes out to check it all and tells us that it is caused by condensation forming on the AC ducts. Cool no problem someone should be out to insulate the ducts to stop that from happening anymore. ""Okay well what about the mold issue?"" ""oh well yea I guess we can have someone come out and check on that aswell."" A couple days later we found a much larger spot of mold in our pantry opposite where the AC unit is stored.    So now we are around 3-3.5 weeks out from the initial incident and thry are aware of the amount of mold in the apartment. What are our options legally? We would like to leave without cancellation fees since this is not our first issue with maintenance. Its a standard month to month contract for 12months ending in November.    Thank you everyone if you need any information or pictures let me know and I can try and upload them, I am currently on mobile at work."	No
144	"So it's basically as the title says. My apartment had two light bulbs go out. It's apartment policy that the apartment handles light bulbs so I asked them to repair it. This past weekend, I went away, and when I returned today, the light bulbs were fixed, but there were glass shards all over the floor, seemingly from a broken lightbulb. I received no notification or update, or anything that cautioned against stepping in it, not even a note ""hey, broken glass, will return tomorrow with shop vac"". I am lucky I didn't step in anything and slice my foot open. Is there anything I can do?"	No
145	forgive me if this is a long story. this has been slowly building for seven years. i will try to include only the essential facts. after that, feel free to ask questions.  fact 1 -- my husband has degenerative bone disease and was told eight years ago that he would soon be confined to a wheelchair. so far this hasn't happened, but he is not in good health although he continues to work hard for the little money he can make.  fact 2 -- i suffer from mental illnesses including PTSD from childhood and borderline personality disorder. i have applied for disability and been turned down, although it doesn't change the fact that my last therapist advised that i shouldn't be working.  fact 3 -- our landlady uses and abuses us. when she takes vacations, we watch her cats for free because we feel if we say no, we'll be kicked out. this is how she suckers us into almost everything, including spending an entire day cleaning out a shed on our property full of her stuff.  fact 4 -- her worst offense happened a few months ago. our septic tank overflowed (not maintained for 20+ years) and she didn't fix it for nearly two weeks despite my pleas, which only angered her as she tried to turn my husband against me. she also forced my nearly crippled husband to dig up the septic tank himself.  we were unable to take showers, use the sinks, do laundry, or even use the bathroom in the house. the smell was awful and very unsanitary. i do have video documentation.  fact 5 -- since that happened, i believe it has either caused further PTSD or aggravated what i already had. i have nightmares about poop. i smell phantom sewage smells all the time and very often taste it in my food. i was admitted to a state hospital for thirteen days and my psychiatrist classified what she did to me as abuse.  fact 6 -- while i was trying to recover in the hospital, the refrigerator that came with the house broke and my husband has been eating fast food for three weeks as he begs her to replace the fridge. now she isn't even answering her phone even though she is home. (lives next door to our rental property.)  fact 7 -- we have four cats that have also suffered due to the stress in our household. we can't afford to move and if we did, it might be near a busy road or highway, and i fear for them. i might could give one up for adoption but no more.  fact 8 -- in kentucky there is something called a landlord retaliation law that states she can't kick us out for a year after we have complained about a major repair to the house. if this is true we still have time, however with my mental illnesses i became very angry with her before my hospital stay. because of that, i cannot go to my house at all. i haven't seen my cats in weeks. she is threatening to call the police if i show up, although there is no restraining order or anything of the sort.   -  what would you guys do in my situation? i am finally on the correct antidepressants after twenty-two years, but her behavior is affecting my recovery. i really am better and had gotten over my anger with her, but now it's returning.  any and all advice is appreciated.	No
146	Suppose the following standard sequence of events:  1. I've posted 3 day notice.  2. I file eviction complaint.  3. Tenant answers the complaint with his defense.  4. Court sets hearing.  5. We have a trial.  Can I still settle with the tenant between 4 and 5 to avoid a trial?	No
147	A sprinkler broke on the property and is fixed. The tenant receives a water bill much higher than normal and so requests reimbursement from the management company. The owner rejects the reimbursement. What happens next? Who pays for it?	No
148	Hello, I was wondering if someone on here could help point me in the right direction.    Back in March 2017 my 18 year old daughter contacted me and asked me to come pick her up and asked if she could live with us.  She had been out on her own since Jan 2016 when her and her mom got into a fight and her mom kicked her out.    I jumped on a plane immediately and flew to NC to pick her up.  After getting her settled in and enrolled and transfered in to the local High School I decided to contact the OAG to file a change of status and termination of CS.   The OAG mailed me the required forms and gave me instructions on how to prove her residency. Which I sumbitted per their request.    Now child support was due to terminate in June 2017 so there was merely 3 months of payments left from a 17 year history of the order. I did not want my ex to have anything she did not deserve especially once I learned my daughter had essentially been homeless since Jan 2016.   The AOG placed the moneys on hold while they verified the change.  Months went by.  Finally received a status update from the AOG on June 20th 2017.  However it was not was I was hoping for.  They informed me that with out the other parents signature stating she is giving me credit for those three months the AOG states they can not return the money to me.    The OAG claims it is their policy but refused to give me documentation stating the legal procedure claiming it is not public record.    It has been one month since they mailed my ex wife the documentation and she never responded.  I called the AOG and asked them what the next step was and they told me they do not have an answer for me.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor who ended up just contacting someone else who is going to send another letter to my ex wife inwhich will go straight to the trash.    So my question is what policy is the OAG following that stipulates they must have a response from the other party to determine status change?  They claimed it is not public record when I asked about such policy.  Also if I were to file a suit in court on what grounds would I file since the court order has already expired since my daughter is 18 and has now graduated?    A lawyer would cost too much in comparison to what the AOG is holding.   Any advice would be appreciative.	No
149	Hey guys sorry for the anonymous, this is something I would rather not be tied too. That being said, here it goes.  I have worked for a city agency for 3 years now and for 2 or so of those years almost everyday people make sexual jokes about me or my sexual orientation, this ranges from my coworkers to my boss and even his boss, the second in command. The top dog does not know anything about it.  This all stemmed from a conversation about sexual experiences in the beginning of my employment.  Day in and day out jokes are made. For example: I got to work this morning and not even an hour later a joke about me being gay came up. This happens on average 3-6 times a day.  I know the second I say anything to them it will just make work suck even more.  I would rather not do anything since this is my only form income. I used to love doing what I do and I still do it just sucks being around the people that constantly make these jokes.  Do I have any recourse other than to just quit my job?  Is it my fault for letting it go on so long?	No
150	Australian, but all help is welcome. Tenants that have been living there for around a year and a half have been crying their clothes and not using proper ventilation causing mold. I've made many attempts to fix the issue, installing fans and creating more ventilation (have evidence) yet they continue to keep causing it. They plan on breaking the lease which in fine with but not so happy they are attempting to get compensation for this. I plan on getting local advice soon but please comment, all help is welcome. Additionally I have evidence that I have made many attempts to do right by this current tenants: painting the house, fixing things/paying for fixing things.	No
151	Pulled over yesterday and told I was swerving. I was not drunk, but was pretty tired because it was the end of a long drive. I had a major panic attack during the field sobriety tests, I was shaking too hard to stand, and when the officer did the visual test I almost passed out from locking my legs. There is no way I passed those tests. The attack passed by the 3rd test (balance test) which I was able to do fine, but I was not allowed to retake the previous two.   Officer thought I was on some kind of narcotic, and brought me into the station. The did take a urine sample, which I'm positive will come back clean, I don't do drugs. I did have a few beers earlier that afternoon but this stop happened over 4 hours after I had drinks, and I did not have enough to even get buzzed. I did tell the officer when I had the drinks, and complied with all testing and requests, and I was incredibly polite through the whole ordeal.  This is my first OBI, I have no priors, and I have already spoken to a lawyer and have things in motion to meet before my arraignment hearing. What should I be expecting to happen here? Is it normal for a first time offense to be downgraded into a reckless driving charge? Should I expect the book to get thrown at me and to receive the manditory 72 hours in jail? These questions will obviously be asked to my lawyer, but I was hoping to hear some positives to this before going in because I'm freaking out right now.	No
152	-_- About a month ago I rented a room in a house. The house has 2 other tenants and the landlord also lives on the property. Things were dodgy at first and now they are getting downright ridiculous. The first things I noticed after I moved in was that there were no faucets on the bathtub/shower. I didn't think to check them before I moved in so I figured whatever that's on me, we have to use a freaking wrench to turn on the water.   Anyway, that was strike one. Last week the lock on my bedroom door stopped working, the doorknob turns but the latch doesn't move so I have to use a knife to open my door from the inside and there is no way to lock it when I leave, I have to tape the lock so I don't get locked up and it leaves all my belongings vulnerable. The landlord has been bellyaching about having to go to walkmart to get another lock but has yet to do anything about it. Strike two.  Last Friday, I went to take a shower and there was no hot water. The gas was shut off. The landlord claims he hasn't had money to pay for the hot water because the tenant that lives in the basement hasn't paid rent in 7 months and he's short on cash. Strike three. Which i'm pretty sure hes lying about because I saw someones belongings in the living room 2 weeks ago and i'm pretty sure it was someone moving IN to the basement as it was no one moving in upstairs.    This guy really seems like a piece of human excrement and i'm pretty sure he's spending his money on something else other than the house. I mean its a house, he has three tenants, the guy shouldn't be short on cash at all.   So anyway, at this point i'm ready to try to get out of my lease and find another place. I mean if he can't pay gas now, in the summer, whats going to happen in the winter? Not to mention him being nonchalant about me not being able to lock my door. Do you guys think I have a case to get out of my lease? Him being responsible for the gas is in my lease agreement, is this a breach? If so, is there a chance he would be responsible for my moving costs?  Any advice is appreciated. This is Pennsylvania by the way.	No
153	My ex-and I have had a horrible divorce (like the majority of them).  He has caused many issues in my new relationship.  The strain has caused my new husband to leave a few times because he could handle the verbal abuse of my ex.  Me and my new husband have come to terms with our situation and decided to face that is our life and we are moving forward.  We are not going to separate anymore.  My ex is not happy that me and my new husband are staying together.  Has threatened to get a Guardian ad Litem for my 11 year old.  There is no abuse in our home and my son is loved.  Can my ex (who is living with his girlfriend an no legal place of his own) get custody of my child because of my new husband leaving before?	No
154	My neighbor has been stalking me and threatening me.  I was granted a TRO today, and we go to court next week to extend it.  I have video evidence of several of the incidents.  The only problem is that when the videos save, for some reason the time stamps do not save with them.  I have a couple where they match up to still shots, which do keep their time stamps.  But most are just the video with no time stamps.  Is that going to be a problem in court?  Is there anything else I can do to prepare?  Also, should I get a copy of the related police reports, or will the court already have access to those?	No
155	I have a pending suspension on my NJ license for misstatement of information to obtain a license; I applied for and received an NJ license but was not aware my license was already suspended in FL (my vehicle did not have insurance while it was waiting to get repoed). My move to NJ was sudden so I didn't prepare to have my mail forwarded to me, so I didn't find out about the suspension until later. I'm just now getting my FL license reinstated. I've spoken to a couple lawyers and I'm being told at least 750$, 1,000$ (currently unemployed full-time college student). What are the chances I can prove I didn't know my license was suspended in another state?	No
156	"My 3 roommates and I just moved into a new house. Let's call my them Aaron, Adam, and Matt.   Aaron and Adam found the house. It fit all the criteria and after seeing the place with the landlord they told her that we're 4 room mates. She didn't like this and said the house is for 3 people to live in. It's practically 4 bedroom and 1500 square feet so it made no sense. They said okay thanks but we will keep looking.   Later the landlord calls back Aaron and they talk more about the 4 room mate situation. Aaron tells the landlord that Matt is just a guest and not really a ""roommate"". This part was true. He moved in with us at our old house and was staying as a guest but it looked like he'd move in full time (as the new house was bigger). Lease is signed. Three of us signed the lease (not including Matt).   After moving in this weekend the land lord is saying that she wants a written document with the guest's SSN &amp; the exact date he will leave with all of us signing it. If we fail to do so she said she will use it as grounds to evict. No where on the lease does it say anything about 4 people not being allowed to live in the house. Quite honestly two of the bedrooms are big enough for 2 people to share (for a total of 6). No idea why she's doing this. I should mention that one of the bedrooms is actually a family room but has a separate door and is private. It can be used as a bedroom. She verbally expressed to Aaron and Adam when they were looking at the house that she wouldn't like it to be used as a bedroom. Does she even get a say in this? I'll sleep in the kitchen and cook in the bathroom if I want can't I?  I'm not in love with the house but moving is such a hassle that I do not want to deal with it again. What should we do? Should we write up a document as she requested? Or just not contact her? Is she allowed to come and inspect to see who's living where and how many people? Any help is appreciated!"	No
157	Simple question.  A neighbor, who has always been adamant that it's her fence because it's on her property line and wouldn't you know it she somehow gets onto us about everything that is or is not on her property, tore down the old fence and is building a new one. In certain spots they built the fence a foot inside our property, other sports about 6 inches.  We had a garden, we built a retaining wall, and a BBQ pit close to this fence, because it was on our property. Now the builders have torn up A LOT of this, in order to fit the fence.  What can we do?	No
158	All vehicles our parked at owners risk. No liability is assumed by management for loss or damage by fire, theft, or any other cause to, or by the vehicle while in custody of management. All claims must be presented before vehicle is taken from facility. Any person driving becomes the agent of the owner solely. We are. It responsible for articles left in vehicle or mechanical problems.   Background: left car with hotel valet to park for a few days. I came back and car was stolen and then impounded. I'd like to not pay the $275+ obviously. Do I have any recourse or am I SOL?	No
159	"Our new scumbag landlord withheld $120 of our security deposit for a professional cleaning crew on our move-out. I let her know that we spent hours cleaning and making the apartment spotless, and we have pictures to show it. However, she says that they always hire a professional cleaning crew, even if it's been cleaned by the tenants and won't refund the money.  Furthermore, there are some scratches and wear on the hardwood floor. Long story short, prior to our move in the old landlord tore up the carpet to replace it, and found the hardwood floor that was previously there. When we moved in, this wood floor already had scratches all over and a big scuff in one place. However since the old landlord let us know about it, we didn't think to take pictures and document it. Then came a new landlord who is handling our move out and is charging us $300 for ""repairs to the scratches.""  There was also peeling paint on two doors when we moved in. We told the maintenance person, but never actually had written correspondence with anyone so she's saying there's no record of it, and she's trying to charge us $100 to repaint the doors.  I'm guessing it's going to come down to filing a claim in small claims court, but except for the pictures we took after cleaning the apartment, we don't really have any proof. I asked the new landlord for the receipts for the repairs and she says she'll try to find them.  If we do file a claim, do we do it in the court where she's located? Or can we do it in the new city we moved to?  Thanks for any advice and suggestions!"	No
160	Long story but here is the short version.  17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.   He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	No
161	I know this is super petty and I'm new to this subreddit but my ex has a Reddit account that he's been posting personal details of our relationship in. This is information that may seem like no big deal in general but is information that can cause trouble for me down the line and is, I guess, character defamation. Is there anything I can do here in order to get him to stop posting personal details? I've already had a friend and family member comment on his posts cuz they've come across them and I'm worried about him saying something that might put me in hot water. Any advice would be extremely helpful, thanks.	No
162	About two years ago when I was a freshman in college I got in some legal trouble. Basically ended up in the hospital super drunk, freaked out, accidentally injured a nurse while they were trying to restrain me. I woke up still intoxicated with a police officer instructing me to sign a piece of paper. I did that then I passed back out. When I next woke up there was a doctor there who told me what had happened and that the nurse I accidentally hurt didn't want to press charges.  I hired an attorney and found out (I believe my attorney told me) that the police officer was also trying to charge me with assault and battery. A few days later I showed up at the local court house with my attorney. He spoke to the judge who decided to get rid of the misdemeanor Minor in Consumption and battery charge and instead give me one charge of Disturbing the Peace. I informally plead guilty by telling my attorney to take the deal. I then paid a fine, and that was that. My attorney also mentioned that, because my battery charge hadn't been formally written up and filed yet, it wouldn't show up on my criminal record. Does that sound accurate and plausible?  Now, back to my main question: how can this all be on my file if I never remember having my fingerprints or a mugshot taken? They wouldn't have done that in the hospital, right? I would have had to have been booked into jail?  I'm also an Elementary Education major and I've taken two fingerprint checks, neither of which have come up with anything that the Board of Education found bad enough to bar me from teaching. Does that mean they didn't find anything, or that they don't care about my record?	No
163	Moved in with my sister and her husband a few months ago he was the only one on the lease due to her having a dismissed charge after going through all the legal hoops and probation and thinking she wouldn't pass a background. So now it's 3 of us with only 1 person on the lease. Management ignored it pretty much even though the have seen us plenty and my brother in-law even transferred to a 3 bedroom apartment (why would they not ask questions?). We befriended a new nieghbor and she ended up moving out a few months later and used the trashy nieghbors above as her reason for vacating. Well those nieghbors got the complaint and started to make false accusations against us, saying we got violent over her boyfriend throwing cigarette butts down on stairs in front of our door. So they told my brother in-law they can't ignore it anymore with a new owner and we must all apply and go through a background check or face a lease violation. Fine, it's a relief having us all on the lease. Now here is where it gets fishy, it's been a week and when we ask about the applications we are told they know nothing and the manager is on vacation. We are afraid they are trying to wait for our rent payment and then violate us. Will a dismissed charge through deferment still show up on my sister's record? Is it legal for them to do this?	No
164	Last year I was sexually assaulted at a school dance. I don't want to give details I just want a black and white response.  The school nurse and the principle encouraged me not to press charges. I didn't want to tell my parents but now I have and they want to do something about it.  Do i have any legal leg to stand on?	No
165	My wife has 2 kids from her ex-husband who has custody since they divorced. We have 2 kids from me and my wife. My wife has been unemployed for the last 4 years and is a stay at home mom. I am military and our lifestyle is much more significant and beneficial for my step kids. Her ex-husband recently remarried and is trying to modify the order for more child support among other things that would impact our life for us and our 2 kids. I pay my wife's child support because she doesn't work and has a low education. Her income is imputed. I cannot afford the modifications he's asking for and any job my wife could get has the same effect since we would need child care.  What I want to know is there any chance we could pursue a change of custody especially if our lifestyle would be better for the kids, and they would grow up with their half siblings among many other beneficial opportunities he can't provide?	No
166	My ex-wife and I have 50/50 custody of our 14 year old son both legal and physical. Circumstances have changed in her household and we have both agreed to a new living arrangement for him. We want to just submit a notarized modification to the court, so its on record and we are both held accountable for it. What is the easiest form to file (there are sooo many), we both agree on this for our son and have no intention on letting the court decide what is best. We just want it on file. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	No
167	Hi there,  I am writing this on my Fiancee's behalf and looking for advice on how best to deal with the situation mentioned in the title.  My fiancee is currently living in Texas with her mom and her daughter and is looking to move to the UK to be with me. He daughter is 4 years old and my fiancee has sole responsibility to her. The father is in another state, Mi to be exact, and is completely uninvolved with his daughters life.  Even when they were in the same state about 18 months ago, he had very little contact with his daughter, so much so, that he's not spoke to his child in over a year now. My fiancee has always tried to get him to speak to her, but has never had any luck, and now she just doesn't try anymore. He makes absolutely zero effort in her life. He does not pay any child support, never speaks to her, nothing. He is named on the birth certificate though, so as far as I understand it, as she was born after 2003, and him being in the birth certificate, he has full legal rights as a parent. His daughter no longer asks after him, and is at the point where she is calling me Dad, and this wasn't something we pushed her to do at all.  Now, we're trying to get a Visa completed so they can both move to the UK to be with me. As it stands, he verbally agreed to this, so to make sure we had something in writing, we went him a letter with all the details on it about the plan to move to the UK, and asked him to sign in and have it notarised in the local courthouse. He said he would get this done, however we've yet to receive back a copy of this letter which he said he has sent, so my fiancee is getting very stressed about this, and rightfully so.  I don't fully know the US legal system, well at all really, but wondering what our next step could be. I wanted to suggest that a visit to the local courthouse in Texas could be on the cards for her to request that she has full parental responsibility, even though he is named on the birth certificate, and try and allow her to make all decisions regarding her daughter. Or at least get court permission to allow her to move her daughter over here, even without his permission.  This guy as far as I know does not have a fixed address currently, and mixes between staying with his girlfriend and his mom, does not have a telephone or at least a number we can contact him on, contact is attempted over Facebook messenger, and that's about it.  Any advice on what our next step could be would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.	No
168	Location is Kentucky. MSPaint is here [http://imgur.com/a/eyigA](http://imgur.com/a/eyigA).  I've not got all the information I really need yet, I'm stuck at work. A contractor (i assume hired by the county) is laying pipe in my neighbor's yard and will soon make it to ours. I'm worried about a section of the pipe that will have to be laid underneath a section of property covered in decorative river rock large pebbles up to the roadway.   I figure the county has an easement to allow the work to be done but what responsibility does the contractor have to do minimal damage or put the property back as it was? Any?	No
169	"I know someone who complains about their situation a bit, but I do not think they have actually gone to a lawyer about it, so I thought I would google a bit. I can see why they feel hopeless. I have no background in law or ethics, so I thought I would ask your advice. I am hoping that people can educate me so I do not voice stupid brainstorming ideas when it comes up in conversation. It seems like SURELY something can be done, but I ask dumb questions like ""Did you ever consider ___"" and I feel bad. For what it is worth they have owned the property for 10+ years and each live in one half. With a recent career change, it is impossible to pay the mortgage not to mention maintain the 100 year old property.  Advice I saw online: *Convert duplex to condos (not sure the point of this, plus how?). *Convert to tenants in common (how exactly? by converting to a condo?). *Stop paying the mortgage and either the other party will be more interested in buying him out for $0 or it will go into foreclosure. This just sounds like the natural course of things when you do not have enough money to pay your bills. *Even if the other party were willing to buy out for $0, they do not want to and they may not qualify for the mortgage on their own. *Call mortgage company directly and ask what options are, maybe the other person will not need to refinance making it more appealing (but it does not sound like it matters because they do not want to give up on their failed plans). *File a Petition to Partition (which requires talking to a lawyer). *Bankruptcy (sounds like it might ruin both lives). *One of them dies.  Of all these hoping for a tornado sounds best, or maybe a strong fracking earthquake. I know I have hoped for those when dealing with an upside down mortgage in probate.  Thank you for your opinions in advance."	No
170	My rent is $1200 a month. I recently requested the apartment install a washer and dryer in my unit, which according to them, is $40 a month added to rent. It took them a month to get the washer and dryer installed, and I ever signed a new lease or any paperwork indicating that I agree to pay for the washer and dryer. The last rent bill included the cost for the washer and dryer. Can they arbitrarily increase the billable amount of my rent without me ever signing anything agreeing to pay for it? I get that I requested the washer and dryer, but they forgot to send me a new lease to sign (their mistake, not mine).	No
171	I'm a mom to 4 boys, 11, 10, 8 and 7. I am also in college finishing my bachelor degree. This semester I have a mandatory internship which makes my getting home an hour after the boys get off the bus. In the state of Arkansas, is it legal for the boys to be home without an adult for an hour after school each day? Money is really tight and we cannot afford child care.	No
172	This is for a name change, the hearing is at 9:20 AM so not really time to run all over the city (and to a county 2.5 hours away). I planned to mail all the info to MIL who still lives in the far county and she can do the searches there, while I'm doing my searches in my county, we meet up over the weekend to trade off papers and bam, done. It sounds so stupid but this process has been so stupid that I'm just being careful.	No
