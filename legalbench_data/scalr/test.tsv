This exhaustion requirement is not subject to ""futility or other exceptions,"" Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 746 n.6 (2001), and may not be waived by a district court, Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002). This case presents the following question:
Does a prisoner satisfy the Prison Litigation Reform Act's administrative-exhaustion requirement by filing an untimely or otherwise procedurally defective administrative appeal?"	"holding that it would be inconsistent with Congress' intent to require exhaustion of ""optional appeals"" through state procedures after ""an aggrieved party has exhausted all administrative remedies expressly prescribed"" by Congress in the Administrative Procedures Act (""APA"")"	"holding that, where prison overcrowding was due to state budget shortfalls, a court-mandated prison-population limit was ""necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners' constitutional rights"" under the Prison Litigation Reform Act"	"holding that the district court properly dismissed action for lack of jurisdiction where the plaintiff had not exhausted administrative remedies under § 2675 prior to filing suit; stating, ""The FTCA bars claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they have exhausted their administrative remedies."""	"holding that exhaustion of administrative remedies is still required to bring a federal suit, even when administrative remedies are no longer available due to the inmate's failure to meet the administrative deadlines: ""Proper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency's deadlines and other critical procedural rules . . . ."""	"holding that ""failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the [Prison Litigation Reform Act], and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints"""	3
1	"Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, forbids a publicly traded company, a mutual fund, or ""any ... contractor [or] subcontractor ... of such company [to] ... discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of"" certain protected activity. (Emphasis added). The First Circuit held that under section 1514A such contractors and subcontractors, if privately-held, may retaliate against their own employees, and are prohibited only from retaliating against employees of the public companies with which they work. The question presented is:
Is an employee of a privately-held contractor or subcontractor of a public company protected from retaliation by section 1514A?"	"holding that whether an expression by a public employee is constitutionally protected is a question of ultimate fact for the court and not subject to limited review under the ""clearly erroneous"" standard"	holding generally that if employee conduct is protected under federal law, then state law which interferes with the exercise of such federally protected rights is preempted	holding that management company's “managerial responsibilities” that gave it “substantial control of the terms and conditions of the work” of the employees justified considering management company an employer	holding that whistleblower protection under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, extended to employees of private contractors and subcontractors serving public companies	"holding that a subcontractor on a public project could not ""seize or attach money in the hands of the Government as compensation for the losses resulting from the default of the prime contractor"""	3
2	"Bankruptcy Rules permit discharge of a student loan only through an adversary proceeding, commenced by filing a complaint and serving it and a summons on an appropriate agent of the creditor. Instead, debtor merely included a declaration of discharge in his Chapter 13 plan and mailed it to creditor's post office box. Does such procedure meet the rigorous demands of due process and entitle the resulting orders to respect under principles of res judicata?
Student loans are statutorily non-dischargeable in bankruptcy unless repayment would cause the debtor an ""undue hardship."" Debtor failed to prove undue hardship in an adversary proceeding as required by the Bankruptcy Rules, and instead, merely declared a discharge in his Chapter 13 plan. Are the orders confirming the plan and discharging debtor void?"	holding that the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act,which ordered a debtor railroad company's bankruptcy estate to pay benefits to former employees of the debtor, was a law on the subject of bankruptcies and violated the Bankruptcy Clause	"holding that, in a case involving a mortgage on real property, a bankruptcy discharge ""extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim  namely, an action against the debtor in personam  while leaving intact another  namely, an action against the debtor in rem. """	holding that property seized by a creditor prior to debtor's bankruptcy was property of the estate even though creditor--the IRS--held a secured interest--a tax lien--in the property	"holding that ""it is sensible to view the debtor-in-possession as the same `entity' which existed before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, but empowered by virtue of the Bankruptcy Code to deal with its contracts and property in a manner it could not have employed absent the bankruptcy filing"""	holding that bankruptcy court’s final order was binding 12 and that appellant could not later collaterally attack that order 13 when the appellant had notice of the proceedings leading up to 14 the entry of the order but never appealed the order	4
3	"ERISA preempts any state law that ""relates to"" ERISA-covered employee benefit plans, unless the law is within the statute's insurance ""saving"" clause, which saves from preemption any state law ""which regulates insurance."" Petitioners include health maintenance organizations (""HMOs"") that make limited-size networks of health care providers available to ERISA health benefit plans. Kentucky's ""Any Willing Provider"" (""AWP"") statutes, however, require HMOs to open their networks to any provider in the geographical area willing to meet the network contract terms. The Sixth Circuit below unanimously held that Kentucky's AWP statutes relate to ERISA-covered benefit plans, but by a 2-1 decision joined the Fourth Circuit in holding that AWP statutes are not preempted by ERISA because they are laws ""which regulate[] insurance,"" rejecting contrary decisions of the Eighth and Fifth Circuits.
Are state ""Any Willing Provider"" statutes preempted by ERISA, or are they saved from preemption because they are laws ""which regulate insurance""?"	holding that ERISA preempted New York Human Rights Law to the extent that it imposed conflicting insurance obligations than required under ERISA but that New York Disability Law was not preempted if not applied to ERISA plans	holding that Illinois statute requiring HMOs to provide independent medical review of certain claim denials is saved from preemption because the statute regulates insurance within the meaning of ERISA's savings clause	holding former exemption to the Georgia garnishment statute, O.C.G.A. § 18-4-22.1, preempted by ERISA because the statute expressly referenced ERISA plans and singled out welfare benefit plans for different treatment in state garnishment proceedings	"holding that for a state law to be deemed a law which regulates insurance, and therefore saved from ERISA preemption, the state law must ""be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance"" and ""substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured"""	holding that a local law, requiring employers to continue to offer health insurance to employees receiving workers' compensation benefits, had a “reference to” ERISA plans because employer-offered health insurance is necessarily part of an ERISA plan and the law, therefore, was premised on the existence of an ERISA plan	3
4	"This case involves a challenge to the FCC's jurisdiction to implement §332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934, titled ""Preservation of Local Zoning Authority."" Section 332(c) (7) imposes certain limitations on State and local zoning authority over the placement of wireless service facilities, but authorizes the FCC to address only one of these limitations; it states that no other provision ""in this Act"" may ''limit'' or ""affect"" State and local authority over wireless facilities placement. The FCC concluded that other provisions ""in this Act"" authorize it to adopt national zoning standards to implement §332(c)(7). The Fifth Circuit deferred to the FCC's jurisdictional determination applying Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), but acknowledged that ""[the Supreme Court has not yet conclusively resolved the question of whether Chevron applies in the context of an agency's determination of its own statutory jurisdiction, and the circuit courts of appeals have adopted different approaches to this issue."" The case presents two questions:
Whether, contrary to the decisions of at least two other circuits, and in light of this Court's guidance, a court should apply Chevron to review an agency's determination of its own jurisdiction."	holding that “there is no difference, insofar as the validity of agency action is concerned, between an agency's exceeding the scope of its authority (its ‘jurisdiction’) and its exceeding authorized application of authority that it unquestionably has”	"holding that courts in the District of Columbia are local rather than federal because Congress ""expressly created"" the courts pursuant to its plenary authority and created a body with authority over matters of ""strictly local concern"""	"holding that ""filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance - it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal."""	"holding that ""administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority"""	holding that rule requiring cable operators to originate local programming fell within FCC's statutory jurisdiction	0
5	Is an oral complaint of a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act protected conduct under the anti-retaliation provision, 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3)?	"holding that application of Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA"") to transportation employees employed by local government does not contravene the Commerce Clause because labor conditions of those employees affect interstate commerce"	"holding that the ""plain language"" of the Fair Labor Standards Act's ""willful"" liquidated damages standard requires that ""the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute,"" without regard to the outrageousness of the conduct at issue"	"holding that an opinion letter by the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act was not entitled to deference as a matter of law, but only ""respect"" to the extent that it has the ""power to persuade"""	"holding that ""hearing"" under the Administrative Procedure Act requires that parties have fair notice of what agency intends to do and that parties have opportunity to comment; but ""hearing"" does not require oral testimony, cross-examination, or oral argument"	holding that the anti-retaliation provision makes FLSA's “enforcement scheme effective by preventing ‘fear of economic retaliation’ from inducing workers ‘quietly to accept substandard conditions' ”	4
6	Whether a passenger in a vehicle subject to a traffic stop is thereby “detained” for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, thus allowing the passenger to contest the legality of the traffic stop.	holding that an arrest supported by probable cause and following a traffic stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment because of police officer's subjective motivation to search vehicle for evidence of crime	holding that Fourth Amendment was not violated where, during an “undoubtedly justified traffic stop” an officer observed the vehicle's vehicle identification number (VIN), which “is by law present in one of two locations—either inside the doorjamb, or atop the dashboard and thus ordinarily in plain view of someone outside the automobile”	holding that subjective motive of officers for traffic stop is irrelevant where stop is supported by probable cause and thus rejecting “any argument that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of the individual officers involved”	holding that ordering a driver out of his or her car during a routine traffic stop is not inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment, and noting that Pennsylvania did not go so far as to argue that frisking a driver during a routine traffic stop would always be consistent with the Fourth Amendment	holding that automobile passengers are seized during traffic stops even though the police command to stop is directed to the driver because a reasonable person in the passenger seat would not feel free to leave once the police have stopped the vehicle	4
7	Whether the term “felony drug offense” as used in federal statute requiring imposition of enhanced mandatory minimum 20 years’ imprisonment when drug offender has “prior conviction for a felony drug offense” must be read in pari materia with federal statutes defining both “felony” and “felony drug offense”, so as to require imposition of minimum 20—year sentence only if prior drug conviction is both punishable by more than one year in prison and characterized as a felony by controlling law.	"holding that a South Carolina conviction for possession of cocaine is a conviction for a ""felony drug offense"", as that term is used in § 841(b), because it is ""punishable by more than one year,"" regardless of the fact that the state of conviction classified the offense as a misdemeanor"	holding that only a controlled substance violation that is punishable as a felony under the federal Controlled Substances Act can constitute an aggravated felony and finding that it is not enough that the crime is punishable as a felony under state law	holding that a defendant convicted of a possession offense that has not been enhanced based on a prior conviction has not been convicted of an aggravated felony	"holding that to qualify as a conviction relating to a federally controlled substance, ""a state drug offense must meet two conditions: It must 'necessarily' proscribe conduct that is an offense under the [Controlled Substances Act], and the [Act] must 'necessarily' prescribe felony punishment for that conduct"""	holding that a buyer who uses a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does not “facilitate” felony drug distribution because the term “facilitate” is limited to someone other than a principal or necessary actor	0
8	"This case presents the issue that recently divided this Court, 4-4, in Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega, S.A., 131 S. Ct. 565 (2010). Under § 602(a)(1) of the Copyright Act, it is impermissible to import a work ""without the authority of the owner"" of the copyright. But the first-sale doctrine, codified at § 109(a), allows the owner of a copy ""lawfully made under this title"" to sell or otherwise dispose of the copy without the copyright owner's permission.
The question presented is how these provisions apply to a copy that was made and legally acquired abroad and then imported into the United States. Can such a foreign-made product never be resold within the United States without the copyright owner's permission, as the Second Circuit held in this case? Can such a foreign-made product sometimes be resold within the United States without permission, but only after the owner approves an earlier sale in this country, as the Ninth Circuit held in Costco? Or can such a product always be resold without permission within the United States, so long as the copyright owner authorized the first sale abroad, as the Third Circuit has indicated?"	holding the first sale doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work manufactured abroad	holding that as long as court is satisfied that vessel owner's right to seek limitation is protected, the decision to dissolve the injunction is within the district court's discretion	holding constitutional a statute providing that a mineral interest would lapse to the surface owner if the interest owner either made no use of the interest, or failed to file a claim with the State, within a twenty year period	"holding that analysis of effect of a zoning commission's application of zoning ordinances on the value of an owner's property and investment-backed expectations ""cannot be measured until a final decision is made as to how the regulations will be applied to [the owner's] property"""	"holding that ""[a]t least in the absence of an interference with an owner's legal right to dispose of his land, even a substantial reduction of the attractiveness of the property to potential purchasers does not entitle the owner to compensation under the Fifth Amendment"""	0
9	Where Congress has provided that compliance with a federal motor vehicle safety standard does not exempt a person from liability at common law, 49 U.S.C. § 30103(e), does a federal minimum safety standard allowing vehicle manufacturers to install either lap-only or lap/shoulder seatbelts in certain seating positions impliedly preempt a state common-law claim alleging that the manufacturer should have installed a lap/shoulder belt in one of those seating positions?	holding state tort action was not preempted by FMVSS 208 after examining the regulation, its history, the agency's contemporaneous explanation of its objectives, and the agency's current views of the regulation's preemptive effect	"holding that federal law preempted state failure-to-warn claims against generic drug manufacturers because ""[i]t was not lawful under federal law for the Manufacturers to do what state law required of them,"" i.e., ""to use a different, stronger label"" than the one approved by the FDA"	"holding that once the FHWA approved the warning devices to be installed at a railroad crossing and the devices were installed using federal funds, ""the federal standard for adequacy displaced [state] statutory and common law addressing the same subject, thereby preempting"" a failure to maintain adequate warning devices claim under state law"	"holding that, despite party's failure to raise issue of whether state or federal law provided proper standard, court of appeals ""was not free to promulgate a federal common law ... rule without identifying the proper source of federal common law"""	holding police regulation permitting a warrantless inventory search prior to towing a vehicle does not violate Fourth Amendment provided law enforcement officerconducting search follows standard procedure, and does not act in bad faith or solely for investigative purposes	0
10	"Whether the authority of the federal courts under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706(1), to ""compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed"" extends to review of the adequacy of an agency's ongoing management of public lands under general statutory standards and its own land use plans."	holding that “there is no difference, insofar as the validity of agency action is concerned, between an agency's exceeding the scope of its authority (its ‘jurisdiction’) and its exceeding authorized application of authority that it unquestionably has”	holding that federal courts have power to review an agency's actions to ensure that its own regulations have been followed	holding agency's issuance of an administrative complaint was not subject to review until final agency action despite its evident assumption that the propriety of the initial charging decision would not be subject to administrative review	"holding that when ""an agency has `improperly'; `withheld'; `agency records' . . . [j]udicial authority to devise remedies and enjoin agencies can only be invoked, under the jurisdictional grant conferred by § 552, if the agency has contravened all three components of this obligation"""	"holding that a claim under the APA for a ""failure to act"" requires there to be a "" discrete agency action that it is required to take. "" (emphasis in original)"	4
11	Whether state statutory, common law negligence, and consumer protection act enforcement actions against a tow-motor carrier based on state law regulating the sale and disposal of a towed vehicle are related to a transportation service provided by the carrier and are thus preempted by 49 U.S.C. §14501(c)(1).	"holding under ICCTA's predecessor statute that ""transportation by rail carrier"" includes ""service provided by interstate rail carriers on `equipment which they own'"""	holding that § 14501(c) preempts two provisions of a Maine law regulating the delivery of tobacco within the state; Maine's attempt to require tobacco retailers to employ only delivery companies that follow particular delivery service procedures created a direct “connection with” motor carrier services— i.e., the transportation and delivery of goods	"holding that the carrier was the owner's agent for the ""single, limited purpose"" of determining limitations on the liability of the carrier's downstream subcontractor and that it would be ""unsustainable"" to find that the carrier was ""automatically empowered to be the cargo owner's agent in every sense"""	holding that NEPA does not require the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to evaluate the environmental effects of cross-border motor carrier operations because the agency lacked the discretion to prevent those operations	"holding that claims brought under the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act were not preempted by the FAAAA because the unfair conduct alleged – the storage and disposal of a car - was not ""sufficiently connected to a motor carrier's service with respect to the transportation of property to warrant preemption"""	4
12	"ERISA's  ""anti-cutback""  rule,  29  U.S.C.  §  1054(g),  generally  prohibits  any pension  plan  amendment  which  has  the  effect  of  eliminating  or  reducing  a participant's  early  retirement  benefit  or  a  retirement-type  subsidy  with respect  to  benefits  attributable  to  service  before  the  amendment.    The Seventh  Circuit,  expressly  acknowledging  its  direct  conflict  with  a  1998 decision  of  the  Fifth  Circuit,  held  that  a  pension  plan  amendment  which expands  the  types  of  post-retirement  employment  that  trigger  mandatory suspension  of  early  retirement  benefits  violates  the  anti-  cutback  rule  when applied  to  suspend  the  benefits  of  participants  who  retired  before  the amendment.
Whether a ""suspension"" of early retirement benefits pursuant to a multiemployer pension plan amendment is an ""elimination"" or a ""reduction"" of such benefits which would be prohibited by ERISA's anti-cutback rule."	holding that ERISA preempts community property rights in pension plan benefits and that a pension plan participant cannot be required by state law to account for a deceased spouse's community property interest in pension plan proceeds	holding that a plan administrator's denial of ERISA benefits is reviewed under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard only if the benefit plan gives the plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan	holding that congressional reduction of social welfare benefits, or even elimination of such benefits, does not constitute a “taking” of private property	holding that a state law claim, brought by an employee who was terminated because of the employer's desire to avoid paying pension benefits, was preempted because an element of the state cause of action was whether an ERISA-regulated pension plan existed and the state law claim therefore had a “reference” to ERISA	holding that conditions could be placed upon receipt of an ERISA pension plan if those conditions were in place when employees entered into the contract establishing their plan	4
13	"Does the four-year ""catch-all"" limitations period of 28 U.S.C. §1658 apply to new causes of action created by public law 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which were codified at 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) and (b)?"	holding that a law extending the limitations period enacted after expiration of a previously applicable statute of limitations violates the Ex Post Facto Clause; whereas a law extending the limitations period enacted before expiration of a previously applicable statute of limitations does not violate this clause	"holding that § 101 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, amending the definition announced in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 of the term `make and amend contracts' as used in 42 U.S.C. § 1981, ""does not apply to preenactment conduct."""	"holding that the one-year limitations period runs ""from the date on which the right . . . was initially recognized by th[e] [Supreme] Court"""	"holding that ""when the underlying cause of action is based on federal law and the absence of an express federal statute of limitations makes it necessary to borrow a limitations period from another statute, the action is not barred if it has been commenced in compliance with Rule 3 within the borrowed period."""

In most cases, they are binding rules of law"" unless the tolling rule is inconsistent with the United States Constitution or federal law"	4
14	Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that a private party cannot bring a Lanham Act claim challenging a product label regulated under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.	holding that private parties have an implied right to bring suit for violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act	holding that a company may bring a claim against a competitor under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, for misleading product labeling, even where the challenged labeling may be permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 –399f	holding that the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under § 2 of the Lanham Act are applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under § 43	holding that, although private parties do not have standing to sue other private parties under the Act, “an ‘appropriate’ role for private parties under § 9011(b) [is] to bring suits against the FEC to challenge its interpretations of various provisions of the Act”	holding that the FDA's decision not to take enforcement actions to prevent violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 301 et seq., is not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 500 et seq.	1
15	"Whether a debt collector's legal error qualifies for the bona fide error defense under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (""FDCPA""), 15 U.S.C. § 1692."	holding that failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence is an error subject to harmless error analysis	"holding that Rule 11(c) error is not a form of ""structural"" error and, therefore, that ""Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule)"""	holding that “the bona fide error defense in § 1692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a debt collector’s incorrect interpretation of the requirements of that statute” and reversing the contrary judgment of the court of appeals	"holding that lawyers who regularly collect consumer debt through litigation may be considered ""debt collectors"" under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692- 1692o, and are therefore subject to liability for litigation activities"	"holding that 15 U.S.C. § 1692e ""do[es] not merely impose procedural requirements upon debt collectors, but instead 'create a private duty owed personally to' a consumer by a debt collector to refrain from using false, deceptive, or misleading means or representations in attempting to collect a debt"""	2
16	Under Title VII, a plaintiff seeking to bring suit for employment discrimination must first file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days after the unlawful employment practice occurred. Where an employer adopts an employment practice that discriminates against African Americans in violation of Title VII's disparate impact provision, must a plaintiff file an EEOC charge within 300 days after the announcement of the practice, or may a plaintiff file a charge within 300 days after the employer's use of the discriminatory practice?	"holding that the term ""employment practice"" in Title VII is not defined, but encompassed city's conduct when, in selecting applicants to advance in the hiring process, it excluded passing applicants who scored below a certain threshold on the qualification examination"	holding that an employee whose employment was terminated after his fiancee, a co-employee, filed a sex-discrimination charge with the EEOC had standing as an “aggrieved person,” under a zone-of-interests test, to sue the employer under Title VII’s antiretaliation provision	holding that a private right of action does not arise until 180 days after a charge has been filed with the EEOC	"holding that despite the literal terms of § 2000e-5(e), which suggest that the ""person aggrieved"" must institute the proceedings with a state agency in order to trigger the 300-day deadline, the EEOC can institute such proceedings on behalf of an employment-discrimination plaintiff"	holding that historical practice is important when courts interpret the Constitution, “even when the nature or longevity of that practice is subject to dispute, and even when that practice began after the founding era”	0
17	"This Court has held that the test to determine if a person is ""in custody"" to require warnings pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), is an objective test (i.e., whether there is a ""formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement"" of the degree associated with a formal arrest).  Thompson v. Keohane,  516 U.S. 99, 112 (1995) (quoting California v.  Beheler, 463  U.S. 1121, 1125  (1983)); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420,442 (1984). The question presented is:
Whether,  in  applying  the  objective  test  for  a  ""custody""  determination  under Miranda,  a  court  must  consider  the  age  and  experience  of  a  person  if  he  or she is a juvenile."	holding that even in routine tax investigations a person in custody, regardless of the reason for his detention, must be given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)	holding that Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964), applied retroactively only to trials commenced after the decisions were released	holding that court was nowhere close to the mark in ruling that the state court had unreasonably applied established federal law by failing to consider a suspect's age when determining custodial status, where “[the Supreme Court's] opinions applying the Miranda custody test have not mentioned the suspect's age, much less mandated its consideration”	holding that a law enforcement officer's unarticulated subjective belief as to whether the person being questioned is a criminal suspect is irrelevant to the custody determination because a custody assessment depends on the objective circumstances of an interrogation	holding that person is seized only if she is detained by means intentionally applied to terminate her freedom of movement and that seizure occurs even when unintended person is object of detention, so long as means of detention are intentionally applied to that person	2
18	Whether the United States Leadership Against HIV/ AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, 22 U.S.C. 7631(f), which requires an organization to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking in order to receive federal funding to provide HIV and AIDS programs overseas, violates the First Amendment.	holding that the federal regulations apply to the states in administering Medicaid programs	"holding unconstitutional funding condition requiring recipients to affirm opposition to prostitution because it compelled grant recipient ""to adopt a particular belief as a condition of funding"""	holding that an organization has standing to sue on behalf of its members where: (1) the individual members would otherwise have standing to sue on their own; (2) the interests the organization seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (3	holding that the “HIV infection satisfies the statutory and regulatory definition of a physical impairment during every stage of the disease” but leaving it to courts to make a disability determination based on individual cir- cumstances	"holding that an `appendix' incorporated by reference into a consent order, as well as a complaint that the consent order noted ""may be used in construing the terms of the order,"" were ""proper aids to the construction of the order and of the agreement of which it is part."""	1
19	"Whether the prescription drug labeling judgments imposed on manufacturers by the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") pursuant to FDA's comprehensive safety and efficacy authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., preempt state law product liability claims premised on the theory that different labeling judgments were necessary to make drugs reasonably safe for use."	holding that a company may bring a claim against a competitor under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, for misleading product labeling, even where the challenged labeling may be permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 –399f	"holding that federal law preempted state failure-to-warn claims against generic drug manufacturers because ""[i]t was not lawful under federal law for the Manufacturers to do what state law required of them,"" i.e., ""to use a different, stronger label"" than the one approved by the FDA"	holding that the FDA’s drug label- ing judgments pursuant to the FDCA did not obstacle preempt state law products liability claims	holding that the statutory definition of “new drug” confers authority upon the FDA	holding that the FDA's decision not to take enforcement actions to prevent violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 301 et seq., is not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 500 et seq.	2
20	"Section 7266(a) of Title 38, U.S.C., establishes a 120-day time limit for a veteran to seek judicial review of a final agency decision denying the veteran's claim for disability benefits. Before the decision below, the Federal Circuit in two en banc decisions held that Section 7266(a) constitutes a statute of limitations subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling under this Court's decision in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89 (1990).
Whether the time limit in Section 7266(a) constitutes a statute of limitations subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, or whether the time limit is jurisdictional and therefore bars application of that doctrine."	holding that the time limit for filing a petition for certiorari is not jurisdictional	holding that statutory time limit for filing attorney-fee reimbursement applications under Equal Access to Justice Act was not jurisdictional because time limit did not “describe what ‘classes of cases,’ the [court] is competent to adjudicate; instead, the section relate[d] only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within court's adjudicatory authority”	holding that state law, rather than Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, determines when a diversity action commences for the purposes of tolling the state statute of limitations; Rule 3 makes no reference to the tolling of state limitations, and, therefore, there is no direct conflict	holding statute of limitations in actions against the government are subject to a rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants	"holding that the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal for a veteran claim was not jurisdictional and noting that ""[f]iling deadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue here, are quintessential claim-processing rules."""	4
21	"Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding, contrary to decisions of the First and Seventh Circuits, that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, prohibits ""reverse discrimination,"" i.e., employer actions, practices, or policies  that  treat  older  workers  more  favorably  than  younger  workers  who  are  at least 40 years old."	holding that Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, thereby prohibits retaliation because “[r]etaliation ... is a form of ‘discrimination’ ” and is “ ‘discrimination on the basis of sex’ because it is an intentional response to ... an allegation of sex discrimination”	holding that age was not a proper BFOQ defense of the airline's discriminatory policy, which prohibited the employment of pilots older than 60	holding that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act did not allow for reverse age discrimination suits even though plain reading of the statute appeared to allow for such suits	holding mandatory retirement age constitutional despite the statute being underinclusive in failing to remove from employment some younger individuals who were no longer qualified to continue working and overinclusive in removing from employment those who were older but still capable	"holding that the exclusion in 9 U.S.C. § 1, which excludes ""contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce"" from the FAA's coverage, only applies to transportation workers"	2

23	Whether this Court’s decision in Central Bank, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank, N.A., 511 U.S. 164 (1994), forecloses claims for deceptive conduct under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), 17 C.F.R. 240.l0b-5(a) and (c), where Respondents engaged in transactions with a public corporation with no legitimate business or economic purpose except to inflate artificially the public corporation’s financial statements, but where Respondents themselves made no public statements concerning those transactions.	holding that a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce must have sufficient intrastate contacts before a State can require the corporation to qualify to do business	"holding that the sole shareholder of a corporation lacked standing to state a personal § 1981 claim where the defendant allegedly breached its contract with the corporation, because ""the shareholder and contracting officer of a corporation has no rights and is exposed to no liability under the corporation's contracts"""	holding that regulations for the reporting of financial transactions by financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 abridge no Fourth Amendment rights of such institutions	holding that a certificate of deposit issued by a federally regulated bank did not constitute a security under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934	"holding that although the Securities Exchange Act does not include a private cause of action for Section 10(b) violations, there is a right of action implied in the Act's words and its implementing regulation and declining to extend said right ""beyond its boundaries"""	4
24	"The California Burglary Statute Section 459 does not require as an element that a burglar enter or remain unlawfully in a building.

Aguila-Montes De Oca, 655 F.3d 915 (9th Cir. 2011), (En Banc) that a state conviction for burglary where the statute is missing an element of the generic crime, may be subject to the modified categorical approach, even though most other Circuit Courts of Appeal would not allow it."	"holding that ""a one-element approach"" is ""flatly incompatible"" with the Court's precedent"	holding that under narrow circumstances a sentencing court can look beyond the state statutory definition of burglary and examine the charging instrument and jury instructions to determine whether the defendant was actually convicted of generic burglary	holding that, in offense of making false statement within jurisdiction of agency of United States, the federal agency element is a jurisdictional requirement only and conviction does not require the defendant knew of that element at the time of the offense	"holding that courts ""may look only to the statutory definitions—i.e ., the elements—of a defendant’s prior offenses"""	holding that the trial court’s erroneous ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove the existence of an alleged element of the crime at defendant's trial that it was not, in fact, required to prove was not subject to appellate review	3

"holding that States ""cannot impose regulations that are hostile to the religious beliefs of affected citizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices"""	holding that the section of the Civil Rights Act exempting religious organizations from the Act's ban on religious discrimination in employment did not violate the Establishment Clause and that the exemption shielded a church-run gymnasium from liability under the Act in a suit brought by a building engineer	"holding that when an individual asks for a draft exemption on religious grounds, the local draft board and the Court are permitted to ""decide whether the beliefs professed by a registrant are sincerely held and whether they are, in his own scheme of things, religious"""	holding that a prison's grooming policy substantially burdened a Muslim prisoner's sincerely held religious belief that he must grow a beard	holding that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause because it does not “differentiate among bona fide faiths” and “confers no privileged status on any particular religious sect, and singles out no bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment”	3
44	Whether the express preemption provision of the Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §360k(a), preempts state-law claims seeking damages for injuries caused by medical devices that received premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration.	"holding that § 360k of the Medical Device Amendments, which preempts ""any requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,"" does not ""den[y] Florida the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of common-law duties when those duties parallel federal requirements."""	holding that Class III premarket approval imposed federal requirements on a device, even though it was used in 10 an off-label manner	holding that the FDA's decision not to take enforcement actions to prevent violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 301 et seq., is not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 500 et seq.	holding that a company may bring a claim against a competitor under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, for misleading product labeling, even where the challenged labeling may be permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 –399f	"holding that an FDA order that a drug is a ""new drug"" within the meaning of FFDCA and therefore requires the filing and approval of an NDA ""is reviewable by the district court under the Administrative Procedure Act"""	1
45	Does 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(1) authorize a court to award fees to a debtor's attorney?	"holding that ""in absence of special circumstances a district court not merely 'may' but must award fees to the prevailing plaintiff"	"holding that, with respect to the plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees in the plaintiff's action under the Clean Air Act, ""absent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant, it is not `appropriate' for a federal court to award attorney's fees under § 307(f) [of the Clean Air Act]"""	"holding that "" § 330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors' attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by § 327[,]"" and ""[i]f the attorney is to be paid from estate funds under § 330(a)(1"	"holding that the amount of damages a plaintiff recovers is ""only one of many factors that a court should consider in calculating an award of attorney's fees"", id. at 574, 106 S.Ct. 2686, and upholding an award of attorney's fees for $245,456.25 for plaintiffs who had received a jury award of $33,350"	holding that Eleventh Amendment did not prohibit enhancement of fee award under Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act against state to compensate for delay in payment; a district court may consider the delay in payment as one factor in determining an appropriate award of attorney's fees	2
46	"Anthony Cooper faced assault with intent to murder charges. His counsel advised him to reject a plea offer based on a misunderstanding of Michigan law. Cooper rejected the offer, and he was convicted as charged. Cooper does not assert that any error occurred at the trial. On habeas review, the Sixth Circuit found that because there is a reasonable probability that Cooper would have accepted the plea offer had he been adequately advised, his Sixth Amendment rights were violated. The writ was conditioned on Michigan re offering the plea agreement. The question presented is:
Is a state habeas petitioner entitled to relief where his counsel deficiently advises him to reject a favorable plea bargain but the defendant is later convicted and sentenced pursuant to a fair trial?"	holding that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, must show “a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea”	holding that a guilty plea to certain charges did not bar trial as to related offenses, as the plea effectuated a waiver of double jeopardy interests	"holding that, where the state court's decision was ""contrary to"" clearly established federal law, because it failed to apply the Strickland standards to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the federal court ""can determine the principles necessary to grant relief"" and apply them to the facts of the case"	holding that where the Government withdrew a more favorable plea bargain when defendant sought to accept it, defendant did not have any due process right to have first offer specifically enforced unless and until it was accepted by the trial court	"holding that the term ""costs"" in Rule 68 includes attorneys' fees and that, therefore, prevailing civil rights plaintiffs ""who reject an offer more favorable than what is thereafter recovered at trial will not recover attorney's fees for services performed after the offer is rejected"""	2
47	Which, if any, state law crop injury claims are preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 136-137?	"holding that only state law claims that are ""inextricably intertwined with considerations of the terms of the labor contract"" are preempted by § 301"	holding that state-law claims are preempted even when the NLRB refuses to assume jurisdiction	"holding that the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act did not preempt a local ordinance requiring a permit for the application of pesticides because the Act ""addresse[d] numerous aspects of pesticide control in considerable detail"" but ""le[ft] substantial portions of the field vacant,"" including an affirmative permit scheme for actual use of pesticides"	holding that claims that termination of employment violated state law and public policy — claims which required only “purely factual inquiry into any retaliatory motive of the employer” — were not preempted by the RLA	holding that a petitioner's suit challenging his previous incarceration for failing to pay child support was not moot because there was “a more than ‘reasonable’ likelihood that Turner will again be ‘subjected to the same action’ ” in light of numerous failures to pay	4
48	Whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment.	"holding that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction, but no monetary damages, was a ""prevailing party"" under § 1988 because the injunction ordered the defendants to change their behavior in a way that directly benefited the plaintiff"	"holding that certain categories of speech, including ""advocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless action; obscenity; defamation; speech integral to criminal conduct; so-called ‘fighting words'; child pornography; fraud; true threats; and speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the government has the power to prevent"" are not protected by the First Amendment"	holding that the ongoing permanent injunction in a defamation suit prevented the plaintiff's death from mooting the defendant's appeal	"holding that, in a case where a ""private figure"" brings a defamation claim based on a matter ""of public concern,"" the ""common law's rule on falsity—that the defendant must bear the burden of proving truth—must ... fall ... to a constitutional requirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of showing falsity"""	holding that an appeal from a preliminary injunction was not rendered moot by an order granting a permanent injunction, where the issue appealed “[was] independent of [the plaintiffs’] claim on the merits” and 2 “ha[d] nothing to do with the validity of the permanent injunction”	2
49	Does the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit a state legislature from removing the authority of state political subdivisions to make payroll deductions for political activities under a statute that is concededly valid as applied to state government employers?	holding that a political majority may not restructure the political process to make it more difficult for a political minority to obtain favorable government action in a race discrimination case	"holding that government may not retaliate against contractors or ""regular provider of services"" for exercising First Amendment rights of political association or expression of political allegiance ""unless political affiliation is a reasonably appropriate requirement for the [services] in question"""	holding that Idaho's limitation on public employee payroll deductions did not implicate the First Amendment, as the prohibition simply prevented organizations from enlisting the state's support of their speech	"holding that a state may not, however, ""grant its political subdivisions a power to discriminate against interstate commerce that the state lacked in the first instance"""	"holding that ""[n]either the right to associate nor the right to participate in political activities is absolute,"" and Congress may prohibit federal employees from participating in political activities in view of its interest in maintaining a nonpartisan work force"	2
50	"1. Whether a habeas petitioner's claim has been ""adjudicated on the merits"" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) where the state court denied relief in an explained decision but did not expressly acknowledge a federal-law basis for the claim. 

2. Whether, under § 2254, a federal habeas court (a) may grant relief on the ground that the petitioner had a Sixth Amendment right to retain a biased juror on the panel and (b) may reject a state court’s finding of juror bias because it disagrees with the finding and the reasons stated for it, even where the finding was rationally supported by evidence in the state-court record.
Whether a habeas petitioner's claim has been ""adjudicated on the merits"" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) where the state court denied relief in an explained decision but did not expressly acknowledge a federal-law basis for the claim."	"holding that although § 2254(d) relieves a federal court of AEDPA deference when the state court makes an unreasonable determination of facts, it ""does not repeal the command of § 2254 that habeas relief may be afforded to a state prisoner ‘only on the ground’ that his custody violates federal law"""	"holding that where a state habeas court issues an opinion that addresses some issues but does not expressly address the federal habeas claim in question, that claim ""must be presumed to have been adjudicated on the merits by the [state habeas court] ... the restrictive standard of review set out in § 2254(d) applies"""	holding that a § 2254 habeas petitioner was entitled to habeas relief on the basis of a Batson claim	holding that “clearly established Federal law,” as determined by the Supreme Court for the purposes of § 2254(d), includes Supreme Court decisions in existence at the time of the state-court adjudication on the merits	holding that a claim had not been adjudicated on the merits where state courts had found it to have been previously litigated (and dismissed it on that ground), but in fact it had not been	1
51	"QUESTION PRESENTED:
Does 18 U.S.C. § 666 criminalize acts of bribery lacking a nexus to a federal interest and, if so, is the statute in that respect a constitutional exercise of Congress's powers?"	holding the federal bribery statute is “ ‘applicable to all persons performing activities for or on behalf of the United States,’ whatever the form of delegation of authority”	holding that commercial bribery falls under the definition of bribery under the Travel Act, which was passed nine years before RICO was enacted	"holding that Speech or Debate Clause protects ""acts generally done in the course of the process of enacting legislation"" and reversing dismissal of bribery indictment where conviction would not require inquiry into legislative acts"	holding that, absent evidence that Congress intended a federal statute to provide the exclusive remedy for a plaintiff's claims, the question of preemption by federal law is solely a defense, and does not justify removal	"holding that Congress was authorized under the Spending Clause to enact § 666 to ""protect spending objects from the menace of local administrators on the take"""	4
52	"A long-time resident of California sued that State in a Nevada state court, alleging that California committed the torts of invasion of privacy, outrage, abuse of process, and fraud in the course of a personal income tax investigation concerning the timing of the individual's change of residence from California to Nevada. California Government Code section 860.2 reads: ""Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by. ..(a) Instituting any judicial or administrative proceeding or action for or incidental to the assessment or collection of a tax.""
Did the Nevada Supreme Court impermissibly interfere with California's capacity to fulfill its sovereign responsibilities, in derogation of article IV, section 1, by refusing to give full faith and credit to California Government Code section 860.2, in a suit brought against California for the torts of invasion of privacy, outrage, abuse of process, and fraud alleged to have occurred in the course of California's administrative efforts to determine a former resident's liability for California personal income tax?"	holding that a forum is not required to extend sovereign immunity to other states sued in its courts, but should extend immunity under the principle of comity unless doing so would violate the forum's public policies	"holding that ""the responsibility for assuring that the constitutionally adequate procedures governing California's parole system are properly applied rests with California courts, and is no part of the Ninth Circuit's business"""	holding that California was not required to apply Nevada's statutory cap on monetary damages in tort actions against the state when the accident involving a state employee occurred in California	"holding that the defendant's contacts with California were sufficient to establish minimum contacts because the allegedly libelous publication reported activities in California, most of the harm or ""effects"" to the plaintiffs reputation and career occurred in California, and the defendant's intentional tortious actions were ""aimed at California"""	holding that the FAA did not preempt California law permitting court to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation where parties had selected California law in a standard choice of law provision	0
53	"In South Carolina, a criminal defendant's evidence of third-party guilt is inadmissible if, when comparing this evidence standing alone against the prosecution's evidence, the trial court finds that it fails to create a reasonable inference of innocence. In making this comparison, if the trial court finds the prosecution's evidence -- and especially its forensic evidence -- to be ""strong,"" third-party guilt evidence is per se inadmissible because it is deemed, as a matter of law, to be insufficient to ""overcome"" the prosecution's evidence so as to create a reasonable inference of innocence.
Whether South Carolina's rule governing the admissibility of third-party guilt evidence violates a criminal defendant's constitutional right to present a complete defense grounded in the Due Process, Confrontation, and Compulsory Process Clauses?"	holding that 6 “the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request 7 violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, 8 irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”	holding that the defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to present a defense when his proffered evidence that another person committed the crimes was excluded on grounds that disputed forensic evidence linked the defendant to the crimes	Holding evidence is material to guilt if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different “had the evidence been disclosed to the defense.”	holding that a Military Rule of Evidence, which makes polygraph evidence inadmissible in court-martial proceedings, does not unconstitutionally abridge the right of the accused to present a defense	"holding that a showing of actual innocence requires ""evidence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of non-harmless constitutional error."""	1
54	"Did the Third Circuit err in holding, in accord with the Ninth Circuit but in contrast to nine other Courts of Appeals, that under the ""inquiry notice"" standard applicable to federal securities fraud claims, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until an investor receives evidence of scienter without the benefit of any investigation?"	holding that in order to show a well-founded fear of persecution, the standard applicable to asylum claims, the petitioner need not demonstrate that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted upon return to the country in question, the standard applicable to withholding of removal claims	"holding that ""facts that tend to show a materially false or misleading statement"" do not always suffice ""to show scienter as well"""	holding that the Court of Federal Claims is not the appropriate authority to determine retirement issues, as that arena of federal employee litigation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit	holding that the statute of limitations did not begin to run on the date the defendants' tax returns were initially due, but rather on the date they actually filed the returns after the defendants obtained an extension	holding that because the FCA does not provide a statute of limitations for retaliation claims, courts should apply the most closely analogous state statute of limitations	1
55	Whether the Florida Supreme Court has decided an important federal question in a way that conflicts with the established Fourth Amendment precedent of this Court by holding that an alert by a well-trained narcotics detection dog certified to detect illegal contraband is insufficient to establish probable cause for the search of a vehicle?	holding that a drug-sniffing dog's detection of drugs constitutes probable cause absent a showing of the dog's unreliability	holding that an arrest supported by probable cause and following a traffic stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment because of police officer's subjective motivation to search vehicle for evidence of crime	holding that the warrantless seizure of property in a vehicle that officers had probable cause to believe was contraband was permissible	holding that the Fourth Amendment is not violated when police use a drug-detection dog to sniff around the exterior of a vehicle during a lawful traffic stop lasting less than ten minutes, even when no reasonable, articulable suspicion of drug activity supports the use of the dog	"holding that dog sniff of vehicle was not a search within meaning of Fourth Amendment and explaining that ""governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband `compromises no legitimate privacy interest.'"""	0
56	Does this Court's decision in Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367 (1988), constitute a new rule of law that cannot be applied retroactively to award sentencing relief to a prisoner whose conviction became final before Mills was announced?	holding that state supreme court's determination that change it announced in definition of statutory term had evolved over time supported not applying the decision retroactively, but remanding for determination of due process question whether definitional change had evolved when defendant's conviction became final	holding that another Supreme Court decision finding that a particular warrantless search lacked probable cause and contravened the Fourth Amendment would not be applied retroactively to defendant's case even though it was pending on appeal on date the decision was announced	holding that Mills announced a new rule of constitutional law that nevertheless may not be applied retroactively	"holding that, subject to certain exceptions, ""a decision of this Court construing the Fourth Amendment is to be applied retroactively to all convictions that were not yet final at the time the decision was rendered"""	holding that where a state court decision does not create a new rule, but merely interprets a state criminal statute, that decision applies to any § 2254 petitioner whose conviction under that statute was final at the time of the state court’s decision	2
57	"Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a lawful permanent resident who has been ""convicted"" of an ""aggravated felony"" is ineligible to seek cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3). The courts of appeals have divided 4-2 on the following question presented by this case:
Whether a person convicted under state law for simple drug possession (a federal law misdemeanor) has been ""convicted"" of an ""aggravated felony"" on the theory that he could have been prosecuted for recidivist simple possession (a federal law felony), even though there was no charge or finding of a prior conviction in his prosecution for possession."	holding that a violation of § 7206 can be serious enough to be an aggravated felony and deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act	"holding that the defendant's prior drug conviction for simple possession did not constitute a ""controlled substance offense"" because the plain language of § 4B1.2(b) requires that the prior conviction involve possession with intent to distribute"	holding that only a controlled substance violation that is punishable as a felony under the federal Controlled Substances Act can constitute an aggravated felony and finding that it is not enough that the crime is punishable as a felony under state law	holding that 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2), which authorizes increased sentence for a deported alien's illegal return if the deportation was subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction, is a penalty provision and that the aggravated felony need not be charged in the indictment	holding that a defendant convicted of a possession offense that has not been enhanced based on a prior conviction has not been convicted of an aggravated felony	4
58	Whether the 180-day statutory time limit for filing an appeal with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board from a final Medicare payment determination made by a fiscal intermediary, 42 U.S.C. 1395oo(a)(3), is subject to equitable tolling.	"holding that where a narrow tolling provision in § 507 provided tolling unavailable under traditional equitable tolling principles, it ""supplement[ed]"" equitable tolling rather than implying its unavailability"	holding that refusal by fiscal intermediary to reopen a reimbursement determination pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 405.1885 is not a final reviewable decision	holding that Congress need not “incant magic words in order to speak clearly,” and requiring that the Court “consider ‘context, including this Court’s interpretations of similar provisions in many years past.’”(citation omitted)	holding that where the statute at issue provided for an additional 60 days to file for good cause shown and Congress had demonstrated an intent to preclude tolling, the 90-day period to file a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court was not subject to equitable tolling	holding that the time limit for filing a petition for certiorari is not jurisdictional	2

61	"In California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 585-586 (2000), this Court specified how States could structure a top-two primary system that does not violate the associational rights of a political party. Pursuant to the Initiative power which the People of the State of Washington reserved to themselves in their State Constitution, the voters of the State of Washington enacted a top-two primary law that the Washington State Grange had drafted to comply with Jones. That law makes the State primary a contest to select the two most popular candidates for the November ballot - regardless of party nominations or party selection. That law also allows candidates for certain offices to disclose on the ballot the name of the party (if any) which that candidate personally prefers. The Ninth Circuit invalidated this top-two primary system in its entirety, holding that the First Amendment (applied to the States through the 14th Amendment) prohibits a State from so allowing a candidate to disclose the name of the party he or she personally prefers on the ballot.
Does the First Amendment prohibit top-two election systems that allow a candidate to disclose on the ballot the name of the party he or she personally prefers?"	holding that the State's legitimate interest in preventing political party raiding was not sufficient to justify the substantial restraint of a statute prohibiting voters from voting in a party primary if they had voted in another party's primary within the preceding twenty-three months	"holding that although minor party candidates face numerous problems in obtaining political office, state is under no duty to ameliorate those problems; rather, state legislation ""may, in practice, favor the traditional two-party system"""	"holding courts should ""[e]xercis[e] judicial restraint"" to prevent ""premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy."""	holding that Wisconsin's asserted compelling interests in preserving the integrity of the election process, providing secrecy of the ballot, increasing voter participation in primaries, and preventing harassment of voters did not justify the State's substantial intrusion into the associational freedom of members of a minor party	holding that a California statute requiring that political candidates pay a fixed filing fee was unconstitutional as applied to an indigent political candidate to the extent the statute failed to provide reasonable alternative means of ballot access	2
62	Did  the  Ninth  Circuit  err  in  holding,  in  conflict  with  the  First,  Sixth,  and Eleventh  Circuits,  that  the  Tax  Injunction  Act,  28  U.S.C.  §  1341,  and principles  of  comity  that  traditionally  restrain  federal  judicial  interference with state tax systems do not  require district courts to dismiss constitutional challenges  to  state  tax  credits  that  directly  impact  the  administration  of  a State's tax system?	"holding that the ""rule against superfluities"" means that "" statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant"""	holding that a New Hampshire income tax that effectively applied only to nonresidents violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause because the tax categorically denied nonresidents an exemption from the tax without imposing a similar or offsetting tax on residents	holding that taxpayers are barred by the principle of comity from asserting § 1983 damages actions in federal courts based on the administration of state tax systems	"holding that the collection of tax revenue under the label of a ""tax penalty"" against a responsible corporate officer constituted the collection of a ""tax"" within the meaning of the predecessor statute to Section C"	holding that a party who, though not assessed a tax, paid a tax under protest to remove a federal tax lien from her property was a “taxpayer” entitled to bring administrative tax refund claim	0
63	"This Court has held that antitrust “per se rules are appropriate only for conduct that . . .  would always or almost always tend to restrict competition.” Modern economic analysis establishes that vertical minimum resale price maintenance does not meet this condition because the practice often has substantial competition-enhancing effects. QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
The question presented is whether vertical minimum resale price maintenance agreements should be deemed per se illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or whether they should instead be evaluated under the rule of reason."	holding that the goal of judicial scrutiny is to “distinguish between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest”	"holding that the per se rule does not apply to a vertical agreement between a buyer and supplier, and noting that ""precedent limits the per se rule in the boycott context to cases involving horizontal agreements among direct competitors"""	holding that New 7 York’s resale price maintenance scheme for liquor was preempted by the Sherman Act	holding that the only vertical restraints that create a per se antitrust violation are price-fixing schemes	"holding that because the rent controls were not ""a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act,"" the court ""need not address whether . . . they would be exempt under the state-action doctrine from antitrust scrutiny"""	0
64	"Whether the Federal Circuit has erred in holding that a claimed invention cannot be held ""obvious"", and thus unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § lO3(a), in the absence of some proven ""'teaching, suggestion, or motivation' that would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the relevant prior art teachings in the manner claimed."""

65	What is the scope of the jurisdictional stripping provision of 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) and whether the statute removes jurisdiction from federal courts to review rulings on motions to reopen by the Board of Immigration Appeals?	holding that the Court of Federal Claims is not the appropriate authority to determine retirement issues, as that arena of federal employee litigation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit	holding that a court of appeals has jurisdiction over a small category of rulings if the rulings “are conclusive,” “resolve important questions separate from the merits,” and “are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action”	holding that the timing requirements of 26 U.S.C. § 6511 are jurisdictional, even though the statute does not refer to the courts' jurisdiction, because of the provision's “detail, its technical language, the iteration of the limitations in both procedural and substantive forms, and the explicit listing of exceptions”	"holding that 8 U.S.C. § 1252, which bars judicial review of agency action ""the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General,"" applies only to ""determinations made discretionary by statute,"" not those ""declared discretionary by the Attorney General himself through regulation"""	holding that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider whether the Board had erred in finding that certain picketing was lawful because no party had raised the issue to the Board, either during the initial proceedings or on motion for reconsideration	3

85	"The Federal Impact Aid Program, 20 U.S.C. § 7709, was enacted to subsidize local State school districts which have a federal presence within the district such as military bases or, as in the present case, Indian Reservations. These local districts are not able to tax such federally impacted lands. The Impact Aid Program prohibits the State from counting these federal subsidies as part of an impacted district’s budget when the State allocates operational funds to the local districts, unless the State’s operational funding to districts throughout the State is “equalized” under an equalization formula under the Impact Aid Program. If the State’s operational funding is determined to be “equalized,” the State can reduce operational funding to an impacted district by the amount of the Impact Aid subsidy. In 1994, the equalization formula was statutorily created and effectively repealed the equalization formula previously created by the Secretary of the United States Department of Education by regulation. However, in 1996, the Secretary, by regulation, reinstated his repealed and conflicting equalization formula and refuses to follow Congress’ equalization formula. Under Congress’ formula, New Mexico is not “equalized” and the intended beneficiaries receive the Impact Aid. Under the Secretary’s formula, New Mexico is deemed “equalized” and the Impact Aid is taken from the impacted districts. The impacted districts are losing approximately $50,000,000 per year in Impact Aid. The Tenth Circuit was split 6 to 6 on the question, leaving the Secretary’s formula in effect.
Whether the Secretary has the authority to create and impose his formula over the one prescribed by Congress and through this process certify New Mexico’s operational funding for fiscal year 1999- 2000 as “equalized,” thereby diverting the Impact Aid subsidies to the State and whether this is one of the rare cases where this Court should exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to correct a plain error that affects all State school districts that educate federally connected children."

89	"The City and County of San Francisco adopted an ordinance that prohibited hotels from continuing their historic, duly-licensed operation as hotels, but allowed hotel owners to avoid those restrictions by paying an exaction. Petitioners brought this action challenging the exaction based on the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit initially refused to reach the merits of the constitutional challenge, finding that petitioners were required to ripen their claim by seeking compensation in state court under Williamson County Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City. Once the claim was ripe, the Ninth Circuit again refused to reach the merits of the constitutional challenge, finding that the claim was barred by issue preclusion. In reaching that conclusion, the Ninth Circuit held that the California Supreme Courts' refusal to apply heightened scrutiny to legislative exactions under state law is consistent with federal Takings law.

Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), this Court held that mandatory application of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines violates a criminal defendant’s right under the Sixth Amendment to have facts that increase his or her sentence determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court further held that to avoid the Sixth Amendment violation, the Guidelines are to be applied as advisory only, and as one of a number of factors both that a sentencing court must consider pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3553(a) in exercising its discretion in selecting a sentence and that a court of appeals must consider when reviewing the sentence for reasonableness. In light of the Court’s holdings, the following questions are presented.
In carrying out the mandate of §3553(a) to impose a sentence that is “sufficient but not greater than necessary” on a defendant, may a district court consider either the impact of the so-called “100:1 crack/powder ratio” implemented in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines or the reports and recommendations of the U.S. Sentencing Commission in 1995, 1997, and 2002 regarding the ratio?"

Whether Indian tribal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate civil tort claims as an “other means” of regulating the conduct of a nonmember bank owning fee-land on a reservation that entered into a private commercial agreement with a member-owned corporation?"	holding that the tribe's authority to tax nonmember mining and drilling on tribal land derived from its inherent power to govern and pay for the costs of self-government and stating that such regulations were also within the tribe's inherent power to condition the continued presence of nonmembers on tribal land	holding that federal district court had diversity jurisdiction over insurance dispute, but that a federal court may not exercise diversity jurisdiction over a civil dispute relating to reservation affairs before an appropriate Indian tribal court system has had an opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction	"holding that ""the retained sovereignty of the tribe as a political and social organization to govern its own affairs does not include the authority to impose criminal sanctions"" on a nonmember Indian who committed murder on the tribe's reservation"	holding that a tribal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a suit by an Indian plaintiff against a non-Indian defendant for conduct involving the sale of fee land within Indian country	"holding ""tribal courts may not entertain claims against nonmembers arising out of accidents on state highways, absent a statute or treaty authorizing the tribe to govern the conduct of nonmembers on the highway in question"""	3
127	"Section 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a debt for money obtained by means of fraud (and certain other categories of debt) is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. This case presents a question that has divided the courts of appeals:
Whether an otherwise nondischargeable debt becomes dischargeable if the parties enter into a settlement agreement resolving the amount of the debt?"	"holding that 15 U.S.C. § 1692e ""do[es] not merely impose procedural requirements upon debt collectors, but instead 'create a private duty owed personally to' a consumer by a debt collector to refrain from using false, deceptive, or misleading means or representations in attempting to collect a debt"""	holding that federal bankruptcy law preempted a state law that interfered with federal bankruptcy law’s goal of providing uniform standards for determining discharge of debt	holding that settlement agreement of underlying suit, which did not settle the issue of fraud, did not bar plaintiff from showing that the settlement debt actually arose out of fraud and was, therefore, nondischargeable under § 523	"holding that post-petition interest on nondischargeable tax debt remained a personal liability of the debtor after bankruptcy, finding ""the reasons—and thus the rule—inapplicable"""	"holding that lawyers who regularly collect consumer debt through litigation may be considered ""debt collectors"" under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692- 1692o, and are therefore subject to liability for litigation activities"	2
128	"Employee benefit plans often cover a participant's medical bills in the event of injury but require that, if the participant obtains compensation from a third party for that injury, he or she reimburse the plan in full. Under Section 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA""), plans may enforce these reimbursement provisions in court by seeking ""appropriate equitable relief” to enforce ""the terms of the plan."" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3). Twice in recent years this Court has resolved disputes about how Section 502(a)(3) works in reimbursement actions. In the more recent case, Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U.S. 356 (2006), the Court expressly reserved a third question about the provision. The Third Circuit, in its words, has now ""squarely"" answered ""the question that Sereboff left open,"" Pet. App. 9a, and has done so in a way that, as it acknowledged, splits the circuits.
Whether the Third Circuit correctly held-in conflict with the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits-that ERISA Section 502(a)(3) authorizes courts to use equitable principles to rewrite contractual language and refuse to order participants to reimburse their plan for benefits paid, even where the plan's terms give it an absolute right to full reimbursement."	holding that a contractual right to reimbursement from funds recovered from a third party supported a plan’s action under § 502(a)(3) because the clause established an equitable lien by agreement	holding that an ERISA plan fiduciary, bringing action under ERISA § 502, could enforce a lien on monies received by the beneficiary from a third party tortfeasor, reasoning that the lien would serve to hold the fiduciary and beneficiary to their mutual promises pursuant to the governing ERISA plan document	holding that ERISA preempted a state anti-subrogation law, the latter of which prohibited an employee welfare benefit plan from requiring reimbursement from a participant that already had recovered from a third party, and noting that preemption served “to ensure that benefit plans will be governed by only a single set of regulations”	"holding that a participant in a disability plan could not bring suit under § 502 to recover consequential damages arising from delay in the processing of her claim because § 502 ""provid[es] remedies that would protect the entire plan rather than individuals"""	"holding that an action for reimbursement under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") plan involved a legal determination, and therefore was not authorized as an equitable remedy under § 502 of ERISA, because the petitioners were seeking to impose personal liability on the respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money damages"	1

This petition presents two recurring questions of jurisprudential significance involving equitable tolling under AEDPA that have divided the circuits:
Whether there is an actual-innocence exception to the requirement that a petitioner show an extraordinary circumstance that ""prevented timely filing"" of a habeas petition."	holding that attorney abandonment constitutes an extraordinary circumstance that allows a federal court to disregard the state procedural bar to hearing a habeas petition	holding that whether the AEDPA governs depends on whether the petitioner had filed an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits prior to AEDPA's effective date	holding that the right to appointed counsel in federal habeas proceedings “adheres prior to the filing of a formal, legally sufficient habeas corpus petition” because it “includes a right to legal assistance in the preparation of a habeas corpus application”	"holding that a showing of actual innocence requires ""evidence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of non-harmless constitutional error."""	holding that the time limit for filing a petition for certiorari is not jurisdictional	3

Whether §4(a) of the Voting Rights Act, which permits ""political subdivisions"" of a State covered by §5's requirement that certain jurisdictions preclear changes affecting voting with the federal government to bail out of §5 coverage if they can establish a ten-year history of compliance with the VRA, must be available to any political subunit of a covered State when the Court's precedent requires ""political subdivision"" to be given its ordinary meaning throughout most of the VRA and no statutory text abrogates that interpretation with respect to §4(a).
2. Whether, under the Court's consistent jurisprudence requiring that remedial legislation be congruent and proportional to substantive constitutional guarantees, the 2006 enactment of the §5 preclearance requirement can be applied as a valid exercise of Congress's remedial powers under the Reconstruction Amendments when that enactment was founded on a congressional record demonstrating no evidence of a persisting pattern of attempts to evade court enforcement of voting-rights guarantees in jurisdictions covered only on the basis of data 35 or more years old, or even when considered under a purportedly less stringent rational-basis standard

133	"Section 507 of the Bankruptcy Code grants payment priority to some unsecured claims, including claims for certain wages and employee benefits earned before the bankruptcy filing. 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(4), (5). Such priority claims must be paid in full before other unsecured claims may be paid from estate assets. The debtor in this chapter 11 case agreed to settle a cause of action belonging to the estate. Rather than distributing the settlement proceeds under a confirmed plan of reorganization, the debtor then sought a ""structured dismissal"" of the bankruptcy case. The dismissal order provided that the settlement proceeds would be paid to general unsecured creditors, rather than to petitioners, former employees of the debtor whose claims have priority over those of general unsecured creditors under § 507(a)(4) and (5). The question presented, on which the courts of appeals are divided, is:
Whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the statutory priority scheme."	holding that the claims that will have priority in advance of payment to all other creditors are the costs and expenses of administration of the estate	"holding that a bankruptcy court lacks the authority, absent the consent of affected parties, to order a distribution scheme related to a Chapter 11 dismissal that skips the Bankruptcy Code’s ""basic priority rules"" for ""final distributions of estate value in business bankruptcies"""	"holding that ""it is sensible to view the debtor-in-possession as the same `entity' which existed before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, but empowered by virtue of the Bankruptcy Code to deal with its contracts and property in a manner it could not have employed absent the bankruptcy filing"""	holding that bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to issue injunction prohibiting execution of supersedeas bond that was not part of the debtor's Chapter 11 bankruptcy estate because bankruptcy court's jurisdiction extends to “more than the simpl[e] proceedings involving the property of the estate”	holding that the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act,which ordered a debtor railroad company's bankruptcy estate to pay benefits to former employees of the debtor, was a law on the subject of bankruptcies and violated the Bankruptcy Clause	1
134	"The Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 et seq., requires that a criminal defendant be tried within 70 days of indictment or the defendant's first appearance in court, whichever is later.

Whether a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C.

Such requirements are common in manufacturing firms. However, under section 203(o) of the Act an employer need not compensate a worker for time spent in ""changing clothes"" (even if it is a principal activity) if that time is expressly excluded from compensable time under a bona fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to that worker. The interrelated questions presented are:

In an appeal certified directly from the bankruptcy court, the Seventh Circuit held that the Debtors could only satisfy the statute by allowing their secured creditor to bid its claim in lieu of cash (i.e., credit bid) at the sale pursuant to Section 1129(b )(2)(A)(ii). This holding directly conflicts with the Third Circuit's decision in In re Philadelphia Newspapers, 599 F.3d 298 (3d Cir. 2010), and the Fifth Circuit's decision in Scotia Pacific Co., LLC v. Official Unsecured Creditors' Comm. (In re Pacific Lumber Co.), 584 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2009). The question presented is:

The First, Second, and Third Circuits have held that drug companies have no duty to disclose adverse event reports until the reports provide statistically significant evidence that the adverse events may be caused by, and are not simply randomly associated with, a drug's use. Expressly disagreeing with those decisions, the Ninth Circuit below rejected a statistical significance standard and allowed the case to proceed despite the lack of any allegation that the undisclosed adverse event reports were statistically significant.

The Sixth Circuit agreed, reasoning that Brentwood’s voluntary agreement is irrelevant to the constitutional analysis and declining to recognize any substantial state interest in fair and level athletic competition.

168	"For more than 25 years, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) held that a legal permanent resident (LPR) who is deportable due to a criminal conviction could seek a discretionary waiver of removal under Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1182(c), provided that the conviction also would have constituted a waivable basis for exclusion. In 2005, the BIA abruptly changed course, adding a requirement that the LPR be deportable under a statutory provision that used ""similar language"" to an exclusion provision. Deportable LPRs who departed and reentered the United States after their conviction, however, may seek Section 212(c) relief under a longstanding ""nunc pro tunc"" procedure that does not turn on similar language between deportation and exclusion provisions. Thus, under the BIA's current view, an LPR who pled guilty to an offense that renders him both deportable and excludable, but under provisions that use dissimilar phrasing, will be eligible for Section 212(c) relief from deportation if he departed and reentered the United States after his conviction, but ineligible if he did not depart. The circuits are split three ways on the lawfulness of the BIA's new interpretation.
Whether a lawful permanent resident who was convicted by guilty plea of an offense that renders him deportable and excludable under differently phrased statutory subsections, but who did not depart and reenter the United States between his conviction and the commencement of removal proceedings, is categorically foreclosed from seeking discretionary relief from removal under former Section 212(c) of the INA."	holding that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, must show “a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea”	holding that Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 did not prevent section 212(c) relief from being available to aliens who pled guilty before enactment and who would otherwise have been eligible for section 212(c) relief at time of guilty pleas	holding that a violation of § 7206 can be serious enough to be an aggravated felony and deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act	"holding that the Board of Immigration Appeals violated the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard when it ""hing[ed] a deportable alien's eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories—a matter irrelevant to the alien's fitness to reside in this country,"" id. at 53, 132 S.Ct. 476"	holding that lawful permanent resident aliens may only be held pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1231 for a period reasonably necessary to secure the alien's removal and establishing a presumption that detention is reasonable for six months after the conclusion of the removal period	3

1. Can a trial court’s unconstitutional exclusion of reliable evidence of third party guilt be deemed harmless error?
2. This Court’s decisions in Holmes v. South Carolina __U.S.___, 164 L.Ed.2d 503, 126 S.Ct. 1727 (2006), and House v. Bell, __U.S.__, 2006 U.S. Lexis 4675 (2006), were handed down after the decision of the Ninth Circuit below. Should this Court issue a GVR order in this case, directing the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its decision that the unconstitutional exclusion of reliable evidence of third party guilt can be harmless, in light of Holmes and House?
If constitutional error in a state trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, is the prejudicial impact of the error assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), or that enunciated in Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993)? Does it matter which harmless error standard is employed?

175	"Section 319 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 created the so-called “Millionaires’ Amendment.” The three-judge district court found that Congress enacted section 319 to achieve equity between congressional candidates utilizing personal funds for their campaigns and candidates relying mainly on contributed funds. Under the statute, when candidates for the United States House of Representatives exceed $350,000 in personal campaign expenditures their opponents may be entitled to receive: 1) contributions from donors at triple the statutory limit; 2) contributions from donors who have reached their statutory limit for aggregate campaign donations; and 3) coordinated expenditures from party committees in excess of the statutory limit. To effectuate application of section 319, the statute also imposes significant notification and disclosure obligations upon self- financed candidates. The questions presented are:

What is the correct trigger event for the application of the AEDPA in capital cases?"	holding that an amendment to a criminal statute did not apply retroactively to offenses committed prior to the effective date of the amendment, even though the defendants were sentenced after that date	"holding that there was no due process violation under AEDPA where the challenged jury instruction ""parroted the language of the statute"""	holding that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) did not deprive district courts of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 over legal questions raised by criminal aliens in habeas petitions seeking review of final removal orders	holding that whether the AEDPA governs depends on whether the petitioner had filed an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits prior to AEDPA's effective date	holding that, if legislation includes a provision that expressly applies to cases pending on the date of enactment and another provision that does not, the construction “indicat[es] implicitly” that the latter applies only to cases filed after the date of enactment	3
191	Whether a federal criminal defendant, whose new appellate counsel fails to raise, on direct appeal, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, is procedurally barred from asserting that constitutional claim in a habeas corpus proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255?	"holding that petitioner did not have a ""constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment"" and that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during state habeas appellate proceedings does not constitute cause to excuse the procedural defects"	holding a petitioner arguing ineffective assistance by his appellate counsel must establish both his appellate counsel's performance was objectively unreasonable and there is a reasonable probability that, but for appellate counsel's objectively unreasonable conduct, the petitioner would have prevailed on appeal	"holding that to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that ""counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness"" and ""there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different"""	holding that “ineffective-assistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.”	holding that a defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as cause for procedural default in a § 2254 petition is a constitutional claim that is also sub- ject to being procedurally defaulted if it was not timely raised before the state court	3
192	"Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50 U.S.C. 1881a (Supp. II 2008)-referred to here as Section 1881a - allows the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to authorize jointly the ""targeting of [non-United States] persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States"" to acquire ""foreign intelligence information,"" normally with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's prior approval of targeting and other procedures. 50 U.S.C. 1881a(a), (b), (g)(2) and (i)(3); cf. 50 U.S.C. 1881a(c) (2). Respondents are United States persons who may not be targeted for surveillance under Section 1881a. Respondents filed this action on the day that Section 1881a was enacted, seeking both a declaration that Section 1881a is unconstitutional and an injunction permanently enjoining any foreign-intelligence surveillance from being conducted under Section 1881a. The question presented is:
Whether respondents lack Article III standing to seek prospective relief because they proffered no evidence that the United States would imminently acquire their international communications using Section 1881a-authorized surveillance and did not show that an injunction prohibiting Section 1881a-authorized surveillance would likely redress their purported injuries."	holding that federal employees suing under section 15 of the ADEA are not entitled to a jury trial on their claims because Congress did not grant that right by statute as they did in section 7(a)	"holding that an expectation of privacy in the contents of a container, even if lawfully frustrated, may be regained by a gap in surveillance; provided only, however, that ""there is a substantial likelihood that the contents of the container have been changed during the gap in surveillance"""	"holding that harm alleged is not cognizable where it is based upon (instructing courts to determine whether ""the physical or mental condition of the person is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite him"""	"holding that the Fourth Amendment protects only ""the people"" of the United States and has no application to search-and-seizure challenges where the challenger is a non-citizen/non-resident alien with no voluntary attachment to the United States and the area searched is located outside of the United States"	"holding that a former Central Intelligence Agency employee's disclosure of intelligence information was unprotected by the First Amendment even though the employee was ""also engaged in criti- cism of the Government"""	2
193	Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendant's refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.	holding that New York could not strip a state Democratic party official of his office on the grounds that he refused to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination before a grand jury	"holding that Miranda requires ""the suspect be informed, as here, that he has the right to an attorney before and during questioning, and that an attorney would be appointed for him if he could not afford one."""	holding that a psychiatrist’s testimony about the defendant’s future dangerousness in a capital felony trial violated the defendant’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights where the defendant was not given Miranda warnings before his psychiatric examination	"holding that an accused who has been advised of his Miranda rights ""has been sufficiently apprised of the nature of his Sixth Amendment rights, and of the consequences of abandoning those rights, so that his waiver on this basis will be considered a knowing and intelligent one"""	holding that no Fifth Amendment violation occurs through use of a defendant's post- arrest, pre-Miranda silence as substantive evidence of guilt if the defendant does not clearly invoke the right to remain silent, but not reaching the question of whether the same would be true in light of a clear invocation of that right	4
194	"Ten states have enacted laws that allow merchants to charge higher prices to consumers who pay with a credit card instead of cash, but require the merchant to communicate that price difference as a cash ""discount"" and not as a credit-card ""surcharge.""
The question presented is:
Do these state no-surcharge laws unconstitutionally restrict speech conveying price information (as the Eleventh Circuit has held), or do they regulate economic conduct (as the Second and Fifth Circuits have held)?"	holding that an “agreement to terminate the practice of giving credit” is appropriately characterized as a price-fixing agreement because “[i]t is virtually self-evident that extending interest-free credit for a period of time is equivalent to giving a discount equal to the value of the use of the purchase price for that period of time”	"holding that consumers who pay a higher price for goods purchased for personal use as a result of antitrust violations sustain an injury in their ""property"" within the meaning of Section 4 of the Clayton Act"	holding that evidence that defendant's price discrimination forced plaintiff to charge higher retail prices for beer and suffered lost sales as a result was sufficient to establish injury	holding that the plaintiffs could not raise a successful vagueness claim because the challenged law clearly proscribed their intended speech	holding that Maine was free to create an incentive for drug companies to negotiate favorable rates with its Medicaid program so long as it did not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction or tie the price of a product purchased in-state to out-of-state products	3
195	Whether the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), vests federal district courts with authority to exercise removal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1441 over lawsuits brought in state court when the state court suit threatens the integrity of the federal court's rulings in ongoing complex litigation.	holding that state court proceeding did not hinder federal court's jurisdiction when state and federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction, and court could not prevent party from simultaneously pursuing claims in both courts	holding that the Court of Federal Claims is not the appropriate authority to determine retirement issues, as that arena of federal employee litigation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit	holding that All Writs Act did not provide jurisdictional basis to remove an action from state to federal court where the district court did not have original jurisdiction over the dispute	"holding provision of FLSA that suit under the Act ""may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction,"" does not bar removal of a suit from state to federal court"	holding that state procedural law applied in state-court litigation of a federal-law claim	2
196	Whether the Third Circuit erred in holding that state and local government employees may sue their employers for retaliation under the First Amendment's Petition Clause when they petitioned the government on matters of purely private concern, contrary to decisions by all ten other federal circuits and four state supreme courts that have ruled on the issue.	holding that the Sixth Circuit erred in finding that the state court's jury instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law	holding that the First Amendment does not require showing of actual malice for recovery of presumed and punitive damages for false statements about private figures involving matters of purely private concern	"holding that courts in the District of Columbia are local rather than federal because Congress ""expressly created"" the courts pursuant to its plenary authority and created a body with authority over matters of ""strictly local concern"""	"holding that the ""framework used to govern Speech Clause claims"" will also apply to claims arising out of the Petition Clause"	"holding that where a state college professor claimed First Amendment retaliation based on his disagreement with the policies of the board of regents, the district court erred in granting summary judgment without analyzing whether he had been terminated for ""public criticism of his superiors on matters of public concern"""	3
197	Are the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments violated by forcing a capital defendant to proceed through penalty phase while shackled and handcuffed to a belly chain in full view of the jury, and if so, doesn't the burden fall on the state to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than on the defendant to show that he was prejudiced?	"holding that once defendant has been convicted fairly in guilt phase of capital trial, presumption of innocence disappears; ""presumption [of innocence] operates at the guilt phase of a trial to remind the jury that the State has the burden of establishing every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt"""	holding that the state court's exclusion of evidence probative of the credibility of the defendant's confession because the proffered evidence was also relevant to voluntariness, an issue the court had already ruled on, violated the defendant's right to a fair trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments	holding that the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause violation in that case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore did not require the conviction to be overturned	holding that the Constitution “prohibit[s] the use of physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination, in the exercise of its discretion, that they are justified by a state interest specific to a particular trial”	"holding that it is not the role of an appellate court to determine whether a jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but, rather, whether a jury's actual finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ""would surely not have been different absent the constitutional error"""	3
198	In the context of a vehicular stop for a minor traffic infraction, may an officer conduct a pat-down search of a passenger when the officer has an articulable basis to believe the passenger might be armed and presently dangerous, but has no reasonable grounds to believe that the passenger is committing, or has committed, a criminal offense?	"holding that probable cause exists when the ""facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge ... are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing... that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense"""	holding that “liability under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention arises only if a passenger's injury is caused by an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger”	"holding that a law enforcement officer’s questions ""into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop . . . do not convert the encoun- ter into something other than a lawful seizure,"" provided those questions ""do not measurably extend the duration of the stop"""	holding that the officer lawfully reached into the suspect's clothing without performing a pat-down where the suspect's failure to comply with the officer's command to exit the vehicle made it impossible for the officer to pat down the suspect without the officer placing himself in a more dangerous position	holding that when a police communique has been issued on the basis of articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion, any authorized officer may make an investigatory stop on the basis of that bulletin, even though the officer making the stop is not aware of the underlying facts	2
199	Whether a dog sniff at the front door of a suspected grow house by a trained narcotics detection dog is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause?	"holding that dog sniff of vehicle was not a search within meaning of Fourth Amendment and explaining that ""governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband `compromises no legitimate privacy interest.'"""	holding that a drug-sniffing dog's detection of drugs constitutes probable cause absent a showing of the dog's unreliability	holding that the Fourth Amendment is not violated when police use a drug-detection dog to sniff around the exterior of a vehicle during a lawful traffic stop lasting less than ten minutes, even when no reasonable, articulable suspicion of drug activity supports the use of the dog	holding that a person’s “mere propinquity” to persons suspected of criminal activity does not provide probable cause to search that person	holding that traditional, property-based principles underpinning the Fourth Amendment, rather than Katz’s privacy analysis, supported suppressing the evidence against Jardines when a drug dog trespassed on the home’s curtilage	4
200	"Daimler AG is a German public stock company that does not manufacture or sell products, own property, or employ workers in the United States. The Ninth Circuit nevertheless held that Daimler AG is subject to general personal jurisdiction in California--and can therefore be sued in the State for alleged human-rights violations committed in Argentina by an Argentine subsidiary against Argentine residents--because it has a different, indirect subsidiary that distributes Daimler AG-manufactured vehicles in California. It is undisputed that Daimler AG and its U.S. subsidiary adhere to all the legal requirements necessary to maintain their separate corporate identities.
The question presented is whether it violates due process for a court to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation based solely on the fact that an indirect corporate subsidiary performs services on behalf of the defendant in the forum State."	"holding that American subsidiary of a Japanese parent had no Treaty defense because the subsidiary was not a ""company of Japan"""	"holding that foreign corporations may not be subject to general jurisdiction ""whenever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate"""	holding that Rule 52(a) requires that the district court’s subsidiary factual determinations should be reviewed for clear error	"holding that while ""subsidiary factual questions"" are subject to § 2254(d)'s presumption, the ultimate legal question of confession's constitutional voluntariness ""is a matter for independent federal determination"""	holding that the Hague Service Convention does not apply when process is served on a foreign corporation by serving its domestic subsidiary which, under state law, is the foreign corporation's involuntary agent for service	1

S. C. §2000d et seq., does “not allow compensatory relief in the absence of proof of discriminatory intent”	holding that a claim for racial discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires proof of a racially discriminatory intent or purpose	"holding that there is no private right of action to enforce disparate impact regulations promulgated under Title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964, because ""Title VI itself directly reaches only instances of intentional discrimination"""	"holding that the phrase ""any action or proceeding"" as used in section 706(k) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.

203	"A single element missing or misdefined in jury instructions can be harmless error if, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error did not contribute to the verdict. Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1 (1999). In contrast, errors that affect the entire framework within which a trial proceeds, rather than errors in the trial process itself, are ""structural"" and will always invalidate a conviction. Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993). It is undisputed in this assault case that the only weapon used was a firearm, but the verdict form for the enhancement failed to distinguish a ""firearm"" finding from a more generic ""deadly weapon"" finding -- the ""firearm"" finding carries a greater sentence.
The question presented here is whether error as to the definition of a sentencing enhancement should be subject to harmless error analysis where it is shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict on the enhancement."	"holding that it is not the role of an appellate court to determine whether a jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but, rather, whether a jury's actual finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ""would surely not have been different absent the constitutional error"""	holding that failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence is an error subject to harmless error analysis	"holding that UNITED STATES v.

United States, 527 U.S. 1, 8 (1999) (quoting Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 310"	holding that application of harmless-error analysis to erroneous presumption depends upon a determination of what evidence the jury actually considered in reaching its verdict and a consideration of whether, in light of that evidence, it is possible to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury's verdict was not affected by the presumption	holding that error involving Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531, and the failure to submit a sentencing factor to a jury, like the failure to submit an element on an offense to the jury, is not structural error and is therefore subject to harmless error review	4
204	"Whether this Court's clearly established precedent under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 holds that a prisoner is always ""in custody"" for purposes of Miranda any time that prisoner is isolated from the general prison population and questioned about conduct occurring outside the prison regardless of the surrounding circumstances."	holding that “clearly established Federal law,” as determined by the Supreme Court for the purposes of § 2254(d), includes Supreme Court decisions in existence at the time of the state-court adjudication on the merits	"holding that the defendant was not ""in custody"" because, inter alia, he ""was not physically restrained or threatened"""	"holding that a petition for habeas corpus is the only federal procedure for attacking ""the validity of the fact or length"" of a state prisoner's confinement and applying this principle to ""areas of particular state administrative concern"" such as the deprivation of a prisoner's good-conduct-time credits in state prison disciplinary proceedings"	"holding that, where prison overcrowding was due to state budget shortfalls, a court-mandated prison-population limit was ""necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners' constitutional rights"" under the Prison Litigation Reform Act"	holding that prisoner was entitled to relief under § 2255 where his sentence was imposed outside of the prisoner’s or counsel’s presence	1
205	"Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(2) allows that ""[a] notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence or order - but before entry of the judgment - is treated as filed on the date of and after entry."" The rule incorporates this Court's decision in Lemke v. United States, 346 U.S. 325 (1953) (per curiam) and decisions of the circuits that a premature notice of appeal matures or springs forward when the judgment under review is entered. The interaction of this rule with deferred restitution judgments has become a source of circuit conflict, particularly following this Court's decision in Dolan v. United States, 560 U.S. 605 (2010), which allows a sentencing court to retain jurisdiction after sentencing to award restitution under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d)(5).
Should the Court grant certiorari to resolve the significant division among the circuits concerning the jurisdictional prerequisites for appealing a deferred restitution award made during the pendency of a timely appeal of a criminal judgment imposing sentence, a question left open by the Court's decision in Dolan v. United States,  560 U.S. 605, 618 (2010)?"	holding that a notice of appeal is ineffective when filed after announcement of the decision but before entry of the order on any post-trial motion referenced in Rule 4	"holding that a defendant's ""single notice of appeal, filed between the initial judgment and [an] amended judgment"" is ""[in]sufficient to invoke appellate review of the later-determined restitution amount,"" at least when the government objects to the defendant's failure to file a notice of appeal after the amended judgment"	"holding that under the Victim and Witness Protection Act, the predecessor of the MVRA, a trial court is authorized to make ""an award of restitution only for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction"""	"holding that restitution order may be entered after the 90-day deadline under 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d) where ""the sentencing court [makes] clear prior to the deadline's expiration that it would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount."""	holding that a sentencing court imposing restitution under the MVRA “must reduce the restitution amount by the amount of money the victim received in selling the collateral, not the value of the collateral when the victim received it”	1

Respondent was a participant in Northwest Airlines' frequent flyer program, which by its terms permitted Northwest to remove participants from the program in Northwest's ""sole judgment."" After respondent was removed from the frequent flyer program, he filed suit against Northwest alleging, inter alia, that Northwest breached both its contractual obligations and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Minnesota law when it exercised its discretion to terminate respondent's membership in the program. Although the district court dismissed the contract claim for failure to state a claim and the implied covenant of good faith claim as preempted by the ADA, the Ninth Circuit reversed as to the implied covenant claim, finding such claims categorically unrelated to a price, route or service under a line of Ninth Circuit cases that have been recognized by other Circuits as inconsistent with this Court's precedents, especially American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U.S. 219 (1995). The question presented is:
Did the court of appeals err by holding, in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, that respondent's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim was not preempted under the ADA because such claims are categorically unrelated to a price, route, or service, notwithstanding that respondent's claim arises out of a frequent flyer program (the precise context of Wolens) and manifestly enlarged the terms of the parties' voluntary undertakings, which allowed termination in Northwest's sole discretion."	holding that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted claims alleging breach of an implied covenant because, under the controlling state law, parties could not contract out of such covenants—and thus they were “regarded as state-imposed”—but noting that if a state permitted parties to voluntarily surrender protections from covenants, then those claims would “escape preemption”	"holding that an anonymous informant's ""ability to predict respondent's future behavior""—namely, the route that respondent would take to deliver a package of cocaine—""demonstrated inside information a special familiarity with respondent's affairs,"" and thus rendered the informant's tip sufficiently reliable—although it was a ""close case"""	"holding that an implied private cause of action exists under Title IX, which states that ""[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied to the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance"""	holding that Maine was free to create an incentive for drug companies to negotiate favorable rates with its Medicaid program so long as it did not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction or tie the price of a product purchased in-state to out-of-state products	holding that requiring a college to modify its clinical nursing program to accommodate a woman with a hearing impairment would fundamentally alter the program by converting it from a clinical program into a program of academic classes	0

However, in Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Servs., Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2411, 2416 (2007), the Court stated that “it is far from clear . . . that when discretionary supplemental jurisdiction is declined the remand is not based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for purposes of § 1447(c) and § 1447(d)” and noted that “[w]e have never passed on whether Cohill remands are subject-matter jurisdictional for purposes of post-1988 versions § 1447(c) and § 1447(d).” Construing Powerex as leaving the question open, the Federal Circuit held that a remand based on declining supplemental jurisdiction can be colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, thus disagreeing with the nine other federal courts of appeals that have construed Cohill as distinguishing between remands for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remands based on declining to exercise subject matter jurisdiction that already exists.

Ct. 2594 (2011), this Court held that Article III of the United States Constitution precludes Congress from assigning certain ""core"" bankruptcy proceedings involving private state law rights to adjudication by non-Article III bankruptcy judges. Applying Stern, the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a fraudulent conveyance action is subject to Article III. The court further held, in conflict with the Sixth Circuit, that the Article III problem had been waived by petitioner's litigation conduct, which the court of appeals construed as implied consent to entry of final judgment by the bankruptcy court. The court of appeals also held, in conflict with the Seventh Circuit, that a bankruptcy court may issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to a district court's de novo review, in ""core"" bankruptcy proceedings where Article III precludes the bankruptcy court from entering final judgment. The court of appeals' decision presents the following questions, about which there is considerable confusion in the lower courts in the wake of Stern:
Whether Article III permits the exercise of the judicial power of the United States by bankruptcy courts on the basis of litigant consent, and, if so, whether ""implied consent"" based on a litigant's conduct, where the statutory scheme provides the litigant no notice that its consent is required, is sufficient to satisfy Article III."	holding that bankruptcy courts, as non- Article III forums, cannot issue final decisions on state common law counterclaims	"holding that when considering Stern claims, i.e., those that are statutorily defined as core proceedings, but which must be adjudicated by an Article III court, ""[t]he bankruptcy court should hear the proceeding and submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review and entry of judgment"""	"holding that the first step is to ""address the jurisdictional question whether [respondent] has standing under Article III of the Constitution to maintain this suit"""	holding that where every Article III judge had an interest in the outcome of the case, the common law rule of necessity prevailed	"holding that, unlike state courts, ""[f]ederal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction; they have only the power that is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress pursuant thereto"""	1
249	"Jack Phillips is a cake artist. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that he engaged in sexual orientation discrimination under the Colorado Anti Discrimination Act (""CADA'') when he declined to design and create a custom cake honoring a same sex marriage because doing so conflicts with his sincerely held religious beliefs.

It reached this conclusion despite the artistry of Phillips' cakes and the Commission's exemption of other cake artists who declined to create custom cakes based on their message. This analysis (1) flouts this Court's controlling precedent, (2) conflicts with Ninth and Eleventh Circuit decisions regarding the free speech protection of art, (3) deepens an existing conflict between the Second, Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits as to the proper test for identifying expressive conduct, and (4) conflicts with free exercise rulings by the Third, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits.

251	"Petitioner Arkansas Game & Fish Commission, a constitutional entity of the State of Arkansas, sought just compensation from the United States under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment for physically taking its bottomland hardwood timber through six consecutive years of protested flooding during the sensitive growing season. The Court of Federal Claims awarded $5.7 million, finding that the Army Corps of Engineers' actions foreseeably destroyed and degraded more than 18 million board feet of timber, left habitat unable to regenerate, and preempted Petitioner's use and enjoyment. The Federal Circuit, with its unique jurisdiction over takings claims, reversed the trial judgment on a single point of law. Contrary to this Court's precedent, a sharply divided 2-1 panel ruled that the United States did not inflict a taking because its actions were not permanent and the flooding eventually stopped. The Federal Circuit denied rehearing en banc in a fractured 7-4 vote. The question presented is:
Whether government actions that impose recurring flood invasions must continue permanently to take property within the meaning of the Takings Clause."	holding that the Court of Federal Claims is not the appropriate authority to determine retirement issues, as that arena of federal employee litigation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit	"holding that ""where the government's activities have already worked a taking of all use of property no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the period during which the taking was effective"""	"holding that a state statute taking, for the government's own use, the interest accruing on a privately owned interpleader fund deposited in the registry of the county court was unconstitutional under the Takings Clause, and that the state could not avoid the constitutional violation by legislatively or judicially recharacterizing the principal as ""public money"""	holding that temporary flooding caused by the Corps of Engineers’ operation of a dam could potentially be compensable through the Takings Clause	"holding that a district court may decline to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims by considering a ""host"" of factors, ""including the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the state law claims, and the character of the governing state law, and the relationship between the state and federal claims"""	3

Pharmacies sell this information to data mining companies, and the data miners aggregate and package the data for use as a marketing tool by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

The Second Circuit, deferring to EPA, held that EPA has authority to retrofit existing facilities.

In the decision below, the Seventh Circuit held that actionable harassment by a person whom the employer deemed a ""supervisor"" and who had the authority to direct and oversee the victim's daily work could not give rise to vicarious liability because the harasser did not also have the power to take formal employment actions against her. The question presented is:
Whether, as the Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits have held, the Faragher and Ellerth ""supervisor"" liability rule (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victim's daily work, or, as the First, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits have held (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to ""hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline"" their victim."

293	"Under state law, the Michigan Liquor Control Commission generally bans out-of- state direct shipment of alcoholic liquor to consumers' doorsteps, but permits in- state licensed wineries to direct ship to consumers, and out-of-state wineries to import through in-state licensed wholesalers.

Any denial of such a request may be appealed through the State court system. Section 2 of the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution expressly prohibits importation of alcoholic beverages into any state for delivery or use, in violation of the laws of the State. The Court of Appeals declared Michigan's alcoholic liquor importation law facially unconstitutional in violation of the Commerce Clause. The question presented is:
Does Michigan's regulation of the importation of beverage alcohol under the 21st Amendment facially violate the Commerce Clause when it permits in-state licensed wineries to directly ship alcohol to consumers, but requires out-of-state wineries to import its products through licensed in-state wholesalers and to sell its products through licensed retailers or request permission of the Liquor Control Commission to bypass this distribution system and ship directly to consumers?"

314	"When the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approves a drug for multiple uses, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drug makers to avoid contested patent litigation by marketing generic versions of the drug solely for non-patented uses. The FDA lacks the authority and expertise needed to verify the patent information submitted by name-brand drug companies, however, so it defers to their descriptions of the scope of their patents. Such companies can therefore block the approval of generic drugs by submitting overbroad patent descriptions to the FDA, effectively extending their patents to cover non-infringing uses. To combat this problem, the Act allows a ""counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [patent] holder to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the holder * * * on the ground that the patent does not claim * * * an approved method of using the drug."" 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). In a 2-1 decision that conflicts with this Court's precedents and recent D.C. Circuit authority, the Federal Circuit held that the counterclaim provision effectively authorizes only ""delet[ingl"" improperly listed patents, but not ""correct[ing]"" information that misrepresents the scope of the approved uses claimed by a patent. That ruling expressly invalidates longstanding FDA regulations defining ""patent information,"" which the FDA deems ""essential"" to administering the Act, without seeking the agency's views. The question presented is:

The Act provides that ""these regulations may contain such classifications...as in the judgment of the Board are necessary"" to effectuate the purposes of the statute. 15 U.S.C. § 1604(a). The Federal Reserve exercised this authority by promulgating Regulation Z, a provision of which has since 1981 excluded from the definition of ""finance charge"" any fees imposed ""for exceeding a credit limit."" 12 C.F.R. §226.4(c)(2). In Ford Motor Credit Co. v.

District courts in those Circuits may consider evidence supporting removal even if it comes later in response to a motion to remand.

The Sixth Circuit concluded below that Heck's favorable termination requirement does not cover claims challenging parole procedures because success on those claims would not necessarily guarantee speedier release, but instead would provide only a new parole hearing. This raises the following questions:
When a prisoner invokes § 1983 to challenge parole proceedings, does Heck v. Humphrey's favorable termination requirement apply where success by the prisoner on the claim would result only in a new parole hearing and not necessarily guarantee earlier release from prison?"

In a decision that focused on factual determinations, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed. The First Circuit Court of Appeals focused on statutory construction and determined that although the legislative history says that the right to convert is ""absolute"", the right can be denied in circumstances such as those presented in this case.

Phelps, Sr., Westboro Baptist Church, Incorporated, Rebekah A. Phelps-Davis and Shirley L. Phelps-Roper (collectively, ""Phelps""). Snyder's claim arose out of Phelps' intentional acts at Snyder's son's funeral. Specifically the claims were: (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (2) invasion of privacy and (3) civil conspiracy. These claims were dismissed by the Fourth Circuit notwithstanding that (a) Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell does not apply to private versus private individuals; (b) Snyder was a ""captive"" audience; (c) Phelps specifically targeted Snyder and his family; (d) Snyder proved that he was intentionally harmed by clear and convincing evidence;¹ and (e) Phelps disrupted Snyder's mourning process. The Fourth Circuit's decision gives no credence to Snyder's personal stake in honoring and mourning his son and ignores Snyder's right to bury his son with dignity and respect.

Washington, 542 U.S. at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531, and the failure to submit a sentencing factor to a jury, like the failure to submit an element on an offense to the jury, is not structural error and is therefore subject to harmless error review	holding that failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence is an error subject to harmless error analysis	"holding that trial court error is harmless (i.e. not prejudicial) when ""there is no reasonable possibility that the [error] complained of might have contributed to the conviction"""	holding that constitutionally or legally defective jury instruction becomes reversible error only if it “had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict” (quoting Brecht v.

355	"Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), has been interpreted to provide an implied private right of action for sex discrimination by federally funded educational institutions. Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code creates an express remedy for violations of the U.S. Constitution. Three courts of appeals have held that Title IX’s implied remedy does not foreclose Section 1983 claims to enforce the Constitution’s prohibition against invidious sex discrimination. In contrast, four circuits, including the First Circuit in this case, have held that Title IX’s implied right of action is the exclusive remedy for sex discrimination by federally funded educational institutions. The question presented is:
Whether Title IX’s implied right of action precludes Section 1983 constitutional claims to remedy sex discrimination by federally funded educational institutions."	holding that Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, thereby prohibits retaliation because “[r]etaliation ... is a form of ‘discrimination’ ” and is “ ‘discrimination on the basis of sex’ because it is an intentional response to ... an allegation of sex discrimination”	"holding that an implied private cause of action exists under Title IX, which states that ""[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied to the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance"""	"holding employees may bring a discrimination claim under Title IX when they ""directly participate in federal programs,"" ""directly benefit from federal grants, loans, or contracts,"" or are ""subject to discrimination under"" the funded education program"	holding that litigation under the more restrictive statute of Title IX did not preclude litigation under Section 1983	"holding that Title IX's implied private right of action will not lie in absence of school district's ""deliberate indifference"" to teacher's conduct upon actual receipt of notice thereof"	3

357	"In a civil case against police officers for excessive force, a court must grant qualified immunity unless the use of force was prohibited by clearly established law. Here, the Sixth Circuit denied qualified immunity for force used in 2004 to end a vehicular pursuit that is similar to the force ruled permissible in Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007). The Sixth Circuit denied qualified immunity by distinguishing Scott ""in the details"" from the force used three years earlier in this case. (Pet. App. at 8-9.) The Sixth Circuit applied a similar analysis in Walker v. Davis, 649 F.3d 502 (6th Cir. 2011), where it also distinguished Scott to deny qualified immunity for pre-2007 conduct. As Judge McKeague noted in his extended dissent, the Sixth Circuit stands alone in this analysis. Id. at 504- 11 (McKeague, J., dissenting). Petitioners believe this Court has an opportunity to correct the errors in the Sixth Circuit's qualified immunity analysis by agreeing to hear their case. The specific questions presented are as follows:
Whether the Sixth Circuit wrongly denied qualified immunity to Petitioners by analyzing whether the force used in 2004 was distinguishable from factually similar force ruled permissible three years later in Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007).

364	"The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's jurisdiction over the Republic of Austria, a sovereign state, and its national museum, the Austrian Gallery, for a disputed expropriation claim that arose in 1948, twenty-eight years before enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq. (""FSIA""). The claim challenges the Republic's ownership of artwork that is and always has been located in Austria. Jurisdiction and venue in the Central District of California were asserted notwithstanding that (a) the claims in this case arose before the United States adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity in 1952, at a time when Austria had an expectation of absolute immunity from private civil suit in United States courts; (b) the United States opposes a finding of jurisdiction in this case; (c) respondent did not exhaust her legal remedies in Austria; (d) no part of the alleged events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in any judicial district in the United States, or concern any commercial activity here.

375	"In December 2001, in an earlier appeal in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that an attorney's fee application under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d), is jurisdictionally barred if the fee applicant does not allege, within the statute's 30-day limitations period, that the position of the United States lacked substantial justification, even when the application itself is timely filed and the applicant promptly amends the application to supply the allegation. The Federal Circuit acknowledged that its holding directly conflicted with decisions of other circuits. On June 17, 2002, this Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the Federal Circuit's decision, and remanded in light of Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 122 S. Ct. 1145 (2002). In a nearly verbatim reprise of its earlier ruling, the Federal Circuit again held the fee application jurisdictionally barred. That court again acknowledged the circuit split and then found Edelman inapposite. The question presented is the same as that presented in the earlier petition to this Court:
Whether, or in what circumstances, an applicant for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act is barred from obtaining a fee award by the Act's 30-day statute of limitations solely because the applicant's timely-filed fee application did not initially allege that the position of the government in the underlying litigation lacked substantial justification."

Whether to establish a prima facie case under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), the objector must show that it is more likely than not the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias?"	"holding that race based peremptory strikes for jurors violate the equal protection rights of the challenged jurors and that the court, by allowing this to occur, had ""involved itself with invidious discrimination."""	"holding that in a case alleging intentional employment discrimination by means of termination of employment, a prima facie case is established ""when a member of a protected group is discharged under circumstances which, if unexplained, would support an inference that the decision to discharge was `based on the consideration of impermissible factors.'"""	holding that a federal court must assess its subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte	"holding proper standard for judging whether prima facie case had arisen was Batson ""inference of discriminatory purpose"" standard, not California's Wheeler ""strong likelihood"" test for successful prima facie showing of bias"	holding that the Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from challenging potential jurors solely on account of their race and setting the factual threshold for a defendant to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in jury selection	2

Whether the Tenth Circuit erred by affirming the entry of judgment in favor of a qui tam relator under the False Claims Act, based on a misinterpretation of the statutory definition of an “original source” set forth in 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)?"	holding that a relator may collect a portion of a settlement agreement depending upon whether the Government intervened in their suit, and if so, how much the relator contributed to the prosecution of the claim	holding that qui tam plaintiffs have Article III standing	"holding that the ""information"" to which § 3730(e)(B) speaks, refers to the information on which relator's allegations are based, not upon the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations that triggered § 3730(e)'s public disclosure jurisdictional bar are based"	holding that amendment to jurisdictional provision of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-31, permitting qui tam suits based on information in government's possession under certain circumstances did not apply retroactively to conduct occurring before its effective date	"holding that in order to relate back ""the basic claim must have arisen out of the conduct set forth in the original pleading"""	2
397	"A copyright holder possesses the exclusive right ""to perform the copyrighted work publicly."" 17 U.S.C. §106(4). In the Copyright Act of 1976, Congress defined the phrase ""[t]o perform ... 'publicly'"" to include, among other things, ""to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work ... to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times."" Id. §101. Congress enacted that provision with the express intent to bring within the scope of the public-performance right services that retransmit over-the-air television broadcasts to the public. Respondent Aereo offers just such a service. Aereo captures over-the-air television broadcasts and, without obtaining authorization from or compensating anyone, retransmits that programming to tens of thousands of members of the public over the Internet for a profit. According to the Second Circuit, because Aereo sends each of its subscribers an individualized transmission of a performance from a unique copy of each copyrighted program, it is not transmitting performances ""to the public,"" but rather is engaged in tens of thousands of ""private"" performances to paying strangers.
Whether a company ""publicly performs"" a copyrighted television program when it retransmits a broadcast of that program to thousands of paid subscribers over the Internet."	holding that the defendant has the burden of proving whether counsel’s performance was deficient by a preponderance of the evidence	"holding that, ""[b]ecause the duty is directly imposed upon the States by the Constitution itself, there can be no need to weigh the performance of the federal obligation against the powers reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment"""	holding that under the federal Copyright Act, a CATV system is not a “performer” of copyrighted broadcast programming and is also not a “broadcaster.”	"holding that, despite technological complexity concerning the ""behind-the-scenes"" delivery of images, the defendant violated the exclusive right to ""show [an audiovisual work's] images in any sequence,"" because ""whether Aereo transmits from the same or separate copies, it ... shows the same images and makes audible the same sound"""	holding that the only relevant public interest in disclosure “is the extent to which disclosure would serve 20 the ‘core purpose of the FOIA,’ which is ‘contribut[ing] significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.”	3
398	Does the United States Constitution prohibit a state from taxing all the income of its residents-wherever earned-by mandating a credit for taxes paid on income earned in other states?	"holding that ""what appellant must show, in order to establish that its dividend income is not subject to an apportioned tax in Vermont, is that the income was earned in the course of activities unrelated to the sale of petroleum products in that State."""	holding that Maryland violated the dormant aspect of the Commerce Clause by refusing to grant a tax credit for taxes that its residents paid to another state where Maryland also taxed the income that residents of other states earned from sources in Maryland	holding that a New York income tax provision that expressly provided a tax credit for shipping products from New York rather than other states violated the Commerce Clause	holding that, as a general rule, where a litigant's recovery constitutes income, the litigant's income includes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a contingency fee	"holding that since defendant's ""shocking"" abduction from Mexico to the United States did not violate the extradition treaty between the two countries, under Ker-Frisbie, ""respondent's forcible abduction does not therefore prohibit his trial in a court in the United States for violations of the criminal laws of the United States"""	1
399	Whether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce testimonial statements of a non testifying forensic analyst through the in-court testimony of a supervisor or other person who did not perform or observe the laboratory analysis described in the statements.	holding that the Confrontation Clause providing the defendant the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him applies not only to in-court testimony, but also to out-of-court statements introduced at trial, regardless of admissibility of statements under the rules of evidence	holding statements non-hearsay where “the point of the prosecutor's introducing those statements was simply to prove that the statements were made so as to establish a foundation for later showing, through other admissible evidence, that they were false” (footnotes omitted)	holding that Confrontation Clause requires analyst who conducted blood alcohol testing to testify, not surrogate analyst	"holding that ""the Confrontation Clause does not require excluding from evidence the prior statements of a witness who concedes making those statements"""	holding that state statute permitting out-of-court co- conspirator statements made during the concealment phase of a conspiracy did not violate the Confrontation Clause	2

402	"Section 8(b) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. § 2607(b), provides:
Whether Section 8(b) of RESPA prohibits a real estate settlement services provider from charging an unearned fee only if the fee is divided between two or more parties."	holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction over a motion to enforce settlement following entry of a stipulated dismissal with prejudice where there was no provision in the settlement agreement retaining jurisdiction, and the settlement agreement was not incorporated into the order dismissing with prejudice	holding that union's decision to enter into strike settlement agreement was not arbitrary since it was supported by rational reasons even though the settlement imposed terms that turned out to be worse for union members than if there was no settlement	holding that bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to issue injunction prohibiting execution of supersedeas bond that was not part of the debtor's Chapter 11 bankruptcy estate because bankruptcy court's jurisdiction extends to “more than the simpl[e] proceedings involving the property of the estate”	"holding that that ""[t]he phrase 'portion, split, or percentage'"" in § 2607(b) ""does not cover a situation in which a settlement-service provider retains the entirety of a fee received from a consumer"""	holding that a transfer of unencumbered real property, as well as encumbered real property, to a pension trust in order to satisfy an obligation is a prohibited transaction	3
403	"Arizona enacted the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (S.B. 1070) to address the illegal immigration crisis in the State. The four provisions of S.B. 1070 enjoined by the courts below authorize and direct state law-enforcement officers to cooperate and communicate with federal officials regarding the enforcement of federal immigration law and impose penalties under state law for non-compliance with federal immigration requirements.
The question presented is whether the federal immigration laws preclude Arizona's efforts at cooperative law enforcement and impliedly preempt these four provisions of S.B. 1070 on their face."	holding that it was the ―right‖ of Arizona state courts to take ―no account of federal standing rules‖ in state court, even on a matter interpreting federal law	"holding that the Eleventh Amendment prevents federal courts from providing a declaratory judgment that state officials violated federal law in the past if there is ""no claimed continuing violation of federal law"" or ""any threat of state officials violating the ... law in the future"""	"holding that a state law regulating unauthorized alien employment did not interfere with federal immigration law where the federal program ""operates unimpeded by the state law"""	holding that state procedural law applied in state-court litigation of a federal-law claim	"holding that Arizona statute that ""authoriz[ed] state officers to decide whether an alien should be detained for being removable ... violate[d] the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government"" and thus ""create[d] an obstacle to the full purposes and objectives of Congress"""	4
404	Whether a district court's denial of a criminal defendant's qualified right to be represented by counsel of choice requires automatic reversal of his conviction.	holding that the appellant had no constitutional right to represent himself on appeal and no right to a “hybrid” form of representation in which he would be represented by counsel while also acting simultaneously as his own counsel	holding that the denial of the right to counsel of one’s choice is structural error not subject to harmlessness review because “[h]armless-error analysis in such a context would be a speculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe”	holding that the acts of a defendant's criminal trial standby counsel did not deprive the defendant of his right of self-representation	holding that a defendant charged with contempt has a right to an opportunity to be heard, to be represented by counsel, and to file motions and pleadings essential to his claims	"holding that because ""a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to counsel to pursue discretionary state appeals,"" ""he could not be deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his retained counsel's failure to file [a timely] application"" for discretionary review by the Florida Supreme Court"	1

Eight courts of appeals have held that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated where retroactive application of the Sentencing Guidelines creates a significant risk of a higher sentence. In the decision below, however, the Seventh Circuit has held that the Ex Post Facto Clause is never violated by retroactive application of the Sentencing Guidelines because the Guidelines are advisory, not mandatory.
Does a sentencing court violate the Ex Post Facto Clause by using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing rather than the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense, if the newer Guidelines create a significant risk that the defendant will receive a longer sentence?"	holding that a change in the law, if merely procedural, does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, even if detrimental to the defendant	holding that application of a revision of Florida's sentencing guidelines applied to a defendant convicted before the legislature passed the guidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because the new guidelines increased the length of the defendant's punishment	"holding that sentencing a defendant ""under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts"" violates the Ex Post Facto clause of the United States Constitution if ""the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense"""	holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution precluded application of a statute to offenses committed before its effective date	"holding that while ""limitations on ex post facto judicial decisionmaking are inherent in the notion of due process,"" the Due Process Clause does not incorporate the specific prohibitions of the Ex Post Facto Clause"	2
406	Whether the private right of action for violations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq., encompasses redress for retaliation for complaints about unlawful sex discrimination.	holding that the FDA's decision not to take enforcement actions to prevent violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 301 et seq., is not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 500 et seq.

407	"In determining whether the Due Process Clause requires a State or local government to provide a post-seizure probable cause hearing prior to a statutory judicial forfeiture proceeding and, if so, when such a hearing must take place, should district courts apply the ""speedy trial"" test employed in United States v. $8,850, 461 U.S. 555 (1983) and Barker v.

Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, which was developed to determine when governmental delay has abridged the right to a speedy trial, provided the appropriate framework for determining whether an 18-month delay in filing a forfeiture action was reasonable	holding that due process requires a determination at a pre-revocation hearing, i.e., a Gagnon I hearing, that probable cause exists to believe a violation has been committed	1
408	Whether, for purposes of determining principal place of business for diversity jurisdiction citizenship under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, a court can disregard the location of a nationwide corporation's headquarters - i.e., its nerve center.	holding that a limited partnership is not itself a citizen and that courts must instead look to the citizenship of its members to determine if diversity jurisdiction exists	holding that “[a] case falls within the federal district court’s original diversity jurisdiction only if diversity of citizenship among the parties is complete, i.e. , only if there is no plaintiff and no defendant who are citizens of the same State”	holding that a corporation's place of incorporation and principal place of business are bases for general jurisdiction	"holding that ""[w]hen challenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allegations by competent proof and noting, for example, that the Court would reject the ""mere filing"" of a form, such as an SEC 10-K that listed a company's ""principal executive offices"", as insufficient to establish a corporation's nerve center"	"holding that ""a corporation's citizenship derives, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, from its State of incorporation and principal place of business,"" and ""[i]t is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it conducts business or is otherwise amenable to personal jurisdiction"""	3

414	"The primary purpose of The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the ""Hague Convention"" or the ""Convention"") is to protect children from international abduction by returning an abducted child to the nation of habitual residence for adjudication of custody rights under that nation's laws. To further that purpose, Article 12 of the Convention mandates that an abducted child must be returned if the left-behind parent's petition for the child's return is filed within one year of the abduction. In doing so, the Convention deters international child abductions by removing the benefit an abducting parent would otherwise obtain or perceive under the laws of the nation to which he or she has abducted the child. If the left-behind parent is unable, or otherwise fails, to determine the situs of the child and meet this one-year filing deadline, the court must still order the return of the child unless the abducting parent demonstrates one of four affirmative defenses, including that the child is ""settled"" in her new environment. The circuit courts of appeal are split over whether equitable tolling may apply to the one-year period. While the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits all hold the one-year period may be equitably tolled, the Second Circuit held in this case that the one-year period is not subject to equitable tolling and the settled defense is still available even where, as here, the abducting parent conceals the location of the child.
Whether a district court considering a petition under the Hague Convention for the return of an abducted child may equitably toll the running of the one-year filing period when the abducting parent has concealed the whereabouts of the child from the left-behind parent."	holding that a noncustodial parent did not have standing to assert the constitutional claims of his daughter when the parent with exclusive legal custody objected on the grounds that litigation was not in the child’s best interest	holding that ICWA's requirement that qualified expert testimony be provided that continued custody by the parent will be damaging to the child does not apply to a parent who has never had custody	holding unconstitutional a provision of the Social Security Act which allowed an illegitimate child to obtain benefits if a disabled parent either contributed to the child's support or lived with the child prior to the disability	holding that the Hague Convention requires the return of the child to the parent who possess a single right of custody—even a joint right—that is violated by the child's removal	holding that “a parent has a ‘righ[t] of custody’ by reason of that parent’s ne exeat right: the authority to consent before the other parent may take the child to another country”	3
415	"In Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974), and Menna v. New York, 423 U.S. 61 (1975), this Court held that a defendant who pleads guilty can still raise on appeal any constitutional claim that does not depend on challenging his ""factual guilt."" In Blackledge and Menna, the Court held that double jeopardy and vindictive prosecution are two such claims that are not inherently resolved by pleading guilty, because those claims do not challenge whether the government could properly meet its burden of proving each element of the crime.

In the years since this Court decided Blackledge and Menna, the circuit courts have deeply divided on whether a defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of his statute of conviction survives a plea, or instead is inherently waived as part of the concession of factual guilt.

The question presented is:
Whether a guilty plea inherently waives a defendant's right to challenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction?"	"holding that a guilty plea accompanied by protestations of innocence is valid when the ""defendant intelligently concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt"""	"holding that defendants' ""guilty plea served as a relinquishment of their opportunity to receive a factual hearing on a double jeopardy claim. Relinquishment derives not from any inquiry into a defendant's subjective understanding of the range of potential defenses, but from the admissions necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of guilty."""	"holding a defendant who pleaded guilty did not waive Second Amendment and due process challenges to statute of conviction because claims did not ""contradict the terms of the indictment or the written plea agreement"""	"holding that attorney does not have the power to enter a plea of guilty or to admit guilt ""in effect"" where the defendant has not consented to such a strategy"	"holding that defendant, by pleading guilty, did 4 not waive a double jeopardy claim because, were the claim well founded, the government could ""not convict petitioner no matter how validly his factual guilt [might be] established"""	2
416	"The courts of appeals are divided about the jurisdiction of district courts to entertain Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motions in habeas corpus cases. Seven circuits address the continuing viability of Rule 60(b) on a flexible case-by-case basis, while three circuits, including the Eleventh Circuit below, hold that AEDP A erects a bright line jurisdictional bar to Rule 60(b) motions in habeas corpus proceedings. The conflict among the circuits has exacerbated since the Court dismissed as improvidently granted Abdur'Rahman v. Bell, 537 U.S. 88 (2002). The instant petition replicates for the Court's consideration the questions left unanswered in Abdur'Rahman, without the procedural and jurisdictional difficulties that caused it to be dismissed:

Most state and federal appellate courts have read this decision more broadly than its precise holding and have concluded that a capital defendant has no constitutional right to offer evidence and argue in a penalty- phase proceeding that he should receive a sentence less than death because he continues to assert his innocence of the underlying crime. The Oregon Supreme Court, however, held in this case that a capital defendant has a federal constitutional right to present in a penalty-phase proceeding alibi evidence that casts doubt on his guilt. The question presented is:
Does a capital defendant have a right under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to offer evidence and argument in support of a residual-doubt claim - that is, that the jury in a penalty-phase proceeding should consider doubt about the defendant's guilt in deciding whether to impose the death penalty?"	"holding that defendant did not have an Eighth Amendment right to an instruction that the jury could consider ""residual doubts"" about guilt as mitigating circumstances during sentencing"	holding that a jury instruction that stated that the jury could consider all the mitigating evidence presented during both the guilt and penalty stage was sufficient to inform the jury that it could consider evidence of defendant’s youth	"holding that state re-sentencing procedure that allowed for introduction of transcripts of guilt phase evidence adequately protected any right capital defendant might have to argue ""residual doubt"" as a mitigating factor"	"holding that once defendant has been convicted fairly in guilt phase of capital trial, presumption of innocence disappears; ""presumption [of innocence] operates at the guilt phase of a trial to remind the jury that the State has the burden of establishing every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt"""	holding that counsel's strategic decision, made without the defendant's express consent, to concede, in his opening statement at guilt phase of capital murder trial, the defendant's commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing defendant's life, is not per se prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel	2

420	"This Court held in C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 386 (1994), that “a so-called flow control ordinance, which require[d] all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality,’ discriminated against interstate commerce and was invalid under the Commerce Clause because it “depriv[ed] competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market.” This case presents two questions, the first of which is the subject of an acknowledged circuit conflict:
Whether the virtually per se prohibition against “hoard[ing] solid waste” (Id. at 392) recognized in Carbone is inapplicable when the “preferred processing facility” (ibid.) is owned by a public entity."	holding that Alabama statute imposing additional fees on hazardous waste generated outside Alabama and disposed of at Alabama facilities violated the Commerce Clause because it discriminated against interstate commerce on its face	holding that two New York counties' ordinances governing the flow of solid waste does not violate the Commerce Clause, in part because “[w]aste disposal is both typically and traditionally a local government function” (alteration in original)	"holding that a state may not insulate part of its market from out-of-state competition while leaving other parts open, because this ""measures only the extent of the discrimination; it is of no relevance to the determination whether a State has discriminated against interstate commerce"""	"holding that ""flow control ordinance discriminates"" since its ""avowed purpose"" was to ""retain the processing fees"" over local wastewater, and since the ordinance's effect was to ""allow only the favored operator to process waste that is within the limits of the town"""	holding that a $2.25 per ton surcharge on out-of-state waste disposed of in Oregon was discriminatory on its face because it subjected out-of-state waste to a fee almost three times greater than the $0.85 per ton charge imposed on in-state waste	1

Dist. Att’y's Office v. Osborne, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 2320 (2009) (citation omitted). The district court dismissed Mr. Skinner's § 1983 suit solely on the ground that his claim sounded only in habeas corpus, and the Fifth Circuit summarily affirmed. The question presented is the same one the Court granted certiorari in Osborne to decide, but left unresolved:
May a convicted prisoner seeking access to biological evidence for DNA testing assert that claim in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or is such a claim cognizable only in a petition for writ of habeas corpus?"

Petitioner asks the Court to resolve a deepening split in the lower courts over whether the good-faith exception applies to changing interpretations of law. The question presented is this:

That ruling conflicts with decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals and with the interpretation of the Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA "" or ""Board""). The question presented is as follows:
Whether, in the absence of a mens rea of at least recklessness with respect to the active application of force against another, DUI with serious bodily injury is a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16 that constitutes an ""aggravated felony"" under § 101 of the INA ?"	holding that only a controlled substance violation that is punishable as a felony under the federal Controlled Substances Act can constitute an aggravated felony and finding that it is not enough that the crime is punishable as a felony under state law	holding that a violation of § 7206 can be serious enough to be an aggravated felony and deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act	holding that 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2), which authorizes increased sentence for a deported alien's illegal return if the deportation was subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction, is a penalty provision and that the aggravated felony need not be charged in the indictment	holding that a DUI offense did not have “as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another” under the “crime of violence” definition of 18 U.S.C. § 16 because it could be committed negligently or accidentally	holding that courts must not “substitute [their] judgment for those of the Board with respect to the issues that Congress intended the Board should resolve”	3

They then heard noises which indicated that physical evidence was being destroyed. The officers entered the apartment and found large quantities of drugs. The Kentucky Supreme Court held that this evidence should have been suppressed, ruling that (1) the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because the officers created the exigency by knocking on the door, and (2) the hot pursuit exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because the suspect was not aware he was being pursued.

Whether the government can violate an innocent individual's fundamental right to bodily integrity by injecting him with permanently mind-altering psychotropic drugs against his will solely because it believes there is a chance to medicate the individual into drug-induced ""competence"" for trial? 
2. Whether the government's effort to forcibly medicate an innocent person, solely for the purpose of attempting to make him ""competent"" to stand trial, is reviewed under a strict scrutiny standard or under one of the lower standards, which standards are both recited in the conflicting lower court and appellate court decisions on this issue?
3. Whether the government should at least be required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, each element of the strict scrutiny test before it violates an individual's right to be free from the forced injection of mind-altering medication? 
4. Whether the district court must consider the effects of forcible medication on a defendant's Sixth Amendment trial rights before the government is allowed to permanently alter an individual's psychological chemistry?
Whether the Court of Appeals error in rejecting petitioner's argument that allowing the government to administer antipsychotic medication against his will solely to render him competent to stand trial for non-violent offenses would violate his rights under the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments."

462	"In Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444 (2003), this Court granted certiorari to decide a question that had divided the lower courts: whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits the imposition of class arbitration when the parties' agreement is silent regarding class arbitration. The Court was unable to reach that question, however, because a plurality concluded that the arbitrator first needed to address whether the agreement there was in fact ""silent."" That threshold obstacle is not present in this case, and the question presented here - which continues to divide the lower courts - is the same one presented in Bazzle:
Whether imposing class arbitration on parties whose arbitration clauses are silent on that issue is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq."	"holding that class arbitration ""changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator"""	holding that under the Federal Arbitration Act, a challenge to an arbitration provision is for the courts to decide, while a challenge to an entire contract which includes an arbitration provision is an issue for the arbitrator	"holding that questions over whether class claims could be litigated in the arbitration did not turn on whether the parties ""agreed"" to arbitrate, but ""what kind of arbitration proceeding [they] agreed to,"" and that ""[a]rbitrators are well situated to answer that question"""	holding that when the parties in court proceedings include claims that are subject to an arbitration agreement, the FAA requires that agreement to be enforced even if a state statute or common-law rule would otherwise exclude that claim from arbitration	"holding that the Arbitration Act ""leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed"""	0
463	In the absence of a contractual relationship with the defendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone sufficient to confer standing on a plaintiff pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1981?	"holding that plaintiff employee's initial filing under Title VII did not toll the statute of limitations as to his related private discrimination action, sought under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, because ""the two remedies are truly independent"""	holding that a court is not required to accept without question the truth of the plaintiff's factual allegations if those allegations are fanciful, but can instead determine those allegations to be frivolous for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d)	holding that plaintiffs, who residedin Maryland and Virginia, lacked standing to challenge a property transfer in Pennsylvania, and rejecting the argument that “any person asserting an Establishment Clause violation possesses a ‘spiritual stake’ sufficient to confer standing”	"holding that the sole shareholder of a corporation lacked standing to state a personal § 1981 claim where the defendant allegedly breached its contract with the corporation, because ""the shareholder and contracting officer of a corporation has no rights and is exposed to no liability under the corporation's contracts"""	"holding that it was sufficient to confer standing under Article III where it was clear that at least one plaintiff had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the law in question, and that there was no need to ""consider the standing issue as to the [other plaintiffs]"""	3
464	"When a federal court bases an enhanced sentence on a vacated state conviction, is the vacatur of the state conviction a ""fact"" supporting a prisoner's 28 U.S.C. § 2255 claim requiring reduction of the prisoner's sentence?"

465	Do the Social Security Act and the Debt Collection Improvement Act bar the United States from withholding social security benefits to collect student loan debt that has been outstanding for more than ten years, as the Eighth Circuit has held, or does the Higher Education Act eliminate any such bar, as the Ninth Circuit held below?	holding that a Social Security manual did not bind the Social Security Administration because it is not a regulation and has “no legal force”	"holding that section 1343 jurisdiction does not ""encompass a claim that a state welfare regulation is invalid because it conflicts with the Social Security Act"" because the Social Security Act is not one meant to secure equal or civil rights"	holding that the previous 10-year limit in the Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3716(e), did not bar offsetting Social Security benefits to repay federally-reinsured student loans	"holding that lawyers who regularly collect consumer debt through litigation may be considered ""debt collectors"" under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692- 1692o, and are therefore subject to liability for litigation activities"	"holding that amendment to Social Security Act that prevented States from terminating participation in Social Security System was not an unconstitutional taking because there existed no contractual rights rising to level of ""property"""	2

467	Whether, in order to show that a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 constitutes reversible plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that he would not have pleaded guilty if the violation had not occurred.	"holding that Rule 11(c) error is not a form of ""structural"" error and, therefore, that ""Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule)"""	holding that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, must show “a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea”	holding that a defendant who does not object to a Rule 11 error in the district court is subject to the Rule 52(b) plain-error standard on appeal, even though Rule 11 does not have a provision stating that plain error review applies to claims not brought to the district court's attention	holding that petitioner may satisfy prejudice prong of two- part Strickland standard following guilty plea if petitioner shows “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial”	"holding that, in order to prove a violation of § 1512(C), the government must show a ""reasonable likelihood"" that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer but for the victim's death"	1
468	"May a criminal defendant who, despite being legally competent, is schizophrenic, delusional, and mentally decompensatory in the course of a simple conversation, be denied the right to represent himself at trial when the trial court reasonably concludes that permitting self-representation would deny the defendant a fair trial? The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted limited to the following question:
May states adopt a higher standard for measuring competency to represent oneself at trial than for measuring competency to stand trial?"	holding that a trial court must conduct, sua sponte, a competency hearing when the information known to the trial court at the time of the trial or plea is sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendant’s competence	holding that the acts of a defendant's criminal trial standby counsel did not deprive the defendant of his right of self-representation	holding that the defendant -- who suffered from severe schizophrenia, was found incompetent to stand trial multiple times, and was committed to the state hospital while awaiting trial -- was competent to stand trial but not competent to represent himself due to his severe mental illness	holding that trial court's failure to give requested instruction on presumption of innocence resulted in violation of defendant's right to a fair trial	"holding that trial court should have ordered competency evaluation where, inter alia, defendant shot himself during trial; Court noted that mid-trial suicide attempt ""suggests a rather substantial degree of mental instability contemporaneous with the trial"""	2
469	Does the Eighth Amendment permit the execution of a death row inmate who has a factual awareness of the reason for his execution but who, because of severe mental illness, has a delusional belief as to why the state is executing him, and thus does not appreciate that his execution is intended to seek retribution for his capital crime?	holding that the Due Process Clause permits the government “to treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will, if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate’s medical interest”	holding that the Eighth Amendment does not bar the execution of prisoners who were under 18 years of age at the time they committed their offenses	holding that AEDPA does not require habeas courts to await “some nearly identical factual pattern” before applying a clearly established rule, nor does it prohibit “finding an application of a principle unreasonable when it involves a set of facts different from those of the case in which the principle was announced”	holding that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit the execution of a person who was under sixteen years of age at the time of his or her offense	holding that detentions incident to the execution of a search warrant are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment	2

Whether Congress's decision to impose a different physical-presence requirement on unwed citizen mothers of foreign-born children than on other citizen parents of foreign-born children through 8 U.S.C. 1401 and 1409 (1958) violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection."	holding that statute that provided different rights to the children of unwed U.S. citizen mothers than the children of unwed U.S. citizen fathers violated the equal protection clause	holding that a citizen has “a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship”	holding unconstitutional intestacy statute that permitted child born out of wedlock to inherit only from his or her mother	holding that the Indian Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings, even though the children were born off the reservation, because the children were “domiciled” on the reservation for purposes of the ICWA	"holding that the Fourth Amendment protects only ""the people"" of the United States and has no application to search-and-seizure challenges where the challenger is a non-citizen/non-resident alien with no voluntary attachment to the United States and the area searched is located outside of the United States"	0

474	"QUESTION PRESENTED
When  a  district  court,  upon  the  plaintiffs  written  consent,  refers  a  case  to  a magistrate  judge  for  trial,  see  28  U.S.C.  §636(c),  and  all  parties,  the  magistrate judge, and the jury proceed in a manner consistent with that referral, must a court of  appeals sua sponte vacate the judgment for lack of jurisdiction because defendants did not expressly consent, or can defendants cure that alleged defect by confirming,  in  a  post-judgment  filing  with  the  district  court,  their  consent  to  trial before the magistrate judge?"	"holding that § 636(b)(B) allows magistrate judges to enter reports and recommendations on all ""actions for monetary or injunctive relief"" which are ""brought by prisoners . . . under 42 U.S.C. § 1983"" without the parties' consent"	holding that a magistrate, rather than an Article III judge, can conduct voir dire in a felony case under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(3), so long as the defendant consents	holding that a district court may adopt as the credibility findings contained in a magistrate judge's report and recommendation regarding the voluntariness of a confession without rehearing the testimony of the witnesses who testified at a suppression hearing before the magistrate judge	holding that, under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), a consensual referral gives a magistrate judge full authority over dispositive motions, conduct of trial, and entry of final judgment, all without district court review, and that consent to proceedings before a magistrate judge can be inferred from a party's conduct during litigation	holding that defense counsel may decide whether to consent to voir dire proceedings before a federal magistrate judge	3
475	Can a reasonable attorney's fee award under a federal fee-shifting statute ever be enhanced based solely on quality of performance and results obtained when these factors already are included in the lodestar calculation?	holding that the court was “unable to affirm the [fee award] ... because the District Court's opinion did not properly consider the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the fee award” or “answer the question of what is ‘reasonable’ in light of that level of success”	"holding that plaintiff's counsel should recover the percentage of the recovery specified in the contingent-fee agreement because the fee-shifting provision of 42 U.S.C. § 1988 does not ""limit civil rights plaintiffs' freedom to contract with their attorneys"""	"holding that in determining the reasonableness of attorney's fees under federal fee shifting statutes, courts may not enhance the fee award above the ""lodestar"" amount to compensate attorneys for assuming the risk of receiving no payment for their services if the lawsuit failed"	holding that the government did not perpetrate a taking when it deducted a statutory fee from the plaintiff's award by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal instead of requiring the plaintiff to pay the fee separately	holding that compensation for a delay in payment “is generally made either by basing the award on current rates or by adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its present value” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)	4
476	"In Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370 (1990), this Court upheld the constitutionality of California's ""catch-all"" mitigation instruction in capital cases, which directs a jury to consider ""any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."" The mitigating evidence at issue in Boyde was pre-crime evidence in mitigation. Relying on Boyde, the California Supreme Court held that California's ""catch-all"" mitigation instruction in this capital case is constitutional as applied to post-crime evidence in mitigation. In a 6-5 decision, the en banc Ninth Circuit held that the California Supreme Court decision was objectively unreasonable ""because Boyde does not control this case."" The question presented is:
Did the Ninth Circuit violate 28 U .S.C. § 2254 (d) when it found the California Supreme Court objectively unreasonable in holding that California's ""catch-all"" mitigation instruction in capital cases is constitutional as applied to post-crime evidence in mitigation?"	holding that the failure to present cumulative mitigation evidence at sentencing did not prejudice the defendant	"holding that the defendant's contacts with California were sufficient to establish minimum contacts because the allegedly libelous publication reported activities in California, most of the harm or ""effects"" to the plaintiffs reputation and career occurred in California, and the defendant's intentional tortious actions were ""aimed at California"""	holding that a proper prejudice analysis under Strickland must take into account the newly uncovered mitigation evidence, along with the mitigation evidence introduced during the penalty phase of the trial, to assess whether a reasonable probability arises that the petitioner would have received a different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient mitigation investigation.	"holding that the California Supreme Court's decision that a jury was not reasonably likely to think it could not consider post-conviction mitigation evidence when given a general jury instruction to consider all mitigation evidence, although perhaps ""erroneous,"" was not unreasonable under AEDPA"	holding that the sentencing court properly considered all information, including nonstatutory mitigation, where the court stated that it considered all the evidence and found no mitigating circumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances	3
477	"Under 28 U.S.C. 2680(c), the Federal Tort Claims Act’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to “[a]ny claim arising in respect of * * * the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.” The question presented, over which ten circuits are divided six—to—four is:
Whether the term “other law enforcement officer” is limited to officers acting in a tax, excise, or customs capacity."	"holding that phrase ""any claim arising in respect of the detention of goods means any claim ""arising out of the detention of goods, and includes a claim resulting from negligent handling or storage of detained property."	holding that sovereign immunity is not implicated since “action of an officer of the sovereign ... beyond the officer's statutory authority is not action of the sovereign”	holding that FTCA’s exclusion of suits arising from customs detention does not extend to Tucker Act	"holding that BOP officers are ""law enforcement officers"" as that term is used in § 2680(c) and, therefore, § 2680(c) ""forecloses lawsuits against the United States for the unlawful detention of property"" by BOP officials"	holding that the United States is liable for the intentional torts committed by an investigative or law enforcement officer even when the officer is not carrying out the law enforcement proviso's statutorily prescribed duties	3
478	Whether and under what circumstances a plaintiff may bring an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 alleging illegal pay discrimination when the disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period, but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period.

479	"Whether a competitor is ""injured in his business or property by reason of a violation"" of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO"") where the alleged predicate acts of racketeering activity were mail fraud but the competitor was not the party defrauded and did not rely on the alleged fraudulent behavior."	holding that where plaintiff alleged that he was injured by the termination of his employment, which was an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy, but not an act that was independently wrongful under RICO, he did not have a RICO cause of action.	holding that the unambiguous language of the RICO statute does not require a racketeering enterprise or racketeering predicate acts to be accompanied by an economic motive	holding that anti-abortion protestors could be liable for violations under federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)	"holding that under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the term ""participate"" as used in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) entails that a person have "" some part in directing the enterprise's affairs"""	holding that a business could not recover against its competitor for a scheme to defraud the New York State tax authority that allowed the defendant to undercut the plaintiff's prices	4

LaHue, 460 U.S. 325 (1983), this Court held that law enforcement officials enjoy absolute immunity from civil liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for perjured testimony that they provide at trial. But in Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986), this Court held that law enforcement officials are not entitled to absolute immunity when they act as ""complaining witnesses"" to initiate a criminal prosecution by submitting a legally invalid arrest warrant. The federal courts of appeals have since divided about how Briscoe and Malley apply when government officials act as ""complaining witnesses"" by testifying before a grand jury or at another judicial proceeding. The question presented in this case is:
Whether a government official who acts as a ""complaining witness"" by presenting perjured testimony against an innocent citizen is entitled to absolute immunity from a Section 1983 claim for civil damages."	holding that witnesses in a grand jury proceeding, including complaining witnesses, are entitled to absolute immunity from liability under § 1983 for their grand jury testimony	holding that absolute judicial immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief under Sec. 1983 against a state-court judge acting in a judicial capacity	holding that prison guards employed by a private prison are not entitled to qualified immunity from suits under § 1983, but that whether the private defendants acted under color of state law in violation of § 1983 was a matter to be determined by the district court	"holding that ""state and regional legislators are entitled to absolute immunity from liability under § 1983 for their legislative activities."""	"holding that ""42 U.S.C. § 1983 [did not] authorize[] a convicted person to assert a claim against a police officer for giving perjured testimony at his criminal trial"" and also ""that witnesses are absolutely immune from damages liability based on their testimony"""	0

Arizona's Citizens Clean Elections Act achieves a similar result by providing extra subsidies in the form of ""matching funds"" to publicly financed candidates who are outspent by independent expenditure groups and privately financed candidates.

Moreover, the calculation of disability retirement benefits is based upon actual years of service plus the number of years remaining before the member reaches retirement age or eligibility based on years of service alone; age may thereby be an indirect factor in determining the amount of disability retirement benefits.

Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 300 U.S. 185, 191 (1937) (citation omitted). In light of this principle, numerous courts have held that a court of appeals may not order an increase in a criminal defendant’s sentence in the absence of an appeal or cross-appeal by the Government. The Eighth and Tenth Circuits, however, have held that courts of appeals may sua sponte order increases in a defendant’s sentence when the district court has failed to impose a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, even if the Government has not appealed or cross-appealed the sentence. The question presented is:
Whether a federal court of appeals may increase a criminal defendant’s sentence sua sponte and in the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government."	holding that, in determining a sentence, the district court may consider a defendant’s failure to cooperate with an ongoing investigation of the criminal scheme of which the defendant was a part	"holding that in ""sentencing package cases,"" an appellate court ""may vacate the entire sentence on all counts so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to ensure that it remains adequate to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553"""	holding that the government could appeal a criminal sentence without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause when Congress expressly authorized such an appeal	holding that the district court has discretion to order a consecutive sentence to an anticipated state sentence	"holding that while a nonappealing party may raise any argument in support of a judgment, without a cross-appeal, a nonappealing party may not argue "" 'with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary' """	1

The questions presented are as follows:
Whether the Eleventh Circuit properly held - in conflict with the decisions of this Court and other courts - that there was no ""cause"" to excuse any procedural default where petitioner was blameless for the default, the State's own conduct contributed to the default, and petitioner's attorneys of record were no longer functioning as his agents at the time of any default."	holding that on collateral review, a court examines the time the error occurred in determining how “novel” a rule is for purposes of providing cause for a procedural default	"holding that ""a federal court will not entertain a procedurally defaulted constitutional claim in a petition for habeas corpus absent a showing of cause and prejudice to excuse the default,"" or a showing that the petitioner ""is actually innocent of the underlying offense"""	holding that state procedural rules were inadequate to support a default in a challenge to a violation of a federal right that the state affirmatively caused and that required quick action to correct	holding that the fact the state court does not explicitly rule on the merits of petitioner's claims is irrelevant, where the the state court be given the opportunity to consider the claims that have been presented	holding that attorney abandonment constitutes an extraordinary circumstance that allows a federal court to disregard the state procedural bar to hearing a habeas petition	4

557	"The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") expressly grants sole shareholder corporations, partners and sole proprietors the right to be ""participants"" in an ""employee benefit plan"", as those terms are defined in ERISA, if other non-spouse employees participate in the employee benefit plan. Nine circuit courts of appeals and the Department of Labor (""DOL"") have reviewed ERISA, and its regulations, and reached the same conclusion. This Court's holding in Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 112 S.Ct. 1344, 117 L.Ed.2d 581 (1992), provides that the common-law definition of employee should be used to determine who may be a ""participant"" in an employee benefit plan. Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit held in Hendon v. Yates (In re Yates), 287 F.3d 521 (6th Cir. 2002), reh'g denied, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 12550 (6th Cir. June 20, 2002) (Appendix, pp. 1a- 8a, 51a-52a), that a different definition of ""employee"" should be used to determine whether such persons can participate in an employee benefit plan.
The question presented is whether a one hundred percent (100%) shareholder of a corporate employer, partner or a sole proprietor can qualify as a participant in an employee benefit plan sponsored by the employer in which other non-spouse employees, as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-3(c), participate, and thus, be entitled to enforce the restrictions against alienation contained in § 206(d) of ERISA and §401(a)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code (""Code"")."	holding that a plan administrator's denial of ERISA benefits is reviewed under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard only if the benefit plan gives the plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan	"holding that when a federal statute does not provide a definition for ""employee,"" does not give specific guidance on the meaning of the term ""employee,"" and does not otherwise suggest the common-law definition is inappropriate, then the court will presume Congress intended to incorporate the common-law agency definition of ""employee"" into the statute"	"holding that a working shareholder and president of a professional corporation can qualify as a ""participant"" in an ERISA employee benefits plan as long as the plan covers employees other than the shareholder"	"holding that an action for reimbursement under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") plan involved a legal determination, and therefore was not authorized as an equitable remedy under § 502 of ERISA, because the petitioners were seeking to impose personal liability on the respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money damages"	holding that ERISA preempted a state anti-subrogation law, the latter of which prohibited an employee welfare benefit plan from requiring reimbursement from a participant that already had recovered from a third party, and noting that preemption served “to ensure that benefit plans will be governed by only a single set of regulations”	2
558	Whether a state’s withdrawal of jurisdiction over certain damages claims against state corrections employees — from state courts of general jurisdiction — may be constitutionally applied to exclude federal claims under Section 1983, especially when, as here, the state legislature withdrew jurisdiction because it concluded that permitting such lawsuits is bad policy?

Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979).	"holding that the ""seizure"" of motorists who were stopped at a sobriety checkpoint at which all vehicles were stopped, was reasonable without individualized suspicion in light of the magnitude of the drunk-driving problem and the determination of law enforcement officials that such checkpoints were necessary to apprehend such individuals before tragedy strikes"	holding that officer's stop was reasonable where vehicle turned off of a highway near the Mexican border just before the last checkpoint and the officer learned that the vehicle was registered to a town near the border that was notorious for alien and narcotic smuggling	"holding that § 924(c) constitutes a continuing offense for purposes of venue where the predicate offense is a continuing offense: ""In our view, § 924(c) does not define a `point-in-time' offense when a firearm is used during and in relation to a continuing crime of violence."""	holding that where jury was -19- instructed on both a greater offense and lesser-included offense and the jury convicted on the lesser-included offense, the double jeopardy provision prohibited retrial on the greater offense	"holding that searches or seizures designed to elicit information about a particular crime ""in all likelihood committed by others"" are constitutional, unlike those designed to determine whether the particular individuals stopped are ""committing a crime"""	4

In direct conflict with the decisions of four other circuits, the Sixth Circuit held that Sections 3729(a)(2) and 3729(a)(3) “cover[] false claims made to parties other than the government so long as the claim will be paid with government funds.”
The question presented is whether a plaintiff asserting a cause of action under Section 3729(a)(2) or Section 3729(a)(3) of the False Claims Act is required to prove that a false claim was submitted to the federal government, or whether it is sufficient to establish that the claim was paid using federal funds."	holding that an assertion that government funds were used to pay a false or fraudulent claim, without assertions that the defendant intended that the government itself pay the claim, is insufficient under § 3729(a)(2) of the FCA	"holding that the term ""claim"" was not limited to claims submitted for payments due and owing from the government, but included claims for favorable action by the government upon applications for loans"	"holding that the imposition of a civil penalty of $2,000 per claim plus twice the government's actual damages and costs against an individual who was previously convicted of submitting 65 false claims to the government constitutes ""punishment"" for purposes of double jeopardy"	holding that the debtor's statements and conduct, which “created a false impression regarding his qualifications and abilities as a general contractor and regarding the quality of the house,” constituted false representations and false pretenses	holding that amendment to jurisdictional provision of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-31, permitting qui tam suits based on information in government's possession under certain circumstances did not apply retroactively to conduct occurring before its effective date	0

The Ninth Circuit rejected an interpretation of the PMPA that would require the franchisee to discontinue its business in order to preserve its rights under the Act. A single question is thus presented:
Whether the PMPA encompasses a claim for ""constructive"" nonrenewal of the franchise relationship where: (i) the petitioner-franchisees filed suit prior to receiving new lease agreements that violated the Act; (ii) the lease agreements were presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis; (iii) respondent-franchisor stated it would terminate the franchises unless petitioners signed the lease agreements; and (iv) the franchisees signed the lease agreements, under protest, and pursued their legal claims against the franchisor."	holding that rules requiring local fleet operators to purchase or lease only vehicles that met state motor vehicle pollution standards were related to controlling emissions and were preempted by the CAA	holding that the inclusion of successorship clauses in bargaining agreements cannot bind a subsequent buyer to the substantive terms of the agreements where it was clear that the new employer refused to assume any obligations under the agreements	"holding that 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(l ) ""unambiguously requires lease terms that vest local public housing authorities with the discretion to evict tenants for the drug-related activity of ... guests"""	"holding that where municipality had refused to lease utility pole space to respondent cable company, ""the activities in which respondent allegedly seeks to engage plainly implicate First Amendment interests"""	holding that abandonment of any of the three statutory elements of the franchise operation—1	4

Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate the extraordinary mitigating evidence in Mr. Trevino's life. The federal proceeding was stayed to allow exhaustion, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Mr. Trevino's Wiggins claim under state abuse of the writ rules. Thereafter, the federal district court dismissed the claim as procedurally barred, finding no cause for the default. On appeal, Mr. Trevino argued that the Court of Appeals should stay further proceedings until this Court resolved the question then-pending in several cases whether ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel in failing to raise a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel established cause for the default in state habeas proceedings. The Court of Appeals refused to stay Mr. Trevino's appeal for this purpose. Four months later, this Court decided in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S.Ct. 1309 (March 20, 2012), that ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel in the very circumstance presented by Mr. Trevino's case could establish cause for the default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.
