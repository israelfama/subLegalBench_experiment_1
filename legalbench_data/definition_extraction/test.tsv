0	Relief	The ordinary meaning of “relief” in the context of a lawsuit is the “redress[ ] or benefit” that attends a favorable judgment. Black's Law Dictionary 1161 (5th ed. 1979). 
1	efficient	efficient means “characterized by effective activity,” 
2	Deemed	The key word here is “deemed.” That term is used in legal materials “[t]o treat (something) as if ... it were really something else.” Black's Law Dictionary 504 (10th ed. 2014).
3	relate to	To “relate to” means “ ‘to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with.’ ” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)). In ordinary parlance, one thing can “relate to” another even if it also relates to other things. 
4	Appeal 	It then refers to the definition of “appeal” found in Black's Law Dictionary 96 (6th ed. 1990), which includes, inter alia, the following: “There are two stages of appeal in the federal and many state court systems; to wit, appeal from trial court to intermediate appellate court and then to Supreme Court.” 
5	quorum	"""In sum, a straightforward understanding of the text... points us toward an interpretation of the delegation clause that requires a delegee group to maintain a membership of three."" "
6	Treaty	A treaty in its legal sense is defined by Bouvier as ‘a compact made between two or more independent nations with a view to the public welfare’ (2 Law Dict. 1136), and by Webster as ‘an argeement, league, or contract between two or more nations or sovereigns, formally signed by commissioners properly authorized, and solemnly ratified by the several sovereigns or the supreme power of each state.’
7	administer	"To the contrary, 'administer' is consistently defined in purely nondiscretionary terms."" See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 27 (1961) (“to manage the affairs of,” “to direct or superintend the execution, use, or conduct of ”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 26 (2d ed.1987) (“to manage (affairs, a government, etc.); have executive charge of”); Black's Law Dictionary 44 (6th ed. 1990) (“To manage or conduct”). "
8	Application	An “application” is a “putting to, placing before, preferring a request or petition *649 to or before a person. The act of making a request for something.” Black's Law Dictionary 98-99 (6th ed. 1990); see also Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 97 (1991) (application is a “request, petition ... a form used in making a request”).
9	child support	As an initial matter, the common usage of 'child support' refers to legally compulsory payments made by parents. Black's Law Dictionary 217 (5th ed. 1979) defines 'child support' as “[t]he legal obligation of parents to contribute to the economic maintenance, including education, of their children; enforceable in both civil and criminal contexts. In a dissolution or custody action, money paid by one parent to another toward the expenses of children of the marriage.
10	color	In other legal usage, the word ‘color,’ as in ‘color of authority,’ ‘color of law,’ ‘color of office,’ ‘color of title,’ and ‘colorable,’ suggests a kind of holding out and means ‘appearance, semblance, or simulacrum,’ but not necessarily the reality. See H. Black, Law Dictionary 331—332 (rev.4th ed. 1968).
11	transferred-intent doctrine	Similarly, “if one person intends to harm a second person but instead unintentionally harms a third, the first person's criminal or tortious intent toward the second applies to the third as well.” Black's Law Dictionary at 1504 (defining transferred-intent doctrine)
12	Goodwill	No business can establish good will -“ ‘[s]omething in business which gives reasonable expectancy of preference in race ... of competition’ ”- merely by broadcasting that it, as all businesses are expected to do, conducts itself in conformance with applicable state law. Black's Law Dictionary 625 (5th ed. 1979) (quoting In re Witkind's Estate, 167 Misc. 885, 895, 4 N.Y.S.2d 933, 947 (1938)).
13	price	"""Moving closer to home, recall that demand-response participants must choose either to pruchase a unit of energy at the prevailing retail price (say $10) or to withhold from purchasing that unit and receive instead an incentive payment (of say $5). The two options thus present a choice between having a unit of energy, on the one hand, and having $15 more in the bank, on the other. To repeat: take the energy, be $15 poorer; forgo the energy, be $15 richer. Is that not the very definition of price?"" F.E.R.C. v. Electric Power Supply, 577 U.S. 260, 300, 136 S.Ct. 760, 787 (Scalia, J., dissenting). "
14	capable	“Capable” means “susceptible” or “having attributes ... required for performance or accomplishment” or “having traits conducive to or features permitting.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 203 (1983); see also Oxford American Dictionary and Thesaurus 180 (2d ed. 2009) (“having the ability or quality necessary to do”).
15	money laundering,launder	" ""We agree with petitioner that taking steps to make funds appear legitimate is the common meaning of the term 'money laundering.'"" Regalado Cuellar v. United States, 553 U.S. 550, 558, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 2000 (2008). "
16	Defalcation	On the one hand, a law dictionary in use in 1867 defines the word “defalcation” as “the act of a defaulter,” which, in turn, it defines broadly as one “who is deficient in his accounts, or fails in making his accounts correct.” 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 387, 388 (4th ed. 1852). See also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 369 (2d ed. 1989) (quoting an 1846 definition that defines the term as *272 “ ‘a breach of trust by one who has charge or management of money’ ”). Modern dictionaries contain similarly broad definitional language. Black's Law Dictionary, for example, defines “defalcation” first as “EMBEZZLEMENT,” but, second, as “[l]oosely, the failure to meet an obligation; a nonfraudulent default.” Black's Law Dictionary 479 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black's). See also American Heritage Dictionary 474 (5th ed. 2011) (“To misuse funds; embezzle”); 4 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 369 (“monetary deficiency through breach of trust by one who has the management or charge of funds; a fraudulent deficiency in money matters”); Webster's New International Dictionary 686 (2d ed. 1954) (“An abstraction or misappropriation of money by one, esp. an officer or agent, having it in trust”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 590 (1986) (“misappropriation of money in one's keeping”).
17	court	Bouvier says (Law Dict.) in giving a definition of the word 'court' and the different styles of court, 'that the one common and essential feature in all courts is a judge or judges, -so essential, indeed, that they are even called the court, as distinguished form the accessory and subordinate officers.' So, too in Bacon's Abridgement a court is defined as an incorporeal political being, which requires for its existence the presence of the judges.
18	aid and abet, facilitate	"We thus think it likely that Congress had comparable scope in mind when it used the term “facilitate,” a word with equivalent meaning (then compares definition of ""aid and abet"" to ""faciliate"") "
19	discrimination 	“Discrimination” is the “failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored.” Black's Law Dictionary 534 (9th ed.2009); accord, id., at 420 (5th ed.1979); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 648 (1976) (“discriminates” means “to make a difference in treatment or *287 favor on a class or categorical basis in disregard of individual merit”). 
20	relief	"""Next, the majority repeats Texas' dictionary-based contention that in using the word “relief” Congress meant to “connot[e] equitable relief.” Ante, at 1660. This proposition suffers from three flaws. First, it is not established by the dictionary to which the majority cites...Second, it is inconsistent with our precedent."""
21	procedure	The word 'procedure' has been defined by Anderson, in his Dictionary of Law as follows: 'rpocedure. The body of rules, whether of practice or pleadings, whereby rights are effectuated through the successful application of proper remedies. Opposed to the sume of the legal principles which constitute the substance of the law, and also distinguished from the of evidence. The term is so broad that is is seldom employed as a word of art; it including whatever is embraced by the three technical terms, ‘pleadings,’ ‘evidence,’ and ‘practice;’ ‘practice’ here meaning those legal rules which direct the course of proceeding to bring parties into court, and the course of the court after they are brought in; and ‘evidence’ meaning those rules of law whereby we determine what testimony is to be admitted and what rejected in each case, and what is the weight to be given to the testimony admitted.'
22	"""Property Interest"" "	But the commonly understood definition of a property “interest” is “[a] legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property .... Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of [such] rights.” Black's Law Dictionary 828 (8th ed.2004).
23	forgery	Blackstone defined forgery as “the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man's right.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 245 (1769) (emphasis added). The most prominent 19th-century American authority on criminal law wrote that “[f]orgery, at the common law, is the false making or materially altering, with intent to defraud, of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy or the foundation of a legal liability.” 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law § 523, p. 288 (5th ed. 1872) (emphasis added). 
24	administration	The word “administration” can be read literally to refer to every “[a]ct or process of administering” including every act of “managing” or “conduct[ing]” any “office,” or “performing the executive duties of” any “institution, business, or the like.” Webster's 34.
25	insane 	"""Alternatively, however, the term may also be used to encompass persons with other mental conditions, so long as they are 'severe enough [to] prevent[ ] a person from having legal capacity and excuse[ ] the person from criminal or civil responsibility.' Black's Law Dictionary 914 (10th ed. 2014). In that different understanding, 'insanity' connotes a general standard of legal competency rather than a more limited description of delusional disorders."" "
26	facts	Facts, by contrast, are mere real-world things—extraneous to the crime's legal requirements. (We have sometimes called them “brute facts” when distinguishing them from elements. Richardson, 526 U.S., at 817, 119 S.Ct. 1707.) They are “circumstance[s]” or “event[s]” having no “legal effect [or] consequence”: In particular, they need neither be found by a jury nor admitted by a defendant. Black's Law Dictionary 709.
27	cause,suit,controversy	"""The last four words in that list—'cause,' 'suit,' 'proceeding,' and 'controversy'—connote a formal exercise of governmental power, such as a lawsuit, hearing, or administrative determination."" See, e.g., Crimes Act of 1790, § 21, 1 Stat. 117 (using “cause,” “suit,” and “controversy” in a related statutory context to refer to judicial proceedings); Black's Law Dictionary 278–279, 400, 1602–1603 (4th ed. 1951) (defining “cause,” “suit,” and “controversy” as judicial proceedings); 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(3) (using “proceeding” to refer to trials, hearings, or the like “before any court, any committee of either House or both Houses of Congress, or any agency, commission, or officer”)."
28	under	"""Based on the plain language and statutory context discussed above, we think it obvious that the word 'under,' as used in the stop-time rule, can only mean 'in accordance with' or 'according to,' for it connects the stop-time trigger in § 1229b(d)(1) to a 'notice to appear' that contains the enumerated time-and-place information described in § 1229(a)(1)(G)(i)."" "
29	robbery	Robbery, accurately defined, is ‘the felonious and forcible taking from the person of another, goods or money to any value, by violence or putting him in fear.’
30	right	"First, the 'ordinary meaning' of the term 'right; as confirmed by Black's Law Dictionary indicates that the Commerce Clause provides petitioner a right."" "
31	pilots	The term pilots is equally applicable to two classes of persons,—  tothose whose employment is to guide vessels in and out of ports, and to those who are intrusted with the management of the helm and the direction of the vessel on her voyage.
32	enterprise	That an “enterprise” must have a purpose is apparent from the meaning of the term in ordinary usage, i.e., a “venture,” “undertaking,” or “project.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 757 (1976).
33	Challenge	Arguing that a prior removal order was substantively unlawful is a “challenge” to that order. See Black's Law Dictionary 230 (6th ed. 1990) (“Challenge” means “[t]o object or except to” or “to put into dispute”). 
34	access	"In the computing context, ""access"" references the act of entering a computer ""system itself"" or a particular ""part of a computer system,"" such as files, folders, or databases."""
35	insurance	A key feature of insurance is that it indemnifies loss. See Black's Law Dictionary 802 (6th ed. 1990) (first definition of insurance is “contract whereby, for a stipulated consideration, one party undertakes to compensate the other for loss on a specified subject by specified perils”). 
36	res judicata	This mere recital of the facts concerning that action at law seems sufficient answer to the plea of res judicata, for among the essentials of an estoppel by judgment is identity of the cause of action. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Commissioners of Jefferson Co., 12 Kan. 127; 2 Bouv. Law Dict. tit. ‘Res Judicata.’ 
37	police	What is police? Sir William Blackstone has defined it in his Commentaries
38	regulate	Indeed, as the D.C. Circuit observed, “[a]t the time the Constitution was [framed], to ‘regulate’ meant,” among other things, “to require action.” 
39	discrimination	The term “ discriminatory” means characterized by differential treatment that lacks a sound justification. See The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 564 (2d ed. 1987) (“discriminatory” means “characterized by or showing prejudicial treatment esp. as an indication of racial, religious, or sexual bias”); B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 191 (1987) (“discriminatory” means “applying discrimination in treatment, esp. on ethnic grounds”); Black's Law Dictionary 479 (“discrimination” means characterized by “[d]ifferential treatment; esp., a failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored”). 
40	accused	And “[t]his understanding of the Sixth Amendment language—‘accused’ as distinct from ‘convicted’ ...—endures today.” Betterman, 578 U. S., at ––––, 136 S.Ct., at 1614 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 26 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “accused” as “a person who has been arrested and brought before a magistrate or who has been formally charged” (emphasis added))). at 2392
41	arbitrator	But the Secretary of War was not an arbitrator. An arbitrator is defined as ‘a private extraordinary judge chosen by the parties who have a matter in dispute, invested with power to decide the same.’ The Secretary of War acted ministerially. The resolution conferred no judicial power upon him.
42	mobilia sequuntur personam'	The “home port doctrine” enunciated in Hays was a corollary of the medieval maxim mobilia sequuntur personam (“movables follow the person,” see Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (rev. 4th ed. 1968)) and resulted in personal property being taxable in full at the domicile of the owner.
43	right-of-way	Specifically, a right-of-way grants the limited “right to pass ... through the estate of another.” Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (4th ed. 1968).       1) right-of-way  A right-of-way may include not just a right of passage, but also the land itself. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 521e(3) (providing that certain “rights-of-way” are “lands”); Black's Law Dictionary 1587 (11th ed. 2019) (“rightof-way” can refer to “[t]he strip of land”); Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (4th ed. 1968) (similar)  United States Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass'n, 140 S. Ct. 1837, 1857, 207 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2020)  2) Land  The legal meaning of “land” when Congress enacted the relevant statutes was “any ground, soil, or earth whatsoever.” Black's Law Dictionary 1019 (4th ed. 1968). The ordinary meaning of land was much the same. Webster's New International Dictionary 1388 (2d ed. 1949) (“The solid part of the surface of the earth, as distinguished from water”; “Any ground, soil, or earth whatsoever ... and everything annexed to it, whether by nature ... or by man”).  United States Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass'n, 140 S. Ct. 1837, 1852, 207 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2020)
44	remedial action	Deterrence, however, has traditionally been viewed as a goal of punishment, and forfeiture of the currency here does not serve the remedial purpose of compensating the Government for a loss. See Black's Law Dictionary 1293 (6th ed. 1990) (“[R]emedial action” is one “brought to obtain compensation or indemnity”).
45	event	"""The rejection of an explicit request for assistance would be an 'event' or 'happening' under the ordinary and usual definitions of these terms."" at 655. "
46	Suspension	At the founding, suspension was a well-known term that meant “a [t]emporal [s]top of a [m]an's [r]ight.” N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (22d ed. 1770)
47	personnel agency	And a “personnel agency” is “an agency for placing employable persons in jobs; employment agency.” Random House 1075.
48	board of trade 	“In the United States, a body of men appointed for the advancement and protection of business interests. Cf. chamber of commerce.”
49	claim	"""Nor does it advance the ball very far to recognize from the statute's later reference to 'the cause of action alleged in such suit or process,' that the term 'claim' is used here synonymously with 'cause of action,' see Black's Law Dictionary 247 (6th ed. 1990) (defining 'claim' as 'cause of action'), since, as both parties admit, 'cause of action,' like 'claim,' can carry a variety of meanings..."
50	Organize	The statute does not define what is meant by ‘organize.’ Dictionary definitions are of little help, for, as those offered us sufficiently show, the term is susceptible of both meanings attributed to it by the parties here.
51	appearance	"""An 'appearance' being commonly understood as '[t]he first act of the defendant in court,' J. Ballentine, Law Dictionary with Pronunciations 91 (2d ed.1948)"" at 587 n.5 "
52	Process	The Court's references to “process” in Utah & Northern R. Co. and Kagama, and the Court's concern in Kagama over possible federal encroachment on state prerogatives, suggest state authority to issue search warrants in cases such as the one before us. (“Process” is defined as “any means used by a court to acquire or exercise its jurisdiction over a person or over specific property,” Black's Law Dictionary 1084 (5th ed.1979), and is equated in criminal cases with a warrant, id., at 1085.) 
53	prison	Prison, by contrast, is a “state or federal facility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp. felons.” Id., at 1314.
54	present	To “present” is “to bring or introduce into the presence of someone” or “to lay (as a charge) before a court as an object of inquiry.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 930 (1991). 
55	detention	“[D]etention” is defined by legal and nonlegal dictionaries alike as a “compulsory,” “forced,” or “punitive” containment. Black's Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed.1999) (compulsory); American Heritage Dictionary 494 (4th ed.2000) (forced or punitive).
56	per	In fact, the word “per” simply means “[f]or each” or “for every.” Black's Law Dictionary 1171 (8th ed.1999); see Webster's Third 1674.
57	void	A void judgment is a legal nullity. See Black's Law Dictionary 1822 (3d ed.1933); see also id., at 1709 (9th ed.2009).
58	"""arm's length transacation"" "	And still, we can further delineate that issue just by plugging in the widely (universally?) *968 understood definition of an arm's-length transaction: a transaction conducted as though the two parties were strangers. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 1726 (10th ed. 2014). 
59	Right	A right is a well founded or acknowledged claim
60	enact	An “enactment” is the product of legislation, not adjudication. See Webster's New International Dictionary 841 (2d ed.1949) (defining “enact” as “[t]o make into an act or law; esp., to perform the legislative act with reference to (a bill) which gives it the validity of law”);
61	use	"""That is particularly true of a word as 'use,' whose meanings range all the way from 'to partake of' (as in 'he uses tobacco') to 'to be wont or accustomed' (as in 'he used to smoke tobacco')."" Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 241-42, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2061 (1993) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citation omitted). "
62	subject	a “subject” is merely “[o]ne who owes allegiance to a sovereign and is governed by that sovereign's laws,” id., at 1438.
63	offence	The framers understood the term “offence” to mean a “transgression.”
64	physical force	"""In explaining its interpretation of 'physical force,' the Court in Johnson expressly rejected the common law's definition of 'force,' see 559 U.S., at 139, 130 S.Ct. 1265 instead recognizing that the phrase should be 'give[n] ... its ordinary meaning...Rather, ;context determines meaning,' ibid., and, 'in the context of a statutory definition of ‘violent felony,’' the ordinary rather than the common-law meaning of 'force' was what fit, id., at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265."" (quoting Johnson v. United States (2015)) "
65	falsify	The last two verbs, “falsif[y]” and “mak[e] a false entry in,” typically take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “falsify” as “[t]o make deceptive; to counterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a document, record, etc.)”). It would be unnatural, for example, to describe a killer's act of wiping his fingerprints from a gun as “falsifying” the murder weapon. But it would not be strange to refer to “falsifying” data stored on a hard drive as simply “falsifying” a hard drive.
66	levy 	One of its “principal tools,” ibid., is a levy, which is a “legally sanctioned seizure and sale of property,” Black's Law Dictionary 926 (8th ed.2004); see also § 6331(b) (“The term ‘levy’ as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means”).
67	color of law	"Color of law' does not mean actual law. 'Color,' as a modifier, in legal parlance, means 'appearance, as distinguished from reality.' Color of law means 'mere semblance of legal right.'"" "
68	To mitigate	To mitigate a sentence is to reduce or lessen the amount of the penalty or punishment. 1 Bouvier's Law Dict. 374; 2 Id. 428.  
69	personnel department	So, for example, a “personnel department” is “the department of a business firm that deals with problems affecting the employees of the firm and that usually interviews applicants for jobs.” Random House Dictionary 1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House). 
70	capitation tax	Mr. Justice Bouvier, in his learned [l]aw [d]ictionary, defines a capitation tax, 'a poll tax; an imposition which is yearly laid on each person according to his estate and ability.'
71	search	"At the founding, 'search' did not mean a violation of someone's reasonable expectation of privacy. The word was probably not a term of art, as it does not appear in legal dictionaries from the era. And its ordinary meaning was the same as it is today...""  (then Thomas goes on to cite ordinary dictionaries) "
72	court of competent jurisdiction	A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it, Black's Law Dictionary 431, and a court's subject-matter jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210. 
73	imprison	""" First, the definition of “is imprisoned” may well include pretrial detention. Both now and at the time Congress created supervised release, see § 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1999–2000, the term 'imprison' has meant '[t]o put in a prison,' 'to incarcerate,' '[t]o confine a person, or restrain his liberty, in any way.' Black's Law Dictionary 681 (5th ed. 1979); 5 Oxford English Dictionary 113 (1933); accord, Black's Law Dictionary 875 (10th ed. 2014)."" "
74	low-water-mark	The “low-water mark” of a river is “the point to which the water recedes at its lowest stage.” Black's Law Dictionary 1623 (8th ed.2004).
75	renvoi	Renvoi is “[t]he doctrine under which a court in resorting to foreign law adopts as well the foreign law's conflict-of-laws principles, which may in turn refer the court back to the law of the forum.” Black's Law Dictionary 1300 (7th ed.1999).
76	case	"In our view, a 'criminal case' at the very leats requires the initiation of legal proceedings."" Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 766, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 2001 (2003).  See Blyew v. United States, 13 Wall. 581, 595, 20 L.Ed. 638 (1872) (“The words ‘case’ and ‘cause’ are constantly used as synonyms in statutes and judicial decisions, each meaning a proceeding in court, a suit, or action” (emphasis added)); Black's Law Dictionary 215 (6th ed.1990) (defining “[c]ase” as “[a] general term for an action, cause, suit, or controversy at law ...; a question contested before a court of justice” (emphasis added))."
77	any	The standard dictionary definition of “any” is “[s]ome, regardless of quantity or number.” American Heritage Dictionary 59 (def. 2) (1969).
78	right	"""This combined restriction on state power and entitlement to relief under the Commerce Clause amounts to a 'right, privilege, or immunity' under the ordinary meaning of those terms"" "
79	Violation	A “violation” is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or conduct that is contrary to law. Black's Law Dictionary 1570 (6th ed.1990).
80	actual damages	"The latest edition of Black's Law Dictionary available when Congress enacted the Privacy Act defined 'actual damages' as…..."" But this general (and notably circular) definition is of little value here because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed, the precise meaning of the term 'changes with the specific statute in which it is found.'"""
81	capacity	“Capacity,” used in this sense, means “[o]utward condition or circumstances; relation; character; position.” Webster's New International Dictionary 396 (2d ed. 1934); see also 2 Oxford English Dictionary 89 (def. 9) (1933) (“Position, condition, character, relation”). 
82	repo men 	"But, according to Obduskey, 'repo men'—those who seize automobiles and other personal property in response to nonpayment—fit the bill. See Black's Law Dictionary 1493 (10th ed. 2014) (explaining that ""repo” is short for “repossession,” which means “retaking property; esp., a seller's retaking of goods sold on credit when the buyer has failed to pay for them”)."
83	damage	"""The word 'damage' traditionally describes a harm to property (hence, 'property damage'), rather than harm to the person (usually referred to as 'personal injury')."" "
84	structure	In the sense relevant here, the term “structure” means “[t]he way in which parts are arranged or put together to form a whole” *946 and “[t]he interrelation or arrangement of parts in a complex entity.” American Heritage Dictionary 1718 (4th ed.2000); see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1410 (1967) (defining structure to mean, among other things, “the pattern of relationships, as of status or friendship, existing among the members of a group or society”).
85	any	This Court has time and again recognized that “any” has “an expansive meaning,” bringing within a statute's reach all types of the item (here, “tangible object”) to which the law refers.
86	tort damages	That's exactly how we usually understand tort damages—as “compensation” for an “injury” caused by “the unlawful act or omission or negligence of another.” Black's Law Dictionary 314 (2d ed. 1910).
87	remaining	here may be some ambiguity at the margin, but “remain[ing] in one place” requires more than a temporary **1877 stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding respondents' arrests described supra, at 1872–1873.
88	Tonnage	Tonnage, in our law, is a vessel's ‘internal cubical capacity in tons of one hundred cubic feet each, to be ascertained’ in the manner prescribed by Congress. Act of May 6, 1864, 13 Stat. pp. 70, 72; Rev. Stat. U. S. 804, § 4153. ‘Tonnage duties are duties upon vessels in proportion to their capacity.’ Bouv. Law Dict., ‘Tonnage.’
89	precedent	Apodaca was a precedent, that is, “a decided case that furnishes a basis for determining later cases involving similar facts or issues.” Black's Law Dictionary 1366 (10th ed. 2014); see also J. Salmond, Jurisprudence 191 (10th ed. 1947); M. Gerhardt, The Power of Precedent 3 (2008); Landes & Posner, Legal Precedent: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, 19 J. Law & Econ. 249, 250 (1976).
90	corporation	"""Under the definitions supplied by contemporary law dictionaries, Territories would have been classified as 'corporations' (and hence as 'persons') at the time that § 1983 was enacted and the Dictionary Act recodified."""
91	injury	To deprive another of his property forever by deliberately disposing of it without semblance of authority is certainly an injury thereto within common acceptation of the words. Bouvier's Law Dict., ‘Injury.’ 
92	Sovereign	The sovereign is, by definition, the entity “in which independent **1644 and supreme authority is vested.” Black's Law Dictionary 1395 (6th ed.1990).
93	Authorize	Although the word “authorize” sometimes means simply “to permit,” it ordinarily denotes affirmative enabling action. Black's Law Dictionary 122 (5th ed. 1979) defines “authorize” as “[t]o empower; to give a right or authority to act.”
94	real party in interest	The phrase, “real party in interest,” is a term of art utilized in federal law to refer to an actor with a substantive right whose interests may be represented in litigation by *935 another. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a); see also Cts.Crim.App. Rule Prac. & Proc. 20(b), 44 M.J. LXXII (1996) (“When an accused has not been named as a party, the accused ... shall be designated as the real party in interest”); Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at 1154 (defining a “real party in interest” as “[a] person entitled under the substantive law to enforce the right sued upon and who generally ... benefits from the action's final outcome”). 
95	administration, noscitur a sociis	When used to modify the nouns “report, hearing, audit, or investigation,” in the context of a statutory provision about “the public disclosure” of fraud on the United States, the term is most naturally read to describe the activities of governmental agencies. See Black's Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black's) (defining “administration,” “[i]n public law, [as] the practical management and direction of the executive department and its agencies”).
96	excessive	Excessive means surpassing the usual, the proper, or a normal measure of proportion. See 1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (defining excessive as “beyond the common measure or proportion”); S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 680 (4th ed. 1773) (“[b]eyond the common proportion”).
97	cold-blooded	 The lead entry for “cold-blooded” gives coordinate definitions. One, *472 “marked by absence of warm feelings: without consideration, compunction, or clemency,” id., at 442, mirrors the definition of “pitiless.” The other defines “cold-blooded” to mean “matter of fact, emotionless.” Ibid. It is true that “cold-blooded” is sometimes also used to describe “premedita[tion],” Black's Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990)—a mental state that may coincide with, but is distinct from, a lack of feeling or compassion.
98	independent 	"""Neither amicus nor the House explains how the CFPB would be 'independent' if its head were required to implement the President's policies upon pain of removal. See Black's Law Dictionary 838 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “independent” as “[n]ot subject to the control or influence of another”)."" "
99	collection	Finally, “collection” is the act of obtaining payment of taxes due. See Black's 349 (defining “collect” as “to obtain payment or liquidation” of a debt or claim). 
100	copyright	According to the practice of legislation in England and America, (says Judge BOUVIER, 2 Law Dict. 363,) the copyright is confined to the exclusive right secured to the author or proprietor of a writing or drawing which may be multiplied by the arts of printing in any of its branches.
101	"""rule of the last antecedent"""	When this Court has interpreted statutes that include a list of terms or phrases followed by a limiting clause, we have typically applied an interpretive strategy called the “rule of the last antecedent.” See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26, 124 S.Ct. 376, 157 L.Ed.2d 333 (2003). The rule provides that “a limiting clause or phrase ... should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.” Ibid.; see also Black's Law Dictionary 1532–1533 (10th ed. 2014) (“[Q]ualifying words or phrases modify the words or phrases immediately preceding them and not words or phrases more remote, unless the extension is necessary from the context or the spirit of the entire writing”)
102	under	Everyone agrees, however, that “under” is often used to mean “authorized by.” See, e.g., Webster's New World College Dictionary 1453 (3d ed. 1997) (“authorized ... by”); American Heritage Dictionary 1945 (3d ed. 1992) (“With the authorization of”); see also Brief for Respondent 24 (agreeing that “under” can mean “subject to,” “governed by,” or “issued under the authority of”); Brief for Petitioner 28. 
103	steal	‘Steal’ (originally ‘stale’) at first denoted in general usage a taking through secrecy, as implied in ‘stealth,’ or through stratagem, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. 
104	false makiing	[Black's Law Dictionary] reads as follows: “False making. An essential element of forgery, where material alteration is not involved. Term has reference to manner in which writing is made or executed rather than to its substance or effect. A falsely made instrument is one that is fictitious, not genuine, or in some material particular something other than it purports to be and without regard to truth or falsity of facts stated therein.” Black's Law Dictionary 602 (6th ed. 1990). 
105	ne exeat 	...the latter was then informed ... that he could file an answer and apply for the discharge of the writ immediately. ... It could have meant but one thing, namely, that it was in the power of Durant to obtain, without objection, if not of right, a discharge of the writ, after answering, by executing a bond of some kind. A party arrested upon ne exeat may obtain the discharge of the writ, upon motion or petition...
106	endeavor	To “endeavor” means to strive or work for a certain end. Webster's New International Dictionary 844 (2d ed. 1950); 1 New *611 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 816 (1993). 
107	Pander,pandering	The Oxford English Dictionary defines the verb “pander,” as “to minister to the gratification of (another's lust),” 11 Oxford English Dictionary 129 (2d ed.1989). And Black's Law Dictionary provides, as relevant, this definition of “pandering”: “The act or offense of selling or distributing textual or visual material (such as magazines or videotapes) openly advertised to appeal to the recipient's sexual interest.” Black's Law Dictionary 1142 (8th ed.2004) (hereinafter Black's).
108	firearms	Boston's gunpowder law imposed a £10 fine upon “any Person” who “shall take into any Dwelling–House, Stable, Barn, Out-house, Ware-house, Store, Shop, or other Building, within the Town of Boston, any ... Fire–Arm, loaded with, or having Gun–Powder.” An Act in Addition to the several Acts already made for the prudent Storage of Gun–Powder within the Town of Boston, ch. XIII, 1783 Mass. Acts pp. 218–219; see also 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 751 (4th ed. 1773) (defining “firearms” as “[a]rms which owe their efficacy to fire; guns”)
109	statute of limitations, civil action	In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates “a time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when the claim accrued.” Black's Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed. 2009) (Black's)
110	tangible object	"Tangible object' in § 1519, we conclude, is better read to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world."" Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1081 (2015). "
111	Purpotedly	Laws that purportedly regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts are laws having the “appearance of” regulating or “intending” to regulate insurance companies or contracts. Black's Law Dictionary 1236 (6th ed.1990).
112	firm	Some sources define ‘firm’ as ‘[t]he persons composing a partnership, taken collectively.’ II Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1232 (1914); see also Ballentine's Law Dictionary 507 (2d ed. 1948); Black's Law Dictionary 761–762 (4th ed. 1951); Crowell's Dictionary of Business and Finance 225 (rev. ed. 1930); Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance 238 (Garcia, 5th ed. 1949). But other dictionaries, while recognizing that narrow definition, also state that the word has a broader meaning in popular usage, connoting any business entity, including individual proprietorships. For example, the standard American reference defines ‘firm’ both as ‘a partnership of two or more persons not recognized as a legal person distinct from the members composing it’ and as any ‘business unit or enterprise.’ Webster's Third New International Dictionary—Unabridged 856 (1961). Accord, Clark & Gottfried, Dictionary of Business and Finance 152 (1957) (‘Strictly, an unincorporated business carried on by more than one person, jointly; a partnership. * * * In popular usage, any business, company, or concern, incorporated or not.’); Dictionary of Business and Industry 218 (Schwartz ed. 1954) (‘A business partnership; any business house or organization, no matter what its legal form * * *’); Dictionary of English Law 807 (1959) (‘the style or title under which one or several persons carry on business'); Dictionary of Foreign Trade 308 (Henius, 2d ed. 1947) (‘the name or title under which one or more persons do business').
113	hearing	In Bouvier's Law Dictionary, (1 Bouv. Law Dict. p. 581,) ‘hearing’ is thus defined: ‘The examination of a prisoner charged with a crime or misdemeanor, and of the witnesses for the accuser.’ In 9 Amer. & Eng. Enc. Law, p. 324, it is said to be ‘the preliminary examination of a prisoner charged with a crime, and of witnesses for the prosecution and defense.’ See, also, Whart. Crim. Pl. & Pr. § 70.
114	Elements	“Elements” are the “constituent parts” of a crime's legal definition—the things the “prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.” Black's Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014).  
115	detain	First, in ordinary English and in light of the history of bail, the word “detain” is ambiguous in respect to the relevant point. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), surveying the history of the word, notes that Edward Hall, a famous 16th-century legal scholar and author of Hall's Chronicle, wrote: “A traytor ... is apprehended and deteigned in prisone for his offence,” a use of the word, as we know from Blackstone, that is consistent with bail. See supra, at 863 – 864 OED (3d ed., Dec. 2012), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176 (annot. to def. 1). David Hume, the famous 18th-century historian and philosopher, writes of being “detained in strict confinement,” thereby implying the existence of detention without strict confinement. Ibid. A 19th-century novelist writes, “ ‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ said the constable, ... ‘I shall be obliged to detain you till this business is settled’ ”—again a use of “detain” that we know (from Blackstone) is consistent with bail. Ibid. And the OED concludes that the primary meaning of “detain” is “[t]o keep in confinement or under restraint ; to keep prisoner.” Ibid. (emphasis added). 
116	Accused	This understanding of the Sixth Amendment language—“accused” as distinct from “convicted,” and “trial” as separate from “sentencing”—endures today. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 26 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “accused” as “a person who has *1615 been arrested and brought before a magistrate or who has been formally charged ” (emphasis added)); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32 (governing “Sentencing and Judgment,” the rule appears in the chapter on “Post–Conviction Procedures,” which follows immediately after the separate chapter headed “Trial”).
117	Proviso	A proviso in deeds, or laws, is a limitation or exception to a grant made, or authority conferred, the effect of which is to declare that the one shall not operate, or the other be exercised, unless in the case provided.
118	noscitur a sociis 	Finding no direct guidance in the statute, the court applied the maxim noscitur a sociis (“[i]t is known from its associates,” Black's Law Dictionary 1209 (Rev. 4th ed. 1968))
119	determine	Instead, the fifth definition of that word—“[c]harge, oversight, or management”—is clearly the relevant one. The point is only that context, as well as common sense, matters when selecting among possible definitions.
120	attainder	"The word attainder is derived, by Sir Thomas Tomlins, in his law dictionary, from the words attincta and attinctura, and is defined to be ‘the stain or corruption of the blood of a criminal capitally condemned; the immediate inseparable consequence of the common law, on the pronouncing the sentence of death.’"" "
121	Incident	 What it obviously means, however, is “element.” See Black's Law Dictionary 762 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “incidents of ownership”); J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 783–784 (1883) (defining “incident” and giving examples of “incident to a reversion,” and “incidents” to a contract).
122	assessment	Contemporaneous dictionaries from the time of the TIA's enactment define assessment in expansive terms. They would broaden any understanding of the term, and so the Act's bar. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 139 (1927) (providing three context relevant definitions for the term assessment: It is the act of apportioning or determining an amount to be paid; a valuation of property for the purpose of taxation; or the entire plan or scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing).
123	low-water mark	"""The 'low-water mark' of a river is defined as a 'the point to which the water recedes at its lowest stage.'"" Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 62 n.2, 124 S.Ct. 598, 603 n.2 (2003) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1586 (7th ed. 1999)). "
124	enjoin	In ordinary usage, the term “enjoin” means to “require,” “command,” or “direct” an action, or to “require a person ... to perform, or to abstain or desist from, some act.” Black's Law Dictionary 529 (6th ed.1990) (hereinafter Black's). See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 754 (1993) (defining “enjoin” to mean “to direct, prescribe, or impose by order”; “to prohibit or restrain by a judicial order or decree”).
125	relevancy	Relevancy is that ‘quality of evidence which renders it properly applicable in determining the truth or falsity of the matter in issue between the parties to a suit.’ 1 Bouvier Law Dict. Rawle's Revision, 866.
126	executor	The ordinary in granting administration, is a ministerial, not a judicial officer. Toler, 50, 66. Jac. Law, Dict. tit. executor. 12, Mod. 437.
127	remedy	But this exercise in isolated definition is ultimately inconclusive, for, depending on where one looks, “remedy” can mean either specific relief obtainable at the end of a process of seeking redress, **1824 or the process itself, the procedural avenue leading to some relief. See Black's Law Dictionary 1296 (7th ed.1999) (defining “remedy” alternatively as “[t]he means of enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong,” or as “REMEDIAL ACTION.... Cf. RELIEF”).
128	substantive law	On this account, a substantive standard is one that “creates duties, rights and obligations,” while a procedural standard specifies how those duties, rights, and obligations should be enforced. Black's Law Dictionary 1281 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “substantive law”).
129	Nunc pro tunc	Federal courts may issue nunc pro tunc orders, or “now for then” orders, Black's Law Dictionary, at 1287, to “reflect[ *701 ] the reality” of what has already occurred, Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 49, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 109 L.Ed.2d 31 (1990). 
130	accrue	Thus the “standard rule” is that a claim accrues “when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.” ... And that definition appears in dictionaries from the 19th century up until today. See, e.g., 1 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 17 (1850) (“an action accrues when the plaintiff has a right to commence it”); Black's Law Dictionary 23 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “accrue” as “[t]o come into existence as an enforceable claim or right”).
131	discretion	Agency discretion presumes that an agency can exercise “judgment” in connection with a particular action… see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (unabridged ed.1967) (“discretion” defined as “the power or right to decide or act according to one's own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice”). 
132	Compensation	A dictionary from the period during which the private-hands exception was enacted illustrates the general nature of the term; it defines compensation to include “that which supplies the place of something else” and “that which is given or received as an equivalent for services, debt, want, loss, or suffering.” N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 235 (C. Goodrich ed. 1849).
133	original	"Whether one consults a dictionary or common sense, the meaning of “original sentence” is plain: The term refers to the initial judgment imposing punishment on a defendant. “Original” is commonly understood to mean “initial” or “first in order.” (then goes on to define the word ""original"" in ordinary dictionaries and law dictionaries)  "
134	tonnage	‘Tonnage duties,’ as defined by the learned Bouvier, are ‘duties on vessels in proportion to their capacity.’
135	cold-blood	“Cold blood” is used “to designate a willful, deliberate, and premeditated homicide.” Black's Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990). As such, the term is used to differentiate between first- and second-degree murders.
136	regulate	That understanding is consistent with the original meaning of “regulate” at the time of the Constitution's ratification, when “to regulate” meant “[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,” 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); “[t]o adjust, to direct according to rule,” 2 J. Ash, New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1775); “to put in order, set to rights, govern or keep in order,” T. Dyche & W. Pardon, A New General English Dictionary (16th ed. 1777).
137	act	An act is defined in the Century Dictionary as ‘an exertion of energy or force, mental or physical; anything that is done or performed; a doing or deed; an operation or performance.’ 
138	separate legal person	But the phrase “separate legal person” typically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to hold personhood separate from the natural persons who are its shareholders or officers.
139	proclamation	"What is a proclamation?"" It is to cry aloud, publicly to make known. One may proclaim, as of old, by the sound of trumpet, or by voice, or by print, or by posting; but not by silence. A proclamation may be published in the newspapers, or scattered by writing, or in any demonstrative manner, but it cannot be published by a deposit in a place to which the public have no access."
140	Intent	“Intent” is “[a] state of mind in which a person seeks to accomplish a given result through a course of action.” Black's Law Dictionary 810 (6th ed.1990).
141	scienter	 If the ordinance's prohibition were limited *111 to loitering with “an apparently harmful purpose,” the criminality of the conduct would continue to depend on its external appearance, rather than the loiterer's state of mind. See Black's Law Dictionary 1345 (6th ed.1990) (scienter “is frequently used to signify the defendant's guilty knowledge”). 
142	ownership	 But whether “ownership” is the “[c]ollection of rights to use and enjoy property, including [the] right to transmit it to others,” or “[t]he complete dominion, title, or proprietary right in a thing,” or “[t]he entirety of the powers of use and disposal allowed by law,” id., at 997, the parent corporation—not the subsidiary whose every decision it controls—better fits the bill as the true owner of any property that the subsidiary nominally possesses.
143	remedy	Black's Law Dictionary 1163 (5th ed. 1979) defines “remedy” as “[t]he means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed, or compensated.” 
144	maturity	Contemporaneous editions of legal dictionaries defined “maturity” as “[t]he time when a ... note becomes due.” Black's Law Dictionary 1170 (3d ed. 1933); Cyclopedic Law Dictionary 649 (2d ed. 1922).
145	stolen	Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed., 1953) likewise defines ‘stolen’ as ‘Obtained or accomplished by theft, stealth, or craft
146	Money	Regardless, the formal “medium of exchange” definition is not the only dictionary definition of “money,” now or then. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, included in its definition “property or possessions of any kind viewed as convertible into money,” 6 Oxford English Dictionary 603 (1st ed. 1933); Black's Law Dictionary said that money was the representative of “everything that can be transferred in commerce,” Black's Law Dictionary 1200 (3d ed. 1933); and the New Century Dictionary defined money as “property considered with reference to its pecuniary value,” 1 New Century Dictionary of the English Language 1083 (1933).
147	service of process	Service of process refers to a formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action. 1 Ristau § 4–5(2), p. 123 (interpreting the Convention); Black's Law Dictionary 1227 (5th ed. 1979); see 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1063, p. 225 (2d ed. 1987). 
148	shall 	“Though ‘shall’ generally means ‘must,’ legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, ‘shall’ to mean ‘should,’ ‘will,’ or even ‘may.’ ” See D. Mellinkoff, Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage 402–403 (1992)) (“shall” and “may” are “frequently treated as synonyms” and their meaning depends on context); B. Garner, Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 939 (2d ed. 1995) (‘Courts in virtually every English-speaking jurisdiction have held—by necessity—that shall means may in some contexts, and vice versa’)”
149	pursuant	To remove a case “pursuant to” § 1442 or § 1443, then, just means that a defendant's notice of removal must assert the case is removable “in accordance with or by reason of ” one of those provisions.
150	damage, damages	Black's Law Dictionary cautions that the word ‘damage,’ meaning ‘loss, injury, or deterioration,’ is ‘to be distinguished from its plural,—’ damages,'—which means a compensation in money for a loss or damage.'
151	felony	A “felony,” we have come to understand, is a “serious crime usu[ally] punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death.” Black's Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed.2009) (hereinafter Black's).
152	until	The meaning of the word “until” is not difficult to understand, nor is it some specialized term of art. See Webster's New International Dictionary 2794 (2d ed.1957) (defining “until” to mean “[d]uring the whole time before”); Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1297 *299 10th ed.1993) (defining “until” to mean “up to such time as” or “[b]efore”). 
153	violence	And “violence,” when used in a legal context, also implies an intentional act. See Black's Law Dictionary 1564 (“violence” is the “[u]njust or unwarranted use of force, usu. accompanied by fury, vehemence, or outrage; physical force unlawfully exercised with the intent to harm”).
154	pardon 	"Whereas commutation is a substitution of a milder form of punishment pardon is an act of public conscience that relieves the recipient of all the legal consequences of the conviction."" Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256, 273 n.8, 95 S.Ct. 379, 388 n.8 (1974) (Marshall, J., dissenting). "
155	tolled	Ordinarily, “tolled,” in the context of a time prescription like § 1367(d), means that the limitations period is suspended (stops running) while the claim is sub judice elsewhere, then starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off. See Black's Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (“toll,” when paired with the grammatical object “statute of limitations,” means “to suspend or stop temporarily”). 
156	owner	That is because the words “own” and “ownership”—neither of which is defined in the FSIA—are not technical terms or terms of art but common terms, the precise legal meaning of which depends upon the statutory context in which they appear. See J. Cribbet & C. Johnson, Principles of the Law of Property 16 (3d ed. 1989) (“Anglo–American law has not made much use of the term ownership in a technical sense”); Black's Law Dictionary 1049, 1105 (6th *482 ed. 1990) (“The term [‘owner’] is ... a nomen generalissimum”—a “term of the most general meaning” or “of the most general kind”—“and its meaning is to be gathered from the connection in which it is used, and from the subject-matter to which it is applied”).
157	to cane	the use of a cane as an instrument of punishment was once so common that “to cane” has become a verb meaning “[t]o beat with a cane.” Webster's New International Dictionary, supra, at 390
158	Statute 	The founding generation treated conflicts between federal and state laws as implied repeals. PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.S. 604, 622, 131 S.Ct. 2567, 180 L.Ed.2d 580 (2011) (plurality opinion). Then, as now, courts disfavored repeals by implication. See, e.g., Warder v. Arell, 2 Va. 282, 299 (1796) (opinion of President Judge); 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law-Dictionary (2d ed. 1771) (defining “Statute”); 4 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 638 (3d ed. 1768).
159	certified mail 	It is also significant that service under § 1608(a)(3) requires a signed returned receipt, a standard method for ensuring delivery to the addressee. Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 1096 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “certified mail” as “[m]ail for which the sender requests proof of delivery in the form of a receipt signed by the addressee”). 
160	tidelands	"""We find no basis for petitioners' restriction of this term from its more common meaning, i.e., that 'tidelands' are lands 'over which the tide ebbs and flows ... land as is affected by the tide.' Black's Law Dictionary 1329 (5th ed. 1979)."" "
161	damages	At the time Hughes was decided, damages were understood only as compensation for injury. See T. Blount, Law–Dictionary (1670) (Blount) (unpaginated) (defining “damages” as “a recompense for what the Plaintiff or Demandant hath suffered, by means of the wrong done him by the Defendant or Tenant”) (emphasis added)
162	scrip	In the 1930's, “scrip” could refer to “[c]ertificates of ownership, either absolute or conditional, of shares in a public company, corporate profits, etc.” Black's Law Dictionary, at 1588; C. Alsager, Dictionary of Business Terms 321 (1932) (“A certificate which represents fractions of shares of stock”); 3 F. Stroud, Judicial Dictionary 1802 (2d ed. 1903) (“a [c]ertificate, transferable by delivery, entitling its holder to become a Shareholder or Bondholder in respect of the shares or bonds therein mentioned”).
163	carry arms or weapons	On definitions, “carry” in legal formulations could mean, inter alia, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be infectious, or wear or bear on one's person.
164	gift enterprise	Thus, a ‘gift enterprise’ *215 has been defined to be ‘a scheme for the division or distribution of certain articles of property, to be determined by chance, amongst those who have taken shares in the scheme.’ Bouvier's Law Dict. (Rawle's Rev.) p. 884; Black's Law Dict. p. 539; Anderson's Law Dict. p. 488. See also Lohman v. State, 81 Ind. 15, 17; Winston ston v. Beeson, 135 N. C. 271, 279, 65 L.R.A. 167, 47 S. E. 457; Randle v. State, 42 Tex. 580
165	condition precedent	A condition precedent is one which must happen or be performed before the estate to which it is annexed can vest’ or which must be performed ‘before some right dependent thereon accrues.
166	Market value'	“The market value of ... a  piece of property is the price which it might be expected to bring if offered for sale in a fair market; not the price which might be obtained on a sale at public auction or a sale forced by the necessities of the owner, but such a price as would be fixed by negotiation and mutual agreement, after ample time to find a purchaser, as between a vendor who is willing (but not compelled) to sell and a purchaser who desires to buy but is not compelled to take the particular ... piece of property.” Black's Law Dictionary 971 (6th ed. 1990).
167	willful	"""The Court seems to rely in part on 'common usage' of the word 'willful' in adopting the 'knowing or reckless' standard, citing Roget's International Thesaurus...The Court fails to acknowledge, however, that the dictionary includes a wide variety of definitions of 'willful,' ranging from 'malicious' to 'not accidental,' and including precisely the intermediate definition urged by the Secretary—under which an act is willful if it is 'done without ground for believing it is lawful.' Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979)"" "
168	public domain 	"""Although the phrase 'public domain' appears infrequently in our precedents, this Court has used it interchangeably with references to 'public land[s].' Black's Law Dictionary 1229 (6th ed. 1990) defines the public domain as “[l]and and water in possession of and owned by the United States and the states individually."" "
169	relate to	"""Under the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'relate to,' § 1144(a) pre-empts all state laws that ‘stand in some relation’ to, 'have bearing or concern’ on, ‘pertain’ to, ‘refer’ to, or 'bring into association with or connection with’ an ERISA plan"" (quoting Black's Law Dict.)"
170	testimony	The Court's use of the label “nontestimonial” is meaningful, for “[t]estimony properly means only such evidence as is delivered by a witness . . . , (either orally or in the form of affidavits or depositions.” Black's Law Dictionary 1324 (5th ed. 1979). Testimony is a statement of knowledge or belief by a witness as opposed to the mere display of a physical characteristic.
171	dismissal without prejudice	[Thus, Black's Law Dictionary] defines “dismissal without prejudice” as “[a] dismissal that *506 does not bar the plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit within the applicable limitations period,” ibid.
172	any	The word “any” is of no help because all speakers (including writers and legislators) who use general words such as “all,” “any,” “never,” and “none” normally rely upon context to indicate the limits of time **850 and place within which they intend those words to do their linguistic work.
173	constructive possession	Constructive possession is established when a person, though lacking such physical custody, still has the power and intent to exercise control over the object. See Black's 1047; 2A O'Malley § 39.12, at 55.
174	Public Accommodation 	 Although definitions between jurisdictions vary, a company ordinarily is a place of public accommodation if it provides “lodging, food, entertainment, or other services to the public ... in general.” Black's Law Dictionary 20 (11th ed. 2019) (defining “public accommodation”); accord, 42 U.S. C. § 2000a(b)(3) (covering places of “entertainment”). 
175	Insanity	“[T]he divergence between law and psychiatry is caused in part by the legal fiction represented by the words ‘insanity’ or ‘insane,’ which are a kind of lawyer's catchall and have no clinical meaning.” J. Biggs, The Guilty Mind 117 (1955); see also 2 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 1590 (8th ed. 1914) (“The legal and the medical ideas of insanity are essentially different, and the difference is one of substance”).
176	privies	The term ‘privies' is not confined to persons interested in real estate (3 Tomlin, Law Dict. 218; 2 Bouv. 382), nor is it true that only the same parties, eo nomine, are bound by a judgment.
177	tort	Moreover, common-law damages actions of the sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty, and it is difficult to say that such actions do not impose “requirements or prohibitions.” See W. Prosser, Law of Torts 4 (4th ed. 1971); Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “tort” as “always [involving] a violation of some duty owing to plaintiff”).
178	notwithstanding	"""The ordinary meaning of 'notwithstanding' is 'in spite of,' or 'without prevention or obstruction from or by.'"" (then cites to both Ordinary and Legal D)  "
179	compromise	A compromise as defined by Mr. Justice Bouvier in his valuable Law Dictionary, is 'an agreement between two or more persons who, to avoid a lawsuit, settle their differences on such terms as they can agree upon.'
180	jurisdiction	Thus, under the plain terms of the 1905 Compact, each State had “jurisdiction”—the “authority of a sovereign power to govern or legislate,” Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language 806 (1898)—over wharfing out on “its own side of the river.”
181	Lien	A lien typically is imposed on the property of another for payment of a debt owed by that other. See Black's Law Dictionary 922 (6th ed.1990).
182	"""contributing cause"""	 Taken literally, its “contributing-cause” test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or omission that makes a positive incremental contribution *218 , however small, to a particular result. See Brief for State of Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black's Law Dictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) **892 (defining “contributing cause” as “[a] factor that—though not the primary cause—plays a part in producing a result”).
183	based upon, base, based	"In denoting conduct that forms the 'basis,' or 'foundation,' for a claim, see Black's Law Dictionary 151 (6th ed. 1990) (defining 'base'); Random House Dictionary 172 (2d ed. 1987) (same); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 180, 181 (1976) (defining 'base'  and 'based'), the phrase is read most naturally to mean those elements of a claim that, if proven, would entitle a plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case."" "
184	doctrine of laches 	The defense of laches “requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense.” Costello v. United States, 365 U.S. 265, 282, 81 S.Ct. 534, 543, 5 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961); see also Black's Law Dictionary 875 (6th ed. 1990) (“ ‘Doctrine of laches,’ is based upon maxim that equity aids the vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights. It is defined as neglect to assert a right or claim which, taken together with lapse of time and other circumstances causing prejudice to the adverse party, operates as bar in court of equity”). 
185	Disgorgement	Disgorgement as a remedy in its own right is also absent from legal publications until the 20th century. Leading legal dictionaries did not define the term until the turn of the 20th century. See, e.g., Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 143 (1996); Black's Law Dictionary 480 (7th ed. 1999).
186	efficient	Moreover, the word “efficient,” which was defined as “characterized by effective activity,” may have been intended to require an effective remedy. See Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 819 (2d ed. 1934).
187	tolled	 The dictionary informs that to “toll” means “[t]o take away, bar, defeat, [or] annul.” See 18 Oxford English Dictionary 204 (2d ed. 1989); Webster's New International Dictionary 2662 (2d ed. 1957) (“[t]o take away; to vacate; to annul”); Oxford Latin Dictionary 1947 (1982) ( “tollere,” the Latin origin, means to “remove” or “lift”). So when a statute speaks of tolling a limitations period it can, naturally enough, mean either that the running of the limitations period is suspended or that the effect of the limitations period is defeated. 
188	bailment	A prisoner's voluntary decision to deliver property for transfer to another facility, for example, bears a greater similarity to a “bailment”—the delivery of personal property after being held by the prison in trust, see American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 134—than to a “detention.”
189	garnishment	That suit related to a Maine attachment law which, of course, is governed by the same rule as garnishment law. See ‘garnishment,’ Bouvier's Law Dictionary
190	specifically	Specifically” can mean “explicitly, particularly, [or] definitely,” Black's Law Dictionary 1398 (6th ed.1990), thereby contrasting a specific reference with an implicit reference made by more general language to a broader topic. 
191	remedy	a remedy is the means employed to enforce a right or redress an injury. Bouvier's Law Dictionary.
192	Judgment	"A ""judgment"" is ""[a] court's final determination of the rights and obligation of the parties in a case."" Black's Law Dictionary 1007 (11th ed. 2019); see also 1 H. Black, Law of Judgments 1, p. 2, n. l (1891) (""'A judgment is the final consideration and determination of a court... upon the matters submitted to it'"")."
193	necessary	"""In the strictest sense of the term, something is 'necessary' only if it is essential... But in ordinary speech, the term is often used more loosely to refer to something that is merely important or strongly desired… the term is sometimes used in a similar way in the law."""
194	forged, counterfeit	One would not expect general-usage dictionaries to have a separate entry for “falsely made,” but some of them do use precisely the phrase “to make falsely” to define “forged.” See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 990 (2d ed. (1945); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 891 (1961). 
195	Disclosure	These statutes only prohibit “disclos [ure],” 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(c); 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. § 5703(2) (2000), and one cannot “disclose” what is already in the public domain. See Black's Law Dictionary 477 (7th ed.1999) (defining “disclosure” as “[t]he act or process of making known something that was previously unknown; a revelation of facts”); *547 S.Rep. No. 1097, at 93, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, pp. 2112, 2181 (“The disclosure of the contents of an intercepted communication that had already become ‘public information’ or ‘common knowledge’ would not be prohibited”).
196	fraud	"""The common law of fraud confirms this characterization of Canada's right to excise taxes. Consistent with that understanding, fraud at common law included a scheme to deprive a victim of his entitlement to money. For instance, a debtor who concealed his assets when settling debts with his creditors thereby committed common-law fraud."" at 356."
197	participate	It seems that Congress chose a middle ground, consistent with a common understanding of the word “participate”—“to take part in.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1646 (1976).
198	interest	Most legal dictionaries of the era of the National Bank Act did not place such a limitation upon “interest.” See, e.g., 1 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 652 (6th ed. 1856) (“The compensation which is paid by the borrower to the lender or by the debtor to the creditor for ... use [of money]”); 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 90 (2d ed. 1860); 11 American and English Encyclopedia of Law 379 (J. Merrill ed. 1890). But see J. Wharton, Law Lexicon or Dictionary of Jurisprudence 391 (2d Am. ed. 1860). 
199	bailment	A bailment is the “delivery of personal property by one person (the bailor ) to another (the bailee ) who holds the property for a certain purpose.” Black's Law Dictionary 169 (10th ed. 2014); J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments § 2, p. 2 (1832) (“a bailment is a delivery of a thing in trust for some special object or purpose, and upon a contract, expressed or implied, to conform to the object or purpose of the trust”). A bailee normally owes a legal duty to keep the item safe, according to the terms of the parties' contract if they have one, and according to the “implication[s] from their  conduct” if they don't. 8 C.J. S., Bailments § 36, pp. 468–469 (2017). 
200	Witness	A witness is one who “gives evidence in a cause.” T. Cunningham, 2 New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).
201	safe	The clause requires the charterer to designate a “safe” berth: That means a berth “free from harm or risk.” Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1030 (10th ed. 1994); see also New Oxford American Dictionary 1500 (E. Jewell & F. Abate eds. 2001) (“safe” means “protected from or not exposed to danger or risk”).
202	allision	An allision is “[t]he contact of a vessel with a stationary object such as an anchored vessel or a pier.” Black's Law Dictionary 94 (11th ed. 2019).
203	of	Of’ is a word of many meanings, one of which indicates ‘the thing or person whence anything originates, comes, is acquired or sought.’ 7 Oxford English Dictionary (definition III).
204	lien	At the time of the FSIA's adoption, “lien” was defined as a “charge or security or incumbrance upon property,” Black's Law Dictionary 1072
205	operation	The term “operations” connotes active and affirmative participation by the grant recipient, not merely inaction or failure to respond. See Black's Law Dictionary 1092 (6th ed.1990) (defining “operation” as an “[e]xertion of power; the process of operating or mode of action; an effect brought about in accordance with a definite plan; action; activity”).
206	context, poverty	“Context” here means the text of the Act of Congress surrounding the word at issue, or the texts of other related congressional Acts, and this is simply an instance of the word's ordinary meaning: “[t]he part or parts of a discourse preceding or following a ‘text’ or passage or a word, or so intimately associated with it as to throw light upon its meaning.” Webster's New International Dictionary 576 (2d ed. 1942). 
207	appropriate	Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word “appropriate” is inherently context dependent. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining “appropriate” as “specially suitable: FIT, PROPER”). The context here—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests, if anything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or “proper.” 
208	prevailing party	lack's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed.1999) defines “prevailing party” as “[a] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded <in certain cases, the court will award attorney's fees to the prevailing party>.—Also termed successful party.” 
209	sacrilege	A student of English lexicography would despair of finding the meaning attributed to ‘sacrilege’ by the New York court.(citing many dictionary definitions)
210	described in	"""But neither of those claims about the bare term 'described in' can resolve this case. Like many words, “describe” takes on different meanings in different contexts"" "
211	habeas corpus	“Prosecution,” as Blackstone used the term, referred to “instituting a criminal suit,” id., at *309, by filing a formal charging document—an indictment, presentment, or information—upon which the defendant was to be tried in a court with power to punish the alleged offense. And, significantly, Blackstone's usage appears to have accorded with the ordinary meaning of the term. See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (defining “prosecution” as “[t]he institution or commencement and continuance of a criminal suit; the process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender *222 before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment,” and noting that “[p]rosecutions may be by presentment, information or indictment”).
212	personal injury	"""Under the American decisional law, the phrase ‘personal injury’ denotes primarily an injury to the body of a person. At least some of the courts, however, have not narrowly limited the term, and have concluded that a personal injury or an injury to the person, within the meaning of the law, does not necessarily involve physical contact with the person injured or mere bodily or physical injuries, but may embrace all actionable injuries to the individual himself.” 1 S. Speiser, C. Krause, & A. Gans, American Law of Torts 6 (1983) See also Black's Law Dictionary 786 (6th ed. 1990). -"
213	assessment	n its numerous uses throughout the Code, it is clear that the term “assessment” refers to little more than the calculation or recording of a tax liability. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 6201 (assessment authority); § 6203 (method of assessment); § 6204 (supplemental assessments); 26 CFR § 601.103 (2003). See also Black's Law Dictionary 111 (7th ed.1999) (defining “assessment” as the “[d]etermination of the [tax] rate or amount of something, such as a tax or damages”). “
214	design	In this context, “design” means purpose or plan; i.e., the intended aim of the transportation. See Am. Hert. 491 (“[t]o formulate a plan for; devise”; “[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or effect”); Black's 478 (“[a] plan or scheme”; “[p]urpose or intention combined with a plan”); see also Brief for United States 14 (“ ‘to conceive and plan out in the mind’ ” (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 611 (1993))).
215	sole	“Sole” is defined as “having no companion,” “solitary,” “being the only one,” and “functioning ... independently and without assistance or interference.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2168 (1971).
216	cognizable by, has jurisdiction 	"""The two linguistic forms ('cognizable by'; 'has jurisdiction') mean about the same thing. See Black's Law Dictionary 991 (4th ed.1951) (defining 'jurisdiction' as 'the authority by which courts and judicial officers take cognizance of and decide cases' (emphasis added)); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1038 (3d ed.1933) (similarly using the term 'cognizance' to define 'jurisdiction')."
217	smuggler	n Burns' Law Dictionary (1792) smugglers are said to be ‘those who conceal prohibited goods and defraud the king of his customs on the seacoast by running of goods and merchandise.’ 
218	take	To “take,” when applied to wild animals, means to reduce those animals, by killing or capturing, to human control. See, e.g., 11 Oxford English Dictionary (1933) (“Take ... To catch, capture (a wild beast, bird, fish, etc.)”); Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language (2d ed. 1949) (take defined as “to catch or capture by trapping, snaring, etc., or as prey”)
219	available	"""As we explained in Booth, the ordinary meaning of the word “available” is “ ‘capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose,’ and that which ‘is accessible or may be obtained.’"" at 1859"
220	Redeem	It reduces the value of a lienholder's equitable interest in a debtor's property to the property's liquidation value, but it does not insure the debtor an opportunity to “redeem” the property at that price, i.e., to “free [the] property ... from [the] mortgage or pledge by paying the debt for which it stood as security.” Black's Law Dictionary 1278 (6th ed. 1990).
221	sale	"""To put the same fairly obvious point in the language of the regulations of § 3(k) of the FLSA, the detailer does not 'sell' anything to the doctor."" Christopher v. Smithkline Beechman Corp., 567 U.S. 142, 172, 132 S.Ct. 2156, 2176 (2012) (Breyer, J., dissenting). "
222	evidence	Further, it appears that the phrases “gives evidence” and “furnishes evidence” were not simply descriptions of the act of providing testimony. For example, in King v. Purnell, 1 Black. 37, 96 Eng. Rep. 20 (K.B.1748), the phrase “furnish evidence” is repeatedly used to refer to the compelled production of books, records, and archives in response to a government request. Id., at 40, 41, 42, 96 Eng. Rep., at 21, 22, 23. See also, e.g., King v. Cornelius, 2 Str. 1210, 1211, 93 Eng. Rep. 1133, 1134 (K.B.1744) (compelling discovery of books “is in effect obliging a defendant ... to furnish evidence against himself”); 1 T. Cunningham, New and Complete Law–Dictionary (2d ed. 1771) (evidence “signifies generally all proof, be it testimony of men, records or writings”); 1 G. Jacob, The Law–Dictionary (T. Tomlins ed. 1797) (defining “evidence” as “[p]roof by testimony of witnesses, on oath; or by writings or records”).
223	threat, threaten	"""According to Elonis, every definition of t'hreat' or 'threaten' conveys the notion of an intent to inflict harm. Brief for Petitioner...These definitions, however, speak to what the statement conveys—not to the mental state of the author."" at 733."
224	harm	The dictionary definition of the verb form of “harm” is “to cause hurt or damage to: injure.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1034 (1966).
225	appoint	When the President “direct[s]” someone to serve as an officer pursuant to the FVRA, he is “appoint[ing]” that person as an “officer of the United States” within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. Around the time of the framing, the verb “appoint” meant “[t]o establish anything by decree,” 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language *313 (def. 3) (6th ed. 1785); T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (To Appoint) (6th ed. 1796), or “[t]o allot, assign, or designate,” 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (def. 3) (1828). When the President “direct [s]” a person to serve as an acting officer, he is “assign[ing]” or “designat [ing]” that person to serve as an officer.
226	Interested	In Bouvier's Law Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 651, ‘interest’ is defined: ‘The benefit which a person has in the matter about to be decided and which is in issue between the parties. By the term ‘benefit’ is here understood some pecuniary or other advantage, which, if obtained, would increase the witness's estate, or some loss which would decrease it.' In Black's Law Dictionary the definition is (p. 636): ‘A relation to the matter in controversy, or to the issue of the suit, in the nature of a prospective gain or loss, which actually does, or presumably might, create a bias or prejudice in the mind, inclining the person to favor one side or the other.’
227	Excusable neglect	According to Black's Law Dictionary 566 (6th ed. 1990), “excusable neglect” is: “[A] failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in consequence of the party's own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident, or reliance on the care and vigilance of his counsel or on promises made by the adverse party. As used in rule (e.g. Fed.R.Civil P. 6(b)) authorizing court to permit an act to be done after expiration of the time within which under the rules such act was required to be done, where failure to act was the result of ‘excusable neglect’, quoted phrase is ordinarily *403 understood to be the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances.”
228	arms	One 18th-century dictionary defined “arms” as “[w]eapons of offence, or armour of defence,” 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (1755), and another contemporaneous source explained that “[b]y arms, we understand those instruments of offence generally made use of in war; such as firearms, swords, &c. 
229	making	The making of the bond would seem to be the writing of it
230	Banishment	In 1 Rap. & L. Law Dict. p. 109, ‘banishment’ is thus defined: ‘A punishment by forced exile, either for years or for life, inflicted principally upon political offenders; ‘transportation’ being the word used to express a similar punishment of ordinary criminals.'
231	assessed valuation	By contrast, an “assessed valuation” is the “[v]alue on each unit of which a prescribed amount must be paid as property taxes.” Id., at 149, 115 S.Ct. 557.
232	amicus curiae	"""The most common definition of 'amicus curiae' is '[a] person with a strong interest in or views on the subject matter of an action [who] petition[s] the court for permission to file a brief … to suggest a rationale consistent with its own views."""
233	cognizable	"Cognizable ordinarily means '[c]apable of being tried or examined before a designated tribunal; within [the] jurisdiction of [a] court or power given to [a] court to adjudicate [a] controversy.' Black's Law Dictionary 259 (6th ed. 1990)."" "
234	Suit	Bouvier's Law Dictionary says that in the practice of the law ‘suit’ means ‘an action.’
235	Entitle	Both in legal and general usage, the normal meaning of entitlement includes a right or benefit for which a person qualifies, and it does not depend upon whether the right has been acknowledged or adjudicated. It means only that the person satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right. See generally Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (discussing property interests protected by the Due Process Clause and contrasting an entitlement to an expectancy); Black's Law Dictionary 532 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “entitle” as “To qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming”).
236	relief	""" Texas also highlights Congress' choice of the word 'relief,' which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief. See Black's Law Dictionary 1293 (7th ed.1999)"" "
237	fine	A “fine signifieth a percuniarie punishment for an offence, or a contempt committed against the king.” 1 E. Coke, Institutes *126b. The second edition of Cunningham's Law–Dictionary, published in 1771, defined “fines for offences” as “amends, pecuniary punishment, or recompence for an offence committed against the King and his laws, or against the Lord of a manor.” 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law–Dictionary (unpaginated). See also 1 T. Tomlins, Law–Dictionary 796–799 (1836) (same); 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 525 (4th ed. 1852) (same).
238	continuance	A vacation is a different thing from a continuance, the result of an ordinary adjournment.
239	punishment	" 'Punishment' does not necessarily imply a culpable state of mind on the part of an identifiable punisher. A prisoner may experience punishment when he suffers 'severe, rough, or disastrous treatment' regardless of whether a state actor intended the cruel treatment to chastise or deter."" "
240	series-qualifier canon	That interpretive practice of applying the modifier to the whole list boasts a fancy name—the “series-qualifier canon,” see Black's Law Dictionary 1574 (10th ed. 2014)—but, as my opening examples show, it reflects the completely ordinary way that people speak and listen, write and read.
241	sentence	They need only both be subsumed under the term “sentence,” which, for the reasons previously stated, they are. See Black's Law Dictionary, at 1362 (defining “sentence” as a judgment imposing punishment, which may include “a fine, incarceration, or probation”).
242	knowledge, knowingly	“[K]nowledge” and “knowingly” are normally associated **2136 with awareness, understanding, or consciousness. See Black's Law Dictionary 888 (8th ed.2004) (hereinafter Black's); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1252–1253 (1993) (hereinafter Webster's 3d); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1981) (hereinafter Am. Hert.).
243	accident	The term “accident” has at least two plausible yet distinct definitions. On the one hand, as noted in Saks, “accident” may be defined as an unintended event. See Webster's New World College Dictionary 8 (4th ed.1999) (“a happening that is not ... intended”); see also American Heritage Dictionary 10 (4th ed.2000) (“[l]ack of intention; chance”); Saks, 470 U.S., at 400, 105 S.Ct. 1338. On the other hand, as noted in Saks, the term “accident” may be defined as an event that is “unusual” or “unexpected,” whether the result of intentional action or not. Ibid. See Black's Law Dictionary 15 (6th ed.1990) (“an unusual, fortuitous, unexpected, unforeseen, or unlooked for event, happening or occurrence” and “if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens”); see also American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 10 (“[a]n unexpected and undesirable event,” “[a]n unforeseen incident”).
244	seizure	From the time of the founding to the present, the word “seizure” has meant a “taking possession,” 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 67 (1828); 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 510 (6th ed. 1856); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2057 (1981).
245	Matter	The word “matter” simply means “an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,” Black's Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014)—a term that could readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation.
246	punitive damages	"""Legal dictionaries in existence when the FTCA was drafted and enacted indicate that “punitive damages” were commonly understood to be damages awarded to punish defendants for torts committed with fraud, actual malice, violence, or oppression."" "
247	actual knowledge	When Congress passed ERISA, the word “actual” meant what it means today: “existing in fact or reality.” Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 10 (1967); accord, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 13 (11th ed. 2005) (same); see also American Heritage Dictionary 14 (1973) (“In existence; real; factual”); id., at 18 (5th ed. 2011) (“Existing in reality and not potential, possible, simulated, or false”). So did the word “knowledge,” which meant and still means “the fact or condition of being aware of something.” Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 469 (1967); accord, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 691 (2005) (same); see also American Heritage Dictionary 725 (1973) (“Familiarity, awareness, or understanding gained through experience or study”); id., at 973 (2011) (same). Thus, to have “actual knowledge” of a piece of information, one must in fact be aware of it.
248	division	"""There is no dispute that the district is a political subdivision of the State of Texas in the ordinary sense of the term."""
249	address	And the noun “address,” in the sense relevant here, means “the designation of a place (as a residence or place of business) where a person or organization may be found or communicated with.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 25 (1971) (Webster's Third); see also Webster's Second New International Dictionary 30 (1957) (“the name or description of a place of residence, business, etc., where a person may be found or communicated with”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 17 (1966) (“the place or the name of the place where a person, organization, or the like is located or may be reached”); American Heritage Dictionary 15 (1969) (“[t]he location at which a particular organization or person may be found or reached”); Oxford English Dictionary 106 (1933) (OED) (“the name of the place to which any one's letters are directed”). 
250	Prima facie evidence'	Typically, “prima facie evidence” is defined as: “Such evidence as, in the judgment of the law, is sufficient to establish a given fact ... and which if not rebutted or contradicted, will remain sufficient. [Such evidence], if unexplained or uncontradicted, is sufficient to sustain a judgment in favor of the issue which it supports, but [it] may be contradicted by other evidence.” Black's Law Dictionary 1190 (6th ed.1990).
251	boycott	It seems clear to me, however, that the “boycott, coercion, or intimidation” language of § 3(b) was intended to refer, not to the practices defined and condemned by the Sherman Act, but to the narrower range of practices involved in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440, the case that prompted Congress to enact the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
252	Foreign	‘Foreign’ (Burrill's Law Dict., ‘Foreign’) means ‘that which is without or beyond the limits of a particular territory,’ as the Western lakes are beyond the limits of a particular State.
253	Request	In everyday speech, the closest synonyms of the verb “request” are “ask,” “petition,” and “entreat.” See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 1929 (3d ed. 1981); Black's Law Dictionary 1172 (5th ed. 1979). There is little reason to think that Congress did not intend “request” to bear its most common meaning when it used the word in § 1915(d). Although “request” may double for “demand” or “command” when it is used as a noun, particularly when employed as a term of art in connection with wills, trusts, and probate proceedings, its ordinary and natural signification when used as a verb was precatory when Congress enacted the provision now appearing at 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) in 1892. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 1027 (1st ed. 1891); 2 B. Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English Jurisprudence 415 (1879); 7 Judicial and Statutory Definitions of Words and Phrases 6120–6122 (West 1905).
254	"""To procure"""	In ordinary usage, “to procure” something is “to get possession of” it. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1809 (2002); accord, Black's Law Dictionary 1401 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “procure” as “[t]o obtain (something), esp. by special effort or means”). So to “procure ... naturalization” means to obtain naturalization (or, to use another word, citizenship).
255	right	 A 'right' is '[a] power, privilege, or immunity guaranteed under a constitution, statutes or decisional laws, or claimed as a result of long usage.' Black's Law Dictionary 1189 *702 (5th ed. 1979). 
256	provide for	When applied to a document such as a contract, “provides for” is “most natural[ly]” read and is “commonly understood” to mean “ ‘make a provision for.’ ” Rake v. Wade, 508 U.S. 464, 473, 474, 113 S.Ct. 2187, 2192–2193, 124 L.Ed.2d 424 (1993) (interpreting a section of the Bankruptcy Code that applies to “ ‘each allowed secured claim provided for by the [reorganization] plan’ ”) (emphasis added). See also Black's Law Dictionary 1224 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “provide” as “[t]o make, procure, or furnish for future use, prepare”). 
257	for	That interpretation is inconsistent with ordinary English usage and is incompatible with the rest of the statute. To be sure, “for” can sometimes mean “in preparation for or anticipation of.” 6 Oxford English Dictionary 24 (2d ed. 1989). But “for” can also mean “[d]uring [or] throughout,” id., at 26, as well as “with the object or purpose of,” id., at 23; see also American Heritage Dictionary 709 (3d ed. 1992) (“Used to indicate the object, aim, or purpose of an action or activity”; “Used to indicate amount, extent, or duration”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 747 (2d ed. 1987) (“with the object or purpose of”; “during the continuance of”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 886 (1993) (“with the purpose or object of”; “to the ... duration of”). And here, only that second set of definitions makes sense in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole.
258	in relation to	According to Webster's, “in relation to” means “with reference to” or “as regards.” Webster's New International *238 Dictionary, at 2102.
259	bear	At the time of the founding, as now, to “bear” meant to “carry.” See Johnson 161; Webster; T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1796); 2 Oxford English Dictionary 20 (2d ed.1989) (hereinafter Oxford). When used with “arms,” however, the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for a particular purpose—confrontation.
260	rate,price	The standard dictionary definition of the term “rate” (as used with reference to prices) is “[a]n amount paid or charged for a good or service.” Black's Law Dictionary 1452 (10th ed. 2014); see, e.g., 13 Oxford English Dictionary 208–209 (2d ed. 1989) (“rate” means “price,” “cost,” or “sum paid or asked for a ... thing”). 
261	collateral review	This usage buttresses the conclusion that “collateral review” means a form of review that is not part of the direct appeal process.
262	"""elements of the offense"" "	The term “elements of the offense” means  “constituent parts of a crime ... that the prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.” Black's Law Dictionary 597 (9th ed.2009). 
263	Misprision	All the definitions of misprision imply such a personal knowledge of the fact as would be legal evidence. 4 Jac. Law Dict. 295; Staundf. P. C. lib. 1, c. 19; Hawk. P.C. c. 20, § 4; 1 Hale's P. C. 375; Termes de la Ley 291; 3 Inst. 36; 1 Chitty's Crim. Law, 2.
264	incumbrance	“incumbrance” was defined as “[a]ny right to, or interest in, land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its value,” id., at 908. 
265	levy	"""…one might look to contemporaneous dictionaries, which defined “levy” as the legislative function of laying or imposing a tax and the executive functions of assessing, recording, and collecting the amount a taxpayer owes. See Black's Law Dictionary 1093 (3d ed. 1933)"""
266	scope of employment	The phrase “scope of employment” is a well-known common-law concept that includes “[t]he range of reasonable and foreseeable activities that an employee engages in while carrying out the employer's business.” Black's Law Dictionary 1465 (9th ed. 2009).
267	violent	Even by itself, the word “violent” in § 924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Webster's Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement ... ”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.1989) ( “[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength”); Black's 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force”).
268	Alien	An alien has been defined to be ‘one born out of the jurisdiction of the United States, and who has not been naturalized under their Constitution anl laws.’ 2 Kent, Com. 50; 1 Bouvier's Law Dict. 129.
269	base,basis	"""To 'base' means '[t]o make, form, or serve as a foundation for,' or '[t]o use (something) as the thing from which something else is developed.' Black's Law Dictionary 180 (10th ed. 2014)."" "
270	Matter	A “matter” is “a subject under consideration, esp. involving a dispute or litigation” or “[s]omething *580 that is to be tried or proved; an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.” Black's Law Dictionary 992 (7th ed. 1999); The Oxford English Dictionary 481 (2d ed. 1989) (“matter” means “[a]n event, circumstance, fact, question, state or course of things, etc., which is or may be an object of consideration or practical concern; a subject, an affair, a business”); seeante, at 1775 – 1776 (embracing this view). 
271	cy pres	In the class action context, cy pres refers to the practice of distributing settlement funds not amenable to individual claims or meaningful pro rata distribution to nonprofit organizations whose work is determined to indirectly benefit class members. Black's Law Dictionary 470 (10th ed. 2014).
272	punishment	"""'[P]unishment,' from the tie of the Founding through the present day, 'has always meant . . ."" "
273	presentment	The first was presentment, which, like an indictment, was a grand jury's formal accusation “of an offence, inquirable in the Court where it [was] presented.” 5 G. Jacob, The Law–Dictionary 278–279 (1811).
274	require,prohibition	he dictionary definitions of these terms suggest, if *536 anything, specific actions mandated or disallowed by a formal governing authority. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1929 (1981) (defining “require” as “to ask for authoritatively or imperatively: claim by right and authority” and “to demand as necessary or essential (as on general principles or in order to comply with or satisfy some regulation)”); Black's Law Dictionary 1212 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “prohibition” as an “[a]ct or law prohibiting something”; an “interdiction”).
275	Provisional attachment	These legal terms of art refer to formal procedures by which one person gains a degree of control over property otherwise subject to the control of another, and generally involve some form of judicial authorization. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 123 (7th ed.1999) (defining “provisional attachment” as a “prejudgment attachment in which the debtor's property is seized so that if the creditor ultimately prevails, the creditor will be assured of recovering on the judgment .... 
276	seek	"""I think it quite possible, particularly in light of the constitutional concerns identified by Justice Thomas, that the phrase 'seek to administer' in the statute requires that the covered jurisdiction exercise discretion or pursue its own policy aims before the obligation to preclear a voting change arises."" See 14 Oxford English Dictionary 877 (2d ed.1989) (defining “seek,” inter alia, as “[t]o make it one's aim, to try or attempt to (do something)”)."
277	law enforcement	"""The ordinary understanding of law enforcement includes not just the investigation and prosecution of offenses that have already been committed, but also proactive steps designed to prevent criminal activity and to maintain security. "
278	act of bankruptcy	And in the same work ‘an act of bankruptcy’ is defined to be ‘an act the commission of which by a debtor renders him liable to be adjudged a bankrupt.
279	mineral	The term ‘minerals' used in an act of Parliament, reserving to the lord all mines and minerals, ... in its proper sense includes all fossil bodies or matters dug out of mines; ... and mines, according to Jacob's Law Dictionary, are quarries or places where anything is digged
280	felonious	Second, as the above quotations indicate, the taking in a robbery had to be 'felonious,' a common-law term of art signifying an intent to steal.
281	Coram Non Judice	“Every order thereafter made in that court [is] coram non judice,” meaning “not before a judge.” Steamship Co. v. Tugman, 106 U.S. 118, 122, 1 S.Ct. 58, 27 L.Ed. 87 (1882); Black's Law Dictionary 426 (11th ed. 2019). See also 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, J. Steinman, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3736, pp. 727–729 (2018).
282	aggravated	An “aggravated” offense is one “made worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another crime.” Id., at 75, 127 S.Ct. 625. 
283	party,intervention	A “party” to litigation is “[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought.” Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed.2004). An individual may also become a “party” to a lawsuit by intervening in the action. See id., at 840 (defining “intervention” as “[t]he legal procedure by which ... a third party is allowed to become a party to the litigation”). 
284	also	“Also” is defined as “likewise,” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 75 (1991), or “in like manner,” Black's Law Dictionary 77 (6th ed.1990).
285	law enforcement officer	"A 'law enforcement officer' is defined as one 'whose duty it is to preserve the peace,' Black's Law Dictionary 796 (5th D.C.)..."" "
286	Business	‘Business' is a very comprehensive term and embraces everything about which a person can be employed. Black's Law Dict. 158, citing People ex rel. Hoyt v. Tax Comrs. 23 N. Y. 242, 244. ‘That which occupies the time, attention, and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or profit.’ 1 Bouvier's Law Dict. p. 273.
287	discharge	"""'Discharge' can be used to signify various means of extinguishing a legal duty. See generally Black's Law Dictionary 463 (6th ed. 1990)"" "
288	Conviction	It is certainly correct that the word “conviction” can mean either the finding of guilt or the entry of a final judgment on that finding. The word has many other meanings as well, including “[a]ct of convincing of error, or of compelling the admission of a truth”; “[s]tate of being convinced; esp., state of being convicted of sin, or by one's conscience”; “[a] strong persuasion or belief; as, to live up to one's convictions; an intensity of thorough conviction. ” Webster's New International Dictionary 584 (2d ed. 1950).
289	law enforcement agency	Similarly, a “law-enforcement *583 agency” is charged with “the apprehension of alleged offenders as well as crime detection and prevention.” R. De Sol, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis added).
290	file, filed	The word 'file' is derived from the Latin word 'filum,' and relates to the ancient practice of placing papers on a thread or wire for safe-keeping and ready reference. Filing, it must be observed, is not complete until the document is delivered and received. 'Shall file' means to deliver to the office, and not send through the United States mails. A paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper official and by him received and filed.
291	amoritization plan	It refers to a dictionary that defines an amortization plan as ‘one where there are partial payments of the principal, and accrued interest, at stated periods for a definite time, at the expiration of which the entire indebtedness will be extinguished.'
292	debentures 	During the summer and early fall of 2009, Waste2Energy hired Lorenzo's firm, Charles Vista, to sell to investors $15 million worth of debentures, a form of “debt secured only by the debtor's earning power, not by a lien on any specific asset,” Black's Law Dictionary 486 (10th ed. 2014).
293	Vacation	A vacation is defined by Bouvier to be the period of time between the end of one term and the beginning of another.
294	activity	That the statutory phrase uses the term “solicitation” in a more general sense that includes not merely the ultimate act of inviting an order but the entire process associated with the invitation is suggested by the fact that § 381 describes “the solicitation of orders” as a subcategory, not of in-state acts, but rather of in-state “business activities ”-a term that more naturally connotes courses of conduct. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 22 (1981) (defining “activity” as “an occupation, pursuit, or recreation in which a person is active-often used in pl. <business activities>”).
295	force	“Force” means “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing,” Black's Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999), or “unlawful violence threatened or committed against persons or property,” Random House Dictionary of the English Language 748 (2d ed. 1987).
296	Use	From the dawn of English common law through the present, the word “use” has been employed to refer to various forms of trust arrangements. See 1 G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees § 2, p. 9 (1935); Black's Law Dictionary 1382 (5th ed. 1979) (“Uses and trusts are not so much different things as different aspects of the same subject. A use regards principally the beneficial interest; a trust regards principally the nominal ownership”).
297	adminstrative	"""As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 1402, the word 'administrative' is more capacious, potentially reaching not only federal, state, and local government sources but also disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979)"" "
298	moral turpitude	Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawles Third Revision, p. 2247, defines ‘moral turpitude’ as ‘an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.’
299	Confidential	The term “confidential” meant then, as it does now, “private” or “secret.” Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 174 (1963).Contemporary dictionaries suggest two conditions that might be required for information communicated to another to be considered confidential. In one sense, information communicated to another remains confidential whenever it is customarily kept private, or at least closely held, by the person imparting it. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 476 (1961) (“known only to a limited few” or “not publicly disseminated”); Black's Law Dictionary 370 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (“intended to be held in confidence or kept secret”).  
300	personnel management	“Personnel management” is similarly “the phase of management concerned with the engagement and effective utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of human resources.” Webster's 1687. 
301	smuggling	Indeed, the word 'smuggling,' as used, carries with it the implication of knowledge.
302	Under	With respect to subparagraph (E), the statutory context makes clear that the prepositional phrase—“under section 1311”—is most naturally read to mean that the effluent limitation or other limitation must be approved or promulgated “pursuant to” or “by reason of the authority of” § 1311. See St. Louis Fuel and Supply Co., Inc. v. FERC, 890 F.2d 446, 450 (C.A.D.C.1989) (R.B. Ginsburg, J.) (“ ‘under’ means ‘subject [or pursuant] to’ or ‘by reason of the authority of’ ”); cf. Black's Law Dictionary 1368 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “under” as “according to”). 
303	Relief	Though § 1259 does not define the term [relief], its familiar meaning encompasses any “redress or benefit” provided by a court. Black's Law Dictionary 1317 (8th ed.2004).
304	appellation of magistration	But the appellation of magistrate ‘is not confined to justices of the peace, and other persons, ejusdem generis, who exercise general judicial powers; but it includes others whose duties are strictly executive.’ Anderson's Law Dict. 643, 644. 
305	embargo	An embargo is a “ [g]overnment order prohibiting commercial trade with individuals or businesses of other nations.” Black's Law Dictionary 468 (5th ed. 1979). It is “[a] policy which prevents goods from entering a nation” and which “may be imposed on a product or on an individual country.” J. Berenyi, The Modern American Business Dictionary 103 (1982). 
306	felony	"""the term 'felony' is commonly defined to mean a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year."" at 130."
307	expiration	"""Indeed, this administrative use of the phrase fits well with the word 'expiration,' which in its most natural sense in this context refers to the close of a formal accounting period."" Barber v. Thomas, 560 U.S. 474, 497, 130 S.Ct. 2499, 2514 (2010) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). "
308	actual	The addition of “actual” in § 1113(2) signals that the plaintiff 's knowledge must be more than “potential, possible, virtual, conceivable, theoretical, hypothetical, or nominal.” Black's Law Dictionary 53 (4th ed. 1951). 
309	impede	The dictionary defines “impede” as “to interfere with or get in the way of the progress of” or “hold up” or “detract from.” Webster's 3d 1132.
310	elect,election	"""Section 30104 bestows upon the injured seaman the right to 'elect' to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice of actions for seamen - not an exclusive remedy."" Altantic Sounding Co., Inc. v. Townsend, 557 U.S. 404, 416, 129 S.Ct. 2561, 2570 (2009). "
311	jail	Jail is a “local government's detention center where persons awaiting trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.” Black's Law Dictionary 910 (9th ed. 2009).
312	entity	"""…'entity' typically refers to an organization, rather than an individual. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed.2009)."" at 315"
313	Recovery	Just as the words “person entitled to recovery” suggest greater breadth than “individual [who has sustained] actual damages,” so the term “recovery” ordinarily encompasses more than “ ‘get[ting] or win[ning] back,’ ” Brief for Respondent 26 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1898 (1966)). 
314	Obstruct	The statutory words “obstruct or impede” are broad. They can refer to anything that “block[s],” “make[s] difficult,” or “hinder[s].” Black's Law Dictionary 1246 (10th ed. 2014) (obstruct); Webster's New International Dictionary (Webster's) 1248 (2d ed. 1954) (impede); id., at 1682 (obstruct); accord, 5 Oxford English Dictionary 80 (1933) (impede); 7 id., at 36 (obstruct).
315	Use	“Use” is concededly “elastic,” Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 241, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (SCALIA, J., dissenting), but none of its standard definitions stretch far enough to reach Watson's conduct, see, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 2806 (2d ed.1939) (“to employ”); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2097 (2d ed.1987) (to “apply to one's own purposes”; “put into service; make use of”); Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed.1990) (“[t]o avail oneself of; ... to utilize”); see also Smith, supra, at 228–229, 113 S.Ct. 2050 (listing various dictionary definitions). 
316	alluvion	The common law as to rivers not navigable has adopted the civil law.3 Washburne on Real Property, *452; Angel on Watercourses, § 53; 1 Bouvier's Law Dictionary, title ‘Alluvion;’ 3 Kent, 428*.
317	alienate	 and to “alienate” is “[t]o convey; to transfer the title to property,”
318	intangible assets, tangible assets	"""Black's Law Dictionary tells us that intangible assets are amortized, while tangible assets are depreciated. Black's Law Dictionary 83, 441 (6th ed. 1990); see also Gregorcich, Amortization of Intangibles: A Reassessment of the Tax Treatment of Purchased Goodwill, 28 Tax Law. 251, 253 (1975) ('Amortization is the commonly accepted way of referring to depreciation of intangible property'). "
319	stare decisis	Stare decisis is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as meaning “to abide by, or adhere to, decided cases.” Black's Law Dictionary 1406 (6th ed. 1990).
320	impound	The word 'impound,' in its application to funds, means to take or retain in 'the custody of the law.' Black's Law Dictionary 681 (5th ed., 1979); Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1515 (8th ed., 1914).
321	quiet title	"""as the majority tells us, see ante, at 2206, an act to quiet title is 'universally understood' as a proceeding 'to establish a plaintiff's title to land.' Black's Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). But § 2409a authorizes civil actions in cases in which neither the Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to the land at issue."" at 235"
322	dismissed without prejudice	Thus, Black's Law Dictionary (7th ed.1999) defines “dismissed without prejudice” as “removed from the court's docket in such a way that the plaintiff may refile the same suit on the same claim,” id., at 482, 92 P.2d 804.
323	reversion	 Reversion signifies the returning of the land after a particular estate is ended. Jacobs' Law Dict., Tit. Reversion.
324	bodies politic and corporate	"""Both before and after the time when the Dictionary Act and § 1983 were passed, the phrase 'bodies politic and corporate' was understood to include the States."" "
325	witness 	"A review of that period reveals substantial support for the view that the term 'witness' meant a person who gives or furnishes evidence, a broader meaning than that which our case law currently ascribes to the term."" "
326	seniority	Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2066 (unabridged ed. 1961) defines “seniority,” in pertinent part, as the “status attained by length of continuous service . . . to which are attached by custom or prior collective agreement various rights or privileges . . . on the basis of ranking relative to others. . . .”
327	maturity	"""The Chief Justice begins by defining 'maturity' to mean the time when a note becomes due."" "
328	Discovery	The ordinary meaning of the term “discovery,” after all, is “the act, process, or an instance of gaining knowledge of or ascertaining the existence of something previously unknown or unrecognized.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 647 (1993). See also Black's Law Dictionary 465 (6th ed. 1990) (“[t]o get first sight or knowledge of”).
329	transaction	For example, it is unclear why a physician's nonbinding commitment to prescribe a drug in an appropriate case cannot qualify as a sale under this test. The broad term “transaction” easily encompasses such a commitment. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2425 (2002) (hereinafter Webster's Third) (defining “transaction” to mean “a communicative action or activity involving two parties or two things reciprocally affecting or influencing each other”). 
330	scienter	"""We normally characterize this interpretive maxim as a presumption in favor of “scienter,” by which we mean a presumption that criminal statutes require the degree of knowledge sufficient to “mak[e] a person legally responsible for the consequences of his or her act or omission.” Black's Law Dictionary 1547 (10th ed. 2014)."" "
331	Pending	The term “pending” means “[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision.” Black's 1314 (10th ed. 2014). See also Webster's Third 1669 (1976) (defining “pending” to mean “not yet decided: in continuance: in suspense”). If the reference to a “pending” action in the FCA is interpreted in this way, an earlier suit bars a later suit while the earlier suit remains undecided but ceases to bar that suit once it is dismissed. 
332	proceeding	 The word, “proceeding,” means “[t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including all acts and events between the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.” Black's Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed.1999) (emphasis added). 
333	with respect to	The phrase “with respect to” means “referring to,” “concerning,” or “relating to.” Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide 853 (1999 ed.); accord, Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 1640 (2003 ed.); American Heritage Dictionary 1485 (4th ed. 2000). 
334	falsely represents 	"""The Act's use of the phrase 'falsely represents,' moreover, connotes a knowledge requirement. See Black's Law Dictionary 1022 (8th ed.2004)"" "
335	Peddler	In Tomlin's Law Dictionary are these definitions: ‘Hawkers. Those deceitful fellows who went from place to place, buying and selling brass, pewter, and other goods and merchandise, which ought to be uttered in open market, were of old so called; and the appellation seems to grow from their uncertain wandering, like persons that, with hawks, seek their game where they can find it. They are mentioned in St. 33 Hen. VIII. c. 4.’ ‘Hawkers, pedlars, and petty chapmen **369 Persons travelling from town to town with goods and merchandise.
336	quorum, proportional quorum	"""...there is no structural implausibility in reading the statute according to its plain terms."" "
337	procedure	The dictionary defines “procedure” as “a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite way.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1807 (1976). 
338	delivery	"""The word 'deliver,' particularly delivery of an 'unborn child,' refers to the process of 'assit[ing] in giving birth,' which suggests removing an intact unborn child from the womb, rather than pieces of a child."" "
339	breaking	petitioner's admission to “breaking” was therefore critical to that element, as well. Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 236 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (“Breaking” denotes the “tearing away or removal of any part of a house or of the locks, latches, or other fastenings intended to *296 secure it, or otherwise exerting force to gain an entrance, with the intent to commit a felony”).
340	res adjudicata	It is well settled that, in order to render a matter res adjudicata, there must be a concurrence of the four conditions, viz: (1) Identity in the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of persons and parties to the action; and (4) identity of the quality in the persons for or against whom the claim is made. 2 Bouv. Law Dict. 467.
341	inspection	Bouvier defines ‘inspection’ as the examination of certain articles made by law subject to such examination, so that they may be declared fit for commerce.
342	record	E-mails might also not be “records” if records are limited to “minutes” or other formal writings “designed to memorialize [past] events.” Id., at 1465.
343	testimonial	we held that “certificates of analysis,” completed by employees of the State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, id., at 308, 129 S.Ct., at 2530–2531, were testimonial because they were “incontrovertibly ... ‘ “solemn declaration[s] or affirmation [s] made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact,” ’ ” id., at 310, 129 S.Ct., at 2532 (quoting Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), in turn quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)).
344	Shall	Though “shall” generally means “must,” legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, “shall” to mean “should,” “will,” or even “may.” See D. Mellinkoff, Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage 402–403 (1992) (“shall” and “may” are “frequently treated as synonyms” and their meaning depends on context); B. Garner, Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 939 (2d ed. 1995) (“[C]ourts in virtually every English-speaking jurisdiction have held—by necessity—that shall means may in some contexts, and vice versa.”). 
345	percentile	"""To understand why, one first must look beyond the smokescreen that the Court lays down with its repeated apologies for inexperience in statistics, and its endless recitation of technical mathematical definitions of the word 'percentile.'"" Zuni Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 89 v. Dep't of Educ., 550 U.S. 81, 111, 127 S.Ct. 1534, 1553 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting). "
346	damages	the term “damages” is generally used to mean “pecuniary compensation or indemnity, which may be recovered in the courts.” Black's 466 (emphasis added).
347	free	The phrase “free from” means “untainted” or “[c]lear of (something which is regarded as objectionable).” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 905 (def. 4(a)(2)) (1976); 4 Oxford English Dictionary 521 (def. 12) (1933); see also American Heritage Dictionary 524 (def. 5(a)) (1969) (defining “free” “used with from” as “[n]ot affected or restricted by a given condition or circumstance”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 565 (def. 12) (1966) (defining “free” as “exempt or released from something specified that controls, restrains, burdens, etc.”). 
348	percentile	Thus, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1675 (1961) (Webster's Third) defines “percentile” as “the value of the statistical variable that marks the boundary between any two consecutive intervals in a distribution of 100 intervals each containing one percent of the total population.”
349	Security	They are all ‘securities' of the United States; or, as Mr. Justice Bouvier defines that term, ‘instruments which render certain the performance of a contract.’
350	delivery	" But obstetric textbooks and even dictionaries routinely use that [""delivery""] to describe any facilitated removal of tissue from the uterus, not only the removal of an intact fetus."" "
351	element	Had Congress meant to make the latter as well as the former an element of the predicate offense, it likely would have used the plural 'elements,' as it has done in other offense-defining provisions... (defining 'element' as '[a] constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed <Burke failed to prove the element of proximate cause in prosecuting his negligence claim>').
352	Potential, risk	This commonsense principle of construction is sometimes referred to as the canon of ejusdem generis: “[W]hen a general word or phrase follows a list of specific persons or things, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only persons or things of the same type as those listed.” Black's Law Dictionary 535 (7th ed. 1999) (Black's); see, e.g., Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 384–385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003).  
353	stay	 The relief sought here is properly termed a “stay” because it suspends the effect of the removal order.
354	question,matter	A “question” could mean any “subject or aspect that is in dispute, open for discussion, or to be inquired into,” and a “matter” any “subject” of “interest or relevance.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1394, 1863 (1961). If those meanings were adopted, a typical meeting, call, or event would qualify as a “question” or “matter.” A “question” may also be interpreted more narrowly, however, as “a subject or point of debate or a proposition being or to be voted on in a meeting,” such as a question “before the senate.” Id., at 1863.Similarly, a “matter” may be limited to “a topic under active and usually serious or practical consideration,” such as a matter that “will come before the committee.” Id., at 1394. To choose between those competing definitions, we look to the context in which the words appear. 
355	party aggrieved	"""As both parties agree...'party aggrieved' means '[a] party entitled to a remedy; espy., a party whose personal, pecuniary, or property rights have been adversely affected by another person's actions or by a court's decree or judgment,' Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed.2004); see also ante, at 2003 – 2004."" "
356	necessary  	"""It would be incronguous to read [§ 188.029] to read this provision, especially the word 'necessary,' to require the performance of tests irrelevant to the expressed statutory purpose of determining viability."" Webster v. Reproductive Health Serv., 492 U.S. 490, 515 n.13, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 3055 n.13 (1989). "
357	always	And the berth must allow the vessel to come and go “always” safely afloat: That means afloat “at all times” and “in any event.” Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, at 35; see also New Oxford American Dictionary, at 47 (“always” means “at all times; on all occasions”). 
358	valuation	"""The Court concedes that the term 'tax valuation' has no canonical definition, ante, at 1419,1 and says that the term 'valuation,' standing alone, means ‘[t]he estimated worth of a thing,’ ante, at 1418 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1721 (4th ed.1951); alteration in original)."""
359	modification	See Black's Law Dictionary 1198 (3d ed. 1933) (defining “modification” as “A change; an alteration which introduces new elements into the details, or cancels some of them, but leaves the general purpose and effect of the subject-matter intact”).
360	employ	At that time, the word from which it derived, “employ,” simply meant to “apply (a thing) to some definite purpose.” 3 J. Murray, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 129 (1891). 
361	Employee	The ordinary dictionary definition of “employee” includes any “person who works for another in return for financial or other compensation.” American Heritage Dictionary **454 604 (3d ed.1992). See also Black's Law Dictionary 525 (6th ed.1990) (an employee is a “person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed”). The phrasing of the Act seems to reiterate the breadth of the ordinary dictionary definition, for it says “[t]he term ‘employee’ shall include any employee.” 29 U.S.C. § 152(3) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added).
362	"""age of consent"""	Although the age of consent for statutory rape purposes varies by jurisdiction, see infra, at 1571, reliable dictionaries provide evidence that the “generic” age—in 1996 and today—is 16. See B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 38 (2d ed. 1995) (“Age of consent, usu[ally] 16, denotes the age when one is legally capable of agreeing ... to sexual intercourse” and cross-referencing “statutory rape”); Black's Law Dictionary 73 (10th ed. 2014) (noting that the age of consent is “usu[ally] defined by statute as 16 years”).
363	affiant	"""Since an 'affiant' is simply a person who makes an affidavit and an artificial entity can make an affidavit through an agent, it is hardly unreasonable to understand the word 'affiant' in § 1915(a) as a reference not to the agent but to the entity on whose behalf the affidavit is made."" "
364	derivative action 	One commentator has explained that “the derivative suit may be viewed as the consolidation in equity of, on the one hand, a suit by the shareholder against the directors in their official capacity, seeking an affirmative order that they sue the alleged wrongdoers, and, on the other, a suit by the corporation against these wrongdoers.” Note, Demand on Directors and Shareholders as a Prerequisite to a Derivative Suit, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 746, 748 (1960). 
365	neurotoxicity	Evans described this damage as “neurotoxicity,” which is “the quality of exerting a destructive or poisonous effect upon the nerve tissue.” The Sloane–Dorland Annotated Medical–Legal Dictionary 498 (1987).
366	condition subsequent	A ‘condition subsequent is one annexed to an estate already vested, * * * and by the failure or non-performance of which it is defeated.'
367	property	"""Valuable entitlements like these are 'property' as that term ordinarily is employed… ; Black's Law Dictionary 1382 (4th ed.1951) (defining 'property' as 'extend[ing] to every species of valuable right and interest')"
368	Assign	By its terms, the antialienation provision, § 1056(d)(1), requires a plan to provide expressly that benefits be neither “assigned” nor “alienated,” the operative verbs having histories of legal meaning: to “assign” is “[t]o transfer; as to assign property, or some interest therein,” Black's Law Dictionary 152 (4th rev. ed.1968) i
369	interet	The ordinary meaning of “interest” surely encompasses a right to profits or proceeds. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1178 (1976), broadly defining “interest,” among other things, as a “good,” “benefit,” or “profit.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1979) defines interest to include “profit,” “welfare,” or “benefit.” Black's Law Dictionary 729 (5th ed., 1979) provides a significant definition of “interest”: “The most general term that can be employed to denote a right, claim, title or legal share in something.” It is thus apparent that the term “interest” comprehends all forms of real and personal property, including profits and proceeds.
370	deviation	"In the law martime, a deviation is defined as a 'voluntary departure without necessaity, or any reasonable cause, from the regular and usual course of the ship insured.'"" Constable v. National S.S. Co., 154 U.S. 51, 66, 14 S.Ct. 1062, 1068 (1894). "
371	authorize	One of the accepted meanings of the term “authorize,” they point out, is “permit.” Brief for Petitioners in No. 16–476, p. 42 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 133 (6th ed. 1990); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 146 (1992)).  
372	debt	Mr. Williams, for Lane County, plaintiff in error, laid down and pressed upon the attention of the court, seeking to maintain them by argument and authority, these two propositions...He cited Bouvier's Law Dictionary, title ‘Debt;’
373	speedy	speedy means “quick,”
374	seniority	The fundamental principle, as the Court recognizes, ante, at 819, is that employee rights and benefits increase with length of service. 
375	Inference	The former was applied “as a matter of law,” Pennco, supra, at 717, and not as the product of inference, which is “[a] process of reasoning by which a fact or proposition sought to be established is deduced as a logical consequence from other facts, or a state of facts, already proved or admitted.” Black's Law Dictionary 700 (5th ed. *815 1979).
376	to liquidate	 At the time of the founding, “to liquidate” meant “to make clear or plain”; “to render unambiguous; to settle (differences, disputes).” Nelson, Stare Decisis and Demonstrably Erroneous Precedents, 87 Va. L. Rev. 1, 13, and n. 35 (2001) (Nelson) (quoting 8 Oxford English Dictionary 1012 (2d ed. 1991); (internal quotation marks omitted)).
377	smuggling	In Brown's Law Dictionary (Eng., 1874), smuggling is defined as ‘importing goods which are liable to duty so as to evade payment of duty,’ and in McClain's Criminal Law (section 1351), as importing dutiable goods without payment.... In the Encyclopedia Britannica ‘smuggling’ is said to denote ‘a breach of the revenue laws, either by the importation or the exportation of prohibited goods, or by the evasion of customs duties on goods liable to duty’; and Stephen, in his Summary of the Criminal Law (page 89), defines smuggling as the ‘importing or exporting of goods without paying the duties imposed thereon by the laws of customs and excise, or of which the importation or exportation is prohibited.’ Similar definitions are given by Lord Hume in his Commentaries on the Laws of Scotland, as well as in Bell's Dictionary of Scottish Law, p. 225. In Tomlin's Law Dictionary, where smuggling is defined as ‘the offense of importing or exporting goods without paying the duties imposed thereon by the custom or excise laws,’ a list of some 30 or 40 acts connected with the unlawful and fraudulent importation of goods is given, but in none of them is the word ‘smuggle’ mentioned as an offense.
378	appraised valuation	An appraised valuation is the market value of property. See id., at 129, 115 S.Ct. 557 (defining “appraise” as “to fix and state the true value of a thing”)
379	restitution	"""Given that the ordinary meaning of 'restitution' is restoring someone to a position he occupied before a particular event, the repeated focus in § 3579 on the offense of which the defendant was convicted suggests strongly that restitution as authorized by the statute is intended to compensate victims only for losses caused by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction."" Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 416, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 1982 (1990). "
380	 Subject Matter Jurisdiction'	“Subject matter jurisdiction defines the court's authority to hear a given type of case,” United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 828, 104 S.Ct. 2769, 81 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984); it represents “the extent to which a court can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of things,” Black's Law Dictionary 870 (8th ed.2004). 
381	consumate	A “consummated transaction” is simply a transaction that has been fully completed. See id., at 490 (defining “consummate” to mean “to bring to completion”).
382	mistake	" ""A mistake is '[a]n error, misconception, or misunderstanding; an erroneous belief.' Black's Law Dictionary 1092 (9th ed.2009); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1446 (2002) (defining 'mistake' as 'a misunderstanding of the meaning or implication of something'; 'a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment,  inadequate knowledge, or inattention'; 'an erroneous belief'; or 'a state of mind not in accordance with the facts')."" "
383	malice	See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–27; see also, e.g., 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 5.1, p. 333 (2d ed.2003) (hereinafter LaFave) (explaining that some common-law crimes require that the crime be done “ ‘maliciously’ ”); Black's Law Dictionary 968 (7th ed.1999) (defining malice as “[t]he intent, without justification or excuse, to commit a wrongful act”).
384	report	"""Schindler argues that 'report' in the FCA's public disclosure bar carries its ordinary meaning and that the DOL's written responses to Mrs. Kirk's FOIA requests are therefore 'reports.' We agree."" Schindler Elevator Corp. v. U.S. ex rel. Kirk, 563 U.S. 401, 407, 131 S.Ct. 1885, 1890 (2011). "
385	embargo	An embargo is “a prohibition imposed by law upon commerce either in general or in one or more of its branches,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 738 (1981), a “[g]overnment order prohibiting commercial trade with individuals or businesses of other nations,” Black's Law Dictionary 468 (5th ed. 1979), an “[a]uthoritative stoppage of foreign commerce or of any special trade,” Funk & Wagnalls New International Dictionary of the English Language 411 (1984).
386	remedy	a remedy is the “legal means to recover a right ... or obtain redress for ... a wrong.” Webster's New International Dictionary **1231 of the English Language 819, 1878, 2106, 2418 (2d ed. 1934).
387	subject, under	That is, the deliberate indifference must, at a minimum, “cause [students] to undergo” harassment or “make them liable or vulnerable” to it. Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1415 (1966) (defining “subject” as “to cause to undergo the action of something specified; expose” or “to make liable or vulnerable; lay open; expose”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2275 (1961) (defining “subject” as “to cause to undergo or submit to: make submit to a particular action or effect: EXPOSE”). 
388	corruptly	“corruptly” requires proof that the defendant “act[ed] with an intent to procure an unlawful benefit either for [himself] or for some other person,” United States v. Floyd, 740 F.3d 22, 31 (C.A.1 2014) (collecting cases); see also Black's Law Dictionary 414 (rev. 4th ed. 1951) (“corruptly” “generally imports a wrongful design to acquire some pecuniary or other advantage”). In other words, “corruptly” requires proof that the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an “unlawful benefit” but that his “objective” or “purpose” was to obtain that unlawful benefit. See 21 Am.Jur.2d, Criminal Law § 114 (2016) (explaining that specific intent requires both knowledge and purpose).
389	similarly situated	n/a- The majority purports to derive this limitation from the dictionary, but then finds itself unable to proceed: After all, Black's Law Dictionary contains no entry defining what it means to be “similarly situated” for the purpose of subsection (b)(4).
390	open court 	The term ‘open court’ is used in contradistinction to a judge sitting in chambers…
391	Mutatis Mutandis'	It interpreted that phrase as applying § 405(h) “mutatis mutandis,” i.e., “[a]ll necessary changes having been made.” Black's Law Dictionary 1039 (7th ed.1999).
392	violent felony	Even by itself, the world 'violent' in § 924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Webster's Second 2846 (defining ‘violent’ as ‘[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement ...’); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989) (‘[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength’); Black's [Law Dictionary] 1706 [ (9th ed. 2009) ] (‘[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force’). When the adjective ‘violent’ is attached to the noun ‘felony,’ its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188 (defining ‘violent felony’ as ‘[a] crime characterized by extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon’); see also United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221, 225 (C.A.1 1992) (Breyer, C.J.) (‘[T]he term to be defined, “violent felony,” ... calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closely related, active violence’).” 559 U.S., at 140–141, 130 S.Ct. 1265.
393	independent contractor	Meanwhile, independent contractors are sometimes described as those “entrusted to undertake a specific project but who [are] left free to do the assigned work and to choose the method for accomplishing it.” Id., at 888.
394	aggravated	An ‘aggravated’ offense is one ‘made worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, *394 or the intent to commit another crime.’ ” Carachuri–Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.S. 563, 574, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 75 (9th ed. 2009)). 
395	Toll	So, also, ‘toll’ is the word used to express the compensation allowed by law or custom to a miller for grinding grain. 2 Bouv. Law Dict. 598.
396	banishment, exile, transportation	In Black's Law Dictionary ‘banishment’ is defined as ‘a punishment inflicted upon criminals, by compelling them to quit a city, place, or country, for a specific period of time,  or for life. 
397	insolvent	An insolvent is one who cannot pay, or who does not pay, his debts, or whose debts cannot be collected out of his means by legal process.
398	insider	The concept of “insider” generally rests on the presumption that a person or entity alleged to be an insider is so connected with the debtor that any business conducted between them necessarily cannot be conducted at arm's length. See Black's Law Dictionary 915 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “insider” as “[a]n entity or person who is so closely related to a debtor that any deal between them will not be  considered an arm's-length transaction and will be subject to close scrutiny”).
399	insure	To “insure” something—as the court below recognized—means “ ‘[t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).’ ”
400	review	“Review” is best understood as an “act of inspecting or examining” or a “judicial reexamination.” Webster's 1944; see also Black's, supra, at 1434 (“[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a subject or thing”); 13 OED 831 (“[t]o submit (a decree, act, etc.) to examination or revision”).
401	citizen	Although the word “citizen” may imply (and in 1789 and 1875 may have implied) the enjoyment of certain basic rights and privileges, see Black's Law Dictionary 237 (7th ed.1999) (defining “citizen” as “entitled to enjoy all its civil rights and protections” of a community), 
402	corrupt,corruptly	“Corrupt” and “corruptly” are normally associated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil. See Black's 371; Webster's 3d 512; Am. Hert. 299–300. 
403	action	The term “action,” however, refers to a judicial “proceeding,” or perhaps to a “suit”—not to the general content of claims. See Black's Law Dictionary 41 (3d ed. 1933) (defining “action” as, inter alia, “an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice”); see also id., at 43 (“The terms ‘action’ and ‘suit’ are ... nearly, if not entirely, synonymous”). 
404	obtain	"At the time Congress enacted § 853(a)(1), the verb “obtain” was defined as “to come into possession of” or to “get or acquire.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language 995 (1966); see also 7 Oxford English Dictionary 37 (1933) (defining “obtain” as “[t]o come into the possession or enjoyment of (something) by one's own effort, or by request; to procure or gain, as the result of purpose and effort”). That definition persists today. See *450 Black's Law Dictionary 1247 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “obtain” as “[t]o bring into one's own possession; to procure, esp. through effort”); cf. Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 734, 133 S.Ct. 2720, 2725, 186 L.Ed.2d 794 (2013) (“Obtaining property requires ‘... the acquisition of property’ ”).Neither the dictionary definition nor the common usage of the word “obtain” supports the conclusion that an individual “obtains” property that was acquired by someone else."""
405	clear error	 'Clear' error can simply mean an obvious, plain, gross, significant, or manifest error or miscalculation. See Black's Law Dictionary 250 (6th ed. 1990).
406	Residence	And “residence” referred to a “[p]ersonal presence at some place of abode,” Black's Law Dictionary, at 1176, “one's usual dwelling-place,” 13 Oxford English Dictionary, at 707, or “the act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some time,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 1931; see also ibid. (“a temporary or permanent dwelling place, abode, or habitation”). 
407	entitle	Second, the ordinary meaning of the word “entitle” indicates that the “person entitled to compensation” must at the very least be qualified to receive compensation. Black's Law Dictionary 532 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “entitle” as “To qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming”).
408	Portion	The first word, “portion,” is defined as “[a] share or allotted part (as of an estate).” Black's Law Dictionary 1182 (7th ed. 1999). “Portion” thus inherently conveys an indeterminate amount. ....Similarly, in this context, referencing a “portion” of the judgment tells us that some amount of the judgment up to 25 percent of the whole is to be applied to the attorney's fee award, but not exactly what amount. 
409	Mens rea	Among the most common definitions of mens rea is “criminal intent.” Black's Law Dictionary 1137 (rev. 4th ed.1968). That dictionary unsurprisingly defines “purpose” as synonymous with intent, id., at 1400, and “intent” as, among other things, “a state of mind,” id., at 947.  
410	so	"[""So""] refers to a stated, identifiable proposition from the ""preceding"" text; indeed, ""so"" typically ""[r]epresent[s]"" a ""word or phrase already employeed,"" thereby avoiding the need for repetition. 15 Oxford English Dictionary, at 887; see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2160 (1986) (so ""often used as a substitute... to express the idea of a preceding phrase"")."
411	entitled	"A person is entitled to do something only if he has a ""right"" to do it. Black's Law Dictionary 477 (5th ed. 1979); see also American Heritage Dictionary 437 (def. 3a) (198a) (to ""allow"" or to ""qualify""). "
412	complaint	Likewise, “complaint” was defined as “the first or initiatory pleading on the part of the plaintiff **644 in a civil action.”3 Id., at 356. 
413	smuggle	Dr. Johnson, with his customary disregard of conventionalities, defines the verb ‘to smuggle’ as ‘to import or export goods without paying the customs,’ and a smuggler as ‘a wretch who, in defiance of justice and the laws, imports or exports goods, either contraband or without paying the customs.’
414	Civil Conspiracy 	The principle that a civil conspiracy plaintiff must claim injury from an act of a tortious character was so widely accepted at the time of RICO's adoption as to be incorporated in the common understanding of “civil conspiracy.” See Ballentine's Law Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 1969) (“It is the civil wrong resulting in damage, and not the conspiracy which constitutes the cause of action”); Black's Law Dictionary 383 (4th ed. 1968) (“[W]here, in carrying out the design of the conspirators, overt acts are done causing legal damage, the person injured has a right of action” (emphasis added)).
415	Satisfy	Third, we know that when you purposefully seek or aim “to satisfy” an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full. (citing numerous dictionaries)
416	Relate	See Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979) (“Relate. To stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with”). 
417	Association	The word ‘association’ appears to be used in the Act in its ordinary meaning. It has been defined as a term ‘used throughout the United States to signify a body of persons united without a charter, but upon the methods and forms used by incorporated bodies for the prosecution of some common enterprise.’ 1 Abb. Law Dict. 101 (1879); 1 Bouv. Law Dict. (Rawle's 3d Rev.) 269; 3 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law (2 Ed.) 162; and Allen v. Stevens, 33 App. Div. 485, 54 N. Y. Supp. 8, 23, in which this definition was cited with approval as being in accord with the common understanding. Other definitions are: ‘In the United States, as distinguished from a corporation, a body of persons organized, for the prosecution of some purpose, without a charter, but having the general form and mode of procedure of a corporation.’ Webst. New Internat. Dict.
418	reform	Reform' means to correct; to make anew; to rectify.
419	sanction	As a general matter, the meaning of “sanction” is spacious enough to cover not only what we have called punitive fines, but coercive ones as well, and use of the term carries no necessary implication that a reference to punitive fines is intended. 
420	collateral attack	A “collateral attack” is “[a]n attack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct appeal.” Black's Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed.2009) (emphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev.Code § 10.73.090(2) (2008) (defining “collateral attack” as “any form of post-conviction relief other than a direct appeal”).
421	threat	And a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict harm. Cf. United States v. White, 258 F.3d 374, 383 (C.A.5 2001) (“A threat imports ‘[a] communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm’ ” (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))
422	any	We have recognized that the modifier “any” can mean “different things depending upon the setting,”  Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541 U.S. 125, 132, 124 S.Ct. 1555, 158 L.Ed.2d 291 (2004), but in the context of 29 U.S.C. § 203(k), it is best read to mean “ ‘one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,’ ” United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)).
423	solicitation	". 'Solicitation,' commonly understood means . . ."" "
424	potential,risk	See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 1188 (7th ed.1999) (potential: “[c]apable of coming into being; possible”); id., at 1328 (risk: “[t]he chance of injury, damage, or loss; danger or hazard”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1775 (1971) (potential: “existing in possibility: having the capacity or a strong possibility for development into a state of actuality”); id., at 1961 (risk: “the possibility of loss, injury, disadvantage, or destruction”).
425	force	“force” generally connotes the use of violence against another. Black's Law Dictionary, for example, defines “force” to mean “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.” Black's Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999). Other dictionaries offer similar definitions. E.g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 748 (def. 5) (2d ed. 1987) (“force,” when used in law, means “unlawful violence threatened or committed against persons or property”); 6 Oxford English Dictionary 34 (def. I(5)(c)) (“unlawful violence offered to persons or things”).
426	bona fide error	"""Certainly a mistaken belief about the law is, if held in good faith, a 'bona fide error' as that phrase is normally understood."" "
427	disposition	Neither the statute nor the regulations define “disposition,” but dictionary definitions of the term range from “relinquishment or alienation” to “arrangement.” See Webster's New International Dictionary 644 (def. 1(b)) (1927) (“[t]he getting rid, or making over, of anything; relinquishment or alienation”); ibid. (def. 1(a)) (“[t]he ordering, regulating, or administering of anything”); 3 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 493 (def. 4) (“[t]he action of disposing of, putting away, getting rid of, making over, etc.”); ibid. (def. 1) (“[t]he action of setting in order, or condition of being set in order; arrangement, order”).
428	principle 	A principle is a 'fundamental truth or doctrine, as of law; a comprehensive rule or doctrine which furnishes a basis or origin for others.' Black's Law Dictionary 1417 (3d ed. 1933); Black's Law Dictionary 1357 (4th ed. 1951).
429	employed	The argument that the term “employed,” as used in § 701(f), is commonly used to mean “[p]erforming work under an employer-employee relationship,” Black's Law Dictionary 525 (6th ed.1990), begs the question by implicitly reading the word “employed” to mean “is employed.” But the word “employed” is not so limited in its possible meanings, and could just as easily be read to mean “was employed.”
430	results from	A thing “results” when it “[a]rise[s] as an effect, issue, or outcome from some action, process or design.” 2 The New *211 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993). “Results from” imposes, in other words, a requirement of actual causality. 
431	sovereignty	When we have stated that sovereignty is a political question, we have referred not to sovereignty in the general, colloquial sense, meaning the exercise of dominion or power, see Webster's New International Dictionary 2406 (2d ed.1934) (“sovereignty,” definition 3), but sovereignty in the narrow, legal sense of the term, meaning a claim of right, see 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, supra, § 206, Comment b, at 94 (noting that sovereignty “implies a state's lawful control over its territory generally to the exclusion of other states, authority to govern in that territory, and authority to apply law there”).
432	decree	The trial court's decree, we noted, had the effect of individually resolving each constituent case. Ibid. (“The same decree ... is entered as in the case of separate suits.”); see Black's Law Dictionary 532 (3d ed. 1933) (“decree” is a “judgment of a court of equity or admiralty, answering for most purposes to the judgment of a court of common law”).
433	relate to	"""We have repeatedly stated that a law 'relate[s] to' a covered employee benefit plan for purposes of § 514(a) 'if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan"""
434	restrain	“Restrain,” standing alone, can have several meanings. One is the broad meaning given by the Court of Appeals, *13 which captures orders that merely inhibit acts of “assessment, levy and collection.” See Black's 1548. Another, narrower meaning, however, is “[t]o prohibit from action; to put compulsion upon ... to enjoin,” ibid., which captures only those orders that stop (or perhaps compel) acts of “assessment, levy and collection.” To resolve this ambiguity, we look to the context in which the word is used. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). The statutory context provides several clues that lead us to conclude that the TIA uses the word “restrain” in its narrower sense.
435	seniority system	A “seniority system” is a *606 scheme that, alone or in tandem with non-“seniority” criteria,13 allots to employees ever improving employment rights and benefits as their relative lengths of pertinent employment increase.
436	veto	"""In constitutional terms, 'veto' is used to describe the President's power under Art. I, § 7 of the Constitution."""
437	violence	Likewise, “violence” implies force, including an “unjust or unwarranted use of force.” Black's Law Dictionary, at 1564; accord, Random House Dictionary, at 2124 (“rough or injurious physical force, action, or treatment,” or “an unjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power, as against rights or laws”).
438	employment	Suggestively, at least one recently published law dictionary defines the word “employment” to mean “the relationship between master and servant.” Black's Law Dictionary 641 (10th ed. 2014).
439	enterprise	"""It is clear from the statute and our earlier decisions construing the term that the Congress used 'enterprise' in these provision in the sense of 'business organization,' rather than 'a venture, undertaking, or project.'"" "
440	poverty	"Poverty, in its primary sense, is a human condition, to be '[w]anting in material riches or goods; lacking the conforts of life; needy."""
441	chambers of commerce	“[A] board or association to protect the interests of commerce, chosen from among the merchants and traders of a city. The term chamber of commerce is by some distinctively used of the bodies that are intrusted with the protection of general commercial interests, esp. in connection with foreign trade and board of trade for those dealing primarily with local commerce.”
442	proclamation	Publishing by outcry, in the market-place and streets of towns, as suggested by Chitty, has, we apprehend, fallen into disuse in England. It is certainly unknown in this country. While it is said the proclamation always appears in the gazette, he does not say that it cannot become operative until promulgated in that way. 
443	Return	Now a ‘return’ implies the prior existence of some state or condition. Webster defines it ‘to turn back; to go or come again to the same place or condition.’ In the Standard dictionary it is defined ‘to cause to take again a former position; put, carry, or send back, as to a former place or holder.’ A technical meaning in the law is thus given in Black's Law Dictionary: ‘The act of a sheriff, constable, or other ministerial officer, in delivering back to the court a writ, notice, or other paper.’
444	political gerrymander	The term “political gerrymander” has been defined as “[t]he practice of dividing a geographical area into electoral districts, often of highly irregular shape, to give one political party an unfair advantage by diluting the opposition's voting strength.” Black's Law Dictionary 696 (7th ed.1999).
445	carry	To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of “carry,” a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column “carries” the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, at 919, 921.
446	under	Moreover, because the harassment must occur “under” “the operations of” a funding recipient, see 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); § 1687 (defining “program or activity”), the harassment must take place in a context subject to the school district's control, Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 2487 (defining “under” as “in or into a condition of subjection, regulation, or subordination”; “subject to the guidance and instruction of”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language, supra, at 1543 (defining “under” as “subject to the authority, direction, or supervision of”).
447	personal injuries	"""The courts and the IRS long since have recognized that § 104(a)(2)'s reference to “personal injuries” encompasses, in accord with common judicial parlance and conceptions, see Black's Law Dictionary 786 (6th ed. 1990)"""
448	suspicion	"""The word 'suspicion,' however, ordinarily indicates that the person suspected has engaged in wrongdoing. See Black's Law Dictionary 1585 (9th ed.2009)"" "
449	infringement	"""The classic case of direct evidence of unlawful purpose occurs when one induces commission of infringement by another, or 'entic[es] or persuad[es] another' to infringe, Black's Law Dictionary 790 (8th ed.2004), as by advertising."" at 935."
450	merely colorable	"""In the legal parlance of the times, a 'merely colorable' claim was one that existed 'in appearance only, and not in reality.'"""
451	motion	" But the term 'motion' generally means '[a]n application made to a court or judge for purpose of obtaining a rule or order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant.'"" (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1013 (6th ed.1990))."
452	exile/transportation	The same author defines ‘exile’ as banishment, and ‘transportation’ as ‘a species of punishment consisting in removing the criminal from his own country to another (usually a penal colony), there to remain in exile for a prescribed period.’In Rapalje & Lawrence's Law Dictionary (vol. 1, page 109), ‘banishment’ is called: ‘A punishment by forced exile, either for years or for life; inflicted principally upon political offenders, ‘transportation’ being the word used to express a similar punishment of ordinary criminals.' In 4 Bl. Com. 377, it is said: ‘Some punishments consist in exile or banishment, by abjuration of the realm, or transportation.’ Vattel, Nations, bk. 1, § 228, declares: ‘As a man may be deprived of any right whatsoever by way of punishment; exile, which deprives him of the right of dwelling in a certain place, may be inflicted as a punishment; banishment is always one; for a mark of infamy cannot be set on any one but with a view of punishing him for a fault, either real or pretended.’
453	negotiable	Negotiable' and 'negotiability' signify that an instrument is capable of being transferred so as to be free from any questions between orginal parties, the quality of being vendible by commercial indorsement.'
454	in	" The CFTC's interpretation violates the ordinary meaning of the key word 'in,' which is usually thought to be 'synonymous with [the] expressions ‘in regard to,’ ‘respecting,’ [and] ‘with respect to.’ Black's Law Dictionary 758 (6th ed.1990)"" "
455	Purpose	‘Purpose’ is listed as a synonym for ‘intention’ in Black's Law Dictionary, at 948 (4th ed. 1968).
456	regulate	Justice GINSBURG suggests that “at the time the Constitution was framed, to ‘regulate’ meant, among other things, to require action.” Post, at 2621 (citing Seven–Sky v. Holder, 661 F.3d 1, 16 (C.A.D.C.2011); brackets and some internal quotation marks omitted). 
457	mineral lands	The argument made in this connection by the railway company would confine the term ‘mineral lands' to lands bearing gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper, which would exclude all other metalliferous lands, such as contain iron, lead, tin, nickel, platinum, aluminum, etc.,-a limitation wholly inconsistent with the use of the word ‘mineral’ in the 1st section.
458	Use	Dictionaries consistently define the noun “use” to mean the “act of employing” something. Webster's New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed. 1954) (“[a]ct of employing anything”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2097 (2d ed. 1987) (“act of employing, using, or putting into service”); Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990) (“[a]ct of employing,” “application”).
459	Claim	"Individual demands for relief within a lawsuit, by contrast, are ""claims."" See Black's Law Dictionary, at 311 (2019) (defining a ""claim"" as ""the part of a complaint in a civil action specifying what relief the plaintiff asks for""); Black's Law Dictionary, at 333 (1933) (defining a ""claim"" as ""any demand held or asserted as of right"" or ""cause of action"")."
460	visitation	In 1864, when the NBA was enacted, “visitation” was generally defined as “[i]nspection; superintendence; direction; [and] regulation.” 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 598 (1860); see also 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 633 (1852) (defining “visitation” as “[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation”). 
461	fail, failure	In its customary and preferred sense, “fail” connotes some omission, fault, or negligence on the part of the person who has failed to do something. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 910 (2d ed.1939) (defining “fail” as “to be wanting; to fall short; to be or become deficient in any measure or degree,” and “failure” as “a falling short,” “a deficiency or *432 lack,” and an “[o]mission to perform”); Webster's New International Dictionary 814 (3d ed.1993) (“to leave some possible or expected action unperformed or some condition unachieved”). See also Black's Law Dictionary 594 (6th ed.1990) (defining “fail” as “[f]ault, negligence, or refusal”). To say a person has failed in a duty implies he did not take the necessary steps to fulfill it.
462	instrumentality	In the latter instance, the property is the actual means by which the criminal act is committed. See Black's Law Dictionary 801 (6th ed. 1990) (“Instrumentality” is “[s]omething by which an end is achieved; a means, medium, agency”).
463	To Defraud	 One leading dictionary stated that “[t]o defraud is to withhold from another that which is justly due to him, or to deprive him of a right by deception or artifice.” 1 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 530 (1897). Another dictionary defined “defraud” as “[t]o cheat; to deceive; to deprive of a right by an act of fraud ... to withhold from another what is justly due him, or to deprive him of a right, by deception or artifice.” W. Anderson, A Dictionary of *371 Law 474 (1893). See also 1 Burrill's Law Dictionary 658-659 (1859).8
464	impair	The dictionary defines “impair” as to weaken, make worse, lessen in power, diminish, relax, or otherwise affect in an injurious manner. 
465	granting of a pardon	But the granting of a pardon... is “[a]n executive action that mitigates or sets aside punishment for a crime.” Black's Law Dictionary 1113 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added).
466	Award	In ordinary usage, “award” most often means “give by judicial decree” or “assign after careful judgment.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002); see also, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (“grant by formal process or by judicial decree”)....  But “award” can also mean “grant,” or “confer or bestow upon.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same).
467	note	Although 'note' is often used generically to refer to any written promise to pay a specified sum on demand or at a specified time, it is also used more narrowly, to refer to any written promise to pay a specified sum on demand or at a specified time, it is also used, more narrowly, to refer to a particular kind of capital-raising debt instruement distributed under an indenture agreement, like bond or debentures but of shorter maturity.
468	personnel	When used as an adjective, as it is here to modify “rules and practices,” that term refers to human resources matters. “Personnel,” in this common parlance, means “the selection, placement, and training of employees and ... the formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees or their representatives.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinafter Webster's). 
469	obtain	"Obtaining property requires ""not only the deprivation but also the acquisition of property."" (citing cases) That is, it requires that the victim ""part with"" his property… and that the extortionist ""gain possession of it,""… see also Webster's New International Dictionary 1682 (2d ed. 1949) (defining ""obtain"")"
470	arrest	A number of other common-law commentaries shared Hawkins's broad reading of Holyday. See The Law of Arrests 205 (2d ed. 1753) (In light of Holyday, “an Arrest of an Offender ... for any Crime prejudicial to the **1546 Publick, seems to be justifiable”); 1 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (1771) (definition of “arrest”) (same); 1 G. Jacob, The Law Dictionary 129 (1st Am.ed., 1811) (same). See generally C. Greaves, Law of Arrest Without a Warrant, in The Criminal Law Consolidation Acts, p. lxiii (1870) (“[Holyday] is rested upon the broad ground that ‘it is pro bono publico to stay such offenders,’ which is equally applicable to every case of misdemeanor ... ”).
471	Inference	An “inference” is generally understood to be a “conclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a logical consequence from them.” Black's Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed.1999).
472	damage	Damages means “loss due to ... injury or harm to person, property, or reputation.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 571 (1961); Black's Law Dictionary 351 (5th ed. 1979). 
473	at issue	For one thing, we do not doubt that the setoff matter is “under dispute” or “in question” in Case No. B/61, and those words typically define the term “at issue.” Black's Law Dictionary 136 (8th ed.2004).
474	damages	"""In legal parlance, the term 'damages' refers to money awarded as reparation for injury resulting from breach of legal duty."" "
475	marriage	"""The Constitution itself says nothing about marriage...The meaning of 'marriage' went without saying. Of course, many did say it. (then cites to founding era dictionaries and treatises) "
476	Expenses	The term [expense], standing alone, encompasses wide-ranging “expenditure[s] of money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a result,” Black's Law Dictionary 698 (10th ed. 2014), “charges or costs met with in ... doing one's work,” Webster's New World College Dictionary 511 (5th ed. 2014), and “outlay[s]” for labor, Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 180 (1996); see also N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 319 (3d ed. 1830) (defining the term broadly to include “the employment and consumption, as of time or labor,” or the “disbursing of money”). 
477	on the merits 	A judgment is normally said to have been rendered “on the merits” only if it was “delivered after the court ... heard and evaluated the evidence and the parties' substantive arguments.” Black's Law Dictionary 1199 (9th ed. 2009) 
478	modify	"""Virtually every dictionary we are aware of says that “to modify” means to change moderately or in minor fashion."""
479	neglect	The ordinary meaning of “neglect” is “to give little attention or respect” to a matter, or, closer to the point for our purposes, “to leave undone or unattended to esp[ecially] through carelessness. ” Webster's **1495 Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 791 (1983) (emphasis added). 
480	Surcharge	Section 518 can be interpreted in several ways. On first read, its prohibition on “impos[ing] a surcharge” on credit card customers appears to prohibit charging customers who pay with a credit card more than those who pay by other means. See Black's Law Dictionary 1579 (9th ed. 2009) (“surcharge” means “[a]n additional tax, charge, or cost”). That is, 518 may require a merchant to charge all customers the same price, no matter the form of payment. 
481	indictment	f the grand jury  was “satisfied of the truth of the accusation,” it endorsed the indictment, id., at *305–*306, which was then “publicly delivered into court,” id., at *306, “afterwards to be tried and determined,” id., at *303, “before an officer having power to punish the [charged] offence,” 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).
482	Discretion	‘Discretion means the equitable decision of what is just and proper under the circumstances.’ Bouvier, Law Dict. ‘Discretion means the liberty or power of acting without other control than one's own judgment.’ Webster, Dict.
483	actual notice	"""The Government's brief notes that the term 'actual notice' is not free from ambiguity as used by this Court in cases...(stating that the term has been used both to distinguish notice by mail from notice by publication and to refer to the actual receipt of the notice by the intended recipient); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1087 (7th ed.1999) (defining 'actual notice' as '[n]otice given directly to, or received personally by, a party'). We think the best way to avoid this confusion is to equate, as petitioner does, 'actual notice' with 'receipt of notice.'"" at 169 n.5. "
484	association	The concept of “associat[ion]” requires both interpersonal relationships and a common interest. See id., at 132 (defining “association” as “an organization of persons having a common interest”); Black's Law Dictionary 156 (rev. 4th ed.1968) (defining “association” as a “collection of persons who have joined together for a certain object”).
485	magistrate	In a general sense a magistrate is a public civil officer, possessing such power-legislative, executive, or judicial-as the government appointing him may ordain. In a narrow sense, a magistrate is regarded-perhaps, commonly regarded-as an inferior judicial officer, such as a justice of the peace. 2 Bouvier's Law Dict. 92. 
486	Confirm	As a matter of English usage, you cannot confirm that an event happened without already having some reason to believe at least that it might have happened. Black's Law Dictionary 298 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “confirm” as meaning “[t]o complete or establish that which was imperfect or uncertain”).  
487	interpreter,interpret	"Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act in 1978 defined “interpreter” as one who translates spoken, as opposed to written, language. (listing a number of dictionaries)… Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the word ""interpreter"" and ""interpret"" in terms of oral translation."
488	Appropriate	And a thing that is not “appropriate” is not “suitable or fitting for a particular purpose.” Id., at 103. 
489	Participate	And “participate” means simply “to take part,” Webster's Ninth 858, or “to have a share, to take part in something,” Oxford 487; see also Black's 1007 (defining “participate” as “[t]o receive or have a part or share of; to partake of; experience in common with others; to have or enjoy a part or share in common with others”).
490	expenses of the proceeding	This term has long referred to a class of expenses commonly recovered in litigation to which attorney's fees did not traditionally belong. See Black's Law Dictionary 461 (1891) (defining “expensæ litis” to mean “generally allowed” costs); 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 392 (1839) (defining the term to mean the “costs which are generally allowed to the successful party”); id., at 244 (excluding from the definition of “costs” the “extraordinary fees [a party] may have paid counsel”).  
491	injunction	When a court employs “the extraordinary remedy of injunction,” Weinberger v. Romero–Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982), it directs the conduct of a party, and does so with the backing of its full coercive powers. See Black's Law Dictionary 784 (6th ed.1990) (defining “injunction” as “[a] court order prohibiting someone from doing some specified act or commanding someone to undo some wrong or injury”).
492	harm	The verb “harm” has a range of meaning: “to cause injury” at its broadest, “to do hurt or damage” in a narrower and more direct sense. See, e.g., 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (“Harm, v.t. To hurt; to injure; to damage; to impair soundness of body, either animal or vegetable”) (emphasis added); American College Dictionary 551 (1970) (“harm ... n. injury; damage; hurt: to do him bodily harm ”). In fact the more directed sense of “harm” is a somewhat more common and preferred usage; “harm has in it a little of the idea of specially focused hurt or injury, as if a personal injury has been anticipated and intended.” J. Opdycke, Mark My Words: A Guide to Modern Usage and Expression 330 (1949). See also American Heritage Dictionary 662 (1985) ( “Injure has the widest range.... Harm and hurt refer principally to what causes physical or mental distress to living things”). 
493	Assist	The term “assist” is defined as “to give support or aid,” Webster's Ninth 109, or “to help,” Oxford American Dictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford). See *544 also Black's Law Dictionary 111 (5th ed.1979) (hereinafter Black's) (defining “assist” as “[t]o help; aid; succor; lend countenance or encouragement to; participate in as an auxiliary”).  
494	per curiam	"""'Per curiam' is a Latin phrase meaning '[b]y the court,' which should distinguish an opinion of the whole Court from an opinion written by any one Justice."""
495	good faith	It has aptly been said that “good faith” “ ‘is an elusive idea, taking on different meanings and emphases as we move from one context to another.’ ” Black's Law Dictionary 836 (11th ed. 2019).
496	amending	"""The act of 'amending,' however, in both ordinary parlance and legal usage, has its own meaning separate and apart from the act of 'interpreting.' (See Black's Law Dictionary) "" "
497	under	Under the most natural reading of this provision, discrimination violates Title IX only if it is authorized by, or in accordance with, the actions, activities, or policies of the grant recipient. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2487 (1981) (defining “under” as “required by: in accordance with: bound by”); American Heritage Dictionary 1395 (New College ed.1981) (defining “under” as “[w]ith the authorization of; attested by; by virtue of”); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2059 (2d ed.1987) (defining “under” as “authorized, warranted, or attested by” or “in accordance with”); see also 43 Words and Phrases 149–152 (1969) (citing cases defining “under” as, inter alia, “ ‘in accordance with’ and ‘in conformity with’ ”; “indicating subjection, guidance or control, and meaning ‘by authority of ’ ”; “ ‘by,’ ‘by reason of,’ or ‘by means of’ ”; and “ ‘by virtue of,’ which is defined ... as meaning ‘by or through the authority of’ ”). This reading reflects the common legal usage of the *660 term “under” to mean pursuant to, in accordance with, or as authorized or provided by. See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 469, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991) (“Because Congress nowhere stated its intent to impose mandatory obligations on the States under its § 5 powers, we concluded that Congress did not do so”); ante, at 1666 (“Among petitioner's claims was a claim for monetary and injunctive relief under Title IX ...”).
498	Such	By using the phrase “such Exchange,” Section 18041 instructs the Secretary to establish and operate the same Exchange that the State was directed to establish under Section 18031. See Black's Law Dictionary 1661 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “such” as “That or those; having just been mentioned”). 
499	Action	"An ""action"" refers to the whole of the lawsuit. See Black's Law Dictionary, at 37 (defining ""action"" as a ""civil or criminal judicial proceeding""); Black's Law Dictionary 43 (3d ed. 1933) (The terms 'action' and 'suit' are now nearly, if not entirely, synonymous""). "
500	under	"""But the Court overlooks that, according to the very dictionaries it cites, ante, at 1358 – 1359, the word “under” commonly signals a relationship of subjection, where one thing is governed or regulated by another."" at 562"
501	exempt	"The term 'exemption' is ordinarily used to denote relief from a duty or service."" "
502	proximate	" In fact 'proximate' causation simply means 'direct' causation."" (Then Scalia cites defintions in both Black's Law Dictionary and Webster's) "
503	Commercial	Rather, the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs (whatever the motive behind them) are the type of actions by which a private party engages in “trade and traffic or commerce,” Black's Law Dictionary 270 (6th ed. 1990). 
504	discrimination 	"""Relying on second definition in Black's Law Dictionary, the majority defines 'discriminates' as 'failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored.'"" CSX Transp., Inc. v. Ala. Dep't of Rev., 562 U.S. 277, 304, 131 S.Ct. 1101, 1119 (2011) (Thomas, J., dissenting). "
505	assignee, assignment	The respondents do not dispute that the trustee meets the usual definition of the word “assignee” in both ordinary and legal usage. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 132 (1986) (defining an “assignee” as “one to whom a right or property is legally transferred”); Black's Law Dictionary 118-119 (6th ed. 1990) (defining an “assignee” as “[a] person to whom an assignment is made” and an “assignment” as “[t]he act of transferring to another all or part of one's property, interest, or rights”); cf. 26 CFR § 301.6036-1(a)(3) (1991) (defining an “assignee for the benefit of ... creditors” as any person who takes possession of and liquidates property of a debtor for distribution to creditors). 
506	civil action	"""The plain meaning of 'civil action' is a proceeding in a court."" "
507	pitiless, cold-blooded	Webster's Dictionary defines “pitiless” to mean devoid of, or unmoved by, mercy or compassion. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1726 (1986). 
508	contemplation of bankruptcy	For instance, Black's Law Dictionary 336 (8th ed.2004) (hereinafter Black's) defines “contemplation of bankruptcy” as “[t]he *241 thought of declaring bankruptcy because of the inability to continue current financial operations, often coupled with action designed to thwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.”
509	common law	In the generic sense of the term, the “common law” has been defined as: “‘the body of those principles and rules of action relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts recognizing, affirming and enforcing such usages and customs; and, in this sense, particularly the ancient unwritten law of England.’” Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Call Pub. Co., 181 U.S. 92, 102, 21 S.Ct. 561, 564, 45 L.Ed. 765 (1901) (citing Black's Law Dictionary).
510	arise	The dictionary definition of the word “arise” does not compel such a reading; to the contrary, it can be used to support either party's position. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 117 (1966) (arise defined as “to come into being”; “to come about”; or “to become apparent in such a way as to demand attention”); Black's Law Dictionary 138 (rev. 4th ed.1968) (“to come into being or notice”). 
511	Appeal	When a sovereign furnishes an opportunity to appeal (as state and federal governments now do), it necessarily invites an appellate court to revisit an initial merits determination. See J. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 148–153 (5th ed. 2019) (describing development of the appeal at common law); G. Jacob, A New Law-Dictionary (1729) (defining “appeal”).
512	incompetency 	it is defined: ‘A relative term without technical meaning. It may be employed as meaning disqualification; inability; incapacity; lack of ability, legal qualifications, or fitness to discharge the required duty.’ In Black's Law Dictionary, 3rd edition, page 945, and in 1 Bouv.Law Dict., Rawle's Third Revision, p. 1528, it is defined as ‘Lack of ability or fitness to discharge the required duty.’ Cases construing the word to the same effect are found in 4 Words and Phrases, First Series, page 3510, and 2 Words and Phrases, Second Series, page 1013.* Webster's New International Dictionary defines it as ‘want of physical, intellectual, or moral ability; insufficiency; inadequacy; specif., want of legal qualifications or fitness.’ Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary defines it as ‘General lack of capacity of fitness, or lack of the special qualities required for a particular purpose.‘‘
513	taxable	"As San Antonio notes, the word ""taxable"" can be used to describe something that may, but need not necessarily, be taxed. See, e.g., Random Hosue Dictionary of the English Language 1947 (2d ed. 1987) (defining ""taxable"" as ""capable of being taxed""); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2345 (1976) (same).... "
514	credibility	It's easy enough to imagine that a factfinder might not describe the plaintiff as lacking credibility—in the sense that she was lying or not “worthy of belief,” Black's Law Dictionary 448 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “credibility”)—yet find that her testimony on a key fact was outweighed by other evidence and thus unpersuasive or insufficient to prove the defendant's liability.
515	decision	"""But like the majority, I reject T–Mobile's contention that the term “decision” inherently demands a statement of reasons. Dictionary definitions support that conclusion."""
516	Jurisdiction	Thus, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1227 (1976) broadly defines “jurisdiction” as, among other things, “the limits or territory within which any particular power may be exercised: sphere of authority.”
517	plain	According to the 1934 edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, plain means “clear” or “manifest,”
518	"stare decisis
"	Stare decisis (“to stand by things decided”) is the legal term for fidelity to precedent. Black's Law Dictionary 1696 (11th ed. 2019).
519	question	"""A question' is ordinarily understood to be '[a] subject or point open to controversy.' American Heritage Dictionary 1483 (3d ed.1992). See also Black's Law Dictionary 1366 (9th ed.2009)"" "
520	institute	Today, as in 1934, the word “institute” is commonly understood to mean “inaugurate or commence; as to institute an action.” Black's Law Dictionary 985–986 (3d ed. 1933) (citing cases); see Black's Law Dictionary 800 (6th ed. 1990) (same definition); Random House Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language 988 (2d ed. 1987) (“to set in operation; to institute a lawsuit”)
521	collateral	The term “collateral,” in its “customary and preferred sense,” Williams, supra, at 431, 120 S.Ct. 1479, means “[l]ying aside from the main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; ... subordinate, indirect,” 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473 (2d ed.1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter Webster's) (“accompanying as ... secondary,” “indirect,” or “ancillary”). By definition, something that is “collateral” is “indirect,” not *552 direct. 3 OED 473.
522	interpreter,interpret	"""In short, employing the word 'interpreters' to include translators of written as well as oral speech, if not “the most common usage,” ante, at 2003, is at least an 'acceptable' usage""Moreover, the word “interpret” is generally understood to mean “to explain or tell the meaning of: translate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,” while “translate” commonly means “to turn into one's own or another language.” Webster's 1182, 2429. See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744, 1505 (1973) (defining the transitive verb “interpret” as, inter alia, “to translate,” and “translate” as “to turn (something written or spoken) from one language into another”)."
523	Afiidavit	The documents at issue here, while denominated by Massachusetts law “certificates,” are quite plainly affidavits: “declaration [s] of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths.” Black's Law Dictionary 62 (8th ed.2004). They are incontrovertibly a “ ‘solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.’ ” Crawford, supra, at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)).
524	Offence,Offense	And the term “ ‘[o]ffence’ was commonly understood in 1791 to mean ‘transgression,’ that is, ‘the Violation or Breaking of a Law.’ ” Grady, 495 U.S. at 529, 110 S.Ct. 2084 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Dictionarium Britannicum (Bailey ed. 1730)).
525	seaworthiness	Bouvier's Law Dictionary, vol. 2, p. 506, defines ‘seaworthiness' to be: ‘In maritime law, the sufficiency of the vessel in materials, construction, equipment, officers, men, and outfit for the trade or service in which it is employed.’ And the same author further says: ‘It can never be settled by positive rules of law how far this obligation of seaworthiness extends in any particular case, for the reason that improvements and changes in the means and modes of navigation frequently require new implements or new forms of old ones; and these, though not *9 necessary at first, become so when there is an established usage that all ships of a certain quality, or those to be sent on certain voyages or used for certain purposes, shall have them.’ 
526	residence	"""In the law, 'residence' can mean…Lay definitions of “residence” similarly describe a specific location… It follows that a 'place of residence' describes a 'physical' location in which a child 'actually lives.'"" "
527	gift inter vivos	But if this transaction is held not to be such a sale as passed the title absolutely to Mrs. Mahan, it must be held to be a gift inter vivos. The learned Dr. Bouvier in his Law Dictionary2 states the rule to be, that such a gift, when  completed by delivery, passes the title to the thing, so that it cannot be recovered back by the giver; and such is no doubt the rule.
528	intervene	Literally, to intervene means, as the derivation of the word indicates [inter, between, and venire, come], to come between. Such is the primary definition of the word given in Webster's Dictionary and in the Century Dictionary. When the term is used in reference to legal proceedings, it covers the right of one to interpose in, or become a party to, a proceeding already instituted
529	quiet title	"""That term is universally understood to refer to suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else's claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed property. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009)"" "
530	valuation	 In its unmodified form, the word “valuation” means '[t]he estimated worth of a thing.'
531	garnishment	Ordinarily, a hearing must be held before the attachment takes place”); id., at 689 (defining “garnishment” as “[a] **1025 judicial proceeding in which a creditor (or potential creditor) asks the court to order a third party who is indebted to or is bailee for the debtor to turn over to the creditor any of the debtor's property”). 
532	mainprise, mainprize	Mainprise or mainprize is a “writ ordering the sheriff to take ... security ... for the prisoner's appearance and release the prisoner.” Black's Law Dictionary 1142 (11th ed. 2019).
533	Money	And when Congress adopted the Act in 1937, “money” was ordinarily understood to mean currency “issued by [a] recognized *2071 authority as a medium of exchange.” Webster's New International Dictionary 1583 (2d ed. 1942); see also 6 Oxford English Dictionary 603 (1st ed. 1933) (“In mod[ern] use commonly applied indifferently to coin and to such promissory documents representing coin (esp. government and bank notes) as are currently accepted as a medium of exchange”); Black's Law Dictionary 1200 (3d ed. 1933) (in its “popular sense, ‘money’ means any currency, tokens, bank-notes, or other circulating medium in general use as the representative of value”); Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. Virginia, 347 U.S. 359, 365, 74 S.Ct. 558, 98 L.Ed. 757 (1954) (“[M]oney ... is a medium of exchange”). 
534	consolidate	When Rule 42(a) was adopted, the term was generally defined, as it is now, as meaning to “unite, as various particulars, into one mass or body; to bring together in close union; to combine.” Webster's New International Dictionary 570 (2d ed. 1942). Consolidation can thus sometimes signify the complete merger of discrete units: “The company consolidated two branches.” But the term can also mean joining together discrete units without causing them to lose their independent character. The United States, for example, is composed of States “unite[d], as various particulars, into one mass or body,” “br[ought] together in close union,” or “combine[d].” Yet all agree that entry *1125 into our Union “by no means implies the loss of distinct and individual existence ... by the States.” 
535	Such	Both at the time of enactment and today, the adjective “such” means “[o]f the kind or degree already described or implied.” H. Fowler & F. Fowler, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English 1289 (5th ed. 1964); Black's Law Dictionary 1661 (10th ed. 2014) (“[t]hat or those; having just been mentioned”). 
536	"""To define"""	To “define” is “to decide upon,” 4 Oxford English Dictionary 383 (2d ed. 1989), or “to settle” or “to establish or prescribe authoritatively,” Black's Law Dictionary 380 (5th ed.1979). 
537	visitation	 ‘Visitation’ is defined by Bouvier (Law Dict. vol. 2, p. 1199) as follows: ‘The act of examining into the affairs of a corporation.
538	physical force	In sum, “physical force,” or “force capable of causing physical pain or injury,” Johnson, 559 U.S., at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265 includes the amount of force necessary to overcome a victim's resistance.
539	employee	Employees are generally understood as those who work “in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.” Black's Law Dictionary, at 639.
540	individual,person	Although in ordinary usage both “individual” and “person” often refer to an individual human being, see, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1152, 1686 (1986) (“individual” defined as a “single human being”; “person” defined as “an individual human being”), “person” often has a broader meaning in the law, see, e.g., 1 U.S.C. § 1 (“person” includes “corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals”).
541	statute	In usage, ‘statute’ is a term which has both a restricted and a broad signification. This is reflection in the following excerpt from Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawle's Revision: ‘Statute.-A law established by the act of the legislative power. An act of the Legislature. The written will of the Legislature, solemnly expressed according to the forms necessary to constitute it the law of the state.
542	Prospectus	When the 1933 Act was drawn and adopted, the term “prospectus” was well understood to refer to a document soliciting the public to acquire securities from the issuer. See Black's Law Dictionary 959 (2d ed. 1910) (defining “prospectus” as a “document published by a company ... or by personsacting  as its agents or assignees, setting forth the nature and objects of an issue of shares ... and inviting the public to subscribe to the issue”).
543	send 	"""And it certainly derives no support from the use of the word 'send,' whose ordinary meaning is broad enough to cover the transmission of any judicial documents (including litigation-initiating documents)"""
544	resulting from	 The phrase “resulting from” means “proceed[ing], *221 spring[ing], or aris[ing] as a consequence, effect, or conclusion.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1937 (1971). 
545	Recognize	A common—and in context the most natural—definition of the word “recognize” is “to acknowledge or treat as valid.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1611 (2d ed.1987).
546	conduct	The term, when used as a noun, is defined by the majority's chosen dictionary as, for example, “carrying forward” or “carrying out,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 473 (1976), phrases without any implication of direction or control. 
547	concrete	"""A 'concrete' injury must be 'de facto '; that is, it must actually exist. See Black's Law Dictionary 479 (9th ed. 2009). When we have used the adjective 'concrete,' we have meant to convey the usual meaning of the term—'real,' and not 'abstract.'"""
548	liability	"Similarly, a 'liability' is 'an obligation one is bound in law or justice to perform.'"" Id., at 823  Salinas v. United States R.R. Ret. Bd., 141 S. Ct. 691, 702 (2021). "
549	make	It is entirely natural to regard an employment decision as being “made” at the time when the outcome is actually determined and not during events leading up to that decision. See American Heritage Dictionary, at 788 (def. 10) (defining “make” as “[t]o arrive at” a particular conclusion, i.e., to “make a decision”).
550	fine	In defining the word “fine,” some 18th–century dictionaries did not mention to whom the money was paid. See, e.g., T. Sheridan, A Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1796) (unpaginated) (“a mulct [or] a pecuniary punishment”); S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785) (unpaginated) (“a mulct [or] pecuniary punishment,” a “penalty,” or “money paid for any exemption or liberty”). To the same effect are some 19th–century dictionaries. See, e.g., 1 C. Richardson, A New Dictionary of the English Language 796 (1839) ( “any thing (as a sum of money) paid at the end, to make an end, termination or conclusion of a suit, of a prosecution”).
551	under	"""The word 'under' can mean [i]n accordance with. 18 Oxford English Dictionary 950 (2d ed.1989). See also Black's Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed. 1990) ('according to')."""
552	maximum	Giving the words used their “ordinary meaning,” Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990), we find that the word “maximum” most naturally connotes the “greatest quantity or value attainable in a given case.” Webster's New International Dictionary 1396 (2d ed. 1958); Black's Law Dictionary 979 (6th ed. 1990) (“The highest or greatest amount, quality, value, or degree”).
553	person, corporation	"""This position accorded with the common understanding among contemporary commentators that corporations were 'persons' in the general enjoyment of the capacity to sue and be sued. See, e.g., 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 332 (6th ed. 1856) (def. 2: The term 'person' 'is also used to denote a corporation which is an artificial person')""   "
554	use, to cane	Surely petitioner's treatment of his MAC–10 can be described as “use” within the everyday meaning of that term. Petitioner “used” his MAC–10 in an attempt to obtain drugs by offering to trade it for cocaine. Webster's *229 defines “to use” as “[t]o convert to one's service” or “to employ.” Webster's New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed. 1939). Black's Law Dictionary contains a similar definition: “[t]o make use of; to convert to one's service; to employ; to avail oneself of; to utilize; to carry out a purpose or action by means of.” Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990).
555	incurred by the estate	To “incur,” one *must “ suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).” Black's Law Dictionary 836 (9th ed.2009); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1146 (1976) ( “to ... become liable or subject to: bring down upon oneself”); Random House Dictionary 722 (1966) (“to become liable or subject to through one's own action; bring upon oneself”).
556	redress	“Redress” means “reparation of, satisfaction or compensation for, a wrong sustained or the loss resulting from this.” Oxford English Dictionary (1933). 
557	conspiracy	Tomlin says that 'the word conspiracy was formerly used almost exclusively for an agreement of two or more persons falsely to indict one, or to procure him to be indicted, of felony;' but that 'now it is no less commonly used for the unlawful combinations of journeymen to raise their wages, or to refuse working, except on certain stipulated conditions.
558	common law	What is the common law?...In Black's Law Dictionary, page 232, it is thus defined: ‘As distinguished from law created by the enactment of legislatures, the common law comprises the body of those principles and rules of action relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts...’
559	Wanton	the term would have been understood by laymen to require some sort of evil or dissolute intention. See Stormonth's English Dictionary 1146 (1885); Webster's Dictionary 1490 (1869); Worcester's Dictionary 1645 (1860). “Wantonly” most frequently was defined as “lewdly” which in turn was regarded as synonymous with “wickedly.” Webster's Dictionary 768 (1869); Worcester's Dictionary 834 (1860). 
560	usufructuary rights	"Usufructuary rights are 'a real right of limited duration on the property of another.'"" at 217-18. "
561	stay	First, a stay is “a kind of injunction,” Black's 1413
562	arms	The 18th-century meaning is no different from the meaning today. The 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary defined “arms” as “[w]eapons of offence, or armour of defence.” 1 Dictionary of the English Language 106 (4th ed.) (reprinted 1978) (hereinafter Johnson). Timothy Cunningham's important 1771 legal dictionary defined “arms” as “any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.” 1 A New and Complete Law Dictionary; see also N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1989) (hereinafter Webster) (similar).
563	contrary to	The simplest and first definition of “contrary to” as a phrase is “in conflict with.” Webster's *389 Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 285 (1983). 
564	Conflict of Interest	Thus, the employer has an “interest ... conflicting with that of the beneficiaries,” the type of conflict that judges must take into account when they review the discretionary acts of a trustee of a common-law trust. Restatement § 187, Comment d; see also Firestone, supra, at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948 (citing that Restatement comment); cf. Black's Law Dictionary 319 (8th ed.2004) (“[C]onflict of interest” is a “real or seeming incompatibility between one's private interests and one's public or fiduciary duties”). 
565	blasphemy	The same dictionaries defined ‘blasphemy,’ a peculiarly verbal offense, in much broader terms than ‘sacrilege,’ indeed in terms which the New York court finds encompassed by ‘sacrilegious.’ For example, Barclay said ‘blasphemy’ is ‘an offering some indignity to God, any person of the Trinity, any messengers from God, his holy writ, or the doctrines of revelation.
566	Turpitude	Black's Law Dictionary defines turpitude as: ‘(I)nherent baseness or vileness of principle or action; shameful wickedness; depravity.’ 
567	shall be made	“[S]hall be made” is a form of the verb “to make,” which means “to bring into existence,” “to produce,” “to render,” and “to cause to be or become.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language, at 866. Thus, “shall be made” means “shall be produced,” etc. And the imperative mood, denoting a duty, see Black's Law Dictionary 1233 (5th ed. 1979), emphasizes the importance of avoiding the taint.
568	Impost	The Maine property tax at issue here is almost certainly not an impost, for, as 18th-century usage of the word indicates, an impost was a tax levied on goods at the time of importation. See, e.g., The Observer-No. XII, Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer, Jan. 7, 1790, p. 1, col. 2 (“[I]mpost is a tax on merchandize, payable at the port of entry”);19 N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26 ed. 1789) (defining “impost” as “a tax or tribute, but more especially such as is received by a prince or state, for goods brought into any haven from other nations”)
569	bear arms	 The term “bear arms” is a familiar idiom; when used unadorned by any additional words, its meaning is “to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight.” 1 Oxford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed.1989). 
570	now	At that time, the primary definition of “now” was “[a]t the present time; at this moment; at the time of speaking.” Webster's New International Dictionary 1671 (2d ed.1934); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1262 (3d ed.1933) (defining “now” to mean “[a]t this time, or at the present moment,” and noting that “ ‘[n]ow’ as used in a statute ordinarily refers to the date of its taking effect ...” (emphasis added)).
571	trafficking	"""We explained in Lopez that 'ordinarily ‘trafficking’ means some sort of commercial dealing."" "
572	encumbrance	A lease, if not terminable at will by the State or terminable automatically upon sale or condemnation, is clearly an 'encumbrance.' 7 G. Thompson, Real Property s 3183, p. 277 (1962); 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1530 (8th ed. 1914).
573	disclaimer	A disclaimer is a refusal to accept property.
574	Confidential	After all, the word “confidential” sometimes refers, at least in the national security context, to information the disclosure of which would cause harm. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 476 (1966) (defining “confidential” to mean “characterized by or relating to information considered prejudicial to a country's interests”); Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 237 (1974) (defining “confidential” to mean “containing information whose unauthorized disclosure could be prejudicial to the national interest”).
575	Veto	In constitutional terms, ‘veto’ is used to describe the President's power under Art. I, § 7, of the Constitution.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 925, n. 2, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 2771, n. 2, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983) (citing Black's Law Dictionary 1403 (5th ed.1979)).
576	Willful	The word “willful” is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as “voluntary” or “intentional.” Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed.1979).
577	use	First, the word “use” in that provision is best read to require intentional conduct. As the majority recognizes, the noun “use” means “the ‘act of employing’ something.” Ante, at 2278 (quoting dictionaries). A “use” is “[t]he act of employing a thing for any ... purpose.” 19 Oxford English Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 1989). To “use” something, in other words, is to employ the thing for its instrumental value, i.e., to employ the thing to accomplish a further goal. See United States v. Castleman, 572 U.S. 157, 171, 134 S.Ct. 1405, 1414–1415, 188 L.Ed.2d 426 (2014). A “use,” therefore, is an inherently intentional act—that is, an act done for the purpose of causing certain consequences or at least with knowledge that those consequences will ensue. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 8A, p. 15 (1965) (defining intentional acts).
578	prosecution	A supervised-release revocation proceeding is not part of the criminal prosecution that landed a defendant in prison in the first place because “[a] ‘criminal prosecution’ ... ends when sentence has been pronounced on the convicted or a verdict of ‘Not guilty’ has cleared the defendant of the charge.” F. Heller, Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 54 (1951). This follows from the early understanding that a “prosecution” concludes when a court enters final judgment. See, e.g., Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (defining a prosecution as the “process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment” (emphasis added)); The Universal English Dictionary 465 (J. Craig ed. 1869) (“[T]he institution of legal proceedings against a person; the process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment” (emphasis added)); H. Holthouse, New Law Dictionary 344 (1847) (defining prosecution as “the means adopted to bring a supposed offender to justice and punishment by due course of law”); Bouvier Law Dictionary 396 (“The means adopted to bring a supposed offender to justice and punishment by due course of law”).
579	services 	"""The word 'services' ordinarily refers to 'labor performed for another.' "
580	curriculum 	The common meaning of the term “curriculum” is “the whole body of courses offered by an educational institution or one of its branches.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 557 (1976); see also Black's Law Dictionary 345 (5th ed. 1979) (“The set of studies or courses for a particular period, designated by a school or branch of a school”). Cf. Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S., at 271, 108 S.Ct., at 570 (high school newspaper produced as part of the school's journalism class was part of the curriculum). 
581	sheriff	Their functions and duties pertain chiefly to the affairs of state in the county”); 3 J. Bouvier, Bouvier's Law Dictionary 3058 (8th ed.1914) (defining sheriff as “[a] county officer representing the executive or administrative power of the state within his county”).
582	filed	"""An application is 'filed,' as that term is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record. See... Black's Law Dictionary 642 (7th ed.1999) (defining 'file' as '[t]o deliver a legal document to the court clerk or record custodian for placement into the official record')."" "
583	debt for	"instead, 'debt for' is used throughout to mean 'debt as a result of,' 'debt with respect to,' 'debt by reason of,' and the like, see American Heritage Dictionary 709 (3d ed.1992); Black's Law Dictionary 644 (6th ed.1990), connoting broadly any liability arising from the specified object"" "
584	plaintiff	"The term “plaintiff” is among the most commonly understood of legal terms of art: It means a “party who brings a civil suit in a court of law.” Black's Law Dictionary 1267 (9th ed. 2009) see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1729 (1961)"""
585	substantive law, substance 	The word “substantive” in § 1395hh(e)(1) modifies the word “change,” and the phrase “substantive change” has a known meaning in the law. It refers to a change to the substance of a rule, rather than a technical change to its form. See, e.g., Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 572 U.S. 273, 282, 134 S.Ct. 1422, 188 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014) (noting that statutory recodification “did not effect any ‘substantive change’ ” to the law); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1469 (8th ed. 2004) (defining “substance” as, inter alia, “the essential quality of something, as opposed to its mere form” (emphasis added)).
586	in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis'	The common-law defense at issue in this case derives from the Latin, in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis: “In a case of equal or mutual fault ... the position of the [defending] party ... is the better one.”
587	keep	We turn to the phrases “keep arms” and “bear arms.” Johnson defined “keep” as, most relevantly, “[t]o retain; not to lose,” and “[t]o have in custody.” Johnson 1095. Webster defined it as “[t]o hold; to retain in one's power or possession.” No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of “keep Arms.” Thus, the most natural reading of “keep Arms” in the Second Amendment is to “have weapons.”
588	physical force	And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.” Ibid.*** (it = Black's Law Dictionary)
589	punishment	At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the word “punishment” referred to the penalty imposed for the commission of a crime [cites to both legal and ordinary dictionaries from the founding era]….  That is also the primary definition of the word today. As a legal term of art, 'punishment' has always meant a 'fine, penalty, or confinement inflicted upon a person by the authority of the law and the judgment and sentence of a court, for some crime or offense committed by him.' Black's Law Dictionary 1234 (6th ed. 1990). And this understanding of the word, of course, does not encompass a prisoner's injuries that bear no relation to his sentence.
590	collect a debt	"In ordinary English, a lawyer who regularly tries to obtain payment of consumer debts through legal proceedings is a lawyer who regularly 'attempts' to 'collect' those consumer debts. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 263 (6th ed. 1990) ('To collect a debt or claim is to obtain payment or liquidation of it, either by personal solicitation or legal proceedings')."""
591	Maintain	While § 216(b) provides *695 that an action “may be maintained ... in any ... State court of competent jurisdiction,” the word “maintain” enjoys a breadth of meaning that leaves its bearing on removal ambiguous at best. “To maintain an action” may mean “to continue” to litigate, as opposed to “commence” an action.1 Black's Law **1885 Dictionary 1143 (3d ed.1933). But “maintain” in reference to a legal action is often read as “bring” or “file”; “[t]o maintain an action or suit may mean to commence or institute it; the term imports the existence of a cause of action.” Ibid.; see 1A J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 0.167[5], p. 472 (2d ed.1996)(calling the “ ‘may be maintained’ ” language an “ambiguous phrase” and “certainly not an express provision against removal within the meaning of § 1441”); 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3729, p. 235 (1998)(referring to “use of the ambiguous term ‘maintain’ in the statute”).
592	determine	“[D]etermine” can mean “[t]o fix conclusively or authoritatively,” Webster's New International Dictionary 711 (2d ed.1954) (2d definition), but it can also mean “[t]o set bounds or limits to,”
593	A true 'Direct Action'	A true “direct action” suit is “[a] lawsuit by a person claiming against an insured but suing the insurer directly instead of pursuing compensation indirectly through the insured.” Black's Law Dictionary 491 (8th ed.2004). 
594	court	In common legal parlance, the word “court” can mean “[t]he judge or judges, as distinguished from the counsel or jury.” Webster's New International Dictionary 611 (2d ed.1949) (def. 10d). But it also has a broader meaning, which includes both judge and jury. See, e.g., ibid. (def. 10b: “The persons duly assembled under authority of law for the administration of justice”); Black's Law Dictionary 318 (5th ed.1979) (“... A body organized to administer justice, and including both judge and jury”). 
595	Sale	And though there is some controversy whether, in reference to personal property, the consideration is not to be paid in money, the use of the old phrase ‘bargain and sale,’ in regard to land, never required that the consideration should be exclusively a money payment. 2 Bouv. Law Dict. p. 494, cl. 6, ‘Sale.’
596	decision	"""The suggestion that a wrong state-court 'decision' - a legal judgment rendered 'after consideration of facts, and … law,' - may no longer be redressed through habeas (because it is unreachable under the 'unreasonable application' phrase) is based on a mistaken insistence that the § 2254(d)(1) phrases have not only independent, but mutually exclusive, meanings."" "
597	threat	In my view, the term “threat” in § 875(c) can fairly *744 be defined as a statement that is reasonably interpreted as “an expression of an intention to inflict evil, injury, or damage on another.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2382 (1976).
598	Contribution	Contribution  is defined as the “tortfeasor's right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.” Black's Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed.2004).
599	entitled	"Thus, if a party is awarded costs under subdivision (a), it is ""entitled"" to those costs-- i.e., has a right to obtain them and not merely to seek them-- when a proper application is made in the district court. See Black's Law Dictionary 626 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (""In its usual sense, to entitle is to give a right or title"")"
600	actual posession	"""Actual possession exists when a person has direct physical control over a thing. See Black's Law Dictionary"" at 626"
601	conduct	As a verb, “conduct” means to lead, run, manage, or direct. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 474 (1976).
602	remedy, procedure	It seems to me that the method of arriving at and distributing the damages pertains to procedure or remedy,—that is to say, to the course of the court after parties are brought in, and the means of redressing the wrong,—and I think the general rule that procedure and remedy are regulated by the law of the forum is applicable.
603	Right of action	In 1966, when § 2415(a) was enacted, a commonly used legal dictionary defined the term “right of action” as “[t]he right to bring suit; a legal right to maintain an action,” with “suit” meaning “any proceeding ... in a court of justice.” Black's Law Dictionary 1488, 1603 (4th ed.1951)
604	boycott	"The generic concept of boycott refers to a method of pressuring a party with whom one has a dispute by witholding, or enlisting others to withhold, patronage or services from the target."""
605	copyright	A copyright, as the term imports, involves the right of publication and reproduction of works of art or literature. A copyright, as defined by Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawles's edition … is the exclusive privilege, secured according to certain legal forms, of printing, or otherwise multiplying, publishing, and vending copies of certain literary or artistic productions
606	Freight	While many of the lexicographers, such as Webster, Worcester, and the Imperial Dictionary, still define ‘freight’ as the sum paid by a party hiring a ship or **488 part of a ship, or for the carriage of goods, in the Century Dictionary it is said to be, in a more general sense, the price paid for the use of a ship, including the transportation of passengers. Similar definitions are given in the law dictionaries of Burrill, Bouvier, and Anderson. See, also, Ben. Adm. §§ 283, 286, and 288.
607	public health	They begin with the object of § 109(b)(1)' s focus, the “public health.” When the term first appeared in federal clean air legislation—in the Act of July 14, 1955 (1955 Act), 69 Stat. 322, which expressed “recognition of the dangers to the public health” from air pollution—its ordinary meaning was “[t]he health of the community.” Webster's New International Dictionary 2005 (2d ed.1950). Respondents argue, however, that § 109(b)(1), as added by the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, meant to use the term's secondary meaning: “[t]he ways and means of conserving the health *466 of the members of a community, as by preventive medicine, organized care of the sick, etc.” Ibid. 
608	Malice	“Malice” was defined by a dictionary published at the approximate time § 1983 was enacted as “extreme enmity of heart; a disposition to injure others unjustly for personal gratification or from a spirit of revenge; spite; deliberate mischief.” Stormonth's English Dictionary 584 (1884). See also Webster's Dictionary 804 (1869); Worcester's Dictionary 873 (1860); II Abbott's Law Dictionary 72 (1879) ( “a malignant design of evil ... is the idea attached to the word in popular use”).
609	injure	To “injure” is, among other things, “to impair.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 623 (1983).
610	suit 	Different words are certainly employed in the two provisions, but it is difficult to see ... in what respect the difference of phraseology supports the theory of the defendants, as ‘a suit by a plaintiff against a defendant’ must mean substantially the same thing in the practical sense as ‘a suit in which there is controversy between the parties,’ as each provision includes the word suit, which applies to any proceeding in a court of justice in which the plaintiff pursues his remedy to recover a right or claim. 
611	renumeration	And “remuneration” means “a quid pro quo,” “recompense” or “reward” for such services. Id., at 1528. 
612	Brought	But a natural reading of § 27's text does not extend so far. “Brought” in this context means “commenced,” Black's Law Dictionary 254 (3d ed. 1933); “ to” is a word “expressing purpose [or] consequence,” The Concise Oxford Dictionary 1288 (1931); and “enforce” means “give force [or] effect to,” 1 Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1927).
613	Monopoly	The idea of monopoly involves something more than a mere acquisition of the whole, or of the major part, of a commodity or of shares of stock. It involves the idea of exclusion of other supply, as well as inclusion of what is actually acquired. Re Greene, 52 Fed. 104; Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 606, 9 L. ed. 847; 20 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, p. 846; 2 Bouvier, Law Dict. Rawle's ed. p. 435; 4 Bl. Com. 159; Century Dict. Monopoly; United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. 171 U. S. 505, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25. 
614	Imprisonment	“Imprisonment” as used in the clause most naturally means “[t]he state of being confined” or “a period of confinement.” Black's Law Dictionary 825 (9th ed.2009); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1137 (1993) (the “state of being imprisoned”). 
615	Charge	Dictionaries define a “charge” as an accusation or indictment. *409 See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 312 (4th ed.2000); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 377 (1993). In legal parlance, a “charge” is generally a formal allegation of wrongdoing that initiates legal proceedings against an alleged wrongdoer. In criminal law, for example, a charge is defined as “[a] formal accusation of an offense as a preliminary step to prosecution.” Black's Law Dictionary 248 (8th ed.2004). 
616	redistrict	The word “redistricted” also is not hard to comprehend. Id., at 980 (defining “redistrict” to mean “to divide anew into districts”); Black's Law Dictionary 1283 (7th ed.1999) (defining “redistrict” to mean “[t]o organize into new districts, esp. legislative ones; reapportion”). 
617	award	The transitive verb “ ‘award’ ” has a settled meaning in the litigation context: It means “[t]o give or assign by sentence or judicial determination.” Black's Law Dictionary 125 (5th ed.1979) (emphasis added); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 152 (1993) (“to give by judicial decree” (emphasis added)).
618	punishable 	The interpretation advocated by respondents and adopted by the CAAF finds support at first blush in contemporaneous dictionary definitions of the term “punishable.” (cites numerous dictionaries). But upon inspection, definitions shed little light on the dispute because they largely re-raise the question over which the parties divide: capable of being punished under what law?
619	describe	"""The plain language of the statute supports this straightforward approach."" . The word “describe” means to “express,” “portray,” or “represent.” See Black's Law Dictionary 445 (6th ed. 1990); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1986). A description may be “detailed” or it may be general, setting forth only the “recognizable features, or characteristic marks,” of the thing described while leaving the rest to the imagination. 4 Oxford English Dictionary 512 (2d ed. 1989)."
620	legislate	Black's Law Dictionary 910 (7th ed.1999) (defining “legislate” as “[t]o make or enact laws”).
621	action	"""In support of this proposition, the Secretary points out that the '[t]erm [action] in its usual legal sense means a suit brought in a court; a formal complaint within the jurisdiction of a court of law.'"" "
622	Habitual	"Her residence in a particular country can be deemed ""habitual,"" however, only when her residence there is more than transitory. “Habitual” implies “[c]ustomary, usual, of the nature of a habit.” Id., at 640."
623	record	"""A mistried count is therefore nothing like the other forms of record material that Ashe suggested should be part of the preclusion inquiry. Ibid.; see also Black's Law Dictionary 1301 (8th ed.2004) defining 'record' as the “official report of the proceedings in a case, including the filed papers, verbatim transcript of the trial or hearing (if any), and tangible exhibits” "
624	entitle	"""Entitle"" means ""to give… a title, right, or claim to something."" Random House Dictionary of the English Language 649 (2d ed. 1987). See also Black's Law Dictionary 477 (5th ed. 1979) (""to give a right or legal title to""). "
625	extortion	"""The Hobbs Act does not define the term “property,” but even at common law the offense of extortion was understood to include the obtaining of any thing of value...At the time Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, the contemporary edition of Black's Law Dictionary included an expansive definition of the term. See Black's Law Dictionary 1446 (3d ed. 1933)."" "
626	exercise	"To ""exercise"" in the sense relevant here means ""to bring into play"" or ""make effective in action."" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 795 (1993). And to ""exercise"" something like control is ""to put in practice or carry out in action."" Webster's New International Dictionary, at 892. "
627	Unconscionable bargain	That an agreement to pay $1,200 a ton for shucks, actually worth not more than $35 a ton, is a grossly unconscionable bargain, defined in Bouvier's Law Dictionary to be ‘a contract which no man in his senses, not under delusion, would make, on the one hand, and which no fair and honest man would accept on the other,’ nobody can doubt.
628	domestic violence	"""That absurdity is not only at war with the English language, it is flatly inconsistent with definitions of “domestic violence” from the period surrounding § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii)'s enactment.""At the time, dictionaries defined “domestic violence” as, for instance, “[v]iolence between members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault or other violent act committed by one member of a household against another,” Black's Law Dictionary 1564 (7th ed. 1999), and “[v]iolence toward or physical *180 abuse of one's spouse or domestic partner,” American Heritage Dictionary 534 (4th ed. 2000)."
629	scrip	both “scrip and merchandise orders” were frequently used at the time to purchase goods at company stores. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 2249 (defining “scrip” as a “certificate ... issued to circulate in lieu of government currency” or “by a corporation that pays wages partly in orders on a company store”);
630	in limine	In limine' has been defined as '[o]n or at the threshold; at the very beginning; preliminarily.' Black's Law Dictionary 708 (5th ed. 1979). We use the term in a broad sense to refer to any motion, whether made before or during trial, to exclude anticipated prejudicial evidence before the evidence is actually offered.
631	Reside	"A child ""resides"" where she lives. See Black's Law Dictionary 1176 (5th ed. 1979) "
632	contract 	It also creates a “contract” as defined by federal regulations, namely, a “mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services ... and the buyer to pay for them,” including “all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and” (as a general matter) “are in writing.” 48 CFR § 2.101 (2015).
633	Security	The securities other than attachment referred to in this section were manifestly embraced in the class known at common law as ‘personal’ security, as distinguished from ‘real’ security, or security upon property. Sweet, Law Dict. verbo ‘Security.’
634	parens patriae	"""‘Parens patriae,’ literally ‘parent of the country,’ refers traditionally to role of state as sovereign and guardian of persons under legal disability.” Black's Law Dictionary 1003 (5th ed. 1979)"""
635	use	The word “use” in the statute must be given its “ordinary or natural” meaning, a meaning variously defined as “[t]o convert to one's service,” “to employ,” “to avail oneself of,” and “to carry out a purpose or action by means of.” Smith, supra, at 228–229, 113 S.Ct., at 2054 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Webster's New International Dictionary of English Language 2806 (2d ed.1949) and Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed.1990)). These various definitions of “use” imply action and implementation. 
636	Sanction	 A “sanction” (in the sense the word is used here) is “[t]he detriment loss of reward, or other coercive intervention, annexed to a violation of a law as a means of enforcing the law.” Webster's New International Dictionary 2211 (2d ed.1954) (hereinafter Webster's Second); see Black's Law Dictionary 1458 (9th ed. 2009) (“A penalty or coercive measure that results from failure to comply with a law, rule, or order”). A monetary penalty is assuredly one kind of “sanction.” See generally Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U.S. 607, 621, 112 S.Ct. 1627, 118 L.Ed.2d 255 (1992).
637	Force	 In more general usage it means “[s]trength or energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of strength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical relations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint exerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black's Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed.2009) (hereinafter Black's) defines “force” as “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.”  There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the word “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp.2003); accord, Black's 173.  
638	certify,attest	A “certification” requires one “[t]o attest” that the accompanying statements are true. Black's Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed.2009) (definition of “certify”); see also id., at 147 (defining “attest” as “[t]o bear witness; testify,” or “[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to authenticate by signing as a witness”).
639	"service
"	A “service” refers to “duty or labor ... by one person ... bound to submit his will to the direction and control of [another].” Black's Law Dictionary 1607 (3d ed. 1933).
640	substantial	One definition of the word “substantial” is “being largely but not wholly that which is specified.” Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, at 1176. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 564, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (describing different meanings of the term “substantial”). In other words, “substantial” can mean “almost all” of the thing denominated.
641	sacrilegious/profane	"""...the majority [of the New York Court of Appeals] held, first, that 'sacrilegious' was an adequately definite standard, quoting a definition from Frunk & Wagnalls' Dictionary and referring to opinions in this Court that in passing used the term 'profane,' which the New York court said was a synonym of 'sacrilegiious.'"" "
642	keep and bear arms	Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (“keep and bear Arms”) (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: “wear, bear, or carry ... upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose ... of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.”
643	animadvert	To animadvert carried the broader implication of “turn[ing] the attention officially or judicially, tak[ing] legal cognizance of anything deserving of chastisement or censure; hence, to proceed by way of punishment or censure.” 1 Oxford English Dictionary 474 (2d ed.1989). 
644	theft	In defining ‘theft’ Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1953) says: ‘Stealing and theft, esp. in popular use, are broader terms than larceny, and may include swindling as well as embezzlement.’ ‘The term ‘theft,’ sometimes used as a synonym of larceny, is in reality a broader term, applying to all cases of depriving another of his property whether by removing or withholding it, and includes larceny, robbery, cheating, embezzlement, breach of trust, etc.' 13 Encyclopaedia Britannica, Larceny (1953), 720. And see 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary (3d rev. ed. 1914) 3267.
645	Occurred	“[O]ccurred” means that the practice took place or happened in the past.
646	month	The month, by the common law,’ says Tomlins, quoting good authorities, ‘is but 28 days, and in case of a condition for rent, the month shall be thus computed. ….it is declared that the word ‘month’ shall mean a calendar month
647	finding of fact	" A common definition of 'finding of fact' is, for example, '[a] conclusion by way of reasonable inference from the evidence.'"" "
648	forgery	...forgery was looked upon as one of the subdivisions of the crimen falsi, which included forgery, perjury, the alteration of the current coin, dealing with false weights and measures, etc. 1 Bouv. Law Dict. 411.
649	any	We have previously noted that “[r]ead naturally, the word ‘any’ **836 has an expansive meaning, that is, ‘one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.’ ” United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)).
650	intent	That dictionary unsurprisingly defines “purpose” as synonymous with intent, id., at 1400, and “intent” as, among other things, “a state of mind,” id., at 947. 
651	enjoin	It is noteworthy that the term “enjoin” has not just its meaning in the restrictive sense but also has meaning in an affirmative sense. The Black's Law Dictionary current at the TIA's enactment gives as a definition of the term, “to require; command; positively direct.” Black's Law Dictionary 663 (3d ed.1933). 
652	Attorney	The definition of the word “attorney” in Webster's Dictionary reads as follows: “[O]ne who is legally appointed by another to transact business for him; specif: a legal agent qualified to act for suitors and defendants in legal proceedings.” Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 73 (1975).
653	collateral attack'	Respondent, by definition, collaterally attacked his previous convictions; he sought to deprive them of their normal force and effect in a proceeding that had an independent purpose other than to overturn the prior judgments. See Black's Law Dictionary 261 (6th ed. 1990); see also Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 58, 65, 100 S.Ct. 915, 917, 920, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980) (challenge to uncounseled prior conviction used as predicate for subsequent conviction characterized as “collateral”). 
654	license	The word 'license' means permission or authority; and a license to do any particular thing is a permission or authority to do that thing, and, if granted by a person having power to grant it, transfers to the grantee the right to do whatever it purposes to authorize. It certainly transfers to him all the right which the grantor can transfer to do what is within the terms of the license.' A license is a contract. 'It is a right given by some competent authority to do an act which, without such authority, would be illegal.'
655	Habitual	"In 1980, as today, ""habitual"" referred to something that was ""[c]ustomary"" or ""usual."" Black's Law Dictionary 640 (5th ed. 1979); see also 6 Oxford English Dictionary 996 (2d ed. 1989) (""existing as a settled practice or condition; constantly repeated or continued; customary”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1017 (1976) (similar)."
656	physical force	Definitions of “physical force” from the same period are also at odds with the Court's nonviolent interpretation of that phrase. See Black's Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999) (“[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim”); id., at 1147 (6th ed. 1990) (“[f]orce applied to the body; actual violence”).
657	court martial	It is supposed that courts-martial were intended originally to be a partial substitute for the court of chivalry of former times. 3 Christian's Bl. 68, 108; Bouv. Law Dict., tit. Courts-martial. 
658	malice, reckless 	"The terms 'malice' and 'reckless' ultimately focus on the actor's state of mind. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary..."" at 534-535."
659	seized	The word ‘seized’ is not here used in that secondary sense in which it serves to describe the condition of a remainderman or reversioner in respect to his estate, when such estate, not discontinued by any act or neglect of the freeholder having the precedent estate, is perfect and unharmed, and simply awaits the determination of the precedent estate to vest in possession.
660	occupy	Contemporaneous definitions further support a link between occupation and settlement. See W. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 725 (1889) (defining “occupy” as “[t]o hold in possession; to hold or keep for use” and noting that the word “[i]mplies actual use, possession or cultivation by a particular person”); id., at 944 (defining “settle” as “[t]o establish one's self upon; to occupy, reside upon”).
661	confinement/detention	"Had Congress wanted to toll supervised release during pretrial confinement, it could have chosen an alternative to the word 'imprisoned' that more readily conveys that intent, such as 'confined' or 'detained.' See Black's Law Dictionary 362 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “confinement” as “the quality, state, or condition of being imprisoned or restrained”); id., at 543 (defining “detention” as “[t]he act or an instance of holding a person in custody; confinement or compulsory delay"")."" "
662	termination	Rather, we find persuasive the determination of the First Circuit that the definition of 'termination' also includes 'cessation in time.' The First Circuit noted that this definition is included in both Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2359 (1976) (definition of 'terminate') and Black's Law Dictionary 1319 (5th ed. 1979) (definition of 'termination')
663	crime of battery	The classic definition of the crime of battery is the “intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another.” Ante, at 1270 (citing 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 7.15, p. 301 (1986 and Supp.2003); Black's Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed.2009)). 
664	necessary parties	Though the Rule no longer describes such parties as “necessary,” “necessary party” is a term of art whose meaning parallels *603 Rule 19(a)'s requirements. See Black's Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed.1979) (defining “necessary parties” as “those persons who must be joined in an action because, inter alia, complete relief cannot be given to those already parties without their joinder,” and citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)).
665	document	"""What is similar to a 'record' or 'document' but yet is not one?"" Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 550, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1089 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring)…. An e-mail, after all, might not be a “document” if, as was “traditionally” so, a document was a “piece of paper with information on it,” not “information stored on a computer, electronic storage device, or any other medium.” Black's Law Dictionary 587–588 (10th ed. 2014)."
666	Legislation	The proper characterization of governmental power should generally depend on the nature of the power, not on the identity of the person exercising it. See Black's Law Dictionary 899 (6th ed.1990) (defining “legislation” as, inter alia, “[f]ormulation of rule[s] for the future”); 1 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise § 2.3, p. 37 (3d ed. 1994) (“If legislative power means the power to make rules of conduct **921 that bind everyone based on resolution of major policy issues, scores of agencies exercise legislative power routinely by *489 promulgating what are candidly called ‘legislative rules' ”).
667	willfully	“willfully” requires proof only “that the law imposed a duty on the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty,” Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 201, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991)
668	testimony	"If the Rule applies only to sworn statements, it does so not because adversarial fairness implies a limitation, but simply because the word 'testimony' refers only to statements made under oath or affirmation. See Black's Law Dictionary 1476 (6th ed. 1990)."" at 322."
669	try	The word “try,” both in 1787 and later, has considerably broader meanings than those to which petitioner would limit it. Older dictionaries define try as *230 “[t]o examine” or “[t]o examine as a judge.” See 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (1785). In more modern usage the term has various meanings. For example, try can mean “to examine or investigate judicially,” “to conduct the trial of,” or “to put to the test by experiment, investigation, or trial.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2457 (1971). 
670	act	"An ""act"" is ""[s]omething done or performed…; a deed."" Black's Law Dictionary 30 (11th ed. 2019); see also Webster's New International Dictionary 25 (2d ed. 1934) (""that which is done,"" ""the exercise of power,"" a ""deed""). "
671	detain	The dictionary cited by the dissent, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), defines “detain” as follows: “[t]o keep in confinement or under restraint; to keep prisoner.” 4 OED 543 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis added); see also OED (3d ed. 2012), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176 (same). Other general-purpose dictionaries provide similar definitions. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 616 (1961) (“to hold or keep in or as if in custody {ed by the police for questioning}”); Webster's New International Dictionary 710 (2d ed. 1934) (“[t]o hold or keep as in custody”); American Heritage Dictionary 508 (def.2) (3d ed. 1992) (“To keep in custody or temporary confinement”); Webster's New World College Dictionary 375 (3d ed. 1997) (“to keep in custody; confine”). And legal dictionaries define “detain” the same way. See, e.g., Ballentine's Law Dictionary 343 (3d ed. 1969) (“To hold; to keep in custody; to keep”); Black's Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed. 1999) (“The act or fact of holding a person in custody; confinement or compulsory delay”).
672	Surcharge	"Section 518 does not define “surcharge,” but the Court of Appeals looked to the ordinary meaning of the term: “a charge in excess of the usual or normal amount.” 808 F.3d, at 127 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2299 (2002); internal quotation marks omitted). Where a seller posts a single sticker price, it is reasonable to treat that sticker price as the “usual or normal amount” and conclude, as the court below did, that a merchant imposes a surcharge when he charges a credit card user more than that sticker price. In short, we cannot dismiss the Court of Appeals' interpretation of 518 as ""clearly wrong."" "
673	imprison	To be sure, dictionary definitions of the word “imprison” sweep more broadly than just post-trial incarceration
674	relating to	The ordinary meaning of these words is a broad one—“to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with,” Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)—and the words thus express a broad pre-emptive purpose. 
675	aid and abet	That would be a term of breadth indeed, for “aid and abet” “comprehends all assistance rendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, or presence.” Black's Law Dictionary 68 (6th ed. 1990).
676	treaty	"Generally, a treaty is defined as ‘a compact made between two or more independent nations, with a view to the public welfare.’""  (quoting 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1136)."
677	prevail 	In everyday use, “prevail” means “gain victory by virtue of strength or superiority: win mastery: triumph.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1797 (1976). 
678	court proceeding	"""A court proceeding is defined as “[a]n act or step that is part of a larger action” and “an act done by the *219 authority or direction of the court.” "
679	defendant 	According to legal as well as standard dictionary definitions available in 2005, a “defendant” is a “person sued in a civil proceeding,” Black's Law Dictionary 450 (8th ed. 2004), and the term is “opposed to” (contrasted with) the word “plaintiff,” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 591 (2002) (Webster). 
680	Forthwith	lthough we have never undertaken to define “forthwith” as it is used in the SAA, it is clear that the term “connotes action which is immediate, without delay, prompt, and with reasonable dispatch.” Amella v. United States, 732 F.2d 711, 713 (C.A.9 1984) (citing Black's Law Dictionary 588 (5th ed.1979)).
681	civil action	Black's Law Dictionary defines a “civil action” as identical to an “action at law,” which in relevant part is defined as a “civil suit stating a legal cause of action.” Black's 32–33, 279 (9th ed. 2009); see also id., at 222 (5th ed. 1979).
682	execution	The execution of the bond included its signing, sealing, and delivery
683	Offense	At the time of both the 1948 and 2008 amendments to the Act, the primary definition of “offense” in Black's Law Dictionary referred to crime. Black's Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed. 2004) (Black's) (“A violation of the law; a crime, often a minor one. See CRIME”); id., at 1232 (4th ed. 1951) (“A crime or misdemeanor; a breach of the criminal laws”); id., at 1282 (3d ed. 1933) (same). The 1942 edition of Webster's similarly states that “offense” “has no technical legal meaning; but it is sometimes used specifically for an indictable crime ... and sometimes for a misdemeanor or wrong punishable only by fine or penalty.” Webster's New International Dictionary 1690 (2d ed.). See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1566 (1976) (Webster's Third) (“an infraction of law: CRIME, MISDEMEANOR”); American Heritage Dictionary 1255 (3d ed. 1992) (“A transgression of law; a crime”). It is true that the term “offense” is sometimes used more broadly. For instance, the 1948 edition of Ballentine's Law Dictionary cautions: “The words ‘crime’ and ‘offense’ are not necessarily synonymous. All crimes are offenses, but some offenses are not crimes.” Ballentine's Law Dictionary 900.
684	Appurtenance	Of what use would the immunity be when there was no property to which it could apply? Further than this, there would be ground to argue that in a stricter sense the word appurtenances would include the immunity.
685	device	A “ ‘device,’ ” we have observed, is simply “ ‘[t]hat which is devised, or formed by design’ ”; a “ ‘scheme’ ” is a “ ‘project,’ ” “ ‘plan[,] or program of something to be done’ ”; and an “ ‘artifice’ ” is “ ‘an artful stratagem or trick.’ ” Id., at 696, n. 13, 100 S.Ct. 1945 (quoting Webster's International Dictionary 713, 2234, 157 (2d ed. 1934) (Webster's Second)).
686	actual damages,compensatory damages	At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black's Law Dictionary defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substantial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a complainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or injury” and as “[s]ynonymous with ‘compensatory damages.’ ” Black's Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed.1968) (hereinafter Black's).
