0	I'm in Missouri. My boss claims that because of IRS requirements I cannot be paid drive time to our second office. Unless I clock in at our main office and ride in the company car with others. Is this company policy? Or is this actually an IRS requirement.	Yes
1	Long story short, I am a college aged female from Lexington, Kentucky, who found what was seemingly the perfect job at the beginning of this year. I'm a psychology major, and I found work as an office assistant at a private practice for a local neuropsychologist. I was so proud of myself for landing the position. I was getting great experience and it was going to look amazing on my resume. The atmosphere was relaxed and I genuinely enjoyed the work.   Sometimes my 57 year old boss (the doctor himself) would make somewhat inappropriate comments about my appearance, or get into personal subjects that made me uncomfortable. He also only seemed to hire college girls. Despite this, I figured he was just a slightly awkward old man until he kept me after work late one day, closed the blinds, grabbed me by the waist and tried to kiss me. I rejected his advances, and ran out to my car where I sobbed hysterically. I emailed him a letter of resignation the next day.  I found out soon after that he did the same thing to my 19 year old female coworker, and a former female employee around our age. I feel deeply disrespected and disgusted. This was someone I looked up to, admired, and trusted. I thought he really appreciated the work I was doing, but I think he just saw me as a piece of meat the whole time. I feel preyed upon and taken advantage of by someone in a position of power over me.   But beyond all of that, I am now extremely worried and stressed out about my financial situation. I never got that many hours, but the job paid decently and was enough to support my spending habits, and now I am suddenly unemployed. I have asked my parents for help temporarily, but there's only so much they are able to do. Obviously I am looking to find a new job, but with searching out positions, applying, and going through the hiring process, then waiting for my first paycheck, I can't imagine I'll have an income again for at least a month.   I am considering suing my ex-boss for workplace harassment and loss of income. I am afraid that if I don't do anything, he will continue to do the same thing to other people. However, I have no idea where to start. There were no witnesses, and what happened that day is basically his word against mine. He's a psychologist, so he knows how to get inside people's heads and twist the truth. However, I do have two other coworkers who quit alongside me (one is the 19 year old girl who he also tried to kiss), as well as corroboration from a girl who used to work there and experienced the same thing.   In addition, he sent all 3 of us who quit a long, insane rambling email that is pretty incriminating. In it, he claims he lost his balance, but also that we tried to seduce him, and he was merely attempting to test how far we'd go. There is almost no way someone could read what he wrote and believe that he's innocent.  Again, I don't know where to start - I don't have money to pay for a lawyer, and I'm afraid of my former boss coming after me. He is a powerful and experienced doctor who probably has lawyers lined up, and I'm a student who's taken one civil law class. On top of all this, I already have two police cases open from previous assaults, and I'm afraid of being called a liar.   Another thing, what if my coworkers don't want to sue? I haven't spoken to them about it yet, and I don't think I could do it without their testimonies.  Please help! How do I proceed from here?	Yes
2	"I have worked for this company since 2009. In 2015 I left for 8 months and when they asked me to come back we negotiated terms. As part of this deal I was now a salaried employee and working mon-Thursday. All was well and fine so I thought. Two months ago I put in a ""time off request"" for 8 working days in late June. The request was accepted and signed by the owner who is my direct boss. And nothing more was said. A week after I got back my boss told me that because I was gone so long I had to ""make up"" days I missed. This bothered me because he never mentioned it before I left or before he signed and agreed. It was only after I was back and he ""realized"" how long I would be gone. That's his fault. So he said I had to make up the days I was gone. He said he would pay me for 40 hours but the rest was on me to make up. I was bothered by it but ok whatever I'll work a Friday or two that's fine.    But then I got an email sunday asking me to fill out a new time sheet for the time I was gone and submit a plan in writing to him to make up the days I missed. Also He wants me to go through all my time sheets since I came back and document any other days he approved for vacation and document those on time sheets and show what days I will make up as well.    Then he is telling me that he is going to give me different vacation allotment because I work 4 days a week (32 total vacation hours per year when everyone else gets 40 hours no matter what) because I am salaried.   So do I have any room to say to him that I am not going to make up time because he did not require me to until after the fact?"	Yes
3	So my question lies within the title. I'm considered an exempt employee making 45k annually. This amount is slightly about the California minimum salary threshold. Based on labor code section 515(c) a work week is considered 40 hours a week. With that said, does Overtime apply after anything over 40 hours worked? Or am I one of the selective few that doesn't receive overtime due to being exempt?  A verbal agreement between my superior was a result of my salary. No contracts or Non-Disclosures have been signed.   Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance.	Yes
4	"My OP here: https://np.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6mtunq/recruiter_pressuring_me_and_sending_red_flags/  (Tenn.) I have no official offer letter, start date, salary, nor do I have that I accepted the job anywhere in writing. I have an email from the recruiter saying she accepted the job for me, but I never responded to it. After I sent an email explaining why I wanted to renege and cancel my contract with the recruitment firm (per my reasons in the original post) and take myself out of the running for the job the recruiter sent me an email stating: ""You signed a waiver that stated that if you accept the offer and don’t show up for the first day of work , accept a counter offer or don’t stay for a minimum of 90 days in that position– that you are financially responsible for the repayment of the placement fee ($9000). I have all the documentation that supports your acceptance and where you state you would tender your resignation and would like to start on the 7th of August""  I said I would LIKE to start on that date, but again, never said I accepted in writing nor was I given a start date or official offer. I spoke to the company who would be hiring me and they are baffled by all of this from the recruiters.   I have a copy of my contract saying: 1. If the Candidate fails to report to work on her/his first day of employment with said employer for no reason or any reason other than major substantiated intervening acts beyond the control of the Candidate (e.g. severe weather, hospitalization, etc.), the Candidate agrees to pay The [recruiters] a fee for the placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate. 2. If the Candidate voluntarily terminates said employment for any reason or is terminated for cause by said employer within the first ninety (90) business days of employment, the Candidate agrees to pay [recruiters] a fee for [recruiters] placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate.   Does this have any ground to stand on?? Can they actually force me to take the job or pay them that fee with nothing in writing?"	Yes
5	"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	Yes
6	"Hello,  Started a new job recently at a restaurant in a busy neighborhood. Not sure on the specifics  of the restaurants income. I worked 50+ (more like 50.5-52.0 hours) on the first week of my work week. I approached my employer after I got my check and my shift was done and asked if I was owed OT for the week I worked 50 hours. My employer said OT is only required for 80+ hours in a TWO week period. I pointed out I had worked 81.80 hours in my pay period and didn't receive 1.80 hours of OT if that was in fact the case. I also told him all of my previous jobs, which admittedly have been big business/corporate (compared to this family owned business) have paid me OT after 40 hours in one week. He gave me a run around and I pretty much got no where with him.  1). Is this legal in MN? Seems MN law dictates OT can only be applied after 48 hours in a 7day period, which still at MINIMUM (correct if wrong) would me I owuld have 2ish hoours of OT.  2). Federal states ""Employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) must receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek of at least one and one-half times their regular rates of pay. "" [here](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/overtimepay) if certaing requirements are met.   AM I getting jipped? Any advice how to handle this? My employer stated he ""would take care of me"" for it but this is the second of three pay checks that seem to have been off. (the second he wrote me a personal check without taking taxes out or not enoug taxes out, I'm not entirely sure)"	Yes
7	I was a misclassified 1099 employee by a company I was with for over a year. I am in the process of filling out the ss8 and I am 100% sure I will be ruled as being an employee. However, in that case I would like the state of IL to investigate overtime wages I have been due that amount to a little over 5k.   Can I file both documents at once?  Or should I wait to file the DOL wage complaint?  In my previous post about this issue I had someone mention I didn't have to wait to file the DOL wage claim but I would like to know how they'd be able to investigate or make a determination if I haven't been ruled an employee yet?   Thanks guys.	Yes
8	"I worked for an IT company and put in my two weeks notice. When I put in my two weeks notice (Resignation) I was told that I would be paid out two weeks and I would go home that day. This is typical in the IT Field. However, I received an email from our COO stating that they are ""modifying"" my resignation to the termination date of when I put in my Two weeks notice (read: not paying me the two weeks out). Is this legal?"	Yes
9	"Thank you for reading this and I understand that this is not exactly the official advice I should run into a courtroom with but I will take any and all advice and suggestions.  Long story short; my wife accepted a post at a summer job for eight weeks and signed a contract for this position.  This post is in New Jersey. The contract is for an 8 week position and she is to be paid $2450 total for all 8 weeks.  First question: As this position requires her to work from at least 8:30 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday, that makes a total of 37.5 official working hours per workweek. She's getting $306.25 per week. That translates to $8.17 an hour and in NJ, minimum wage is $8.44 and hour. Is that legal to hire employees via a contract for under minimum wage? Does it matter if it is a seasonal position?  Second question, going with the 7.5 hours of a work day, she is not given any breaks during the day. She has to set up for the next 'class' and she was told that her break is at 5 PM. Remember, her shift ends at 4 PM. Is that also legal? I thought labor laws required employees to take a break roughly every 5 hours.  Third question; is mandatory orientation and training required to be paid to the new hiree? She was told she had to attend these events which took place on three Saturdays prior to her starting date. Each event was roughly 8 hours. She also has had to work other events prior to the start of job such as a ""meet the parents"" night. She has not seen any compensation for this.  Besides teaching during the 7.5 hours per day, she was told she has to drive a minivan to pick up coworkers and clients and that she would be given $600 as a bonus for the 8 weeks of doing this. That breaks down to $75 per week which is $15 per day. The route is roughly an hour each way and that's not including her time to refuel the vehicle and do the mandatory safety inspection checklist of the vehicle to make sure the vehicle is in proper working conditions.  Furthermore the work van is being rented from a company and my wife's name is not on the contract for the vehicle nor is she listed as an authorized driver for the vehicle.   What would be the ramifications if she was driving the vehicle and something happened? The company she was hired by claims they have their own insurance for the vehicle but with all the other questionable activity, I no longer trust that situation.   Also, what would be the ramifications for her leaving this position before the eight weeks are up? She has a full time job throughout the year but summers are off. This job was mainly just for a little extra summer spending money.  I hope my rant made some sense; I am going by this handle rather than my normal handle to avoid having her identity exposed. Thank you all for your help, time, and support."	Yes
10	Hello everyone,  I am a real estate agent. When I first began my career, I was quite naive and I signed a non-compete agreement because the firm claimed they had a number of trade secrets, incredible training, etc.   After receiving my first paychecks, I was quite disappointed, and I left for a different brokerage. My old firm's lawyer has now sent me a letter saying that I must stop or they will pursue legal action against me.   The non compete says that I cannot work for or operate within 25 miles of any of their offices. They have 4 office across the Detroit Metro region. The term is 2 years.  I know I knew what I was signing, but I had no idea it could hinder my career in this manner. A real estate agent's career depends on their sphere of influence and all of my SOi live around me. A 25 mile non compete puts me out of business for 2 years. I have to drive at least an hour and half to get to a firm outside this region. Furthermore, after interviewing with a number of firms, I have found that there really aren't any trade secrets in Real Estate. And many other firms have more robust training regimes with better splits, and every single one of them did not require a such a noncompete to be signed.   I called my state real estate legal hotline and the lawyer had no idea what to do because he had never hear of non compete agreements in our industry. Ditto with the executive officer of my board. They had never heard of such a thing in my field.   I am not sure what to do.   I can send a copy of that agreement and the letter they send me on request.	Yes
11	Obviously I would be ineligible for unemployment benefits, but the idea of not having to list a termination on my work history is appealing.   I'm mostly wondering if resigning would impair my ability to seek legal relief regarding how my termination has been handled.	Yes
12	I think some lawyer would benefited just to follow me around. Seriously. I have a series of bad luck despite of trying to be very positive. Just this week alone: 1. The president of a dumpster company trespasses my property. I complained to his worker previously but have no intention to pursue it. He took pictures and denied that his worker broke the driveway. He's going to call another expert into my property even after I said he's trespassing. I have the before and after drivrway pictures btw. His company worth 1 million and the damage only worth a few hundreds bucks. Lol.. 2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up. 3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out. 4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools..  5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it. I've dealt with many more.. IRS double charge mistake (1 year to resolve), real estate agent knowingly sold a property with many violations (didn't disclose mold, structural, etc and inspector was her brother), etc.  Disclosures: Not sue happy, PhD in science,  just wonder what the heck life at 1 am..	Yes
13	Hi All,  So apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, but I wasn't sure where else to turn, and didn't know if I had any legal options here.  So in a nutshell, I've been with my company for just over 3 and a half years. During that time I've had a few pay rises, but nothing too dramatic - started on £20k, year later £24k, year later £28k. I know that sounds like quite big jumps, but I've gone above and beyond for these guys - worked loads of (unpaid) hours of overtime, and considering how much I do for them, it's low for what I should be paid (many of my colleagues have told me this).  So it came to the time of year for the meeting I have to discuss my future/salary. Only this time they say they can't pay me any increase, due to changes at the company. Instead, they say they'll offer 'profit share' to us. What this meant, was a small percentage of our profits would come to me every quarter, this worked out to about £800/quarter. So not a great deal, but better than nothing. I tell them I'm invested in the company, I want to be here for the long haul, and if they can't offer me money, I'd be more than happy to take share options in the company. They didn't give me an answer on this.  Fast forward 6 months - we're told the company is being bought out. I organise a meeting to stress that I'm really due a pay rise (or share options) and stress that I don't want to start at the new place on a low salary, as that'll make me seem like a low level employee to them. They say they can't do anything until we start at the new place.   At the new place, they say we're all going to keep our jobs, and the salary will be in line with what we've had before. I'm offered £29k (so a £1k increase). Not great. My title changes from Production Manager to 'Creative Accountant Executive') - which does also feel like a step down. I'm told we'll have a meeting in the coming weeks to discuss this all, but I'm eating fed up of waiting by this point.  Anyway, we start a the new place. It's pretty cool, much the same as my last place, exact same kind of job, with some new duties. I go down the pub that night to discuss how it was for my colleagues, and they tell me something interesting - they were all offered share options in the new company (shares at a discounted cost). They got offered more depending on seniority, and if they didn't want to take them, they were offered a bonus. Admittedly, I'm the youngest of them  - the next oldest colleague has been with them just over 5 years. But he was offered in the region of £50k. Which seems a lot. Maybe I'm missing something,I don't claim to know all the details -  but should I not have been even considered for this? Do I have any legal precedent to stand on? Please advise, any help much appreciated.	Yes
14	So I have a condition called POTS (posterial orthostatic tacacaridia syndrome) and was just fired from my job because of it. It causes me to pass out when I go from sitting to standing sometimes. It's happened three times at work over the past year and they decided that it's not okay for them to have me around anymore. I am a club volleyball coach and I was wondering if it's legal to fire me over this. I'm unconscious for about 30 min and am still able to work after I wake up. Is there something that can be done? Any response would be appreciated even if it's completely okay for them to do this.	Yes
15	"Hi,  I just received an offer for a company to work ""remote"" anywhere I want in the US. Their HQ is located in a state with state income tax. Meanwhile, I live in a state without state income tax.   Would I have to pay the state income tax of their HQ?"	Yes
16	While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell.   I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home.   My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with. While I was at the ER, I told them it was a work related incident and to contact my employer. I received a bill for a little over $500 and promptly handed it to my general manager. I have now received another for a lowered amount, $267. When I received the bill for $267, I sent it to my employer with a note asking what we needed to do to take care of this and haven't heard anything.   I no longer work there because I accepted a position for an internship in another city. What legal obligation do I have to pay the remainder? I don't want it to go to collections, but I don't feel responsible for paying it, either. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have gone to the ER at all. What is the best course of action?  TD;LR: got Tilex in eyes at work, boss sent me to ER, stuck with bill.	Yes
17	"So while I wasn't the only Mexican or ethnic person In the restaurant I was the only one working front of house as a server and one of only two at the times male servers. So what happens is I had been stuck being the only person who hosted for them for some reason even though everyone used to have to do it depending on who's turn it was. And also was promised better hours during the summer and instead got the two hosting shifts for Friday and Saturday(which are the best days to make tips) and serving sundays and mondays and almost always being called off of my shift because the place wasn't busy. Needless to say I wasn't making a livable wage being stuck with those shifts. And then I requested a day off for my best friends wedding and was told "" yeah you can do that but when you come in next we're going to have to have a chat about sticking to your schedule since you're asking for more hours"" which really confused me since my other coworkers would take whole weeks off and never reprimanded for it. So I went in the next pay day since I was off work and said I was ready for the talk which he proceeded to say he wasn't ready for the rest of the week. When I came into work for my next check before I even go to far past the front door he rushed me and asked me to follow him where he said ""I think it's best we go our separate ways."" And handed me a Check for 24 dollars. And a few points I'd like to add is that I never got a single bad review which I was proud of seeing as I'd never been a server before this place. And I was secret shopped more than people who had been working there since the brewery opened and would score 100% every time and win growlers. Apparently my last One I got which was also the week before I got fired wasn't just good and 100% according to him it was ""glowing"" and I received a 50 dollar bonus for doing so. And I should also mention the man I'm talking about was the places director of operations since his general manager had quit. Not only did he fail at his job as a director of operations  skill set needed(expert communicator, expert of delegating work) he was even worse at being the general manager. So I guess what I'm asking for advice on would whether or not I should go speak to a lawyer about this or if I'd even have a case. And Itd be for laws in Oregon. I'd appreciate anything and everything you guys could help me know what To go do and tell the lawyer I'd go to if I possibly had a case"	Yes
18	Hi, I've been contracting full-time for a local firm. Recently they hired a new contractor who insists that they, their, and they're be used as the person's pronouns. The person also does not want to be referred to as man, or guy.   Though I don't mind trying to use said pronouns, it got me wondering about the legal rights an individual has to insist on using specific pronouns in a work environment. NYC if it makes a difference.	Yes
19	Almost a year ago I contacted a housekeeping company on Craigslist. I will change names here, let's call the owners of the company Viktor and Svetlana.  Svetlana sent a cleaning lady to my apartment, we will call her Vera. Vera does a fantastic job, we like her a lot. She is very sweet and meek and deferential. She comes every other week or so as needed, we have a tiny apartment, she charges $60 and I add $10 as a tip for a total of $70, I make out a check to Vera directly every time she comes. She cleans the whole 550 sq. ft. apartment including the dishes.  Vera does not speak basically any English at all, so anything I have to say I have to communicate through Svetlana by text message. I have never met Viktor or Svetlana, but I text them to arrange cleaning or if I have some request for Vera. I have the suspicion that Svetlana may be a bit stern or mean to Vera.  This summer Vera started bringing her girls. The girls are out of school and are helping her clean. Usually I am not home when she comes, so I didn't notice at first, but I worked from home one morning and she had brought her daughter, and then another time I noticed that she has two daughters she sometimes brings. The girls are very sweet and always smiling and pleasant.   I am not certain of the age of the girls, but they are both teenagers. The older one is probably 16-17, the younger may be 14-15.  I don't know what to do.  My concerns:  - We like Vera and her girls a lot. I actually used to clean apartments myself when I was in college full-time and I can't imagine doing it as a single mother. She seems like a great mom with happy girls and we are not judging her or wanting to get her in trouble, I am confident that she is making the best choices she can for her girls. Whatever I do I do not want to make life harder for her or her girls.  - I don't know how old the girls are or if they are being compensated fairly. I can't ask Vera about this because she knows so little English she is nearly mute. I could ask Svetlana, but I don't know how much I trust Svetlana, I have never even met her.  - I have no idea how many hours a week the girls are working, I don't know how many homes Vera cleans. It seems she only brings her girls occasionally and only since the summer began, she brings the older one more often I think.  So I guess my question is, how do I know whether this arrangement is legal? Am I violating child labor laws? How do I remedy this situation in a way that is best for Vera and her girls?	Yes
20	My parent was recently dismissed after 30 years of tenured employment. Most of the information is coming to us after the fact but without going into too many details, he has been dismissed on grounds that he has sent aggressive emails to coworkers and higher ups and has avoided/ignored any attempts from the company to get his perspective on the situation. My father does have a significant substance abuse problem (alcohol) but my question is, what does it take to fire a tenured employee of 30 years? Where does mental health/illness play a role? According to the company, they had no knowledge of him having a problem – he is a higher functioning alcoholic, but in the past 5ish years, it must have been pretty hard to cover up on his part. I believe that he is most likely not able to continue working at this point in time. I also believe that this situation should not be sugar coated and should not enable him but I worry about my mother because she has been completely blindsided by all of this and I want to be able to give her advice and also keep her safe – is he entitled to severance pay? Can we get access to his termination file? While there may be marks against him on his role in certain situations, I’d like to see the proof of the charges that they are reporting. I am not defending him, but we are hearing conflicting stories.  He is in his late 60’s so he does have a significant retirement – I know the company is sending a certified letter in the next day or two and he can choose to say he was fired, retiring and then a 3rd option, but my mother couldn’t remember what that was… I was thinking resigning could be the 3rd option? What are the pros/cons of being fired vs. retired? Can he lose any of his retirement because of all of this? There has been advice given from family friends that he not sign any papers until a lawyer is involved. I just want my mom to get out of this situation without completely drowning- my gut feeling is that we need to be prepared financially for a worst case medical scenario. He also ran up credit cards and we are not even sure completely financially how deep of a hole he has dug. He has made some very bad choices, but my mother is a wonderful person who has no idea how to proceed. I'm not sure if it matters, but the boss that fired him has since been fired as well... Do we get a lawyer?	Yes
21	"Hello all,  I am in a predicament right now regarding my current employer. I recently became a member of the management team at a new local restaurant. My company currently has six restaurants under its belt, and we opened this new restaurant for business last year and I've worked there since. My co-supervisor was recently trained on how to complete payroll before payday rolled around. In passing she candidly said: &gt;I have so much work to do! I have to go through everyone's time punches and edit them to be at least 5 minutes before their shift.  Our company policy essentially states that all employee's punches that are earlier than 5 minutes before a scheduled shift time will be edited to be, at most, 5 minutes before that shift.   That night I talked to one of our company's longer tenured managers and asked him about this practice. He told me that its ""company policy"" and everyone agreed to these policies when they signed their contracts. Many of the managers at other restaurants seem complacent about this practice. I know that you can't just write whatever you want in a contract and call it a day so I was thinking this may be an unenforceable.  I did some light research on the topic on the DOL's website and, from my understanding of the law, the law states that an employer may only edit time punches if an employee incorrectly recorded time (i.e forgetting to clock in or out). But they may not edit time punches in order to reflect something like a ""company policy.""  Now I'm not losing any sleep from my punch being edited from 2:54pm to 2:55pm. I am, however, concerned that my company is simply operating unethically. I want to talk to my HR representative and understand more about where this policy is coming from. But I also feel a little slimy doing payroll and having to edit these punches. Long term I am not interested in going to court about lose wages, etc. I just want my company to operate ethically and fairly.  So, my questions: 1) Is this legal at all? 2) Is this employment contract ""unenforceable"" because of this verbiage? 3) Is there anything a lowly supervisor can do about this company-wide practice?  Thanks in advance"	Yes
22	"Just yesterday an email went out from our CFO announcing we are shifting to an unlimited PTO system from an accrued vacation system as of August 1st. For the last two years I have accrued about three weeks worth of vacation, with coworkers accruing months over a longer time. A fellow coworker and myself both inquired about the hours being bought out to which our CFO replied:    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""No, it's not being paid out in the transition, it will just remain there""   and  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""won't be paid out, but we are figuring how we will / can treat it.""  &amp;nbsp;  He has not replied to us requesting what that means, and if that means the previously accrued hours will still be paid out upon leaving the company (rather than just being paid out when we switch systems). With an August 1st deadline, others and I can't burn all the hours and many were expecting those hours being bought out upon leaving. I know legally in California, a company whose PTO is based on accrued hours has to buy them out upon leaving because those accrued hours are a form of deferred compensation that cannot be taken away from the employee once it is earned. But now that we've switched systems, do they still have to pay out or are all of us workers getting screwed? If they have to pay out, are they able to pay out upon leave rather than upon switching systems?"	Yes
23	Hello Everyone,  I got a new contract for a job in UK, everything seems fine except one clause which I think is very vaguely defined.  &gt;During your employment you will not be employed, engaged, &gt;interested or concerned in any activity, office or outside business &gt;interests (whether paid or unpaid) without the written consent of &gt;the Executive Management team.   &gt;You will disclose in writing to the Executive Management team &gt;any such activities, offices or outside business interests you may &gt;currently have and in the event that the Executive Management &gt;team requires you to cease the same, you will do so forthwith.  &gt;For the avoidance of doubt consent will not be given in relation &gt;to any activities, offices or business interests which in the view of &gt;the Executive Management team, are similar to, or compete &gt;directly or indirectly with the business of the Company or which &gt;could in the view of the Executive Management team, give rise to &gt;a conflict of interest or interfere with the efficient performance of &gt;your duties.  However, such consent will not be unreasonably &gt;withheld.   As far as I understand if I haven't misunderstood it. They potentially can forbid me to do any sort of work, even volunteering for example for a local shelter.  Anyway, my main issue is that I already own a business which is in a completely unrelated field to the employment, hence I'm concerned.  I was wondering what do you gents/gals think about this clause, and would modifying the first sentence with something like this would help?  &gt;that may harm the interests of the Company, interfere with the &gt;Employee’s work time or to a not insubstantial extent occupy the &gt;Employee’s manpower.	Yes
24	I have been offered a job and part of the employment agreement includes a section that states that if I am terminated for cause or resign within the first year of employment I must reimburse the company $750, and $500 if its within the second year.  I believe this training is just on the job training, getting familiar with their system and specific technologies they are using, not a course through an educational institution. The section requires an initial, and it is the only section that requires an initial, so it stood out to me. I don't intend to quit the job but if it just doesn't work out I don't want to be penalized.   Thanks in advance	Yes
25	"Okay so excuse if this broken I am on mobile.  This past week I had a job interview with a prestigious company in my area that was hiring. Interview went well, said they were going to call me previous employers and run a background check. I agree to all. Fast forward to today, I go to work work is fine and finish the day. I get home and I receive a phone call for one of my employers and it goes like this "" (m) wanted me to call you and tell you that you can come in sometime next week and drop off your uniforms and pick up your last check because you were looking for another job."" Are there any recourse that I can take? What if this future employer doesn't hire because of my background and I get letgo/fired from my current employer because I'm looking for financial stability and this job isn't providing it. Thanks"	Yes
26	I was working at a stadium tonight, and at the end of the night it turns out the till was down. After this the security guard searched me, he searched my pockets (no issues so far), then after nothing was found he asked me to remove my bra and lift it up and shake it (with my top still on of course), I felt weird doing this but was tired and wanted to go home so I did it and after I did it the guard seemed seemed really awkward. This took place behind a fridge behind the bar so no customers could see, but the person behind the other bar would be able to see if he looked over. This feels pretty weird to me and I've never experienced this before, I'm not looking to sue or anything but is searching like this (especially by a member of the opposite sex) allowed? If not I'll bring it up to my supervisor tomorrow.	Yes
27	I work for a restaurant in Michigan. The room where our dish machine is regularly gets up to above 80 degrees and 70% humidity. [Here is a photo of the temperature gauge in the room from today](http://imgur.com/a/jkIPM)  That was taken after the dish machine had just shut off for a brief ten minute period.  Our head of the building has begun to disallow us to have the doors to the room propped open while the machine is in use. These doors are at the hottest end of the machine. The ceiling vents do not work and on the weekends the air conditioner for the whole building is turned off anyway. There are two fans inside the room (there used to be three, one broke and was never replaced) that barely move the air around.   I know OSHA states that there are no temperature regulations for workplaces. However it also says that OSHA kicks in when there is a possibility for heat related illness. Spending 20 minutes in the room leaves you coated in sweat and the head of the building does not allow us to keep cups/water bottles in the dish room. We're told we have to go get water from the pop machine, but cannot do that when the dish machine is in use. Serving on 700 people on the regular in a 2 hour period means the machine is constantly in use. We constantly need to rotate people out of the room because they begin to get light headed from the oppressive heat inside the room.  Do we as employees have any legal leg to stand on to change anything?	Yes
28	"I'm not sure if this question is acceptable in this subreddit. So I will ask my question, and if people suggest hiring a lawyer, then I request advice on how to find the right type of lawyer for my situation.   After graduating from college, I spent six months working on a startup which was unsuccessful. Then I began searching for a job, and I put my accomplishments during my startup on my resume. After six months of job searching, I received my first job offer with a company in the same field as my startup, but it's a 3-month consulting agreement. The CTO of the company said if it's a good fit I will be offered a full-time position afterward. I read the consulting agreement and analyzed it with a plagiarism checker. I discovered over 90% of the contract came from two online contracts, and one major difference I found was the removal of a phrase in a statement. To summarize the statement, the online contract says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc, that I develop while performing my services under this agreement"". The contract I received does not have the last phrase so the statement says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc."".  I spoke with the CTO about this, and he said I could make changes to the contract, and they would consider it. At the moment, I had doubt in negotiating and told him I sought a permanent position. So I declined the offer. A week later I regretted not negotiating and asked for another opportunity. He said they might give me another opportunity, but they will be unable to change the wording of the contract. If I sign the contract, is it possible that I will give them rights to all my accomplishments I achieved during my startup?  Let me know if you need additional information. I am on the fence about hiring an attorney/lawyer to help me with my situation, but I would like to get advice from this subreddit first. Thanks."	Yes
29	"TLDR backstory: So my wife has been offered an anchor/reporter job that's a big break for her in her field.  However, the location is far from ideal (Southern Michigan) and it has limited jobs in my field (BioEng).  Her offer is a two-year contract agreement with 90-day probational period, however we're not sure of her rights to leave there after those 90 days.  The contract states:  ""Your first 90 days of employment is a probationary period.  During this period, the company will evaluate your suitability for your position and it may decide not to continue your employment for no reason or for any reason prohibited by law.  You are free to resign your employment with the Company at any time either during your probationary period or thereafter. **This paragraph does not apply to individuals who have been employed by the Company or affiliate for more than 90 days immediately preceding the date of this offer letter**  You represent that you are not subject to the terms of noncompetition, confidentiality, or similar agreement that would limit your ability to carry out the duties of your position and your offer of employment is based on this representation. If the Company learns that you are currently subject to any such agreement that would limit or prohibit you employment with the Company, your employment may be terminated.""  Based on that, is she able to leave early without penalty a year down the road if she doesnt like it?  Could she accept a different job in the same field without violating her contract?    Thanks"	Yes
30	So I worked for a pretty decent company for the past 6 years, I was part of particular department (we had 4 staff members and 1 outsourced IT personnel, that we picked up a few months back).   I was brought into the office of my VP this past week and was being told I was laid off, nothing more. I never had a negative review, never had any work performance issues. I was brought in and told my position was being outsourced. Now what has me wondering is, my title was the same as the rest of my team and we all had different responsibilities. They are currently hiring for the team (but as a different title).. and when I brought this up they told me I can put a resume in and if I qualify for the position they would consider me. I am completely livid, they offered me two weeks of severance after 6 years of working there and that is all.   I am located in Long Island, New York. I just don't see how it can be legal to lay me off (I have been in the company the 2nd longest).. when they are hiring for a position under the same supervisor - while having 4 people with the same title - and they state that its because they are outsourcing my position.	Yes
31	Title. This is in Ireland, I don't know what difference that will make. I'm visiting an information center tomorrow on her behalf. We live in separate counties, and she fears that word will spread in her very petite town if she consults her own info center.  Is there any real basis? It wasn't from her HR manager either, but a higher up, similar to a teacher saying it to a janitor. The co-workers job is also, supposedly at risk.	Yes
32	Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	Yes
33	I work at an undisclosed company where they pay us $8/hour plus tips (Arizona has $10 minimum wage). When clocking out you have to report your tips, and the general manager requires you to put at least $2 per every hour worked, even if we didn't make that much. If we put in less, and what we made instead, the manager will go in to the payroll and change the tips reported (and often lower clocked hours).  What do I do? I have found employment elsewhere but I don't want my friends there to continually be screwed	Yes
34	I am in Idaho, USA.   I've been working at this bar/restaurant for about three months. It is a corporate chain. It is unlike any other bar I've worked for in that the managers count and distribute the tip money amongst the bartenders. I actually never even see or held in my hand the entirety of the tips for any shift that I've closed.  Tips are distributed by dividing the total tips for the night per hour, then dividing that among the bartenders on shift for the hours they work. This makes it important that the managers look at the bartenders' exact hours/minutes each shift to make sure everyone is being paid exactly what they are owed for that shift.   I close the bar 3-4 shifts a week, usually getting there around 5:30 and leaving anywhere from 1-3 am.  I recently realized that my managers had the tips for the shift already divided and put in our individual tip folders before I even clocked out. (While I was doing cleaning and such.) Which would make no sense, since they don't yet even know the hours I worked for that shift.   So for the past three shifts I have compared my clock out slip to the tip sheet that we sign to say we received our tips, and on average I am being shorted for 30 minutes of work per shift. If this has been happening the whole time, it is at minimum $100 a month that I've been shorted, and probably more like $150.   My question is, do I have a leg to stand on here? I've signed the tip sheet every time I've picked up my tips. The hours and tips for that shift are clearly written on there. I've always just counted the money I was given, and made sure it matched what the paper said I was supposed to receive. It never occurred to me to check the hours worked to make sure it was actually accurate. I am planning to confront my GM about it tomorrow, but I want to at least kind of know if I have some good footing here.  I have a few clock out slips that can prove maybe 3 times this has happened. Other than that, I don't know if they can print records of my shifts and how many hours they were. I don't know how far back they log the tip info either.   I hope this all made sense!   Thanks for any advice	Yes
35	This is in the UK: Hi guys. I successfully applied for an internal role at my employer, albeit different business unit so technically an external move, and was offered the role by the actual future team. Then HR asked for my current salary, went away and came back with an approved salary offer. I accepted the offer verbally on the phone, and in the same call was told to notify my current boss that I am moving. Additionally we agreed on a starting date for the new role. 6 days later they just pulled the offer citing some business changes. Now it says here that a verbally accepted offer is legally binding ( https://www.gov.uk/job-offers-your-rights). Initially HR said only a written document is legally binding. When I sent the link, citing that verbal offers are, too, they came back saying that what we discussed on the phone wasn't an offer saying we agreed a salary that we would aim for. That salary came from the rewards team after calculating my current salary and converting it from Business Unit to new Business Unit. So to me that was the final bit of the offer to accept, which I did. Everything afterwards, i.e. waiting for written contract are procedural steps, not conditional to me. Am I right or wrong? Any advice on any options would be very welcome. Thanks in advance.	Yes
36	"The company my wife works for called in a worker today who was ""randomly"" chosen for a drug test (turns out, the owner just assumed he was on drugs).  His drug test came back clean; however, they lied to him and told him he had failed the drug test and fired him for it. My wife doesn't like this and is planning on telling him, but does this guy have any legal ground to stand on if he contacts a lawyer. This is in Texas by the way."	Yes
37	I am in the United States now but last month I was in China. I was working as an independent contractor for a Chinese theme park company since Spring of 2016. I have a signed contract with a salary amount and no clause regarding them withholding payment for any reason. I worked the entire month of May (which was my last month) and they have copies of all my work, but are refusing to pay me. They have also stopped replying to my emails. Since I'm no longer in China, I don't know what to do other than looking online for a lawyer in China that could possibly help me. Is this the right move? Any experience with finding legal help in mainland China? I'm not expecting it to be cheap, but since it's several thousand USD they owe me, I think it's worth seeking help.	Yes
38	I work at a boy scout camp in the sierra national forest in california. My camp director just announced that the majority of staff would not be allowed to eat the food prepared by the kitchen staff, and instead, for wednesday lunch would be eating the food prepared by the scouts. I don't trust the scouts to not give me food poisoning. Is there a law in california that says employers must offer food that has been prepared by a licensed professional? We don't have any other options to eat, it is either the dining hall, or starve.   I don't know if the sierra national forest thing matters, but I included it just in case	Yes
39	We recently installed GPS trackers on our work trucks and we haven't told our employees yet that they are installed. These trucks never go home with our employees and stay on our property when we are closed. They use the trucks to go perform service calls and pickup/deliver equipment. My question is if we have to tell our employees that they are installed.	Yes
40	Hey guys it's me again with an update. I wasn't sure how to go about this - please excuse me if this is not correct. Update is at the bottom of the post for those that might remember it (the post was 2 weeks ago).    Hello /r/legaladvice. Please forgive me in advance for any formatting errors that will occur. As well as spelling errors - currently bumming WiFi from my wife's work :)   So now a little info. I live in Arkansas. I'm recently employed at Walmart (Jun. 12) was my hire date. And we went through orientation (by the way we was told we were getting paid for that). I attended orientation I know for sure Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 2-11 with an hour lunch. Walmart pays biweekly so I was hired the Monday before this last pay period (Jun. 15). Today (Jun. 29) was our payday.   Now when you first hire on with Walmart, I was told you're hired as part time. Which I am working 4 days a week 2-11 shift with an hour lunch. There for I should be earning at least 64 hours ( most of the time I clock out +15mins after my shift - since I've been hired I've worked an hour past my shift 3 times and one time I clocked out at 1:05 a.m) every two weeks.   But now here's the thing. My paystub only shows I worked 47.64 hours the past 2 weeks. 17 the first week and 30 the next. Which this is absolutely wrong.   Since I was hired the Monday before payday. Those hours should be added on along with the 2 - 32 hour work week as well as those times I've work past my shift.   Also do part time employs gain over time if they have worked over 40 hours (or 80 hours in my case ?)  I'm not as much as worried about the overtime. I really want to know why I was paid for 64 hours + the hours I attended orientation.   Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I'm working for a corporation like this. I plan on going to personnel in the morning and asking to see the hours I've clocked in. Because it's wrong on my paystub.   Thanks y'all. Have a great one.   [UPDATE]  I received another paycheck via the Wal-Mart money this past Thursday (July 13th). I only had 40 hours the past 2 weeks (according to Wal-Mart). Which I was scheduled for 64 hours the past two weeks. I've been there everyday that I was scheduled. And that's not including the times I've clocked out at 11:30 or later). I'm seriously debating giving them my 2 weeks notice. Something is not adding up.   To be honest, during orientation I over heard some of the salried managers speaking about the overtime workers were getting and that it was costing them too much. Or something to that affect.  My question is now - could they be doing something with my hours to cover that up? I know I'm only part-time but still..  Forgive me if that is a silly question. I've never dealt with this type of stuff. I've farmed all my life and always received a paper check. So all this is pretty new to me.  So can someone (anyone) please give me a little more advice I would greatly appreciate it. As I'm in a tight spot right now. And I don't know what to do.   Thanks yall. Have a good weekend	Yes
41	Hello... I'm asking for a friend. Here are the details:  She took a scheduled vacation and upon receiving her first paycheck back she saw that her employer only provided her with 16 out of the 40 hours that she was entitled to. She gets paid every week. However, in trying to resolve the matter she was told that she needed to submit a payroll request and she did so. She was told that it can take a few weeks for payroll to correct the issue and if she doesn't see anything on her next few checks to let management know and they'll go from there... This is from their regional manager. She doesn't have the luxury of waiting until they decide to resolve the issue and she's wondering how long her company legally has to replenish her missing compensation.  I already told  her to reach out to HR as well. Located in PA. Thanks!	Yes
42	"I worked as a crew leader for a landscaping company in NV off and on for two years. Last Wednesday I was sent to work with another crew because they where short on people due to two or three people quitting the week prior. I had worked with this crew a few times before and due to them being short on people and hadn't had any major issues other than that I was made to do a majority of the work while they where often either just standing around talking or nowhere to be found. There was one individual who I could tell didn't like me from the first time I met him and I could tell it was a racial thing(he was Hispanic and while I have native blood in me I'm usually assumed by others to be white). In a job like landscaping you have to have thick skin, it's all dudes and it's all outside manual labor. I can put up with a lot, and for a while I did. Now I don't speak Spanish, but it's not hard to figure out when I hear the word gringo while they are talking, then immediately after tell me to go do something(I was often the only ""white guy"") that it was the old ""make the gringo do it"". Fast forward to last week. I've been sent to work with them again the prior day I had worked and this day they made me go dump my trailer then meet them up there. I get up there and drive around looking for them at their normal work areas for a while, then finally find them. First thing the individual asks me is what took me so fucking long. I told him I had been driving around looking for them to which he huffed, put his truck into gear and said ""fucking gringo"" as he started to drive off. This behavior continued through the day until around lunch, when this crew simply disappears. I've been sent to help them and they just leave without telling me where they are going. So I waste a good amount of time driving around looking for them and I finally find them and start working(me and another co-worker who had been sent up there with them(also a white guy)). We went back to doing what we where doing before lunch and at some point they just left us again, without any word. At this point I've had enough and I decide we would just work on our own and I would talk to my boss about it at the end of the day. About 20-30 minutes into working by boss pulls up and starts yelling at both of us not to work so close together because we ""look like butt buddies"". He then tells us that we need to go help the other crew or we will be fired. I started to tell him that I refuse to continue working with that crew and to continue being called a gringo when he cuts me off and threatens that if I don't go back to work with them he would fire me. I told him ""well you can fire me"" to which he replied ""fine"" then asked me for the keys to my truck. He then preceded to force the other co-worker to go back and work with the other crew and left me stranded in another town.  The day following I was told that I needed to sign some price of paper when I went to pick up my check. This paper stated that I had quit and that my ""final pay had been explained to me"" even though I was yet to receive my final pay(the check I was picking up was for the week prior)  I have tried to contact the companies HR(they are a huge company) and was told they don't even have an HR. I've contacted the Nevada equal rights commission and filed a report with them and am currently waiting for word back from a lawyer. Until then I was hoping for some guidance as to what else should be done. Is there a better agency to contact than the Nevada equal rights commission? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.    Tl;dr was repeatedly being called a gringo at work and was fired when I refused to continue working with them."	Yes
43	"I've been working at a cell phone store for 2 and a half months and I'm the only employee there. He refers to me as a ""manager"" and yet I get paid minimum wage. When I applied to the craigslist ad it said that it was an hourly plus commission sales job. But I've yet to see any form of commission on my ADP pay stub. He's trying to sell the business on top of that. Is there anything I can do? He only owns this one cell phone store and he's a really bad business owner. Is there anything I could do?"	Yes
44	"I work for a small company doing manual labor. For the sake of keeping this somewhat private for now, we will say I do lawn maintenance although what I actually do is specific to the area I live and is in high demand. I started working for the company about a year ago. My boss (owner of the company) hired me to fill in for someone who had recently been fired, and him and I (as his helper) were the entire company. I started at $10/hr. As time progressed, i took on more responsibility and after about 4 or 5 months, started doing nearly 100% of the work by myself. My boss then hired a worker to be my helper, and began more of a role that consisted more of doing estimates and taking phone calls. He is not a super presentable guy, though he is very friendly, he's just kind of got this very country/hillbilly vibe about him. Ever since I started working with him, business has been growing substantially faster than it did in the previous 2 years of him owning the company. business is now stronger than ever, and i am being worked to the bone in the summer heat every day using and depending on equipment that is far beyond being in need of repair. It has gotten frustrating to be in charge of everything, (working my *** off), and maintaining to represent the company to the best of my ability, all while making $12/hour on jobs that bring company $2,000-$3000 profit every two days.   This being said, I learned a few months ago that my boss had taken my social security number that he made a copy of when I first started working for him to make me an LLC, unannounced to me. This also included filing a ""workers compensation exemption form"" on my behalf for me. The worker who is my helper is also filed on that llc as my employer/subcontractor (not sure which)I do like my boss, and don't really mind the work if it was for more money, I just feel underpaid for the major role I play in the company.   For the past few months I've been saving and working towards gathering all materials I need to begin doing jobs myself (trailer, about $2000 worth of equipment). I now have almost everything I need, and am only short of getting my own business liability insurance and business license to have everything complete.   My question is, how would you approach the situation if you were in my position? I do like my boss and wouldn't mind continuing to subcontract for his company. However, I'm not sure how he will handle the news that I may become his competition. The way I see it- For the entire length of employment with this company, I have been miscatagorized as a subcontractor. I am now doing what is necisarry for me to actually be subcontracted by him (or another company in the same field.. 2 of which have offered to pay me more than double what my current boss does, but those two company's were both under the impression at the time that the equipment I had with me was all mine when it was actually my current bosses). An arrangement where I help to train my worker to fill my position while my own business picks up seems ideal to me, but am I being too hopeful thinking he would continue to employ me when he knows I'm going to give him competition on my own? I know he is going to feel betrayed and tell me it's a bad idea etc. I'm just trying to think of the best way to present it to him so that the process that both he and I will soon undergo is relatively seamless. I feel like we could both still help each other to an extent, I'm just not sure how to phrase it."	Yes
45	TLDR is, degree, terrible job, want to change my life in any way I can. It's incredibly depressing, and I want to know what are my options. I heard conflicting things:  * it's easy/hard to get tuition paid on unemployment  * you have to be a minority they recognize  * you actually have to be on unemployment for &gt;24wks before they even consider helping you, which seems incredibly counter-productive  * even if you get it, you're not getting essentials covered by UI, just tuition  Help me /r/legaladvice you're my only hope.

46	Asking for a friend who was contracted to work until September, and was just given a week's notice they no longer have the money to keep her position. What is the minimum notice required? I only know the state/city just passed the nation's first protections for freelancers, but no idea what is now legal. Can they cancel on such a short notice?	Yes
47	My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	Yes
48	I currently work in Minnesota. I have both personal and vacation hours that can be used for whatever reason. I recently accepted a position at a different company and was told by my current employer that I owed $870.00 in overused vacation hours.   What I realized was that even though we have access to the entire year's vacation as of January 1st each year, we earn them by accruing them throughout the year. I currently have gone over in vacation from what I have earned at this point in the year by 35 hours. I am a non-exempt employee.  The frustrating part is that I currently have 89 hours of unused personal time that will just be lost. My employer has informed me that our payroll system does not allow personal and vacation days to be switched after being processed. I have been asked to initial a document to allow me last paycheck to be garnished for the $870.00. If I do not sign it, the company has the right to take legal action to recoup the funds.   Is this common? If I do not sign it is it likely that legal action will occur? I understand that I should have researched the company policies beforehand, I am just disappointed that I have so many personal hours that I could have used instead. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
49	I work at a bar in Texas. Last week, one of the other employees brought her older sister in to start working as a busser. She's having her sister clock in under her name in order to help her sister avoid paying (what I assume is back) child support. The sister is has not filled out any W-4 forms. I have three questions.  1: How fucked is my coworker?  2: How fucked is the sister?  3: How fucked is my employer?	Yes
50	My allergist provided a letter to give to my employer requesting a two day a week work from home accommodation due to dust mite allergies.  The request was denied. Almost everyone employed where I work works from home part of the week with the exception of recent hires(hired in 2016), which includes me.  Do I take this to the EEOC, suffer through it or find another job?	Yes
51	This is in Michigan. I don't know if that's relevant.  On Friday, July 14th we were supposed to be paid but there was a mistake and only about 5 people got paid out of all the employees throughout five locations in the franchise.  The district manager says the only way he'll pay us is if we prob we didn't get paid. The only way I know how to do this is by printing up my account summary and bringing it in but I really don't feel like it's their business. Then after we do that, we get a paper check and have to sign a form and write down how much our check was for everyone to see. We have no way of verifying whether the check is even the right amount.   I understand not wanting to pay us twice but the way he's treating people who just pretty much worked for free for the past two weeks is a bit rude...pretty much telling us 'you have to share all this personal information in order to get paid because of a mistake we made'.  This isn't the first shady thing this employer has done and I've been waiting for something like this to get them in trouble. I know how to file a wage claim, as I've had to before​. But are they technically withholding my wages?   Am I just looking too much into this because I'm bitter and spiteful?	Yes
52	My workplace is a secured facility, accessible only with a key card. Every employee is issued one of these. However, if you forget your card or lose it, you have to pay $10 for a new one should be issued to you, regardless of whether or not you actually needed a replacement. For employee such as myself who lives 45 minutes from work, going back home to retrieve my badge would incur an absence for the day. Basically, I'm forced to pay $10 to work, or to take a hit on my attendance. Is this legal? I feel as if it's discriminating against employees who have a larger commute.	Yes
53	I was walking at work when my right knee sprained I didn't fall or hit anything. I was told that they couldn't cover it because I was just walking but, the reason it sprained was  from a prior injury that I sustained from work before. The place they sent me to Concentra urgent care facility that handled and cared for my injury told me that I was fine and released me from care. Not too long ago after they let me go I reinjured the same right knee just walking at work. Now am I suppose to act like Concentra wasn't wrong for letting me go the first time? I'm sure they are not perfect so now the people handling my insurance are telling me that Concentra can never be wrong and that it's just a coincidence that the same right knee sprained just walking ? Can I sue ?	Yes
54	So my story starts in September of 2016. I was laid off at my Insurance firm and went on unemployment. On May 1st I went back to my old job after the contacted me back. I hate to feel this way but last week pay  cuts got brought up and it kinda felt like it was suggested to take to cut or your going to be let go. I'm just wondering what my rights are. I think I exhausted all my unemployment before so I'm not sure if he lets me go I will have anything to fall back on. Serious advice only please	Yes
55	I work for a large big box retailer and have for over 10 years. I have an upper management position which is salaried. Prior to having the position I was a lower manager that was hourly. I was not allowed to take lunches on multiple occasions but expected to do “fake punches” so I didn’t get paid for that work. The only proof I have is that I can print them all out but there’s no way to show that I was required to do so. The same individual who did that was my HR at the time. He had since promoted just like I have meaning he is still my HR. Just a higher up HR. He has yelled at me and other employees, he laughed in my face and admitted to never reading a doctors note I gave him while I was at the end of my pregnancy, and he has an overall abusive personality. I recently found out from my boss that he stopped me from getting a promotion I was very qualified for and recommended for. I emailed even higher up leadership/hr with my concern almost 2 months ago. I received a reply stating that they took it very seriously and would be looking into it. They have not actually spoken with me and I feel I am getting pushed out. What is the best way to go about this? I have no physical proof that my boss admitted to the retaliation and he will side with the company in order to keep his job. Can a few texts showing his character, a letter I wrote him about his abusive behavior, and print outs of my punches get me anywhere? It doesn’t seem like enough to prove my claims despite them being very true.	Yes
56	"Recently started a part time side job at a small music store. ( 3 months in, 2 days a week).   Employer/owner hasn't had me fill out a W-4. Paychecks have listed normal tax reductions. For what ever reason, I forgot to mention the form. It didn't cross my mind until today when he asked me for my social security number for his ""Tax Guy"".   I'm curious as to what should, needs and can happen in this case? Where has the tax money listed in the pay stub been going or logged as?   I don't have time for issues to occur. I don't need the job, just side cash I can play with. Is this reason to quit if he does not truthfully comply?"	Yes
57	For the record, I'm a mobile phlebotomist. I drive my car to the patients house and collect my specimen and drop off at the lab.  I had a meeting with her and the result was that she is going to pay me for the work I've done at home so that's good, but what I'm trying to find out is when I'm supposed to clock in. The office is 35 miles from home but I usually don't go there, and never before I see my patients, and instead may drive for over an hour before I get to my first patient which is when I'm supposed to clock in.  So then I do my job drawing blood then drop off the specimens at the nearest lab and after that I'm supposed to clock out. Many times I'll be an hour or more from home.  What is my boss supposed to be paying me for driving between 100 and 200 miles a day?  When am I supposed to clock in and out for work when my boss sends me an hour from home to work?  Finally, after our meeting they said that until my pay was sorted and a new contract is drawn up I won't be getting any phlebotomy jobs or other work (I understand this qualifies me for unemployment?)  If my boss comes back with a b.s. contact paying me less (she claimed that part of my 13/hr payment was for vehicle upkeep.) Or something else what happens if I don't sign it?  Thanks for your time!	Yes
58	"Need a little bit of legal advice. The company I was working for has been in the process of paying me back freelancer invoices back when I was under a 1099 a while ago. During that time period I had gone full-time with them and I was receiving a weekly paycheck.  Back in January/December, the company moved from one state to another and the owner was trying to make that change reflect in our taxes that are taken out as New Hampshire's is lower. There were a few pay periods that were missed, but then I resumed getting new ones again and was told that I would be reimbursed for those that I had not received during the transition, along with the original freelance checks. (At this point some of you may be wondering, why didn't you leave or take action at that point or earlier? Well, this industry is notorious for not paying people, but it is also difficult to find a position like the one that I was in, so I felt like it was the best opportunity and the reputation and experience to me at the time was worth it. I was also fresh out of school at the time.)  During my final 2 weeks which was a few months ago, 2 of the checks that they had written to pay me back for the original missed pay periods had bounced. Also, during those 2 weeks I didn't receive an automatic deposit, so I approached my employer about it. They basically said that they had a lot less money to pay me than they thought and that it wasn't fair for me to continue to work there while I wasn't getting paid.  I'm not really privy to the behind the scenes accounting, but I can't imagine they're particularly good at it. My employer wrote up a document to basically say that they were suspending payment for a while and verbally said that they would look to get me paid back within 4 weeks. Verbally, they said that want to bring me back on full-time again once the work picks up. Its been about 2 months, and I have received a replacement check for one of those missed pay periods, but I haven't received word on when I will be expecting more.  Basically, I'm trying to figure out what sort of legal power/ability I have under my control between the freelancer checks, the full-time missed pay periods, the bounced checks, and the sudden suspension of employment even though I was under contract. I'm definitely tired of waiting around and even though I would hate to break off the relationship with this company, money is more important to me at this point. If they are legitimately ""out of money"" I understand that they can only do so much to pay me back, but they lacked the foresight to deal with that preemptively and allowed me to work without receiving payments. I also feel like they are doing what they can to pay me back, as I have received one of the replacement checks, so I'm not sure if that changes anything from a legal perspective."	Yes
59	"Hi guys. I don't know what the format is here so I'm just going to go. Also not sure how detailed I should/shouldn't be, so ask for more detail as needed. GA resident, flew to VA for interview.      I was able to make contact with the VA company through a GA recruiter, so GA recruiter handled all the communication. VA company asked for me to make the flight reservation, which I was uncomfortable with because I am accustomed to the company making the reservation. So I asked the GA recruiter to do it for me on their dime, and they agreed.      When I got to the airport, *excuses here*, I missed the flight. I called up the GA recruiter and asked how best to proceed. He told me he would reach out to VA company and call me back. He called back and said they are fine to do the interview later that day or the next day, and that I should book the next flight I can. I specifically asked whether the flight change fee would be reimbursed, and discussed the specific amount it would be with GA recruiter. GA recruiter spoke with the hiring manager and then GA recruiter explicitly told me on the phone that the VA company would reimburse this amount. After this conversation, I booked the flight change, took the flight, rented a car and hotel, and had the interview the next morning.      I submitted my expense reimbursement request with the flight, car rental, hotel, and taxis to and from the airport. A full month later, I received a check from the VA company, reimbursing the car rental, hotel, and taxis. The flight change fee, which was over half the total reimbursement, was not reimbursed.      I called the GA recruiter, and sent subsequent emails because he was picking up on what was going on and not answering calls anymore, and asked what had happened. GA recruiter told me that an ""HR guy"" at VA company had ""put his foot down"" on the flight change expense, and it would not be reimbursed. To my knowledge, GA recruiter has been reimbursed for the flight they booked.      So I figure I have a couple of avenues. One, there's promissory estoppel re: detrimental reliance on GA recruiter's advice. Two, there's some kind of convoluted argument for detrimental reliance on the hiring manager (although I think that would work better for GA recruiter to use on VA company, and GA recruiter is not interested in suing a client, especially on my behalf), even if he didn't have the authority to make that decision. Three, there may be laws around interview reimbursement I haven't really looked into in VA.      I have already reached out to GA recruiter and been told to go pound sand, so any further communication there will likely need to be all lawyered up. I'm not flush with cash, but I am willing to fight this precisely for that reason.      So, uh, advice?"	Yes
60	"Long story short: Wife works as an RN in California. She hasn't been getting union dues deducted from her paychecks for quite some time (something I've been on her about checking in with, but I guess she/we are just too busy to rectify the problem.. we do acknowledge that unions are important and thought she just wasn't signed on with hers, not that she wasn't paying the dues).   Nowhere on her paychecks since roughly 2014 has there been a union dues deduction. Recently, she has received a letter from her union stating that they have experienced ""phenomenal growth"" in recent years and that some employees have fallen through the cracks of their antiquated system, thus deductions had stopped for some employees.   With their updated database they've discovered that some people owe money, and we're being told that she now owes more than a thousand dollars in back payments just because this union decided to upgrade a system and discovered they fucked up and weren't deducting people properly.   The document is basically admitting fault here. I called the union myself and discovered that it's basically a mandatory repayment (of course they are going to say that), but that there's ""no due date""... they just want to set up a payment plan.  The rep did say, however, that collections could be involved at a later time if no payments are arranged.   What are my options?  It just seems like an odd move for a union to go about correcting their huge mistake like this.. my wife wants to just blindly pay the amount, but I am extremely hesitant.   Any advice is greatly appreciated."	Yes
61	"Hi, I just got hired at a bar a couple of weeks ago, and I was asked to sign an employment contract that contained a couple of clauses that I'm a bit apprehensive about. I've worked at many bars and restaurants over the years and I've never had to sign anything like this before, and I'm just wondering what other folks might think before I sign the contract.   The things that stood out to me were: - ""Probation: The first six months of employment are a probationary period during which Employer may, in its sole discretion and for any reason, terminate employment without further compensation, notice, pay in lieu of notice, and severance"". I assume this part is probably legal, but I don't find comfort in knowing that I could be terminated for any reason without notice for the first six months... - ""Confidential Information - you will not at any time divulge, disclose, or communicate to any individual, person, firm, corporation, partnership, or business entity of any time, any information concerning any matter affecting or relating to Employer's enterprise, including business records, business events, daily matters, marketing, operations procedures, passwords, food and beverage development and recipes, menu development, and any financial or business affairs connected thereto.

63	I started to work with a startup 3 months ago. They wanted to know my hourly charge and how many hours I am going to work in a week. Then they said they need the app asap, because they are going to release their product within 2/3 months. So I worked overtime and made the app almost usable (according to other fellow devs) within 2 and half months. Now when I asked for my overtime payment, they clearly denied my payment. They did not pay me 3 weeks payment. They did not pay me overtime payments. Then they stopped to communicate with me. Removed me from slack. No reply to my emails. How should I deal with this situation ? I am working as an hourly freelancer from India. This startup is Brooklyn, NY based startup.	Yes
64	"TLDR   I'm worried my boss won't pay me for work that I've already done.  What are my options if that happens?  I am depending on the money.  ---  I work a crappy minimum wage night shift job and handed in my notice last night.  I also slept through the first hour of my shift and made the decision to quit as I was getting ready to leave for work.  I told my boss over text.   My boss then tried to guilt - trip me into coming in anyways.  When I said no she said fine at least do the rest of your scheduled shifts and I said yes.. but only because I wanted to end the conversation.   I don't want to go back.  I don't need the four days of pay and I have had two mental breakdowns in less then a month because of this job.  I really don't want go back.    This morning, going through my records, I noticed that I didn't get the proper raise for my overtime hours.  Judging from talks with another employee (only one) this was intentional.  I am also missing a few hours of pay.  Honestly this stuff isn't a big deal to me but it happened if it helps.    However, there is still one week of work.. Another 48 hours, 4 of which should be overtime.  I'm worried that if I don't show up for my next set of shifts that my boss won't pay me for the work I've done.  I need that money.  If she does this.. what are my options?    I hope you guys sympathize with me and can offer some stellar advice because I am a depressed hermit and I haven't spoken to my lawyer in over 2 years and I don't even know if she's knowledgeable about employment law.    Don't know if this helps but I work for Tim Hortons which is a franchise owned independently but licensed by a corporation.  I don't think I signed anything.. but I have a horrid memory and I'm not positive about that.  I did give her my SIN and we had a verbal agreement.  I'm not being paid ""under the table"" or anything.  My income was taxed."	Yes
65	Never doing those shifts again which amount to about $4 per hour and required I essentially lived at the doggy day care (there was a bed downstairs to sleep on) for the duration of the time. They initally told me that this payment is counted as 'salary' even though I was told upon being hired that I was paid/hour as minimum wage.  I've worked under the table before but have never been this unfairly compensated. Am I right in thinking they are blatantly violating the law?	Yes
66	"Posting for a friend.   Said friend is working at a certain Melville-themed Coffeeshop, and after a particularly Melvillian day received a call from the manager saying that his register was over $200 short.   Now, ""officially"", according to their training, only one person can use each till at a time. However, there's quite a bit of corner-cutting at this location, with other partners jumping on one another's tills to cover each other during breaks, fixing orders, and so on. Then there's the cash drops--large bills are ""supposed"" to go in specific lockboxes assigned to each register, except when it's 6am it's easy to forget which one's yours.  And then there's the fact that my friend is kinda just plain crap at his job--which would probably explain a shortfall of twenty or thirty dollars, but not the hundreds.   Anyway, the questions:  1. Can the store deduct from his paycheck or tips to recover the shortfall?  2. Is the absence of money sufficient evidence to accuse someone of stealing? If so, what can be done to prevent that, besides the usual advice of shutting and lawyering, respectively, up?"	Yes
67	My mom has been figured from her 20 year job because they say she no called no-showed.  For the last 3 years the company has been under new management.  It's been said amongst coworkers that there has been firing among anyone not young, fresh and modern to represents the companies new image. Out of everyone that worked there before management took over, now only a handful remain. Seasoned in their fields, they are all scared.  Should she seek a lawyer? Can they reject her of anything she has earned, such as Retirement, 401, etc? We're worried all of her commitments will be degraded.  By bullying I mean she has been harassed with text messages, people demanding her to come in on days she has scheduled PTO. Demanding her not to enjoy her days off and cover shifts.. just all around pressuring her to feel stressed and she feels bullied. Please advice   The company is a healthcare facility in NV. Please and thank you for sharing anything we should be aware of moving forward.	Yes
68	Briefly...  I make a HIPAA Violation report about my employer.  When you do this, there is a box that you can check that says that you do not want your information revealed to the company you are reporting.  Today I get a call from my employer... basically saying... about that HIPAA report you made about us...  Awkward.  I contact HHS.gov.  They confirmed that they erroneously revealed my information to my employer.  I do understand that my employer cannot legally retaliate against me.  (At least not overtly.  But who knows what my performance reviews are going to look like over the years).  I also understand that at least as of right now... I have no damages.  So I suspect that I answered my own question...  Except that it seems like a pretty big deal that the agency that you are reporting privacy violations to are violating your privacy.  Do you think this is something I should consider pursuing?  Or do I need to just sit back and wait for enumerable damages?	Yes
69	"I'm not at a risk of getting fired - but have been considering changing jobs if i find a better paying position.      My contract comes with a non compere clause for 12 months and NDA for 24 months limited geographically to my current country.  BUT it also comes with a line that, when translated, says:   ""The amount of monthly compensation is agreed upon at the end of the contract."".   Since sum is not specified, what stops me from asking a compensation equal to my full salary for the duration and refuse small and tiny compensations they might offer?"	Yes
70	This is slightly personal, hence the throwaway, and this situation is based in South East Asia. So, I know that there will be a certain degree of difference but I just want to know what I can expect. Also note that I am not the embezzler  If a person has been embezzling money from the company and the company goes to the cops, will the tax records of the company be under scrutiny?   Also, if the some of the money embezzled has been used to buy houses listed under that person's kids names, will that money be recouped? Alternatively, is there any way to force the person to return the money without going to the police?	Yes
71	"Hi, Don't know if this belongs here but here we go. I'm a teenager and I work at a sailing camp during the summers. There's maybe 15 of us in total and this is my second summer working along with 4 of my other co workers. Last year I racked in almost 300 volunteer hours, wasn't payed a single cent just as the rest of us were. We worked those hours because we were under the common assumption that we would be paid the next year as had been explained to us at the beginning of last year. At the beginning of this season our boss explained that she was looking for everyone to have reached a certain certification level to keep working. 4 out of around 15 people received that ""degree"". We were just notified that we might have to take this year as another training year... Yet there are multiple counselors being paid who have not taken the course. No way I'm working another year as a volunteer... What can we do?"	Yes
72	Now not reckless driving, but the one point negligent driving. It keeps coming back for job background checks and I disclose it now after the first time I was called out on it because I had no idea it was not a general type of ticket when I was 18 and then forgot the ticket was and never thought twice. I can't get a straight answer on if it is a misdemeanor or not? Also I have a lot of driving tickets (4) from the age 18-21. Will that impact me forever? I am embarrassed of them now especially since all my future employers can see them. I haven't had a ticket in two years (23 now) and drive much more responsibly now. I also live in Florida now with the one ticket at 21 in Florida, rest are in Maryland. Will all these forever show up?	Yes
73	location: Michigan  When I first called, they asked some general questions and said they'd get back to me in a few days.  After a week I called them and they said the money probably went to the state as unclaimed money, so it would take them a little longer to get this sorted out, and [payroll person] would get back to me in a week. I received the paycheck slightly under two years ago, and looking at Michigan's laws, it looks to me like my pay would've gone to the state after a year, so that makes sense.  A little more than a week later, I tried following up, and my phone call went straight to voicemail. I tried a few more calls at different times of day, and since they all went to voicemail, I suspect they blocked me.  Around two weeks later, I went in-person to my old workplace with the check, explained my situation, and the person at the front office emailed [payroll person] on my behalf. I got an email back the same day sounding like they just heard about this for the first time. I emailed them back the next day, only to get an automated message saying that as of the previous day, they weren't working there anymore and I should send my queries to [generic payroll email] which promised a response in 48 hours.  It's been over 3 work days since.   In summary, it's been over a month since I brought this to their attention, and I don't know what has been happening on their end, nor do I know if they plan to pay me.   I would go to the state and get the paycheck myself, but the michigan website for unclaimed money/property does not yield any results for my unclaimed paycheck - I don't know if that's a paperwork issue or what. I have my stale paycheck in hand, and I checked my bank account and it doesn't look like they ever paid me via direct deposit, so I don't think I'm mistaken.   The check is worth about $1,000. I'm reluctant to take legal action, and I'm not sure it would be worth the time and money anyways... So what else can I do? Keep attempting to follow up? I'm tired and upset with doing that, but I don't know what else to do.  Thanks so much for the input	Yes
74	I work 80-110 hours a week. I have 80 of available PTO that must be used within the next two months. I have requested single days off and up to 3 days off for PTO vacation days and every single time they say I can't for one reason or another.  They say if I don't use the PTO it will just be unused and wont roll over. They also won't pay for what I don't use. Over the course of the last 10 months off I have put in 14 requests and all have been denied. So what is the point of me getting PTO if I am not allowed to ever take it and I lose it since they won't allow me the time off?	Yes
75	"I work for a theatre chain in VA and we've had complaints all year about the lack of air conditioning.

I went into their office recently and they keep it a cool 68-70 while the lobby is around 80-83. This is before a large rush of people fill up the lobbies and the popcorn machines really get working. Is there anything OSHA or DOL can do? I tried googling but didn't find much on if VA requires AC for indoor employees. Could I request an inspection through VOSH?"	Yes
76	Let me start out by saying that I am transgender and I have legally changed my name. I don't quite pass yet. I signed up and started to drive for uber about 2 months ago. Last week my account was suspended indefinitely because a few passengers complained that the name and photo on my account was not the one driving the car. I tried explaining to uber that I'm trans and that I was driving the car. I tried asking uber if they can send a bigger photo to the passengers that complained to verify that I was not driving the car. Is there anything legally that I can do to get unbanned from driving for uber?	Yes
77	"I was an independent contractor for an online business that had a lot of members (gaming related). In my non-disclosure agreement there is a clause that prohibits me from communcating with any previous or current members. ""The Indepependent Contractor may not commmunicate with any previous or current members that have been or are apart of XYZ properties"".  This has a 3 year term to it and is based out of New Jersey. Many of these members are my friends, and many of them are no longer active members yet I still according to this cannot communicate with them for 3 years.  I would understand not being allowed to solicit members. Also, none of these members are employees of the company. I feel like this goes way beyond examples I have read about where a current employer forbids communication with previous employees. Is this a legitimate, enforcable clause?"	Yes
78	Sorry, I accidentally deleted my last post.   Hey, y'all. Any employee law information you can give me, either state (Indiana) or federal (US), as well as any advice on resolving any legal matters as quickly as I possibly can would be greatly appreciated!  So, since I teach during the school year, I have employment over the summer with a summer camp. I signed no contract with my employers after receiving the job offer - only an employment application and information for payroll. I accepted the job on the premise that I would be paid an hourly wage as I did last year for the same job, but I was told after approximately a week of work that I would be paid a flat rate of $450/week.   The new year also came with some new rules for the camp counselors. We cannot leave the campus without permission, and can only leave for 2 hours at night, one-at-a-time between 11PM-1AM. We were also told that we would be getting overtime pay, and if we worked overtime, to log it on the final week of the payroll cycle in which we will only be present on campus for 1 of the 7 days.   On another note, I was offered a better position at this camp initially, and then they took the offer back to give it to another candidate after I had already made living arrangements for the summer. But I'm not sure that I can prove this/it will hold up in court.   • Since I am required to be present unless given permission and am only allowed 2 hours per night off campus with that permission, does this mean that I am on call 24 hours? If so, can I be paid for the hours that I am not necessarily actively doing something since I am essentially required to just be around?   • Is keeping me here for a month with no release okay? How can I get some time away from here if I want to see family or when I have to move my permanent residence in 2 weeks?   • Do I have a case against my employer for not paying overtime and asking us to alter our time sheets even though this was discussed in a private meeting and there is no written record?   • Can the camp be liable for my expenses since they took back a job offer after I made living arrangements? Again, I'm not really sure I can prove this part.   • Who do I report the above issues to, and how long will it feasibly take to get fixed? Is it possible to resolve some of these issues within a couple of weeks or will I be toughing it out until the end of the camp?	Yes
79	My father fell at work (construction) in November 2016, tripping over a tarp on the ground. At the time he was sore but no severe or lasting pain. Two weeks later, he was laid off for the winter season, starting back to work in April. In early December he was casting a fishing rod and his shoulder dislocated. He was able to pop it back in and has been fine until the last few months. He has had his shoulder dislocate a number of times since April and more recently 3 times over the last week. These dislocations are severely painful for him, to the point that the pain is unbearable for him. A doctor's appointment with xray results showed that there was an past (healed) fracture and new liesions, most likely as a result of repeated dislocations. I am wondering if this is a workmans comp issue since the only fall that could have caused a fracture was at work last November, or if this would not qualify for workman's comp.	Yes
80	[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ffrla/pais_it_legal_for_an_employer_require_a_pregnancy/)  Short but positive update. Apparently the CEO of the company got wind of what was happening and just stopped the entire thing immediately.  She was not required to do anything at all and management has apparently been cool since.   No one knows what happened to management who asked for test behind closed doors but we imagine it was probably a lengthy reminder of what common sense is.  Thanks to everyone who offered advice, it really helped out.	Yes
81	"I recieved a felony DUI in Oregon last year. I served two months earlier this year and am out. I have a decent job now, however a couple ""dream jobs"" have opened up lately. Here is where I run into an issue. I do not know what to answer on the ""Have you been convicted of a felony (sometimes it asks for lower level crimes too, misdemeanor, etc) box. Now before you say to tell the truth, Oregon law EXPLICITLY does not allow that question. Oregon law HB 3025 states: This legislation prohibits an employer from requiring an applicant: to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction; to disclose, prior to an initial interview, a criminal conviction; or if no interview is conducted, to disclose, prior to a conditional offer of employment, a criminal conviction. Portland (where I live) then takes it a step farther, basically stating that they must offer conditional employment before asking about a conviction. They are not even allowed to ask DURING the interview. They must first offer me a conditional offer of employment (cuz ya know, Oregon). After that, if they learn that I have a felony, they can only rescind if the felony directly applies to the line of work I would be in. So this leaves me in a weird spot. When filling out job applications, local companies and national companies (even ones with large legal divisions, think Amazon, various national mortgage agencies) ask that question. It is yes, or no, and you cannot proceed without selecting an answer. Do I tell the truth and have a 0% chance at getting the job, or do I lie since they are breaking a law by even asking that question? It gets even more complicated when looking at tax breaks for hiring felons. They get $2400 for hiring a felon within 1 year of his release date, and are protected by a federal bonding program where they can receive $5,000 fidelity bonds, free of charge, as an incentive to hire job seekers that do not qualify for commercial fidelity bonds. Some applications afterwards have you fill out a WOTC where it asks you questions about foodstamps, government assitance, and being a felon. If we decide that lying is the best course of action, do I then tell the truth on the WOTC part of the application to then not be considered a felon on the part of the application where I am being illegally discriminated against, but be considered a felon on the tax credit part where being a felon works to the companies advantage?  If anyone has any in depth knowledge of this law, or my best course of action, please advise."	Yes
82	Let's say I have friend who is currently in an extremely abusive relationship to the point where it is affecting her work. I am also her supervisor. Would it be possible for me to ask for a restraining order from her boyfriend? Let's say she is in such a bad state the she cannot ask herself, is being forced not to. But me, along with a few other people see how bad it is and want to get her out. Therefore if we have several people that can attest to this, could this make a difference? Like can we make an argument that she has been abused so badly she cannot make this decision for herself? If this is not technically possible, what is my next best course of action?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
83	I work in an IT office in Upstate NY. We have two forms of on call.  Level 1: On call for a week Friday Night - Thursday Night. 2 AM when our office closes to 7 AM (8 AM on weekends) when it opens. Work is done at home on a company issued phone and laptop. You get $7 a night to reimburse for internet bandwidth used. You get paid for the time you spend on a call that comes in. 5 minutes minimum to keep the math easy for hours worked (i.e. if you spend 3 minutes on a call it's logged as 5). The sum of hours worked gets added as overtime as you still work M-F 8 hour days.  Level 2: On for a calendar month. 11 PM - 7 AM weekdays, 5 pm - 8 AM weekends. Work done at home with a company laptop and phone. You do not get compensated every night, but if you answer a phone call once you get $5 reimbursement for internet. Same rules for logging time on calls applies as level 1.  Some people seem to think these procedures are outside the NYS labor laws and I can't seem to find anywhere where that would be true. I've specifically heard the way they pay out hours worked and also one person seemed to think there has to be a minimum hours worked even if only 5 minutes are spent working on a particular night. I just want to know if there is anything outside the law going on.	Yes
84	I am a 16 year old living in Virginia.  My boss has me working 12 hour shifts with no breaks. I've asked for breaks multiple times, but he won't give me one. What do?	Yes
85	I was fired from my job as a health inspector at a county government in Illinois. I was told it was because I was not performing to expectations. I was on a 6 month probationary period and at 5 1/2 months through it, and would not have protection from the union until 6 months. I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me.   I work very little with my bosses (the director and assistant director of the division), and instead work closely with senior people who work as trainers. In the 5.5 months I received no formal performance review or corrective action.   I was part of a harassment investigation, against the director of the division as I witnessed him say something sexist to another coworker. This was the second harassment investigation against the director.   There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire.   Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires.   The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women).   Do I have a case for retaliation since I was fired being part of a harassment investigation? Do I have a case for wrongful termination since there was little to no documentation about corrective action and heterosexual employees, who performed worse than me were retained.   If I do have a case, what do I do next?	Yes
86	Not me but a relative was fired today after 6 months working for a company. Their reason was that he did not inform HR of his conviction. This was his first job after prison and he was required to provide the halfway house he lived in a signed agreement confirming employment. His bosses both knew of the conviction from the interview forward. Even signed said document the prison system required.   Arkansas is right to work. But is there a case against the employer here? If not, is there a case to still get unemployment? They said he would not be eligible for failure to disclose the conviction to HR.   Please help! Thanks.	Yes
87	So my new boss told me today at orientation that it's going to take 3-4 pay cycles for my paycheck to come. The pay cycle however is twice monthly and the owner doesn't do paper checks so my only option for pay is direct deposit. Something just screams red flag. Any legal advice on this one?	Yes
88	**Fair-warning, this is textbook high school drama bullshit. Please click out if you feel like it's going to be a waste of time.**  I currently work at one of the most known fast food restaurants that serves exclusively chicken.   The manager (#1) of the store brought one of his workers with him to this store. We'll call him Kelso and he's second in position.** The dude is 20 years old** and the're basically like father and son. I'm on good terms with all of the management here, but him (because of the issue I'm about to bring up). Even though I'm close with and well liked the management team and the owner of the store, the management team here are VERY close here which is why I'm even bringing this to Reddit because I believe nothing will come out of me bringing this to their attention.  There's a girl (we'll call her Jackie) who everyone is trying to get at/talk to where I work and it's a known fact that this girl and Jake are exclusive and it's known to the public. I saw Kelso (#2) post a picture of him and Jackie on Instagram. I tried liking it and it wouldn't let me. I kept liking it, but it would unlike it automatically so I thought that was weird. So I refreshed my Instagram and his picture which was posted a minute ago was gone. I checked my followers and who I was following and he wasn't there.   So then, I went to a picture of a coworker where I knew he commented on and saw his name there. I clicked on it, and tried following him and it would un-follow automatically.   So then I dm'd a coworker who happens to be very close to Jackie. This is what was said: http://imgur.com/a/SQOQv  His girlfriend would almost always try talking to me and I knew that some shit would go down if he ever saw me talking to her so I made sure to make things short. Unfortunately for me one day, we were talking (WHILE WORKING) and I saw him staring at us from the corner of my eye. At first, I thought nothing of it and boy was I wrong. I talked to Kelso a week or two prior about my hours and I have screenshots of him saying that he'll get me anywhere from 35-40 hours and if anything, he'll get me NEAR that. Ever since the incident of me talking to his girl happened, my hours have went from 38 --&gt; 26 --&gt; 20 --&gt; 16. The guy is basically trying to get me to quit and it's working. I'm not trying to stress over some high school bs when I've been away from that for a couple of years. My question is, is there anything I can do? I was thinking that this HAS to be: 1. conflict of interest and/or 2. unrelated work retaliation. Unfortunately for me, I believe I only have circumstantial evidence. I'm going to put my two weeks in in a few days and I'm chalking this up as a lost cause, but this shit isn't right and don't want someone else going through the same thing because of this insecure fuck.	Yes
89	"I work in New Hampshire for a summer job thats 40 hours a week for 7 weeks. Its seasonal. Its run through a department of the town I live in, so I am employed by the town. My boss told me two things, and I'm not sure how to go about them.  1) I can't get overtime. I'm not sure why not. Is there a rule/law for this? She ""forgot"" to pay us for a training session we had, so she said I have to wait until the seasonal employment is over in order to fill out a timesheet. Or put it in for a day I'm taking off.  2) One week we spend an extra hour off-site. For the past two years, we did not get paid for that extra hour that 41 hour week.  Should i be getting paid? How would I go about this professionally?  Thanks for any &amp; all help."	Yes
90	"It has been a drawn out process in which she has been retaliating against me.   Essentially I had been told one thing (attendance point policy was not thoroughly enforced by her) before I reported her for theft, but afterward I ended up receiving disciplinary actions on attendance which no one on my team was receiving prior, or seemed to be after.  I noticed my boss had a ""tell"" when she was caught lying, which was to explain a process or reasoning behind a situation in full detail and seemingly out of the blue. The product that was missing? It was found in an obscure location and we don't know why it was there, but it was there.   I let my boss' questionable behavior and seemingly loose morals slide for a while, until the stress became unbearable. At which point I reported her, it was anonymous at first. A week or so after the report I brought up the fact I was stressed and made a report to the manager above my boss (who is also close friends with my boss) I had falsely believed this would help the situation and I wanted the stress to go away because I knew I was pregnant and I was concerned the stress would negatively effect my pregnancy (and even told my boss' boss as much).   That was all back in February. I spent time in the following months by feeling miserable but also looking to transfer to a different department or store. However I felt concerned and afraid my boss would not allow me to transfer and once she knew I was trying would react negatively against me even more than before. By May the work environment had become so stressful to me that I told my boss I would rather die than go to work so I needed to seek help. I spoke with HR and they brushed my concerns aside. Then I set up a leave of absence to seek help on the issue. As soon as I heard a return to work date from my doctor I notified my boss and said I would like part time hours (I was working full time before leave). My boss made no indication this would be an issue or against policy until two weeks later on the day before I was set to return. On the day before my leave was up I was informed by HR that I needed a doctor's note with restrictions stating I must work part time for my health. If that option was not used I was to apply to any job in the company as part time. Not my job I had, but any job with no guarantee I would be hired.  Being that it was the end of a business day I could not reach my doctor to get a note in time so I was unable to work my first shift back. My doctor was then out of the office for 6 days (although two were weekend days) I had been scheduled to work in quite a few of those days so I emailed HR asking what I needed to do until my doctor returned. HR directed me to the 3rd party leave office but my question pertained to the store operations, so I rephrased my question in another email and finally got an answer.   By the time my doctor responded I decided to quit. I would have loved to stay at that job but the attitudes of the office and management made me feel like a target.   I suppose what I am hoping for from this situation is at least to have my medical bills paid. I am coming to terms with not having a great job (besides my boss) but am disappointed things happened this way despite telling every manager I spoke with about this situation ""I don't want to get fired for being honest"" and being reassured that nothing negative would come from me making a report."	Yes
91	"I am working as a Contractor in Orange, CA and teaching lessons scheduled a couple of weeks in advance. When I tried to quit, my boss told me that I was under contract and still had to teach. I have pasted the two clauses relating to quitting and teaching. It sounds like I still have to teach the previously booked lessons outside of the 14 day quitting notice. I wanted a second opinion on this. Thanks!  ""(b) Either the Contractor or the Company may terminate the Contractor’s provision of the Services under this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, including for convenience, upon giving fourteen (14) calendar days’ written notice to the other party.  (c) Notwithstanding any termination of the Contractor’s provision of the Services for any reason whatsoever, the Contractor shall teach any lessons booked prior to the date on which notice of termination was given, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Company."""	Yes
92	After moving to an open work space, my focus and attention struggles has really been exasperated and with a family history of mental health struggles I started accepting I might be no longer overcoming my own outside of professional help. I started seeking out help on my own accord knowing I needed to improve. In a meeting with my boss about my unsatisfactory performance, I disclosed to them I had just met with my physician to begin the process of getting help.   I also reached out to HR that day seeking resources for help, if there were any. HR scheduled a meeting with me and my boss to understand my situation and during this meeting I had informed them that I was meeting with a therapist through EAP.   Now, my position is being terminated and I was informed of this the day before my therapist appointment. Though I am bring offered a generous severance and the papers explicitly state this was a decision being made before I sought help from them, it's with an obvious condition that I have no legal options.   I don't want to continue in my position, however I think this is a very questionable time line of events and I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Unfortunately I have not been officially diagnosed with anything - the earliest I could see an actual doctor in my area for this was going to be months in advance. Clearly I have no time to go do so before I have to make a decision to sign.	Yes
93	I was laid off the week of Christmas. Filed for unemployment, Tuesday 13/26/17. Called MARVIN, Monday 1/8/18. Christmas was a paid holiday, so we have to claim it when we call MARVIN. I haven't been paid yet, because my employer hasn't provided paperwork to the state regarding holiday pay. When we get laid off and don't get holiday pay, everything goes through just fine Everytime we get holiday pay during a layoff, we can count on not getting paid right away.  Is my employer breaking any laws? What can I do to try and get paid in a timely manner?	Yes
94	I live in Florida. At the beginning of the summer I accepted an unpaid web development role at a start up. I was skeptical to begin with, but they said I could set my own hours and it was only part time. I also planned on working another part time job. I was the only unpaid intern they hired (which they said was because unlike everyone else who was local and could continue working throughout the year, I had to return to school at the end of the summer). They stated since I was unpaid the work I would be doing would be different. I decided to go for a few days to see what it was like since there was no real obligation.    After the first day, the CTO pulled me aside and stated that once we finished the training period I would be paid for my work. Now, I likely would not have stayed if they had not said they intended to paid me. However, the work I have been doing is exactly the same as everybody else, and the one month review where they were planning on converting me to paid that was supposed to happen weeks ago has been continually pushed back. The supervisors are now all at a conference for a week leaving only interns in the office and another week without pay for me. I would feel bad if I left because everything we've been working on has been in partners and I don't want to leave mine in the dust. When I give my availability for my other part time job I cleared my Monday though Thursday since I thought I would be making money at my internship during that time, so the opportunity cost here is high. Should I report my internship? From what I understand, since I am doing work that is normally done by paid employees and I am not paid, it's illegal. I should also note that all interns are technically independent contractors (I don't know if that changes anything).   So, is this internship illegal, and if so, what is the procedure like for reporting one? Woolf I be able to get paid for the hours I worked?	Yes
95	"I'm a 24 year old male, (was) working in a metallurgical quality control lab of a steel stamping plant with two old ladies (who I despise). I tolerated the 12.25hr job for a year now. Yesterday it was just me and my manager (the one who groped me) in the office and I said some like ""Yeah he's in a meeting or something"" and she awkwardly grabs my bicep in a weird in a unusual way. This isn't the first time this has happened either.   I went straight to HR and the president of the company and told them what happened,  and they were trying to make me sound like I'M crazy and hats a normal thing to do when you need to get someone's attention (even though we were alone in the office and right next to each other). They sent me home to ""calm down and collect myself""  So, this morning I go into work with the intention of going straight to my manager and saying ""Listen, about yesterday, I just don't like being touched like that"" and when I try, she interrupts me mid-sentence and tells me to go talk to HR.. I go into HR and they basically tell me that I can still use them as a reference, for another job because I'm no longer ""compatible"" to work with my manager in that quality control office.   The place was beginning to make me want to kill myself and I don't think 12.25/hr was worth that anyways. I just don't know what to do now. Hopefully a years worth of experience is enough to get somewhere else in quality control. I feel like they were scared they could get sued. Help."	Yes
96	I'm not sure if I can report this or how I should. or if by reporting it I can be retaliated against. But here's what happened.  A few months ago I attended training with my supervisor, we are both males and he is significantly older than I. We had originally planned to stay at the same hotel, however different rooms as is policy.  On arrival he did not book his room correctly and turned to me almost expecting me to say he could share mine. I offered that he could use my room to look for another hotel.  He found another hotel and after the first day of training he complained about how my hotel had the better facilities. I offered for him to use the facilities at my hotel and we could go to dinner after he was finished. He went swimming and after he was finished I said he could change in my bathroom and then we could go to dinner. He said he didn't need to change in the bathroom and proceeded to undress and change right in front of me in the bedroom area of the hotel. This obviously made me uncomfortable and I looked away.  I guess my questions are, 1) Should I report this? Or is this just acceptable as its not unlike a locker room situation? 2) Has to much time gone by for me to report this? It just recently came up again in a conversation and obviously it does bother me a bit. 3) If I take this to our HR what potential fallout could harm me?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
97	Title.  I live in Michigan and where I work, I recently got in a bit of trouble for not giving a coworkers next shift to a (potential) customer over the phone. This is a basic retail sales environment, if that matters.   When I lived in North Carolina, I was told that it was illegal to give a schedule out like that, as there was no way of knowing if the person asking had ill intentions or not, I never thought to look it up, and just stuck with it.   Now, no matter what google searches I do, I only find results for allotted breaks, overtime, and the like.   Any help would be awesome, because this manager is kind of a dick, and if I can, I'd like to prove him wrong. I'm not above admitting I was in the wrong, though. And to be honest, I'm mostly just curious.	Yes
98	I work as a waiter in Pembroke Pines, Florida, where minimum wage for someone in my profession is $5.08. My paychecks have been about $35-$40 dollars and i'm definitely working more than 8 hours. I know that if an employee doesn't meet the hourly mark in declared tips  the company makes up the difference. But does it work the other way around? if i'm declaring tips which reach or exceed the appropriate hourly mark are they allowed to cut into my hourly paycheck and give me less than $5?	Yes
99	"I work at a car dealership in MS, US. We work monday-Friday 45hrs a week. Once a year we work on Saturday to do ""inventory"". We basically count stuff and clean the whole building. The owner pays us cash (usually amounting to around $11/hr). I am hourly and i do not receive time and a half. We don't clock in and the money never goes to our check. He hands us cash.  Is this legal?"	Yes
100	I have severe depression and anxiety and it was causing my performance to drop and they reached out to me about it. At this time I disclosed my mental illnesses to HR to get it documented. After this I was singled out and threatened on a weekly basis that they were going to fire me for not meeting stats for 3-4 months. This put a lot of stress  and anxiety on me causing my depression to get worse and worse which in turn caused my performance to worsen. I then reached out to the employee assistance program to set up sessions to get medication for my depression due to how bad it was getting due to them. Mind you that a good majority of employee's were doing around the same as me and some even worse that were not being treated this way or even being spoken to about it. They continued to push me and have gotten so bad that I can barely function. I have a session set up to see someone about getting back on medication which i fully disclosed to them that i was seeking help at which point they fired me for performance and tried to pay me to sign a contract giving up any rights to legal action. I feel I was discriminated against and harassed due to my mental illnesses to the point of breaking me and then they fired me. I'm trying to find out if I can fight this.	Yes
101	"I'm 50 years old.  After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.  Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.  My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.  Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.  I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.  Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.  Thanks very much for any advice you can give."	Yes
102	"I am a teacher in North Carolina. I have worked at this school for 5 years.  A few weeks after we got out for the summer, the school secretary sent out a questionnaire via email to all staff that asks for a list of regularly used prescription medications. The form is to be completed before school returns in August. They have never asked for this before, we usually just have to have a physical and a letter stating that we do not have TB. I have ADHD and take concerta, as well as an anti depressant and birth control. I am a private person and do not feel like sharing this with my boss. Can they ask for this? I did some reading and everything I have read so far just says ""it depends."""	Yes
103	He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.   He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there.   Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday.   What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.   TL:DR; Will trying for a green card marriage as a US citizen hurt the fact that I haven't been working legally (according to the IRS)?	Yes
104	I currently work at a small SaaS company in a client support type of role. I do general troubleshooting and account setups, nothing on the technical side of things nor do I take part in the sales process.   I've recently got an interview with another, much larger, company in the same exact field, in a different state, doing something pretty similar but not dealing with clients nearly as much.   Well, comes to find out that I have a non-compete that prevents me from working in the industry for TWO YEARS after quitting or being let go. The non-compete was signed when I first started at a super entry level call center position.   Is there any way around this? This is my field of expertise and it would be really hard to find another job that I'm as good at in this field. Am I screwed and stuck at my current company until the end of time?	Yes
105	Ok, asking for a friend. She works for a k-12 school district in central California as a custodian. The Assistant Principal at school site gave orders to classified workers, saying they are not allowed to speak Spanish while at work. We're not taking about in official work meetings, or to give instructions, just words thrown into casual conversation between Spanish-speaking coworkers. He won't put this in writing, of course. When she went to her union rep, the AP changes his story, saying that employees are speaking Spanish on the school walkie-talkies, and this creates a safety issue since not all workers understand it.  How much trouble is this guy potentially in?	Yes
106	Throwaway account to protect those involved.  A good buddy of mine has worked in management at this one place for the past twenty or so years, up until it recently moved out of state. A church has purchased the building, and has employed him to keep things in order as it is is renovated (it is becoming a headquarters for the church, as well as for a house of worship for the town). However, there are a few suspicious things going on that leave me feeling uneasy.  1. Although he is employed to be working 40 hours a week, he puts in a good number of hours of (unpaid) overtime each week, so that he is really working upwards of 60 hours a week. This is in part due to the fact that  2. in hiring him, the church had fired all of their other staff (the guy who mows the lawn, etc.) for a separate location, and is now asking my friend to manage that facility as well. Unfortunately, he's a bit of a pushover, and so he is just going along with it. So, while he is employed to be managing one location, he is really working two, without anyone under him to actually provide assistance. As such, he is doing a good deal of manual labour himself, between driving back and forth for hours between both locations. I'm worried, because his age is definitely getting to him. I fear that a few more months of this could ruin his health.  3. He is now a salaried worker of the church. However, they are consistently late with paying him. For instance, supposing he was meant to be paid on the 4th, it might be added to his account on the 7th. Usually, there is a delay of 2-4 *business days*, meaning that, when he was meant to be paid on June 30th, he only receive it on July 6th, due to bank holiday around the 4th.  Him, being the person he is, is unlikely to make a fuss about this with his management, because he doesn't see that anything is wrong. I have read up a bit about overtime exemptions for EAP employees on the DOL's website, and from what I gather, that his work primarily consists of manual labour would seem to exclude him from that exemption. The two main questions I have hear are a) is this an accurate assessment of what the DOL says about overtime exemptions in regards to the first point, and b) is there any more information I can give my friend that he can use in filing a complaint with his current employer?	Yes
107	"I'm an idiot. I've been spending, on average, 3-4 hours a day out of my 7.5 hour work-day (Monday - Friday, 9 - 5) for the past... 2 years on this website, both general surfing and posting (probably 2000 posts? no idea, at least that). I'm the only person in the company who does what I do, I took over for a retiree and there was no manual/documentation of anything, I just trained with her for a month and then learned the rest on my own and I'm integral to the department (primarily finance/secondarily admin role, don't want to get more detailed).    My boss isn't a very good actor and he's been saying/doing a lot of things over the past few weeks that make me think they're trying to get me to tell them everything about how I do my job, before they fire me. I've never had a warning for the amount of internet usage or anything but there's no reason otherwise they'd consider firing me, and like I said, I can read my boss pretty well and he's not a good actor.    If they do tell me that they're firing me and it's due to the high usage, can I say ""No, that wasn't me""? Like, can I demand proof? I'm not part of a union and I'm *pretty sure* they can fire me for any reason, but would making a demand like that do anything? Is there any possibility of legal repercussions if I argue it and make them prove it? The company is undergoing very public downsizing, so if I say I got laid off I can go on unemployment benefits, but if I got fired then I wouldn't be eligible. **Side question** If I file for unemployment, would the company tell the unemployment office that I was fired as opposed to let go? I assume yes, but would like to know. I realize I'm a piece of shit, I'm looking for a new job either way so all of this is just temporary anyways."	Yes
108	Posting for a friend. Female was Injured on the job at a grocery store due to constant lifting. Coerced into not filing a workers comp case, but has x-rays and a chiropractic visit on record from that time period. The company continues to schedule her for active shifts after hr filing her into a non active shifts which she is unable to do.     On top of this, she makes 12.80 an hour. Less than 20k a year. I was wondering what public assistance she might be able to take advantage of to help stay afloat and any recommendation on legal routes to obtain a lawyer.      Thank you	Yes
109	According to North Carolina department of labor law after 6 hours of working you MUST leave for at least a 30 minute lunch. An hour if you're working more than 8 hours (I'm not sure how this works. Is it that after 8 hours I must leave for an hour? Or simply if I work an 8 hour or more shift I must get an hour lunch?)  Let me know if there's any more information that you would need added. I don't want compensation or anyone to lose their job, although if that's what would happen by reporting it (the job losing, not the compensation) I'll do it. I want this piece of shit to know you can't deny someone a lunch break.   The only reason I didn't simply walk out after 6 hours was because I was working on someone's car, and I'm not a POS who's going to make someone wait an extra hour after I had already been working on it for an hour.   Thanks in advanced for any answers.	Yes
110	Hi Reddit,  This week alone I worked and average of 36 hours and 32 minutes. When I got my check it was unreasonably low and when I checked my Paycor account, it says I only have 16 hours worked?   This happens often at my work place, but hours aren't drastically cut like they were this time, 19 hours were not accounted for? I'm asking this because when I go in and speak to them about this because I'd like to if this is okay, or what I should say.  L	Yes
111	So back in July of 2016 I was at work and lost two fingers. The company I was working for didn't have workcomp insurance. So my insurance covered most of the cost for the surgery and what not. I thought it was completely paid by Medicaid but my lawyer says I actually owe them about 3k. Our options were to sue them and we offered 85k. He came up with that number by figuring out the lose of fingers and a few other things. Sorry dont have the letter he sent me to give exact info. So we sent the offer last month and no response. So I called to see if he heard anything and he said no, He thinks we should go with the Illinois Workers compensation. He said that way we can for sure get some money. But who knows when I would get that and how much since Illinois is broke. My personal opinion is that we should do a civil lawsuit but im not the lawyer. So I dont know what to do. Please advise of any info you might have.	Yes
112	"So some more info, first I am in Kentucky. I have a supervisor that is seemingly being harassing. I say seemingly because I do not know what legally constitutes harassment. But I feel harassed. So the information.. I started a new job, which required a lot of training on the employer's processes and their computer system. I was not learning quick enough for my boss and she began asking me if I had a ""processing disorder"". Later, she and her supervisor called me into a meeting with a list of complaints they had for me that they said came from other co-workers. The list contained some things about my attitude but the majority of the list included, things like tapping, banging my mouse, hiccuping, and talking loudly. Just to name a few. During the meeting she also accused me of being ADHD.  To be noted I am hard of hearing and I wear hearing aids. I am fairly young and have early hearing loss. I at times talk loudly when there is a lot of noise and I have difficulty hearing myself. Again because of the noise I have difficulty hearing others. I have a full list of the complaints as I had to sign it. Since that meeting I have been called into my supervisor's office over what seems like very small matters that she wishes to make big issues, such as the way I do documentation.  The documentation is not wrong, it's just different than what she does, but I try my best to conform to her way, but it has begun to be very stressful. In addition, during the meetings she speaks to me very demeaning in that she will ask ""Do you understand"" after almost every comment. I never know when I am going to be called into her office for minor offenses. And again do not know if this is legally harassing or just my boss doing her best to get me to quit. I guess my biggest concern is her asking me and telling my I have processing disorder or am ADHD just because I don't do what and how she does things."	Yes
113	I was terminated from my company in May. I was paid out growth commission in April from a deal I closed in February.(commission is paid out on growth through 4 months after initial close)  The company paid the growth amount, accounting approved the payment and I was paid the amount in April. In May I was unexpectedly let go from the company for performance. I went on my way and began my search for another job. I received  a call from the company stating that there was an error and they are looking for repayment of the commission. They stated that it wasn't an accounting error but a customer success error. The customer paid the growth amount, accounting approved it and then I was paid the commission the month later in April. Now it is July and they are looking for repayment - I am hoping to get some advice on the my rights here. I was paid the commission in good faith back in April and I have spent the money as it was owed to me. They also stated on the phone that they are holding my final commission check until repayment, which doesn't seem right. I am wondering if I need to get a lawyer involved... I did not agree to any repayment and they stated they will be getting back to me..   I am happy to give anyone additional information. I appreciate any help!!! Thank you!	Yes
114	"I work at a minimum wage service job and put in my two weeks on Monday last week. As the usual two-week courtesy notice would have it, I would typically work until my last usual shift which is this Saturday. However, I told him in writing on my two-week notice that I only want to work til this Thursday (two days from today), which is kinda like a one and a half week notice. To get me to work the last couple shifts, he claimed two things (in person)    1) I need to show up to work because ""I already paid you for those hours, so you need to show up for them"". and    2) ""I need to give you your last paycheck on your last day"" in exchange for my uniform.    ...now for the record I think I know the real reason as to why he's doing this. A number people are leaving for vacation during this time (which is why I couldn't request time off myself in the first place) so he kinda maybe needs me. I also know that I have a direct deposit with the company, so the ""hand me my paycheck thing"" seems pretty bullshit. At the very least, I know he's heavily bending the truth, either too proud to tell ask me straight ""Hey I know you wrote you wanted to give me one and a half weeks, but I really need you this weekend."" or just hoping I'm gullible enough to believe whatever he claims.    Or is he? That's what I want to ask you guys.    Is he legally able to indebt me with ""wage prepayment"" and as a side question, how bullshit is his need to ""hand me my check on the last day""?    Thanks for your time."	Yes
115	"Back story: My company (A) was acquired 1.5 years ago (January 2016) by company (B). In the agreement they were required to keep all company A employees for one year. After that year was over they laid a few of us off for financial reasons.   I was sadly one of those and am now filing for unemployment. It asks me to ""Provide your employment history for the past 18 months, including your very last employer.""   Do I include company A and company B TOGETHER as one company where I have worked for the past 18 months? or list them separately? There is nowhere to include information about the acquisition.   Thanks for the help!"	Yes
116	I work at my state university, and there is a cap on the hours a student may work (25 hours/week). I am an instructional aid (I teach the chemistry labs), but instead of paying per hour that you are actually there they pay you at a rate of 7 hours per every lab you teach (factoring in 3 hours per lab plus 2 office hours and 2 hours grading), and 3 hours for every recitation class you teach. Now, this summer I teach 3 labs and 3 recitations per week: this should equal 30 hours per week, but since I'm capped at 25 hours, I can only enter that many on my timesheet.   I thought that this was far, since often times the 7 hours they pay you for doesn't really equal 7 hours of actual work, but then I thought that they're making me work more per week for the same amount of pay as another student who works 5 hours less than I do.   Is this legal? Thank you in advance for any help!	Yes
117	I haven't actually called him out on it as of yet. If he does not agree with my discrepancy is there any legal action I could take? Seems like a classic bait and switch to me.   Craiglist ad is directly linked to his work email. I took screen shots.	Yes
118	Over the weekend I was having a discussion with friends and they turned me on to the California Overtime Exemption laws. I work in the IT field, and according to [one site I found](http://ckslaw.com/it-and-computer-technology-workers/) it appears I'm paid significantly below the Overtime Exemption threshold, but am salaried and not provided overtime pay.  The main hangup I have is that if I check the [actual wage order](http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/WageOrders2006/iwcarticle4.html), it breaks down the salary cutoff as 2 times the state minimum wage, so I'm not sure where that number in the first site comes from.  I've never had any experience with legal matters like this and am not really sure what to do with this information. Any advice is greatly appreciated!	Yes
119	"Hey --  Does anyone have any experience with legal rights or protection of workers employed in at-will positions?  I know I can be fired without cause, but am I protected from relatiatory discharge or other forms of mistreatment while still at the job?  Additionally, do EO/discrimination complaints *only* apply to minority groups?  Is there another legal term for preferential biases that don't apply to age/sex/etc?  My next step is requesting a formal meeting and initiating the Dispute Resolution Program described in my employee handbook, but frankly I'm afraid to even go that far.    Long story short, I feel there are unfair practices at my place of employment, and one manager in particular ignores the company rules and doesn't give annual reviews and regularly reassigns employees without giving them written job descriptions or expectations.  I don't think any of that is illegal, necessarily, but all of it violates the employee handbook and some of us are planning to address it with the COO.  I work in Washington DC, and the handbook clearly states that my employment is defined as ""at-will.""  I've been there 5 years.  I can give more details via PM if anyone asks.  Thanks in advance!"	Yes
120	First time poster so go easy on me. I have a new job and this is my third week. The first two weeks we worked 10 hour shifts Monday through Friday which was fine. Now they've put us on 12 hour shifts Monday through Friday. is this even legal? Any place I've ever heard of doing 12 hour shifts the most they will work is three days in a row. This just seems overly excessive to me. There will be no work/life ratio. Thanks guys. (I'm in Kentucky, btw)	Yes
121	"After approaching her boss he said ""you havent got the raise because i dont think you proved enough to me""  my question is, is this legal?  technically they are withholding money from her that she should be getting since shes been promoted.   Ive tried looking at NYC job laws but cant find anything.  shes been doing the work load of her current title from the promotion but wont give her the raise that came with it.   Before i say anything to her i was just wondering if this falls under illegal by labor law"	Yes
122	My wife got a new fulltime job recently but still is in the probation period. Shes been put on bed rest for few months for reasons. Her work isn't office work so she can't do it from home or anything. Can she get fired? Does she have legal protection against being fired?	Yes
123	Hello - over the last few years, I noticed my skin had been getting progressive worse like I'm really allergic to something.  I've documented the deterioration of my skin the whole time at my doctor's behest.  Over the last two years, I've worked with my doctors to try everything possible - from steroids to light therapy to daily injections.  Nothing worked.  My doctor began to wonder if it was an environmental issue and encouraged me to stay away from my old, musty office for two weeks and see what happens - lo and behold, my skin turned almost back to normal for the first time in years.    I came back to my boss and talked to her about options for me to continue working - I offered telecommuting, working in another office across the street and coming in for meetings, etc.  She refused to work with me on anything.  I'm now taking medical leave.  What options do I have?	Yes
124	So my ex-employer is a real shady POS (tax fraud, insurance fraud, etc). So the story is that for the past 2 months, he's been having big-time money problems, which caused our last four paychecks to be 7-10 days late. But then he got a loan for a couple hundred k, and now we have money again. My last paycheck was supposed to be 07/03, but I was on PTO (we don't have a written PTO policy, but other employees have taken PTO without any ramifications, and he said I could take it) until 07/05. While I was gone, he kept pressuring me to DocuSign this NDA and non-compete. He still owes me $3k for unpaid medical expenses (signed employment contract states medical coverage is part of benefits, but our insurance was retroactively cancelled in April, which caused all my doctor appointments from January to April to be rejected by insurance, so small bills became huge). He's promised to pay this back numerous times, but of course, he hasn't. I told him I'd sign the NDA/Non-compete out of goodwill, but I expected him to honor his contract and pay me for consequential damages caused by the insurance cancelling. When I return to the office, he seizes my phone and laptop (I'm guessing to get rid of my evidence I've collected against him) and locks me out of my emails. I took this as termination, even though he said it wasn't (I'm sure this was a ploy to get me to stay, so he could further insulate himself from potential damage), but since I wasn't paid, I was out of there. So I sent him a demand letter since he has 6 days to pay me my final paychecks. My question is this: I know he's going to claim that my PTO was unauthorized, but can I claim that's discriminatory because other employees literally took PTO the week before and it didn't affect their paycheck. He also told me to send the hours I was into the office, knowing that none of the employees had been to the office (yet again, none of them had to fill out time sheets) because 1. we hadn't been paid yet and 2. creditors were coming into the office threatening to blow or shoot the place up until they got their money. I was still working, and I had text messages/emails of 1. asking for him to pay server costs, so I could continue working on the website and 2. him sending me to various companies to collect bills on our company's behalf (also promising to pay my medical reimbursement if I managed to collect checks). Will he be able to deny me my last paycheck by claiming I didn't go into the office. And should I threaten what I have on him (tax fraud, insurance fraud)? I also have access to technical systems I set up (and technically own because I bought them with my own money in case something like this happened). Should I take down the systems, or will this backfire on me and allow him to sue me for damages or something. This is really complicated because this guys was SOOOO unscrupulous, sloppy, and corrupt. What do you guys propose is the best course of action? Thanks so much!	Yes
125	Hello legaladvice peeps,  In 2016, I worked for a smallish tech company with a whole host of problems, including sexual harassment, unequal pay given to employees with the same responsibilities, internal nepotism, etc etc. I was asked by a journalist to speak on these problems, in particular about how several employees banded together to bargain for an HR representative and equal pay for the same work.   I spoke to the journalist already, but I've negotiated anonymity and am debating going on-record. The thing is, I signed an NDA, and I'm not sure if it's enforceable in this instance. I can send a copy of it privately if you're curious. But this article will come out within the time period specified by the NDA (2 years). My question is, can an NDA protect against claims of employer retaliation? AFAIK, that's not a business strategy, intellectual property, or anything of the like. It's just how I was treated by my employer, and as far as I can tell, collective bargaining is a federally protected action.  Anyway, any help would be appreciated, here.	Yes
126	I work for a Fortune 500 company in California.  I accepted an offer in the fall of 2016.  The offer did not explicitly list my PTO days, but it had a link to the current benefits site.  The current benefits site detailed that PTO days for employees in my range would be X, and a footnote that said the schedule would change on 1 Jan 2017.  My hiring was delayed by the company until 2017, and now I make X-16 hours of PTO, according to the new schedule.    I believe this has happened to numerous other employees as well, since my hiring class was around 100, and all had offers accepted in 2016.  Do I have any recourse for the company changing the terms of employment?	Yes
127	As stated I'm having to go in tomorrow at 5 am for an emergency procedure. I had today off, and just left the doctors where I found out. I haven't told my job yet. I'm a front office manager at a hotel.   Normally I wouldn't be too worried, but I'm concerned due to the fact we've just gotten a new general manager, who for lack of better words is a complete idiot. He can't do ANYTHING by himself. He's only been at our property for less than a week. No one on the property really knows how to do what I do on a daily basis. This is what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned since I will be out for a minimum of two weeks- they will replace me. Especially seeing as this is going to make everyone's lives really difficult.  How should I handle this situation with my employer and do I have any rights? All our handbook states is if you require more than three days off you need a doctors note.	Yes
128	I started working for the company over 4 months ago and I have only taken one day off (for my grandmas funeral). My mom thinks I have a staph infection but I want to go to the doctor to make sure that I am ok ( I have been feeling nauseous for the last few days and I have this sore on my foot that itches). The company has about 12 employees including me. My real question really is if there is anything in Texas law about paid time off, vacation days, and sick days, for a small company. I also was wondering about not receiving check stubs when I am being paid. He takes taxes, SS, and health insurance out of my check and that is shown at the bottom of the actual check but I feel like check stubs should be in place. Any thoughts and advice??	Yes
129	"Hey guys, so I'm starting a new job and they're having me sign a non-compete agreement, and I had a few concerns about the wording of it so my boyfriend suggested I post here.   Firstly, I work in advertising, so a non-compete agreement is pretty standard I'm told. But there are a few sections that seem really unreasonable to me if I'm reading them correctly. I live in Tennessee if that matters. (I've also replaced the company name with XXX)  The first section:  'Employee shall devote all professional time and attention to the business of XXX. During the term of this Agreement, all persons from or for whom Employee solicits business or performs advertising, marketing, direct marketing, digital marketing or public relations services shall be clients of XXX, and all fees, commissions and other compensation for Employee’s services, direct or indirect, shall be payable solely to XXX. All clients, and all services rendered by Employee to or for all clients, shall be approved by XXX before any services are rendered by Employee to said clients. During Employee’s employment with XXX, Employee shall not render any services or engage in any activity which is competitive with or adverse to XXX’s business, either alone, as a partner, officer, director, employee, shareholder or otherwise on behalf of any other business.""  Does this mean I'm not allowed to do freelance work at all? I run a few networking groups for the online community that are fairly popular, and while I don't make money on them now, I could in the future. And as well, I often have people within the network who offer to pay me to consult them about their online brands, social media, etc. And on top of that, I have my own social media channels that I don't currently make money on, but might in the future. Firstly, is that not allowed? And secondly, do I have to disclose all of it to the company? and Finally, does this mean they could stake a claim to my personal properties online that I'm working on outside of work - like the networking groups I do social media for, my personal accounts that are creative/marketing based?   The second section: During Employee’s employment with XXX and for a period of one (1) year after Employee’s employment with XXX is terminated for any reason by either party, Employee will not, unless acting in his capacity as an employee of XXX in the performance of services under this Agreement, either directly or indirectly, on Employee’s behalf or on behalf of any other advertising, marketing, direct marketing, digital marketing or public relations agency, or in conjunction with any other person, firm or corporation, interfere with the business relationships between XXX and its employees, XXX and XXX Clients and/or XXX Clients and their employees by:  accepting employment with or doing free-lance work for another advertising agency, in-house advertising agency, media buying service, public relations agency, digital marketing agency or direct marketing agency in Tennessee, or influencing other XXX employees or XXX Client’s employees to do so.""  Further down it says:   ""Thus, it is agreed that, in the event of any breach of Subparagraph A or Subparagraph B of Paragraph 5 above, in addition to any other legal or equitable relief to which XXX may be entitled, Employee shall pay to XXX as liquidated damages for the breach thereof an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the gross income (including commissions, fees and retainers) received from any such XXX Client by Employee or by any other agency with whom Employee may hereafter, either directly or indirectly, be associated, for a period beginning with the breach of these provisions and extending three (3) years from the date of the breach of these provisions or from the date of termination of Employee's employment by CTA, whichever is the later.""  Does this mean that if I decide to leave my job or get fired for any reason, I'm not allowed to work in my field of expertise where I live for a year?! And if I do they'll try to take 50% of my compensation for 3 years?   My friends think I'm being overdramatic about this, but I really want to make sure I understand what this is saying before I sign it because I don't want to be in a situation later that could have been avoided. Any clarification or advice you guys can give is really appreciated!"	Yes
130	I accepted a small gift from a vendor that provides resources to the public company I work for with the gift being worth about $5. This was an informal chance meeting where the vendor was throwing a mixer and I recognized them, we talked for a bit and they then gave me that gift which I took without even thinking about it. Apparently someone reported this to my company because HR is now calling me in for multiple sessions of intense questioning. I have no authority at my job, I'm just a lower level cog with nobody under me and no purchasing power.   Am I looking at jail-time or a felony? That's what they hinted at in the meetings.	Yes
131	Like everybody and their brother in this town, I too, am an aspiring screenwriter on the side.  I am about to start a tech job at one of the major studios, and in my offer letter it has the boilerplate stating that as of the day of my employment I assign any and all IP to them.  I don't really have any choice about signing this if I want to work there.  This job is not creative, but I could be exposed to creative projects at various stages of development.  I have developed to a reasonable degree one TV project (pilot written, season 1 outlined) and on film script (fully outlined with 20 pages of dialogue).  I've never really done much with either project other than have my friends read them.  I have no representation, nor am I a member of any trade union.  Obviously I'd love to have the film studio pick up either of these projects, but I don't want to have gifted these work (nor anything else that I create) to the film studio just because they've hired me as a code monkey.  What are my rights here?    I know in CA that as far as tech is concerned as long as you don't develop the IP with the company's time or resources and it is not substantially related to their business you can own it.  Does the same thing apply to creative works?  Can I continue to create works on the side?  Obviously, I can't steal ideas from anything I get exposed to at the studio.  What precautions should I take to avoid any appearance that I've done so?  You can find a lot on Google advising independent creatives about sharing stuff with studios, but I don't see anything pertaining to individuals with an employment contract.  Thanks for reading.	Yes
132	Hi,  My wife's employer pays for her health insurance. About a month ago, she had a routine doctors appointment. The doctor refused to see her since the insurance was terminated, unless she paid out of pocket. This also delayed her month prescription of medicine. Now she has a sudden sever pain in her neck, and she called her insurance to see what urgent care she should go to. They informed her that her policy was terminated again. This is very frustrating. Is this a legal or employment board issue? Someone told her to just go to the urgent care and send the bill to her boss. I think that is a bad idea.   Her employer has never announced to the overall company that there has been nonpayment of the insurance premiums. For all we know, they have failed to make payments on time other months as well. My big concern is what if she was in a serious accident or had a sudden illness. We could be liable for all the charges and he full bill if that were to happen.   Any advice?	Yes
133	"Hey, I am currently employed in a 8:45 -4:30 job at a summer camp as a ""seasonal employee, or so I've been told, I'm paid $6.25 for this, which is well below the New York minimum wage, however I've also been told that due to my seasonal status this does not apply.  Is this true and does it apply to my current job?    Thanks."	Yes
134	"I'm working this summer for a well-known Melville-themed caffeine vendor. Call them ""Ishmael.""  Now, one of the things that was drummed into me on my first day, is that everyone gets a paid ten minute break for every four hours, and an unpaid half hour for every eight hours(or six hours, I get different answers depending on which supervisor I ask.)  On most days they're pretty good about giving me my breaks, except when they don't. I'm not saying that they ""intentionally"" skip breaks, but they have a way of slipping their minds. ""After this task, and the next one, we'll let you take your ten minute break. Almost done? Whoops, we've got a long line, get back on that register! Now what was I talking about just then?""    Naturally, they only ever forget about paid breaks. No one ever forgets about the ones when I'm not paid.   Then there's a ridiculous rule that each employee is expected to bring in their own markers for marking cups, and I've been told off several times for not remembering to bring one(at four fucking AM? They're lucky I remembered to wear pants.)  So, the questions:  1. Are breaktimes set by law? Or is that an internal policy of St-- I mean, Ishmael's Coffee? Can I get anyone in trouble for not giving me breaks?  2. What are the laws for breaks in NYS, anyway?  3. Can I really get fired for this stupid marker shit?"	Yes
135	Hi all. I work part time at a shitty job that I really don't enjoy. I keep track of my hours and I have gotten paid for all of them except for two.  I worked for four days on the week of June 26th and last Friday on July 7th.  I'm supposed to get paid weekly. So let's say I work the week of June 26th; I get paid for that week the that Friday, June 30th.  So I go in June 30th for my pay for the week of June 26th, and my boss says he is busy and because I did not call to let him know I would be picking up my paycheck, he will pay me next time I come in. Okay, fair.  I come in July 2nd and my boss tells me he may as well consolidate the check for the week of July 26th and my pay for whatever other days I work on the week of July 3rd.  So I come in Friday the 7th of July to work, and while I am working my boss tells me checks didn't come in this week, they should be in by Wednesday, July 12th.  Isn't this in violation of the FLSA? He hasn't paid me for the close of a pay period (Week of June 26th and the Friday of June 7th, which he told me he would consolidate).  What should I do? Can/should I take legal action before tomorrow? If tomorrow rolls around and he doesn't pay me, what do I do?  I do not know any personal information about my boss. No contact info, anything. I know his first and last name. The only way to reach him is at my place of work, if he's there, and if he feels like coming to the phone because 50% of the time he's busy. I also overheard him talking to a coworker where the coworker told him he recalled once when he hadn't paid him for months- because my boss needed his social security. Is what my boss is doing illegal? He's not paying us adequately, and he is hiring people without their social security. He also handles tons of raw food without gloves and forces us to do the same. Asking to use gloves while handling results in a simple answer from him: a firm 'no'. Can someone help? I feel like this place is very shady.	Yes
136	Coming from VA, not working for a union. Recently found out a male coworker is making more than 2 female coworkers who have more experience and certifications.  Is it illegal for them to approach this subject with HR with the information that they have about the other co-workers pay?	Yes
137	*If this should have been posted elsewhere please let me know of the other subreddit*  Hi reddit! I work in a currently non-unionized organisation, and there have been talk of changing the situation. We have many different work team, and most employees are ok with the idea. However, my working team (the smallest) has not yet been approached by the union representative. I have an appointment with the representative tomorrow, to learn more and to eventually discuss the matter with my fellow employees.  Having never been unionized, I don't quite know what to expect. Am I placing myself in a dangerous position by meeting the representative? What are the questions I should ask, the information I should require from him? How can I verify if the promises he makes can become reality? As far as I know he can promise all the things he wants, as long as the negotiation process hasnt begun nothing can be taken too seriously right?  Reddit, help me out!  *I am located in Canada (Quebec), if that helps*	Yes
138	"Hi everyone, I apologize in advance if this question is inappropriate for this forum. I recently accepted a position as an R&amp;D scientist at a pharmaceutical company located in the Bay Area, CA. I accepted the position, but contingent upon my hire is passing a controlled substances drug screen before my start date, which is obviously fine and dandy.   My question is in regards to what happens afterwords. Based off of what I've read from CalChamber, ""You may not require employees to submit to random drug testing, except under certain narrowly defined circumstances."" I was wondering whether the duties of an R&amp;D scientist fall under this category? Specifically, what are these narrowly defined circumstances? The language I've seen online seems pretty vague and, as a scientist I'm a little more used to definitive language. Can anyone clarify this for me?"	Yes

141	Hey guys, I'm a musician that knows only the side of law that covers things like copyright and trademark and sampling (audio).   I'm trying to make the release of my next couple of singles as professional as possible, with all bases covered on grounds of copyright and terms of ownership. I've got a song finished and I drafted up artwork for the song using a picture of a friend of mine.  I'd like to write up a Work For Hire contract concerning the picture I'm using and the model in the picture. I basically just want the contract to cover ownership of the song, the model's permission to use her likeness with the song and promotional material of the song, as well as being distributed online with her picture attached to the song.    I don't want the contract to include any sort of royalties to the model as 1. We aren't trying to pull in large sums of revenue from this release and 2. She did not have any creative involvement with the creation of the song.  Do you guys have any pointers and/or clauses that I should include in the contract? Or any advice as to the best possible way to go about writing the contract for the model?  Thank you in advance	Yes
142	Hey Reddit,  So a friend of mine works as a cook in some big sort of conference center thingy.  Before getting into the issue at hand I want to preface that we are from California and there are established laws in our state regarding mandatory meal breaks.  Ok so onto what is going on.  My friend has told me that on several occasions, employees have been required to attend meetings during their lunch period.  They cannot bring food into this meeting and they are not given any other time during the day to eat.  I know in California, it is required that you receive a 30 minute meal break after 5 hours of work unless a shift is only 6 hours.  From what I understand, the company sometimes works around this by making employees clock out early yet not actually take a break, so that on paper they appear to be getting their break and then having them take the break much later in the day.  The final issue I was curious about, is that apparently, said company is counting restroom breaks as the employee's 10s and 15s.  And im not talking about a lengthy bathroom break.  From what I am being told, if nature calls and you arent on break, you use your break.  So if you need to pee and it takes 3 minutes, say goodbye to your 10 minute break.  Any help or comments on the legality of these practices is appreciated.  From what I understand, her division doesnt really have any HR to go to, just an office manager with no real power over how things go.  Anyway, thanks Reddit!	Yes
143	"I'm an assistant nurse mgr. on a hospital unit. One of our per diems asked if she could give me as a reference, as she was applying for another job, so I said OK. The call came yesterday, and my manager happened to be standing next to me. The prospective employer asked me what my title is, and I told him; if ""X"" worked there, and I said yes; and in what capacity - she's a per diem staff RN, I said. Then he asked if I had any specific comments about her, and I told him she's an excellent nurse and an exemplary employee. That's it. Nothing about salary, disciplinary actions, etc. My manager asked me what the deal was, and when I told her, she said in the future I should refer any similar callers to HR, because we're not allowed to give out any information about employment status, and it could be grounds for termination (not that she was threatening me - she was just letting me know). Is this really true as far as employment law is concerned? The information listed above is literally all I told the guy. I realize the hospital itself could probably have some weird policy, and we're not a union shop, if that matters. Just very curious."	Yes
144	I am posting this for a friend who does not use reddit in the hopes that someone here can possibly give some guidance since he asked me but it is not in my field.   He is an assistant to the founder of a national restaurant chain and handles a lot of the farming technology management as well as some other specific design projects for the owner himself. He and some of the other employees that do not have very defined roles and work closely with the owner were just asked to sign paperwork basically to cover the company saying they would not talk about specific ways the company does things, their emails and messages were company property, etc. At the end it gives an option to add any amendments and my friend would like to put something in saying that if he comes up with any new inventions or designs that the company profits off of that he get a share or have some sort of claim.  1. Is the reasonable? 2. If so, what should this language look like? 3. Are there any questions I should be asking?  Thank you in advance and please let me know what other information would be helpful and I will ask him.	Yes

146	I requested to use my PTO and sick days instead of short term disability or FMLA after I give birth in a month because I will need to take FMLA later in the year when I will have no family help and therefore need to be at home.  My employer says they have never had this type of request before (taking PTO instead of FMLA) and that they will dock my vacation days since I do not want to take FMLA at this time.  Is this OK to do? I know they can't legally dock my sick time as per NY law you are required to provide 40 hours of sick time but is it OK for them to dock the vacation time they provided me as well?  Seems weird.  My husband is taking parental leave from his company and he gets to take his full PTO (his is accrued). My PTO is not accrued, I get it the first day of the year.	Yes
147	"TL;DR: The place I work is gross, and the manager does nothing to prevent it. What do I do?  I work at a local pizza restaurant, and the manager is just awful. I could go on about it, but here's the main concern: I'm pretty sure I got a fungal infection from working with dishes. The area rarely gets cleaned properly (I'm one of the maybe 2 people that uses cleaning products thoroughly), and the proper sanitary supplies are not readily available. Not even gloves. I've been cut working a handful of times, and not even washing/sanitizing has prevented the infection. People clean the dishes they need and sometimes more before the regular dish shift (6 pm to close), and the only sanitary option in the area is hand sanitizer. I'm not sure how effective this is honestly, but I personally spray my hands off, dry them with a paper towel, apply a generous amount of hand sanitizer and rub it in, then wipe off the excess before handling clean dishes. Other people typically use the sprayer and handle dishes doing little more than using paper towels after, and then proceed to wash their hands and continue food prep. This is alarming, because I can only imagine how much bacteria and fungus have spread throughout the restaurant due to the manager's utter disregard for any proper procedures. I will either be going to the clinic today or tomorrow for a check-up for the infection, but I'm wondering who I should contact to fix this. It's gotten to the point that I almost want a doctor's note to limit me from any food or dish contact and stick to driving, but that wouldn't be fair to others. They're unaware of the issue due to inexperience or ignorance. I've had issues with fungus from unsanitary working conditions in a ""high class"" popular Italian chain restaurant before. Any information is greatly appreciated, if you need any other info, let me know."	Yes

149	Hi, I'm 17m working at a fast food chain in CT. My boss is taking hours from myself and the other workers. He's done this before, I had my hours written down and he told me that I changed them to give me more hours. Last time he did this, he shorted me by about 14 hours. Well now I have my printed receipts for the hours that I worked. He told one of my co workers that the hours I stayed late with her, because it was busy, I won't get paid for.(to clarify this is maybe an hour once or twice a week) I get paid on Tuesday.  My questions are, if my hours don't match up, what should I do to get them back? Can I sue him over this? What about my co workers, they don't have any evidence that they worked more than he has said, can they get any hours back?	Yes
150	My mother has been sexually harassed at her workplace for about a year or more. She works at a big name energy company that priorities safety for their employees in the workplace as their number one commitment (I know, I've worked with this company as a summer student many years). My mother and father live in this small company town (about 650 population) and they both work for this company at different places/roles. I live a province away and I've heard most of this through my father and sister (who still lives home).   My parents marriage has been suffering so much over the past year and it was seriously stressing out my sister and I as well. My father, sister and I could tell that my mother wasn't the same as she once was, always hiding away from us/people, getting mad with us for no particular reason, blaming my father for things that isn't his fault and just all around being distant and not being a part of the family. I don't even know how to explain this.   Now this may have been going on for more than a year but my mother only told us about her struggles within the last month. I don't know all the details. I know he has touched her body sometimes, talked about her body, and tried to convince her to have an affair. For a year, or more. She had to put up with this kind of guy. I know this guy who harassed her almost ruined her marriage (or still may) as well as part of her life. And perhaps the rest of her life will be altered by this too. My mother is very old school and didn't even want to tell us or let HR of this company know about what has been going on. She doesn't want to ruin the life of the guy who has been harassing her and his family (it's a small town everyone knows everyone) and she doesn't want people to know this has been happening in case they judge her, even if she gets moved to a different work area to get away from him. She thinks that people won't like her or be different around her because she told on him. She's insecure. My mother is on antidepressants to deal with this. She pushed her family members away to deal with this. She's done crazy things she never would have thought about doing before- driving 12 hours away from the town to get away, contemplate suicide, etc.   Today, he got called into HR to discuss what has been happening and he has denied ALL of it. HR said they need proof. We understand that. The problem is: there is no proof. No texts. No interaction over social media. No cameras. No co workers have seen (and my mother is convinced if they did, they wouldn't say anything). My mother said she knew this would happen because the guy told her that if she told ever told anyone, he would deny all of it. My mother wrote out specific scenarios that occurred with this guy who harassed her. The HR manager believes my mother but can not do anything without proof. My mother has written 15 pages of what this guy has said and done to her. These 15 pages made my father cry.   What can be done to bring justice?	Yes
151	The government advises that a fit note must be provided if an employee is off sick for more than 7 days in a row (https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave ). Obviously the employee in the coma is unable to provide this, and I haven't been contacted by any doctors/family etc.   Am I ok to not pay any SSP to the employee unless I receive a fit note?	Yes
152	I work in an office with one other co-worker. He is male and we have the same position but I am the senior of the two.  I requested a transfer to work in another state to live with my fiance. I worked on detail in the other state who is aware of my interest in transferring and would like to have me. Unfortunately, they can't hire right now.   After this request my supervisor, who is not the authority to determine if the transfer is approved, began treating me much worse. I get that being a jerk is not illegal but I have documented several incidences where my male co-worker was clearly favored.   I then was up for a promotion, which was at the discretion of my supervisor, and which I didn’t get. She said she decided I needed to obtain a job certification first which she hadn’t told me prior. Additionally, part of my supervisor’s job is to help support me in getting certified.   I made an informal complaint to her supervisor about what was going on and the treatment I’d been getting compared to my male peer. He thought she was being fair.   Since this complaint my supervisor has been even worse. Lack of communication, discussing my work with my co-worker and not me, and preventing me from working towards my certification. Other senior staff are aware of this and no one is trying to help me. She has a history of bullying her staff.   So I need the certification to get the promotion, as well as for my job, and I’ve been told to stop working towards requirements for the certification. I think this is considered retaliation and there is a financial loss from this.   Side note: She is still supporting my co-worker in progress towards his certification.  Also, I was told that my informal complaint didn’t impact any decision on approving a transfer. It’s basically political.  There’s a lot of other examples I have documented of unfair treatment but I don’t want to make this post too long.   Ultimately, I have great job security. I like my job and I don’t want to let one supervisor stop me from pursuing what I need to do to advance my career. I also don’t want to jeopardize my chances of working with the other state or anyone to think this is just complaining because I want t to transfer.  Any advice on what to do here? Pursue discrimination case or retaliation case? I was thinking about filing an informal grievance and going from there.   Thanks in advance!	Yes
153	About 6 months ago, my boss got allowed the request of one of my coworkers to get a cat for the office. I protested and said my wife may be allergic but he/she said that they had always wanted a cat and it was going to happen. It did.   Come to find out, my wife is severely allergic and can tell if the cat has been near me at work. Coincidentally enough, for the first time in my life, I have had allergies that have really hurt my health as I have preexisting conditions that affect what medicine I can take. I am considering getting a allergy test and if the results are positive for cats, then show it to the boss with a request we no have a cat.  What can I do? Should I just say I will only work from home.	Yes
154	I was recently passed over for a job at state agency. The choice was between myself, who I believe to be well-qualified for the position, and another individual, who did not meet the minimum qualifications to apply for the job, but is a friend of the person in charge of hiring for the position.   Of course, I will not take any formal action, as I have a professional reputation to protect. But I do have a long-standing professional/personal relationship with the person who was in charge of hiring, so I am considering asking for a private meeting to discuss how I feel that the hiring practice was unethical and seems to be based on personal relationships and not professional qualifications.   My question is, despite being unethical, is there anything illegal about this situation? How was this competitor even able to make it past the screening process without the minimum education and certifications? Surely there should be safeguards in place at the state HR office to prevent individuals in positions of power from hiring friends versus hiring for merit?	Yes
155	I work at an all nude strip club as a bartender. Basically a juice bartender since there's no alcohol.  Can anything be done about dancers that tell customers not to tip me?

157	"Quick summary because this has a long explanation: I was not paid for 20+ hours of work for a restaurant, under the guise of it being a ""working interview.""  I live in VA.  Is this legal?  It's been one year since the interview happened, is it too late to do anything about it?   BACKGROUND:  Last year, I had interest in applying to a local (and highly praised) burger shop, just working in the kitchen making burgers, cleaning tables, etc.  The people that own this shop also own an extremely popular fancy restaurant.  I'm serious.  Everything that comes out of that kitchen looks like food porn.  All the people that eat there take pictures of their food when it comes out. And it's crazy expensive, all produce they use is local and they change their menu all the time based on what is available during the season or whatever.  So anyways, I am told that I have to complete 2 ""working"" interviews for these sister restaurants.  One at the burger place, one at the fancy place.  Each one had different tasks, for example the burger place did things I described earlier whereas fancy restaurant involved bussing tables, sorting silverware, etc.  Also, as you can probably tell, the fancy restaurant was a much more stressful environment and all the people that work there are pretty much professional chefs or adults.  There were a few other teens, (I was 16 at this time), but being surrounded by all these people was definitely intimidating.  More so than the laid back but still busy burger shop.  Right.  So I finish my working interview at burger shop.  I worked open to close, roughly 10 hours.  I completed the exact amount of work as the other people working that day, and was probably working 10x harder than them, considering the whole point was to demonstrate how well I worked, so I wanted to do a good job.  End of the day, I don't get paid except for splitting tips, which probably amounted to around $7.  The manager of burger shop tells me I will most likely be hired but it is ultimately up to people who own both places to decide.  I then work another ~10 hour shift at the fancy restaurant.  Now, people working here (well at the position I was applying for) are bussing tables and thus get paid below minimum wage but split tips to compensate, and with each table having bills averaging over $300, this adds up relatively well.  I did not get paid this day either, but they added me on to a list of other people bussing that night, so I assumed I would get the same tips they did? Never got those either.  Figured maybe after I was officially hired I would get them.  The end of the day, the chefs at the restaurant give me a mini interview, said I worked well, and they would give me a call.  They also said that they are known to be lazy and not call people and they ""like to see persistance"" i.e. me calling them and pestering them to give me the job if they don't call me within a week. Eye roll.  I'd like to add that this was not a competitive interview, I performed extremely well and wasn't competing against anyone else for the position.  These people literally just could not be bothered to call me.  They wanted to see me reach out. Also, I was applying to burger shop, but they had me work at both places because (very rarely) they will have people that typically work at one place work the other for a shift depending on scheduling and such.  So the fact that I worked 20+ hours with no pay is extremely annoying to me and I almost feel like that place just uses it to get free labor out of people which is off-putting considering how successful the business is and it almost seems like a bullying situation(for lack of better way to describe it.).  I ended up trying to contact the owners of the restaurant like told to (said to text her) and I didn't even get any reply, which I thought was rude.  If I didn't get the job, at least tell me.  At that point I stopped bothering to reach out just due to how disgusted I was by the people that ran the business.  I looked up if working interviews are legal in VA and from what I can tell you're required to be paid.  I would've pressed the matter if I had known this, but I was so excited at the prospects of a new job for this successful place that I sort of overlooked it.  Now, one year has gone by and I am actually kind of salty and realize how ""abusive"" they were. I feel taken advantage of. The problem is, it's one year later.  Am i too late to try and get any payment out of this? I feel stupid for not doing anything about it sooner but was wondering if I can now."	Yes
158	I have no idea where to begin looking for a labor attorney in San Diego, CA.   Do I look online in Yelp? How do I go about finding one?  The situation involves a company, specifically her direct supervisor, acting very unprofessional towards my girlfriend. On top of that they penalized her for the government arranging to go to a mandatory meeting for her green card.   She wanted to go to HR but other supervisors have stated it will compromise her career and discouraged it. In that case I think it's necessary for her to see an attorney before she goes to HR, or sees what the labor attorney has to say having heard the full details.	Yes

160	"Hi, I am A server at a locally owned Chinese restaurant. Pretty regularly the owners will ""punish"" us for not doing a good enough job by taking money off our paychecks. Our base pay is only 25 dollars for a full 12 hour shift (with no breaks). I generally end up making around 16 an hour here after tips, but these deductions are making me worried.

161	It is a very restrictive non-compete and the company won't contract with any voice actor who won't sign it. But as a contractor, I thought a Company couldn't compel/enforceable a non-compete like that.

Can the enforce something like this for a contractor? They are not paying to license the voice, or hiring a spokesperson.	Yes
162	"Throwaway acc.   I currently work for a company making a low wage for the area that I'm living in. A (shockingly high) 40% of my income is put towards my rent. The other 60% is split between food, utilities, gas, student loan payments and the remainder going towards personal interests and very little going towards savings.  Anyways, I was given a ""promotion"" 7 months ago (only in responsibility, not in title or salary) and part of the position required that I receive professional training that totaled $1900. I was asked by a manager that I take the class (over the phone, then the classes sent to me via email). My company has a 1 and 2 year payback plan. Over $2500 is a 2 year payback and under is a 1 year payback. So if I leave within the next 5 months, I'm being told I'm required to pay back the full $1900.  Can they legally require me to pay back the training cost when it was asked that I take the course so I was able to fulfill the duties of the ""promotion"" I was given? Unfortunately, this would be a prohibiting factor of me leaving this company unless I were to receive a signing bonus elsewhere. I do not have even half of the money to pay back.   I live in VA and the company was incorporated in PA and all of our legal documents say they are governed under the law of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania."	Yes

There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc).   My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.    We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we don’t know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage.   Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.	Yes
165	I'm applying to take intermittent FMLA to care for a family member with Parkinson's, who needs mainly to have me keep an eye on him to make sure he's eating and in case he falls and hurts himself. I requested to work from home but my employer refused and said FMLA was suitable for my needs. It's much less useful to me than WFH would be because I'll have to miss work and because, since I don't know when or if he'll need help back onto his feet or in case he hurts himself, I'll probably end up taking a few days off every week 'just in case' and play the odds.  We bid for shifts periodically based on performance, and if I miss much work I'm not going to be as able to compete for my current, desired shift. I'm worried I'll get pushed into a shift that's not what I want and that, for days I'm in the office, will actually make me even less able to care for him on those days. Can they do that? What would be my recourse if they did?	Yes
166	Essentially to make a long story short I work for my states welfare office Indiana, I came across some pay stubs that looked fake so I reviewed them and found an identical template by searching for fake pay stub templates. I informed my supervisor and was told to process them normally whether they are fake or not is not my problem because everyone lies to us. So I accepted the documents and processed them and notated my findings and my supervisors response. Essentially I knowingly accepted fraudulent documents due to my supervisors instructions. Can my employer fire me for this? Am I in anyway liable if they are determined to be forged documents since I accepted them during the eligibility determination process ?	Yes
167	"I worked at a restaurant as a dish washer for about 5 1/2 hours as a ""trial"" period. I decided not to continue with them after that time. I gave them my information, it's been a week and haven't received any sort of compensation for my work.  What do I do if I do not get paid? There's no proof that I actually worked that night, I didn't sign in or anything like that. I just showed up and got to work, then left."	Yes
168	Horribly sad, very young, sweet girl.  What do we do with her final paycheck?  We don't know any of her family, only her BF who she killed herself in front of, and we will definitely not be giving it to him.	Yes
169	Signed up for a 1099 sales job last year.  Commission was great and was doing very well.  The company then halved the commission awarded and several people quit.  They then switch to minimum wage + commission type, and had us sign a non-compete work contract.  Since then, they have added minimum sales quotas, set hours, and even further reduced our commission.  Am I bound by this new non-compete clause?	Yes
170	First off, yes I was fucking dumb for agreeing to take the job at below minimum. Current minimum wage is 11.40/h in ON. My current rate is 11/h.   I'm really hesitant to speak to my boss (Also the owner of the business) about this, because he's kind of a dick. Type of guy who'd slash my hours for bringing it up.   I have signed a contract with him and plan on asking for a copy for my records tomorrow.   My ask is: How should I proceed? I really need to keep on with this job. I don't have anything else lined up right now.	Yes
171	I work as a supervisor in a fast food restaurant that is locally owned in eastern Washington. Most of my shifts are closing shifts (75% or so), and where I work, closing shifts are on the clock until a certain time at night, whether all the work is completed or not. Not finishing the work in time (this happens often if we're busy towards the end of the night) does not remove the expectation for the work to get done properly, despite the fact that my fellow closer and I are no longer getting paid. Sometimes this means an extra 5-10 minutes of work, but in our busy season, it very often means 20-30 minutes or more of unpaid work. I'm quite sick of working for free and then getting chewed out if the tiniest thing isn't completed, because I've gotten to the point where once I'm not being paid I stop caring.  Under the FLSA, I've recently learned that I can request up to three years of backpay for unpaid work, but I'm not certain at all how I would go about proving that I've been worked off-the-clock, especially as heavily as I have been (between July 3rd and July 10th, 2017, I easily did at least three hours of unpaid work). My restaurant does have a CCTV security system that my boss taught me how to use and get footage from one time when we were robbed on a shift I was leading, but due to a shortage of hard drive space, all footage older than three days or so is overwritten. Can I get some footage over time of myself and my coworker(s) doing this extra work and use it as legal proof? There's no official tracking of how much work any of us employees have done for free, so if I can't use the security footage, what can I do?	Yes
172	As a naive recent college graduate, I came upon an opportunity to work on a side project for a small business owner. We agreed that it would be a side project and I had to get permission from my full-time boss before I could take the project on (proactively avoid any conflict of interests situation).          My boss said he thought it wasn't the best idea because he didn't want my focus being pulled away from any client I would be working for at my full time job, but ultimately was okay with me doing the side project (with the caveat of no phone calls for side project while at a client site, and my full time job always comes first). I communicated this situation to the small business owner and he was okay with the situation.         Long story short, I completely underestimated the project (right out of college, estimation abilities weren't based on reality) and had to enlist the help of 3 other acquaintances to help. We all were working on the project on and off for over a year and there was still some minor development work to be completed plus user testing/bug fixes at the time of him deciding to call off the project.         Over the course of the year he paid me two payments of equal amount and he paid me as a 1099 employee (the second payment only for the sake of being able to include it in his 2016 taxes). From the first payment I used almost all of it to pay 3 work friends for their help. Almost half of the second payment ended up going towards paying my own taxes from the 1099 income.         At the end of 2016/beginning of  2017 his business took a huge hit after losing a major client, and he had to downsize to the point where he might be quitting altogether/finding some other opportunity. In the stress of his business falling apart all of the sudden, he burned a lot of bridges and took a lot of his stresses out on others. During this time he told me that we were going to have to scrap the project because he no longer really had a use for it.         Now, about a month later, he calls me and basically says that he doesn't have a finished product to show for his money and he wants it all back, even if we have to come up with a monthly payment plan. I brought up my time and energy spent on the project and he basically told me that my time doesn't matter, I was supposed to give him this product and I didn't so I owe him everything back. I even told him how half what he paid me had gone to outside help for his project, a large portion to taxes, and I only had a small portion left to show for my own efforts and time; to which he basically replied that that was on me and that my time and efforts are worthless and that if I didn't pay him back he would have no choice but to get his lawyer(s) involved.   So, r/legaladvice, am I pretty much screwed in this situation, or would I even stand any kind of chance in court? He decided to give up on the project and he paid me as a 1099 employee, does that matter in this kind of scenario? I know he is trying to recoup from losses in his business, but just because my efforts are less tangible in his mind (lines of code), it shouldn't discredit my hundreds of hours of effort.  Any help or advice would be appreciated!	Yes
173	"My husbands previous employer is wanting him to pay to have the office rekeyed because he did not have them sign off that the key was returned. My husband left all of his keys on his desk on his last day. It was only him and the owner there that day, and the front office person who is now contacting him after 7 months was not.  For a little more explanation, my husband used to work for a small office, he had to leave due to our daughters health issues and constant hospital trips...his former boss lost his mind when he told him his plan to leave. He resorted to calling him names, and berating him for hours at a time in his last two weeks about how he is ""not a man"" and it's the ""wife's job to stay at home"" among other even worse things. My husband didn't want to cause a scene or stoop to his level so he pretty much just put up with it until it was his last day. His boss kept saying that ""he would be back"" and when my husband actually tried to hand him the keys he refused. So instead, he left them on his cleaned out desk."	Yes
174	I currently work in a call center that gives two ten minute breaks and one lunch.  If we need to use the restroom we have to sign into a program that times and tracks our bathroom use and then it they subtract it from our breaks.  I've overheard them discussing other co-workers four  minute bathroom break and how they will monitor to make sure he only spends six minutes off the phones.	Yes
175	"Hello /r/legaladvice,  I work for a privately owned retail chain you may of heard of in the news recently, and we've come under new store management at our outlet here in San Diego county. While I accepted this manager with an open mind and hope, she's done nothing but demoralize my fellow co-workers. She seems to be incapable of separating numbers on a spreadsheet from human beings, but I digress. To keep this succinct, let me jump into actions she's taken and the California labor codes I believe she's broken.  I'm aware of multiple employees she's disciplined for ""excessive absences"". She gave a write-up to one of our pregnant employees who was absent for 3 consecutive days for scabies (a highly contagious and uncomfortable skin disease caused by an infestation of insects **burrowing** into your skin), despite proper documentation from a doctor. She gave a write-up to an employee for missing work due to a family emergency. She gave a write-up to an employee for absences that were clerical errors (she had switched shifts with another employee and had it manager sanctioned, but they marked her absent *by mistake*). The list goes on, and she's expressed plans to reprimand more. Although I myself have not had anything done unjust to myself, likely because I'm leaving soon, I can no longer stand by and let this happen.  I've done my research, and I believe this violates California Labor Code § [233](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=233) &amp; [234](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=234) (tl;dr: an employer can't discipline an employee for sick time off if they don't exceed what they've been allocated by the company, and none of my aforementioned instances have done that). Since this happened to so many and will likely happen to more, it would be difficult to spread this knowledge to everyone verbally. So my plan is to arm my co-workers *en masse*. I intend to print these labor codes and covertly post them in the break-room with the title: ""Have you been punished for absences lately? This may interest you:"". I'm quite sure it'll be taken down very quickly, but I trust the rumor mill and a few backup copies should cover this.  So my question is; am I understanding these labor laws correctly, and what do you think? I am also open to suggestions of all sorts, as well as opinions on how I'm going about this.  It should also be mentioned, I'm sure they'll suspect me. My co-workers (and managers) have grown accustom to my taste in mischief/shenanigans, and often turn to me first when something of the sort has happened. They are almost always correct in doing so. Although I don't intend to admit to doing this, my employer is an ""at will"" company."	Yes
176	"Hi legaladvice, I'm going to attempt to describe my issue in the best detail possible.   In March of this year, I was verbally assaulted by a co-worker that I used to be friendly with. He did not agree with a life decision I made (I did not know this information until months later) and developed a very deep hatred for me. Behind my back, he would stalk my workload and attempt to find errors and immediately report it to management/After two weeks of condescending remarks about my work, I confronted him as to why he was acting this way, to which he called me a ""fuck up"", ""ruining the company"", ""make mistakes every day"", ""I tell everyone that you fuck up"". I remained quiet and refused to engage in any sort of retaliation. After this incident, management had separate meeting with myself and the harasser, to which they claimed it was resolved. After this meeting, my supervisor stopped speaking to me and only initiated contact unless absolutely necessary. I was effectively ostracized.   Instead of attacking me to my face, the harasser then decided to make it a point to talk badly about me to all of my workers on a daily basis. He continued to stalk my work and made it his mission to get me fired. The workplace became incredibly hostile, and any projects in my department that I needed assistance on, he refused to help with outright. This was affecting business and made my workload greater. I once again reported the harassment and hostility to management, (who claimed we ""Have no HR"") and they once again had a meeting with both, separately, to fix the issue.   Once again, the harasser found ways to continue his assault. There was a racial joke made at my expense by another employee who motioned to the harasser in a knowing way, and he laughed uncontrollably. I reported the further harassment for the third time, to which there were no repercussions.   The final time I reported an issue was when the harasser resorted to laughing at me every time I walked past his area to make me feel uncomfortable no matter where I was. He would do it even louder each time he walked past me as well. At this point, the company magically had an HR department in which they directed me to email. I sent my story and current issue and received no response. This morning I received a email from the Operations Manager that I was being laterally transferred (no change in pay) to a department that had far less responsibility, is considered to be beneath my current department, and simultaneously removed me for the lead position on an upcoming project. I essentially lost many of my decision-making abilities and was placed in a position where management is fully aware I do not want to be. The harasser remains in his position in my department based on his ""seniority"".   I believe I am facing retaliation for reporting harassment, and want to know what my legal options are at this moment. From what I understand, Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from doing lateral transfers in retaliation, especially to unwanted positions that revoke responsibility (seen as a demotion without legally calling it one)."	Yes
177	"I am going to give all the details and I need as much insight or advice as one can provide, because I felt like I was done wrong, but I'm not really sure what to do.  It's Friday and I am a Guest Services Manager/Training Coordinator for a car dealership in Atlanta, GA.  My General Sales Manager(GSM) called me 3 times in the morning, once at 8:58 AM, 9:00 AM, and 9:32 AM. I called him back at 10:03 AM apologizing for missing his calls. He said it was fine, but my co-worker/team member needed to remove her 'du-rag' as he called it, and said it wasn't professional for her to have it on. I told him I apologize if she looks unprofessional and I would address it when I got in at 12.  In the meantime, on my way to work, I reached out to another co-worker to express my discomfort with his request. I am a latina/caucasian woman and my co-worker is a black woman. I am very aware of the hair culture and especially to her, how important he hair is to her. I knew it was a delicate situation and I didn't agree with him asking her to remove it because I assumed it was simply a head wrap and/or scarf. I knew it wasn't against dress code and she's never been anything but professional. She told me to just express my discomfort to him and it shouldn't be a problem.  A side note: She wore a multi-printed scarf just the day before and no one said anything, including my GSM, and so I assumed she was wearing the same one or just a different color and so I figured it would be no problem to talk to him once I arrived.  He called me once more at 11:13 asking if I was at work yet and told me she was still wearing it. He asked me why I didn't have the discussion with her yet? I told him I wanted to wait to arrive to work.  When I got to work we went straight into a staff meeting at which when I walked in he asked me in front of everyone ""Did you have that discussion yet?"" and pointed to her. I just nodded and immediately started texting my female co-worker I called earlier to ask for advice.   I said: ""Pussy ass R** has been hounding me all morning about telling **** to remove her ""du-rag"" as he calls it. You can clearly see it's a scarf  and I don't see the big deal. It's not that fucking serious.""  Well, I accidentally sent it to him. Shortly after he pulled me out of the staff meeting to address it. He showed me the text and asked what was going on? He was pissed, and understandably so, I insulted him.  I told him I didn't agree with his opinion of her head scarf and I didn't want to tell her to take it off. He said if I didn't agree with how they do things then we could part ways, I said I agree. He paused and then took me into a cubical to talk.  At that point he said he didn't understand where this was coming from, he said he did so much for me by giving me my $1,000 bonus for the job I was doing for the last 6 weeks (He laughed in my face when I accepted he position and asked for a raise). He said he never tells me to cover my tattoos, but makes the guy's cover theirs.  I told him that was a double standard, wrong, and I didn't agree with that either. I told him that what he was trying to make me do was discrimination against her and I told him it was not a du-rag. He then proceeded to tell me that it was in fact a du-rag and I could ask anyone else in the building, he insisted it was and it was against dress code.  ***Keep in mind*** NO where on our dress code/handbook manual specifies or even mentions that employees cannot wear hats, head pieces, scarves, accessories,  wraps, or headbands, etc.  So, I'm not sure where he got the ""dress code violation from"". When I tried to explain to him that he was being prejudice and discriminating my co-worker and trying to use me to do his dirty work he got even more upset with me. I told him of other instances where he did some questionably discriminatory/sexist and racist things. I even told him it sounded like a personal problem that he needed to address with her personally and I wanted no part in it.  He had nothing to say and ended it with ""If you don't like how we do things here then we can part ways."" and then he sent me home.  He later told my co-workers I walked and then just today he asked my co-worker (the one he wanted to remove the head piece) if she wanted my job.  Keep in mind, I never got officially fired or resigned.  Do I have some sort of case of injustice going on or is this sort of thing totally normal/acceptable?  I just really hate that this happened. I did so much for my job and I truly cared about the work I put into it."	Yes
178	I've been working at a small startup (UK) for about a year now and I've been pretty unhappy for a while so I decided to look elsewhere. I am considering working for a direct competitor.  My boss and I work very closely, and we both acknowledge that we do not get along. The idea of me departing has been discussed and it would not be a shock if I resigned.  In my search for jobs that suit my skill-set, I found a position identical to mine at a direct competitor. It is at a huge organisation, *pays 1.5x the salary*, and offers more opportunity to grow in my career. To be honest it's a dream job.   After interviewing, I'm optimistic that I'll get an offer in the next week or so. However his got me thinking about non-compete, considering we make essentially the exact same product for the same broad market.  **About my contract**: The clauses in my employment contract very clearly **prohibit me from dealing with any customer, employee, third party or business for 6 months after termination or divulging any trade secrets or confidential information.** The terms are really broad but very clear. *There is a 3 month prohibition on being involved with 'any business concern' in competition.*  It also states that I must notify my employer if an offer from another company is made, and that I have to give the new employer a copy of my non-compete.   I could go on 'garden leave' for 3 months but it is extremely unlikely my potential employer would wait that long.  In terms of 'trade secrets,' I know the company's financials *roughly*, and information about the number of customers we have. I don't know if they count as trade secrets.   **Questions**: * How serious is this? * Do I just go ahead and hope nothing comes of it? * Is there a legal way to go around this? * How costly and complicated would coming after me be? (My boss is lazy and disorganised) * Could this get my future employer in trouble/put them off hiring me?  **TL;DR - Hate my job - could go work for an exciting competitor, in the same role. Worried that my non-compete clause may fuck everything up.**	Yes
179	Hi all, About 7 months ago, I took a new position and agree to take less salary in exchange for a 1% ownership of the company once we went public. After a few odd things keep coming up like all the company's expenses are paid by a few credit cards that are all in the CEO's name. So when I did some online research it turns out that the 'parent' company and investors don't exist. There are multiple LLCs but they are all in the CEOs name and use his home address as well. It all seems very shady. I am not sure what to do now. This company turned out to charge me $528 a paycheck (bi-weekly) for health insurance. This has really hurt my take home amount and is hurting my overall finances. What should I do? Ask for a higher salary? Just leave before this whole thing blows up?	Yes
180	This is a lenghty read ... Spoiler, no TL;DR at the end  :(  Some context - the company that my husband works for is based in Ohio. They have offices in many different states as well as Canada. So my husband and I moved to Mississippi from Oklahoma in October due to this employer relocating him. He has worked for this same company since March of 2017. We both work in Tennessee, but we live in Mississippi. We have switched our licenses, car tags, we have a lease on our rental house, etc. We are permanent, legal residents of Mississippi, and no longer have any legal ties in Oklahoma.  So, the company - until November - was still taking out Oklahoma state witholding on the income tax on his paychecks. He called and asked them to change it to Mississippi- which I thought fixed it. No. From then until present they are taking out Tennessee State taxes. ??? We don't live in Tennessee so we will not file Tennessee State taxes - and Tennessee does not have state tax anyway.  Other than that, Mississippi has the stupid Employees Witholding Exemption Certificate that works as the state's W-4 (at least that's how my employer explained it). I had to fill one out for my job, and I told him to submit one for his when we first moved here. They refused it and said it is useless to them because they do not have an office in Mississippi.  So I did the only thing I could think of and submitted a new W-4 for his company where he withholds more on federal so we can make up the difference when tax time next year rolls around. However, when he submitted it, we noticed his paychecks are different but still more than they should be with the extra taxes taken out. They still are not taking out the extra witholding! He sent in an actual signed form that had our witholding amount on it, and the one they're showing on file is an electronically filled out one with no extra witholding form and it is e-signed. They also had him listed as a D.D.S. (yes, Doctor of Dental Surgery) on his paychecks. I can guarantee if he was a DDS, he wouldn't be working for this bass ackwards company!!  I'm beyond frustrated. I just don't know if I have any ground to stand on with getting an attorney/lawyer. If I do I'm more than willing to hire one. I know that this won't affect our taxes that we are about to file much, if at all, it's next year's that I'm worried about. With our extra witholding, do I even need to really be worried about it, or am I thinking way too much about this?? Thanks in advance for any and all advice!!	Yes
181	"Hello all, I work as a seasonal full time employee at my college over the summers. It's a pretty sweet deal, because I get to live in campus apartments for free, on top of having a full time job. I have a second job as well. This summer, I'm working with the catering crew in the dining hall. They have lost a few people, leaving us a bit understaffed, and as a result we've been over scheduled and worked over forty hours in one week four times.   We sign in by writing down when we came in and took our breaks, and then we sit down while our boss enters our time in online based on what hours we've worked. However, she lies about when we come in - when we reach overtime, we are told that we're not allowed to work overtime, so we ""have"" to spread our hours out in the pay period to prevent that. My friend who is also working this job this summer got fourteen hours of over time. She was unable to even claim all of her hours - she's not getting paid for the full time she worked because we were closed down for a week, and it would look suspicious to put down times that no one else would have at all in the entire dining hall staff.   I personally have five hours of overtime that I was told I couldn't claim, and my boss put it down for last Friday and said if anyone asks, we could lie and say I only came in to help unload a delivery truck. In the state of Virginia, which is where I am, overtime (which is when you exceed forty hours in one week) is paid by time and a half, so instead of making $7.25 on those five hours (and my friend on her fourteen that she didn't even get to claim all of), we should have been getting paid $10.88 for each of the hours that we worked over the forty hour limit. By spreading the hours over the pay period, we are only getting paid the minimum for our week of overtime.   I have worked forty hours in the past three days. I'm poor and mostly self supporting, and I used the promise of my paycheck motivate myself to pull through. I need all of the extra money I can get, and frankly, after pulling 12+ hour shifts and only getting six hours of sleep, I feel pretty freaking cheated. My friend is really upset too, because she's in the same boat, and she recently lost her second job.   I have emailed the Virginia Department of Labor, because I went to my boss's supervisor and asked why I couldn't claim the over time that I had worked. He said ""Well, it's just not in the budget."" I asked him who made the budget, and he said it was campus administration. I ran into my work study employers from the school year, and asked why I was being told I couldn't claim over time. He said the school has the money for it, but doesn't want to pay for it. He also said however that what my boss is doing is extremely wrong, because he's had to give people overtime before. He got chewed out for it, but the student worker was still able to claim their hours and he just made sure not to schedule the student overtime again.   What should I be ready for?? I honestly have no idea what's going to happen from here on out. And I don't want to get in trouble with my boss at work for snitching, or for anyone to get fired, I just want me and my other coworkers to get paid for what we did according to the state's labor laws."	Yes
182	Basically what the title says. I just got hired in California by a restaurant chain. I'm sitting in the employee orientation and the HR lady says employees aren't eligible for health insurance until 1 year. I was under the impression that the ACA chAnged this to a 90 day minimum waiting period, and my cursory googling confirms that. There are some exceptions but none that should extend it to a full year. I haven't even started yet and don't want to jeopardize this employment opportunity, because I need a job, but I want to make sure I am getting what's rightfully mine. I plan on asking Hr once I've completed training, but is there any other course of action I should take? With the current political situation my confidence in government actually helping me is at an all time low, but what should I do?	Yes
183	I am looking to leave (flee, rather) my current employer and one of the opportunities I am presented is the same position with a competitor that is opening a new location.  Back in 2011, contingency of continued employment was a non-compete agreement of 1 year and I am uncertain of the scope of the 'area of coverage'.  This is specialty retail, so I'm not sure what could be considered 'protected information or practices' I could be taking with me. But clientele of this specialty visit most locations and I cannot imagine this not somehow getting back to my current boss if I were to leave and go to this competitor.  I doubt any action would be taken, but I do have a higher-than-most profile in this industry.  Kicker is, I am leaving because of a hostile work environment stemming from and sourced by the top of the food chain.  Berating, misplaced aggression, verbal abuse, swearing, I have documentation of instances that I could probably file a case and win with, but I'm not looking to sink a small business, just to keep myself from garnering a worsening mental state.  TLDR: If I am attacked over a non-compete, is a retort/defense of a hostile working environment forcing me to leave an acceptable legal defense?	Yes
184	Today I found out that my company didn't contribute to my 401k for 3 years ever since I started working there. Even though I elected to have it maxed out and Fidelity has that on record, my employer simply has never carried out the contributions. When I asked HR about it they only said that there is nothing they can do. Is this true or am I legally entitled to some compense or solution to catch up on what I missed?	Yes
185	Posted in r/personalfinance originally   Not sure if best place to post, but have found help on this sub-Reddit before   My grandfather passed away this weekend and I have been off work since. My partner went to work on Monday but came home early and has since taken Tuesday and Wednesday off as well. Partially as she is upset and partially to support me.  Now, the thing is she has been temping at a company the past few weeks (in the uk) and she has been called this morning to be told she is no longer wanted as she is 'unreliable'   To me this seems wholly unfair, as she is taking compassionate leave, and if she had been asked to go in, she would have.  My question is, is this right? Is there anything that can be done here?	Yes
186	Hey everyone. I'm not sure where to look for information, or what to search for. I've tried a bit, and found some information, but not complete.   So here's the situation.   I'm 8 months pregnant, my husband went to work for a company to go tree planting for a couple of months.   Turns out it's a shitty company and he wants to leave early. He told the boss that he needs to come back to help me, as I'm on sick leave currently.   His boss said two things that are making me scratch my head.   1. He needs me to provide a sick note detailing why I'm sick and what's wrong with me. I told my husband that in the note I provided my employer, it didn't say anything about why I am sick, just that I am sick and that I will be off work from this date until this date.   2. Then he said that if my husband leaves now, instead of paying per tree, my husband will get paid minimum wage for the hours worked. My husband also said that he can stay for one more week.   My husband doesn't have a copy of his contract, and will talk to his boss tomorrow to get a copy.   I'm just wondering about the legalities of leaving a contract early, and if the boss can change the rate of pay in this situation.   Also I tried looking into family sick leave in MB, and I found a phone number I can call to ask more. Unfortunately tomorrow is Sunday and I may have to wait until Monday to call.   Also if he is in a different province, what provinces labour laws should he be following, assuming this company is a MB company?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
187	"Hi Reddit. This is my first time posting on here, and any help would be much appreciated! I apologize for the sloppiness of the format, I'm typing this on my phone at work.     I'm 26, Caucasian, female, and I work in the slot department on grave yard in a [non-union] casino. I've been in this department for 2 years, and the casino as a whole for almost 7 years. I recently, after much prodding and being insistent on other managers, have been offered a dual rate ""promotion.""  By becoming a dual rate, im basically a mini supervisor. My current rate is $10.90 an hour. The promotion is $1. But it doesn't entirely bump my pay up. Days that I supervisors all day (which would possibility be once every two weeks) I would make $11.90/hour for 8 hours. Days that I don't supervise the entire day, I would get paid $11.90 for 2 hours.   The major problem is that the manager who had the final say in promoting me told me I would be getting $2 more. All of the other dual rates make $2 more per hour. So essentially $16 more when they supervise all day, and $4 a day when they don't. Said manager (I think his official title is assistant casino operations manager, or some other fancy mumbo jumbo,) played a ton of games when it came time to offering me this promotion because he didn't want to do it since it takes away from his bonus. For example, he told another manager to tell me it was okay to promote me, even though HE was the one who had the final say so. He also took his sweet time going to HR to get the paperwork going.  This manager is also trying to cut expenses in any way possible so he gets a bigger bonus. Gotta love corporate.   The two dual rates on my shift make $2 more for supervising. Technically for them it's only $1.85 more because they got a $0.15 raise about a year or so ago. I am the lowest paid person on my shift. Everyone is at $15 an hour or more. Part of the reason is that they have been here since day one and were on a different pay scale. (Different ownership, Michael Gaughan at first and then Boyd gaming.). I understand being considerably newer, I won't be making as much as somebody since day one. My raises are $0.20 a year. That is part of the reason I wanted to become a dual rate at that $2 mark. I would basically be getting a $0.50 cent raise. My biggest gripe is that other dual rates make $2 more, why are they trying to get me to take $1?  Even newer dual rates got it at $2 an hour.  One of the managers on my shift says he personally thinks they're trying to get one over on me and suggested I sit down and talk with the director and assistant manager. After doing some thinking and talking to my best friend, I don't think meeting with them is a bad idea and inquiring about why my pay is considerably lower, especially given the fact the assistant manager TOLD ME $2 more.  I don't have any concrete proof that he told me, so it's my word versus his. I figured having the director and assistant manager in there wouldn't be a bad idea because that way it won't turn into a big game of he said she said.   I figured with the meeting, I would thank them for giving me this opportunity to further my career, but I was under the impression the promotion would be more. I know I can't be aggressive, but I can't be passive either. It's easier said than done. I don't know if they're going to care it'll literally take 20 years to get to where everybody else is at. Depending on where this meeting goes will determine what the next step is. Part of me is nervous that they'll take away my promotion for questioning them... then it opens up a discriminatory / retaliation case.  But I don't feel right taking the promotion knowing it should be more money.   One of the things I did look up was the NLRA section 7 which basically says employees are allowed to discuss salaries amongst themselves. So during my meeting if they tell me that I'm not allowed to talk about it, I can let them know there's a federal law which protects me, and section 8 of the act basically says they can't retaliate against me for inquiring about other people's pay.  I don't really want to get another job. I live in Las Vegas, and the economy is tough. Not to mention, it took me 2 years to get full time in my department. I don't want to give that up just to have to do it somewhere else and possibility wait longer than that to become full time. I do really like my job for the most part. Working on graveyard is awesome. The people on this shift are cool and want me to better myself. Also, I make tips. A lot of nights were slow, but I make good money for working a shift that isn't too busy.   The casino I work at is not union, so I'm only protected by federal laws. I would like some thoughts and opinions on the matter. Should I fight it? Should I shut up and take the dollar? Am I being a brat? Are there any other laws that protect me, or let upper management do whatever they want? Do I even stand a chance?   Thanks!!"	Yes
188	"I work as a delivery driver for an international pizza chain. I make $4.50/hour when i'm on the road, and $8.00/hour when I am in the store. Today while I was still on a delivery, somebody inside the store clocked me into the store (something that managers do in order to make their numbers look better). When my shift ended an hour later, my general manager approached me and told me that I was committing fraud because I had clocked into the store while on a delivery. They told me I wouldn't be fired, but I needed to pay for the pizza that I had delivered (when I got clocked in) and they took $25-$30 dollars out of the tips that I made for the day. I told them that the pizza that they are trying to make me pay for was paid for BY THE CUSTOMER with a credit card. My manager didn't seem to care and said she would ""look into it."""	Yes
189	I work as a lifeguard. My company does things which I'm not sure of the legality of.  This time they just informed me that my pool will be closed tomorrow all day and that they knew of this well in advance but didn't tell me or the other guards. Its less then 24 hours until my shift would have started and this cuts into my over time. I'm loosing 9 hours of $16.75/hr for a day I could've made plans for but didn't because of no notice. Do I have any rights here?  I'm from anne arundel county maryland.	Yes
190	What rights do employees have in this case? I recieved benefits for about 5 months, they audited my account, found my employer wasn't paying in, now they want ALL the money back. I have no idea what to do.	Yes
191	"Context:    My coworker (we'll call him Steve) has a 17 year old son. Steve's neighbor is a pretty old crotchety guy (We'll call him OCG) and likes to make noise complaints. OCG even said so to Steve when Steve first moved in. OCG complained to Steve once in person and Steve says to let him know any time he has any problems with noise so he may deal with his son (who may be loud at times because he is 17 years old). He also happens to mention he works at a medium sized company in town (We'll call it McCompany). OCG rents from the property management department in McCompany. Steve does not work in this department, however.     The next time OCG decides to complain he goes to the property management department of McCompany and asks the manager to mention this to Steve through his employer connections. Steve tells this to me because he found it weird. Steve also finds out that OCG had tried to file a complaint with the police.   What Happened Today:  OCG decided to visit McCompany's HR department, introduced himself as Steve's neighbor and asked where Steve works because ""He just wants to say 'Hi'"". The HR girl happily leads him into our office, then HR girl pops in and asks where Steve is and I casually mention he was out for some personal stuff and will be back shortly. That's when she mentions to me ""His neighbor is here to say 'Hi'.""  What I'd like to know:  Is what HR girl did illegal? If so, would this law be publicly available for me to read or show to them? (Hopefully with more laws they probably do not abide.) What could my coworker or myself do about this? I really don't feel like my information is safe within the hands on our HR department.  Any help or even a point in the right direction would help and I would be greatly appreciative."	Yes
192	"(suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.  At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.  I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was ""I'll talk to you when I get back"" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule.   Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there.   This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting.   But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying ""I'm too sick to work"" contradicts ""The way you run this place is inhospitable for me"".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there.   What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?"	Yes
193	"I accepted a job offer and started working there. They mentioned me having to sign a contract and they would be bringing one to me. It is 6 months since then and I still have not been approached by anyone.  In the electronic offer an email said this, ""This offer is contingent upon your signing a written employment agreement.""    I guess, I am worried if I left they would come after for all they have paid me since I never signed, or am I good?"	Yes
194	I have a friend who is having some problems at work. We have no idea where to start, or if there is any legal way to help.  Recently my friend over heard a coworker (I'll call her Cindy) make a threatens statement about my friend over a text conversation that happen months ago.   My friend went to HR and assumed that Cindy would be appropriately felt with. Unfortunately the situation was turned around on my friend and now she is in more trouble than Cindy.   The head of our company spoke with my friend and said that they couldn't give my friend any sympathy over the situation because she didn't bring it up months ago. Now she has a last chance write up on her record that will never fall off no matter how long she stays at the company. This write up was for miscommunication. She is also on probabtion and they said if she gets any complaints about communication she will be fired on the spot. She now has to take communication classes with Cindy and as far as I can tell Cindy did not get in trouble at all.   I feel like this is retaliation for speaking out against a hostile employee. Cindy is friends with the head of the company and cronyism runs rampant.   Is there anything legally wrong that the employer did?   Thank you.	Yes
195	"Hired about a month ago and the boss asked me during my interviews what my political views are. We were on separate sides and we both agreed it wouldn't be an issue. So today I tell him how I've met a potential client by discussing politics and agreeing with someone at a bar. He states ""you'll never succeed with that mindset"". I ask to further discuss this and to explain. He tries to sway me and I tell him politely I still believe what I previously stated. I then ask him ""you're thinking about firing me over this, aren't you?"" sure enough he says yes and that we'll talk about it tomorrow. At least I got to go home early so there's that.   Anyways if I do end up getting fired is there anything I can actually do about this? I've tried to do some research but it all seems like a case by case basis."	Yes
196	I am living abroad of US but in an American company. My question is, if a female security guard in an American company wants to have a child just for herself and she chooses a coworker male security guard as donor for giving birth to child, does it effect according to US HR regulation their employment in American company? If the donor has a wife and children.	Yes
197	I'm an FLSA exempt employees in California.  Last weekend, my employer had a major emergency and needed me to remedy it.  After working my 40 hour week, I was kept in the office until obscene hours and asked to return each day of the weekend.  When the problem was fully solved, I had spent nearly 40 extra hours working between the hours of 6pm friday and midnight Sunday. I slept very little each day. When I asked if I could take Monday off to fix my sleep schedule, I was told no. I have yet to receive any extra compensation and am being asked to work every Saturday for a month, on top of my Monday-Friday work week. By EOD this Saturday, I believe I will have seen a 90+ hour work week with no extra compensation.  Enough of the sob story. I just wanted to give context around the magnitude of the situation.  I've read many posts on FLSA exempt employees and how they can be required to work extra without a compensation change. I consider that a given.  My question is, what's the upper boundary of extra required hours? Surely there are laws to protect these workers from situations that are a danger to their health?	Yes
198	I work at a manufacturing facility in South Dakota and I'm not in HR department but sit right next to it so I overhear and greet a lot of potential employees.  We just had a lady come in who wanted to apply for a certain position but one of the qualifications is that you must be able to lift 50lbs.  She told our HR that she is currently pregnant and is on restriction from her doctor to only lift no more than 35lbs but that after her pregnancy she would have no problem doing so.   Our HR lady told her that unfortunately that's part of the job, but we'd be happy to have her apply after she has her baby.  I was just thinking about it for some reason and was wondering if that's the correct way to handle it? Because then I started wondering what would happen if someone in that position currently got pregnant and put on restrictions.	Yes
199	"Im working for a P.I. as an assistant. He wants me to phone a suspect for him, because his voice would be recognized.   Most of the things he asked me to say seems alright, but two things seem sketchy.   He wants me to say:  &gt;*""You are not allowed to leave the country, or the city limits. If you are found fleeing you will be arrested immediately.""*  This is merely  to intimidate them... we havent been told this by police. **Is it legal to tell someone *you will be arrested for doing/not doing xyz*, as a bluff?**  Also:  &gt;*""If we cant get your friends contact info, they will be sued as well""*  This is very possible, but a lawsuit is not yet confirmed. **Is it legal to tell someone ""you **will** be sued unless xyz"", as a bluff**"	Yes
200	"I'll try to make this short.  About a year ago, I, a minor, signed an NDA with an online tech startup based out of California. I cosigned with my parent(s) to do so. I signed my NDA under the presumption that I would be doing work, and getting paid for said work; where the latter was false. It worked out swell for a few months, but my boss started to miss paychecks -- skipping entire months of pay saying that I didn't deserve it because I was ""useless"" and so on. Just a few days ago, a direct competitor offered me a job with them and I decided that I was done with the B.S. that my boss was throwing at me, so I put in my two weeks notice saying that I was going to explore my options at other companies. Instead of working my two weeks, my access was fully removed across all platforms and he told me that in no uncertain terms, he would be suing me if I were to join a competitor. As for what, specifically, he has eluded to the doctrine of ""inevitable disclosure"". Now, I've done my fair share of homework, and there are no clauses in my NDA that prevent me from leaving him and joining a competitor. There are clauses that refer to him being able to apply for an injunction to stop me from revealing his CI in whole or in part, but that's only under the presumption that I have revealed his CI or have threatened to reveal it (which I have done neither).  I've been talking to my parents, and they think that he, for lack of a better way to say it, can't do anything. I'm not joining the competitor to reveal his CI, I'm joining the competitor because they treat me better and pay me more. I never signed a working agreement or contract with him, and it's safe to say that the entirety of the pay that I earned with him was under-the-table. Whenever I alluded to me being his employee (prior this entire ordeal), he'd be very quick to remind me that I am in fact only an 'independent contractor', and not his employee. I don't know if that's relevant to this question, but I thought it may be.  So my question, to you, is the following: What are my options? I have several offers from competitors, offers that I very much want to take, but he's saying if I take any of them w/out his prior written approval (exemption in writing), he'll file suit. Keep in mind, I am a minor from Canada, and he is an adult from California. I am afraid that if I take an offer from a competitor, he will file suit and I'll have to deal with that accordingly. He does have my address, so he can serve me papers (excuse my naivety for the legal process, I'm by no means an expert). My parents think that I am fine, and I can take an offer from the competitor. They've also said (paraphrasing): ""what is he going to do? Extradite you?"", in response to my fears of being sued. They think that if he files suit, I can simply ignore it and let it drift in the water, because what can he do? I'm a minor from Canada, and I haven't even broken his agreement.  Sorry if this post got a little long. I hope I included all relevant details. If you have any questions that I can clarify/expound upon please don't hesitate to ask."	Yes
201	I work for a small incorporated laboratory in Washington state. On Friday we were called into a meeting and told that the company has been sold to a larger laboratory. The new company is headquartered about 40 minutes south, and they will be closing our laboratory completely.   The new company has been acting as if we are now employees of their business, however we have received our final paychecks from our old employer including our accrued vacation time. We have been told that any accrued time is being set back to 0 with the new company. In addition, we are being asked to interview for the new company and sign new employment contracts. We were told that they do not need all of the current staff.  My question is in regards to my employment status. I feel as if I have been terminated from my original position, however I have not been told this directly. I'm unsure of if I qualify for unemployment, and if I am required to continue to show up for work at the new company or if that is considered voluntarily quitting (can I even quit a job I don't technically have?). My current employment contract states that I am entitled to severance pay if I am discharged. However, I don't know if I have been.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I've been having difficulty finding any law advice online for this specific circumstance.	Yes
202	I've been working in a French international NGO dealing with an emergency crisis in my country (Lebanon) for 2.5 years. I am currently at a program manager level (head of a department) and thus I'm involved in medium level decision making and I'm involved in proposal writing and strategy design. In the meantime, I have been volunteering with a local charity for more than 6 years. This charity, of which I consider myself one of the founders, has been growing and has merged with a local NGO. I now have the opportunity to take part of that local NGO as one of its youth club's board members. (Non-paying, volunteer position). And thus will definitely have a say in the strategy and program design. I might also be involved in submitting proposals for funding. Would be a conflict of interest if take up that opportunity? Note that our current area of intervention (geographical), scope of work (what we do), and target demographics, are mutually exclusive. But obviously this could change with time.  I am worried that it would be considered unaccountable towards either of my beneficiaries. I am also worried about my employability and to negatively affect either one of the NGOs.   From a Humanitarian Standards/Principles point of view as well as French Law, am I considered in conflict of interest?	Yes
203	"My friend was talking about non-competes and brought this question up...""Is a non-compete valid if you sign it but you physically haven't started working for them yet?"" Basically, they're asking is if you sign a non-compete but haven't started can you switch to a different job without any legal ramifications.   We couldn't find any answers online.  Cheers also the location is Massachusetts"	Yes
204	"I am a certified teacher and was offered a position teaching at a performance arts summer camp for 5 weeks for 2k. I could bring my child so it was really ideal for summer pay. Since taking the position, basically everything has turned out to be a lie. I was supposed to teach Pre-K. Instead I'm teaching PreK-2nd grade all in one classroom.  Okay cool, part of being a teacher is being flexible and making it work- I can do that. Also the number of campers was supposed to be 100, and instead there's 45 at best. We're also in a low socioeconomic area in my city where many of the parents just haven't paid and we're finishing week 3.  Payday is supposed to be this Friday with half of my pay due. I wasn't feeling very confident about her reliability with paying so I asked her today. She basically said she doesn't have it but has around 1/3 of it. Meanwhile we started with around 6 teachers and are now down to only 2 because everyone else has quit or was told the camp was ""closing"" because basically she couldn't afford to pay them.  If she doesn't pay Friday, I'm done. Both myself and the other remaining teacher will not be returning if she doesn't pay us. I've been flexible with a smile on my face and she's so worried about a final performance that it's literally trumping the fact that half the kids in the main roles haven't even paid to come to camp. What are my next steps to get paid if she can't pay us on Friday?  I'm also super frustrated because on the 4th she actually text me and said she was sorry but camp was closing (in reality she knew she couldn't afford to pay me). Then proceeded to ask me to come back 2 days later after I had asked my previous place of employment if I could be added to their schedule a few days a week. So now I feel like a fool but I really love the kids... help! :(  Tldr; I've been teaching at a camp that has basically turned out to be complete lies. I've taught for 3 weeks and now that we're nearing 1/2 of the pay days she ""doesn't know if she can come up with it"". What are my next steps if she says she can't pay me?"	Yes
205	In October 2016 I was let go from my job. When leaving, I asked about my 26 hours of unused PTO. They referred me to the company's HR department. This is a large company that does business in many states. It is a mail order pharmacy. When I called, they said that in Kansas they don't pay unused PTO. But I don't think that's accurate. I don't think that's accurate because when my girlfriend owned a business that went out of business, a former employee of hers sued her for unused vacation time. I'm just confused with the law is and what I should do. Your help is greatly appreciated!	Yes
206	"December of last year I worked for a studio in Los Angeles, CA for a week making outfits for a commercial. I got the job through a friend and never signed a contract (I'm an idiot, I know) because it was ""such a great opportunity"".  I cut my finger open my first day in the shop and I had to go to an Urgent Care nearby for stitches. My insurance paid for it and I never filed a claim because I didn't want to cause a problem for the shop owner.   The owner turned out to be a very irresponsible, disorganized person who was a complete nightmare to work for. I worked very long hours to finish the job, and in the end only ended up getting paid half of the $1000 he owed me for the week, even after contacting him about it several times.  Last night, my friend linked me to the shop's website where they are using my photos of my personal work (stuff completely unrelated to the job I did for them)  to advertise their business. I had the intention of letting the whole thing go, but after seeing that I'm pretty furious.  Is there anything I can do about it legally or am I SOL?"	Yes
207	I live and work in Ohio. My job is taking out taxes for PA. I called my boss, he said he would fix it, he didn't. I called HR and they said I have to fill in a form from the IRS, but they were unable to tell me what form. Is it a W-4, and who do I send it to? HR didn't know who to send it to, either.   Google and the company website say payroll should fix it. I'm confused. Searches only pull up that I should file out of state during tax time, but that's a while away.  Thank you in advance.	Yes
208	I live and work in Kentucky. Work at a small business (14 employees)   I was sent on a business trip to Iowa and had to fly here for a few days. They are paying me for working Mon-Wednesday since I was supposed to be home Wednesday night. Due to storms my flight got rebooked for Thursday and now I will not be home until Thursday night. If it is important, Thursday's are my day off and I never work thursdays. So I am just wondering if I should be paid to work Thursday since I am stuck here an extra day or if it is nobody's fault.   I do think they will go ahead and pay me but I am just curious if it is illegal if they do not.   Thanks!	Yes
209	"I worked for a 501c3 as an at-will grunt for three years. I reported some mistreatment of my coworkers (bullying, intimidation) and strong indications my Manager was lying about our numbers to the state (we're grant-funded) to our CFO. This was six months ago. I was told to come to her with any problems after our previous supervisor left, but according to our handbook CFO is not a protected whistleblower resource.  Shortly after, Manager let me know in no uncertain terms that nothing was changing. I realize that the CFO simply told supervisor exactly what was said. My coworker and I began to be subjected to constant site visits, which disrupt the traffic in our type of work. Questioning the supervisor on any subject became grounds for faux-disciplinary meetings, and we began getting write-ups for missed deadlines that weren't enforced in any other department. We were threatened with preparatory audits of our finances and paperwork (this has never been done, there has never been a problem, they take an enormous amount of time, and the actual audit is years away) and scheduled so that we worked large amounts of unpaid overtime, which we were told we could not bill for at the start of our employment. This stuff made our working lives miserable for months for virtually zero gain. It seems like this qualifies as retaliation, but aside from outbursts at meetings I recorded most of it just looks like unnecessarily strict oversight.  I decided to try my luck with HR, in the middle of this (three months ago), which the handbook did list as a protected whistleblower resource. They listened to me and two coworkers, and said ""these things take time, we're going to have to go to the board."" Shortly afterward, one of the coworkers that went to HR was fired, and a couple of miserable months afterward I was also fired for missing a deadline for internal docs by a day.  At this point all of my remaining coworkers were even more miserable, and my former supervisor appeared completely untouchable, and our project was suffering for it, so I threw a hail mary and sent a letter to the president of our organization's board (a lawyer). He met with me and said he'd probably hire an employment lawyer to look into it. Neither he nor the board had heard anything about complaints from me or anybody else from HR, which I believe, given that he didn't seem to know Manager by name or anything about our program.  Now I find out at least one of the things I reported on behalf of a coworker to PotB has been investigated and the person involved suspended, and I got a call from our CEO saying ""We take this very seriously, and we'd like you to talk to an employment lawyer we've hired to investigate the other concerns.""   All I have personally are emails documenting when I met with CFO and HR (which also outlined the complaints), some recordings of Supervisor being inappropriately and strangely aggressive in meetings, and my narrative of what happened. The five other employees who still work in my old department are also extremely unhappy, but aside from one person's emails to Supervisor outlining their bullying and other unprofessional behavior, it basically adds up to six peoples' combined hundreds of work stories about Manager being an enormous fucker and complaints to HR getting immediately redirected back to Manager.  Is any of the stuff I've already talked about a red flag for employment lawyers? Will they consider Manager as a legal liability if it adds up to heaps of borderline-actionable material, or only if they find something damaging off the bat? How should I present this to waste as little of their time as possible?"	Yes
210	I work for a state school in California and the contract o signed said I would be paid at 12.5 but my pay stub I received showed a rate of 10.50 what recourse do I have? I also cashed the check before I checked the pay stub and I have pictures of the contract	Yes
211	A conversation with one of the owners of my company has me wondering.  He is advocating for docking pay for mistakes.  His example was to dock an hour of pay even if the mistake took the employee only 5 minutes to correct.  His reasoning is that docking only 5 minutes of pay would not hurt the employee enough to not make the mistake again.  His intention is to punish not to recover actual costs.  This is also a job with a lot of judgement required and grey areas.  Therefore, this would be a matter of him deciding after the fact that performance or the outcome was not sufficient.   The employees make over minimum wage and are part time hourly employees.  In researching this, I found conflicting information.  The law says that hourly employees must be paid for all hours worked.  It also says that pay can be docked as long as overall compensation does not drop below minimum wage.  Before anyone says it, yes, I am looking for a new job.  1. Can he deduct pay, by the hour, as a punishment? 2. Would it make it legal if he made it a set dollar amount, like a fine, as long as it does not drop below minimum wage? 3.  If he could reason that the company lost X dollars due to the mistake, would that give him legal rights to dock pay?  I don't understand how reducing agreed upon pay by arbitrary amounts could be legal but the law seems to contradict itself.	Yes
212	So this guy has owned a trailer based business washing windows for awhile, every now and then on big jobs he has had college aged kids come help him complete those jobs. He files as an sole proprietor and pays the kids in cash. He is leaving for a couple years, and bought another trailer. While he is gone he wants me and another guy to run the trailers. He calls us independent contractors and asks for a 30/70 split of profits. We use his client base, and primarily he does scheduling. His name remains on the trailers, and we do not own the equipment but to dodge legalities I would be leasing the trailer from him.  He had no idea what a 1099 is, and has claimed all wages he paid to people that helped him as business expenses. What problems exist here? I can provide more non-identifying information if that helps. He also has called me a foreman in a video he put in social media.  The reason I ask this is that I believe this is an employee/employer relationship and could get troublesome fast, but there are some gray areas that could prove it possible to make work.   I'm not really interested, but he's also a friend and I want him to know why I'm turning it down and that he needs to fix some things. I'd also like to understand the situation better, and I don't think he even knows there's problems. Thanks!	Yes
213	Hello,  I'm curious about the legality of this. This is a company that I contract with, but am not an official employee of. Are these extensive restrictions legal? Are there any limitations on them?  *For and in consideration of my employment and placement as a tutor for _________, I hereby agree that during my employment for ________ and for a period of one year after the end or termination of my employment, irrespective of the time, manner or cause of said termination, I will not directly or indirectly, either as principal, agent, employee or employer, stockholder, co-partner or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever, solicit or tutor any person whom I have tutored while acting as an agent and/or tutor for _________.

Yes
214	"Hello reddit I'm officially jobless (Hate not having steady income.) basically my issue is that I was fired for ""Lack of performance"" but when my general manager (friend) was telling me over a recorded phone call that I was fired; He told me that the real reason is because I said something and they heard over their audio cameras that they didn't like and the little Weasle of the owner's son told on me.   I legitimately don't recall what I said. The owner doesn't let my GM hear the record so because of hear-say I'm fired.   There were and still are no signs anywhere on the premises that say ""audio cameras in use."" Reddit help me out, Do I have a case?"	Yes
215	So I worked at the Cotton Patch for about 3 weeks before they fired me because it's brand new and they hired too many people. Our first pay check was training, we made minimum wage during this time, so the company took the liberty of making us pay $35.00 for two shirts and an apron. Fast forward to my boss firing me for a random reason and asking for the uniform back before my next paycheck. I was so confused about why I was fired that I didn't think to ask if I'd be reimbursed. Do I have the right to ask for the money back and are they obligated to give it to me? Surely, it just opened and they already want it back...	Yes
216	"Hey so I just found this sub and I've been having this question in my head for a long time. My last job, I was working about 55 hours per week yet still considered part time. On top of that, my boss would take all the hours over 40 (15 for example) and move it to the next week so I wouldn't get paid overtime. I was young and didn't really mind because i liked the place and I wasn't doing it for the money, I'm just a hard worker and I like to work. But I just told my mom the other day about it and she's like ""you should sue for all those hours."" Could I really sue for that?"	Yes
217	Hi, I recently got hired as a guest services supervisor. I'm a full-time employee (scheduled for and work over 40 hours per week) and am salaried at $520 per week. I work in California.   [I seem to qualify for the administrative exemption per California law.](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=A#administrative%20exemption)    From what I can tell, I should be paid at least twice the minimum wage, is this correct? If so, am I being illegally underpaid?  Thanks.	Yes
218	Have put more effort into my job and have demonstrated my commitment more than other employees. (attendance, going above and beyond job description)  My boss is giving me worse shifts, less hours, etc. in preference of workers that are the ethnicity of the companies owners.   I am assuming a lawyer would not take this case without up front fees.	Yes
219	I work for a restaurant in New Jersey where employees pool tips (all cash business). It is customary that managers count the tips 15 minutes before a shift ends as the new shift workers are coming on to replace the prior shift and during the last 15 minutes of our shift those who are leaving attend to typical restaurant duties (filling napkin holders, wiping tables, etc).   The other day I was not replaced by an employee coming on to the second shift and worked 20 minutes past the time I was supposed to get off. I served two large parties and I asked a manager to recount tips since I thought I should be compensated for those tables, among others, and she refused.  My questions is whether it is illegal not to tip me out on the tables I served prior to leaving? They compensated me as though I stopped serving tables 15 minutes before the shift ended instead of recounting the tips and compensating me for 20 minutes after.   Sorry if this seems petty but this occurs rather frequently and over a longer period those tips begin to add up.	Yes
220	I was an employee for a major silicon valley company. This was a remote position. I was recently terminated from my job just one week after making a request to have Sundays off to observe the Sabbath (I am a member of the LDS church).  The reasons for my firing were very shady. There was no final warning. Unemployment reviewed my case and decided that the company was in the wrong. I was hence awarded benefits.   I decided to appeal my termination with the company. An HR rep finally called me back today to discuss the matter. I told the rep that while working for the company- shortly before getting fired- I was asked by my team manager which faith/denomination I belonged to and where specifically I went to church. The HR rep informed me that this was perfectly legal for my team manager to ask of me. I knew this was false.   I honestly believe now that I was fired because of my faith.   The good news is that I had the HR rep email me this same response in writing. They wrote that its standard for managers to ask 'clarifying questions' when making schedule changes such as I had requested.   Everything I've seen online flies in the face of what this HR rep is telling me.   Do I have a strong case for discrimination? Would I win a suit?	Yes
221	I want to apologize if I'm not doing this right, I'm not one to usually post here and I'm not too sure what to do. I just came home for the summer from my university to find out my mom got a new job! Unfortunately, she has to work 3-4 jobs ahead to keep her head afloat. She found this job with a Freight company on Indeed.com, and contacted her two weeks later.   A woman representing the company explained to my mother that the company was located in London, and told my mother that she would be taking packages and distributing them out for the company. My mother signed a contract which she checked with a lawyer friend of ours, who said it was valid. The work came quick shortly after. Mom was in contact with them, and did her job as the contract stated.   Where it gets messy is that, May and June we had work coming, and she was expecting a paycheck for the two months together(as the contract stated of the first month). As July rolls around, the packages ceased and my mother's bank account didn't get the money. She attempted to call both the number on the website and the number of the woman she was in contact with, and they either hung up on her after she identified herself, or just hasn't answered any of her calls.  My mother is upset because of the validity of everything, and also the fact that this money was meant to pay back bills she owed. Can my mother take the company to small claims court? What could be her next step? Everything is recorded in texts and recorded phone calls, as well as the sight she used to receive and send out the packaging. I sincerely hope she wasn't scammed, since she gave out very little information. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for reading.	Yes
222	I have been working at this pizza place for 8 months, and recently a shift manager at another location was fired. My boss started training me as shift manager at our location so I could replace the fired shift manager. I had to request 9 days off to go see my doctor in Arizona, and I was supposed to start at the new location when I came back. Coming back from Arizona I was nervous, because I think I did not receive sufficient training for my new position (I was never shown how to open, when that is part of the responsibilities of the shift manager). My boss messaged me this morning telling me to talk to the guy who runs the other location. Here starts my concern. When I showed up at the new location today my boss' boss did not know I was going to start as shift manager at all, and had already started training someone else for the position. He did not know I was coming over to talk either, even though my boss had supposedly set up our meeting. He said he was not sure when he would be able to put me on the schedule at his location, and it would not be as shift manager. I messaged my boss and told him how embarrassed I had been for showing up at the new location with the intent to start as shift manager and getting to know no such arrangements had been made. My boss told me he had forgot to tell the other location I would be starting, which sounds like a lie, as I have been training for a month to start in the new location. Now my boss is saying he is not sure how to fit me in the schedule at my regular location, leaving me in a tricky spot. I can't help but feel fooled (or bamboozled for the lack of a better word that I can think of right now) and am wondering if my boss is even allowed to do this? I need the hours and don't know when I'll be getting hours again. I don't appreciate the uncertainty and I feel I should not be held liable for this. What should I do? How should I go about this?	Yes
223	I know someone who works at Walmart. They were fired for violating the patriot act according to Walmart. My Friend who I will name Bob(23)  is the Walmart worker. Bob's friend Stu is 16. Stu's dad wanted to send him some money but couldn't because he isn't 18. Instead Stu's dad sends the money to Bob, Bob then signs for the wired money while on break (isn't the issue). Stu also signs the wire transfer. Walmart then fires Bob for violating the Patriot Act and alleges money laundering. Stu was using the money to buy something at the store. Did Bob violate the patriot act?	Yes
224	I know an employer can round to the nearest quarter/eigth hour legally, but can they switch between exact time and rounding depending on what benefits them?  Can they legally round start times to the latest eighth and end times to the earliest? Say a 7:06 to 3:40 work day with an unpaid 30m lunch that results in a paycheck for 7.75 hours.  My start and finish times are very irregular, but my hours are always lower than what I'm calculating no matter which rounding method I select.	Yes
225	Hi,  Florida.  My employer issued a new handbook today, containing a change in policy how they pay out PTO to employees who quit with two weeks' notice. Previously we got all unused PTO in our pay. Now they will only pay half.  Is this legal?	Yes
226	A fellow Redditor told me over on personal finance that if your hours at your job get butchered to the point where you only have one small shift a paycheck, it can be viewed as constructive dismissal and might be grounds for unemployment qualification even if you quit.  My question is, is this true? And if so, are their any technicalities and conditional rules to look into before I try to apply? I worked at McDonald's for three months and in my last month of work they cut me to one day a week, and eventually one day a paycheck. So, naturally, I quit. I'm looking for a new job but could really use some cash to hold me over, even if it's just enough to keep my phone turned on and pay my ride for gas when they take me to interviews.	Yes
227	I can understand if someone quit and you need to cover a shift, or it got busy before you where about to leave, but;  The store I work for closes at 10:00 PM everyday besides Sunday, of which we close at 8:00 PM. The company has distribution centers which ship products to their stores - Which is fine.  What's not fine is that they frequently schedule these shipments to arrive at 7:30 PM or even 8:00 PM - When we close.  Typically, I'm pretty laid back and wouldn't care, but these shipments take *at minimum* one hour to just unload, not put the items where they need to be.  I'm just thinking that there has to be some kind of rule that prevents this. They should either rethink their logistics or schedule for tomorrow.  **Tl;dr**: I, and everyone else, am being kept working well passed store closing ours by same companies (seemingly deliberate) shipment scheduling.  Is there anything I can do about this?  Location: Iowa, USA.	Yes
228	How does an employer prove that they have informed an employee of tip credits? Can the agreement be verbal or does it have to be written? Working in a restaurant, Tip credits and credit card processing fees are being taken from my wages. I was uninformed of this upon the start of my employment. I noticed these deductions after reading the server sales report at the end of the night. I am fully aware that the employer may take these credits, but should they be informing or providing notice to an employee about the exact numbers and percentages at the time of hire or during the training?	Yes
229	Months ago my coworker told me that he was in love with me and I told him that I did not have romantic feelings for him and asked him to keep it professional. He has since gone on to tell me that he is suicidal and continues to pester me with personal questions, following me around at work and asking to hang out outside of work. Today after being bombarded with personal questions I told him once again to leave me alone and keep it professional, that he was making my job miserable and stressful. At this point I was met with extreme hostility, the coworker disappeared, and I told my boss that I was leaving for fear of my safety.   It's my understanding that my boss knew that my coworker has been suicidal, and also that he had feelings for me. I have not officially quit my job and will be expected to join a conference call tomorrow. What should I know about my rights in this situation? Btw, I am a female referring to a male coworker.	Yes
230	I live in California and my shift starts at 6:00.  Can my employer legally say that I have to call in no later than 5:00?   I can't find anything that specific but so far it doesn't seem like they should be able to say anything as long as I have the sick time available.	Yes
231	I cut my finger good enough with a workplace appliance to have to go to an urgent Care facility. Got a tetanus shot and some stitches. Workers comp seems to be the way to go, but I am fairly confident I will test positive for marijuana if drug tested. Does this have potential to impact my workers comp? Seems completely unrelated...	Yes
232	"He hired me out of college and now is deciding not to pay me. It's been 4 weeks since my last ""payday"" and 2 weeks since I stopped working for him due to lack of payment. Being that I was ""under the table"" what can/should I do?  He owes me $530+"	Yes
233	"I had an employee give a verbal two week notice on Saturday. She cited that she wasn't happy and the office wasn't a good fit, and specifically mentioned it was not because of me. This morning, she said she was leaving early Wednesday for an appointment and I said that would not be possible as we didn't have coverage for her. She snapped, went on a rant about how I (the office manager) am actually the reason she's leaving, and that she is ""done."" Gathered her things and left.  I am left wondering what sort of legal protection the office has if she tries to file for unemployment. She has already secured a new job, and unfortunately, I was not able to get a resignation in writing, so I have no documentation beyond a statement I wrote out this morning regarding the situation. What should I do? Or just wait it out and see if an unemployment request comes through?"	Yes
234	Hey guys sorry for the anonymous, this is something I would rather not be tied too. That being said, here it goes.  I have worked for a city agency for 3 years now and for 2 or so of those years almost everyday people make sexual jokes about me or my sexual orientation, this ranges from my coworkers to my boss and even his boss, the second in command. The top dog does not know anything about it.  This all stemmed from a conversation about sexual experiences in the beginning of my employment.  Day in and day out jokes are made. For example: I got to work this morning and not even an hour later a joke about me being gay came up. This happens on average 3-6 times a day.  I know the second I say anything to them it will just make work suck even more.  I would rather not do anything since this is my only form income. I used to love doing what I do and I still do it just sucks being around the people that constantly make these jokes.  Do I have any recourse other than to just quit my job?  Is it my fault for letting it go on so long?	Yes
235	I am going to summarize this the best I can, I apologize ahead of time I am terrible at explaining.   I work for a Managed Service IT Provider. I work out of a satellite office 53 miles from the main office, my office is in a Office Shares building and the rent is $500 a month. My company has decided that the office isn't work the cost anymore. Which I am totally fine with, a few complications like not having a ton of work-space at my house for computer/server setup. I normally get paid Mileage to travel from my office to a clients office because of using my personal vehicle.  Here is the issue I am running into. My boss would like me to go on-site to a client's location and be there for half the day. The issue is my mileage from my home to the client's office isn't going to be considered an expense mileage I can get reimbursed for. He would like me to work from the main office once a week as well - not mileage.   This means driving 106 miles to the main office and back isn't considered mileage anymore. I have an issue with this, as I use the mileage I claim for wear and tear on my vehicle. Currently after adding up all the extra mileage my boss now wants me to drive it is almost 6 times what I would be driving to and from work. This doesn't include if I have to go to another client's office for an issue as this mileage isn't   My question to everyone here, is this illegal? What can I show my boss proving this?  Thanks ahead of time.	Yes
236	My paycheck was witheld this last pay period because my supervisor failed to approve my hours before she left on vacation.  I submitted my hours in a timely manner and the number of hours worked were consistent with my normal ammount.  Because of this I will not be able to pay off my entire credit card balance and will have to pay interest on my balance - in addition to the inconvenience of not having the money.  My employer told me that they cannot pay me until the next pay period.  Do you think I have any legal recourse in this situation - specifically two get my pay sooner than in another two weeks or having my employer pay all or a portion of my interest charge on my credit card?    I am in Utah.	Yes
237	"I work as a server at a restaurant in Alabama. I am not sure if there are any special rules that apply to my state, but the general idea that I have come to is that the practice of the employer taking our tips is illegal. However, I am not certain if my specific case qualifies as being illegal.  Originally servers were paid $6.00 an hour in addition to tips(we had a tip share), however this was eventually changed to $7.25 an hour with the tips being collected and ""put back into the restaurant""(whatever that means). However, this is only for the lunch/dinner shift. The original rule($6.00 plus tips) still applies to the breakfast shift.  Is this legal for employers to do? I am given many of my tips in person by the customers I serve who thank me for my excellent service quite frequently, and I feel quite cheated to be forced to put this money that is by all rights *mine* potentially into the owners' hands.  I have thought of saying something about it, but am fearful of losing my job. I have also considered simply keeping my tips, but am afraid of legal trouble that could be taken against me. Any advice/knowledge would be welcome."	Yes
238	I'm a student who has been working at a Sydney cafe for a few weeks now, and, as the title states, I've been getting underpaid (cash-in-hand), given no payslips, and not given penalty rates. The other workers I have talked to have also been getting the same treatment. Since, there is no payslip there is no evidence except for word of mouth. I don't wish to take them to court because I don't want to make life-long enemies. What will happen to them if I report them to fair work?	Yes
239	I'm applying to take intermittent FMLA to care for a family member with Parkinson's, who needs mainly to have me keep an eye on him to make sure he's eating and in case he falls and hurts himself. I requested to work from home but my employer refused and said FMLA was suitable for my needs. It's much less useful to me than WFH would be because I'll have to miss work and because, since I don't know when or if he'll need help back onto his feet or in case he hurts himself, I'll probably end up taking a few days off every week 'just in case' and play the odds.  We bid for shifts periodically based on performance, and if I miss much work I'm not going to be as able to compete for my current, desired shift. I'm worried I'll get pushed into a shift that's not what I want and that, for days I'm in the office, will actually make me even less able to care for him on those days.   Can they do that? What would be my recourse if they did?	Yes
240	I'm newly employed and need an attorney to review my employment contract. I've been recommended someone, but I'm struggling with the wording of the email. It never seems to sound right- it sounds like I'm asking for a favor instead of hiring him or whatever it's called. I'd appreciate some help with the initial contact/request. For example, I'm not sure if I send the contract with the first email or outline any expectations/problems I have with it.  Thanks for your time.	Yes
241	Hey everyone, I was hired on to work for an afterschool program at a local school. When I was originally hired on, I was going to be a coordinator that would be paid $12.00 an hour and start in the summer.   However, before I actually started, we found out the Assistant Manager was going to be gone for the summer. I was then told that I would be promoted to Assistant Manager for the summer. With this job, the base pay is usually $14.00, but with my experience I could expect around $14.50-15.00.   So, we started on 6/15, and I've been working full time as Assistant Manager. The entire time my supervisor has been emailing/calling/texting her boss to get her to update my pay to Assistant Manager. She didn't for the last paycheck, and I was under the assumption I would be getting retroactive pay for this paycheck. Today I found out that my pay had still not been updated, so I talked to my supervisor again, and she gave me her supervisor's (the person in charge of updating my pay) phone number and told me that I should text her myself to get her going.   Well, I did. But she didn't text me back, instead she emailed my supervisor and told her that since the original Assistant Manager would be coming back after the summer, they couldn't give me the position, and that I would have to be paid the original $12.00 that I was originally offered.   So, do I have any options? Is there any way I can get compensated for the pay I was expecting? Being the assistant manager is much more difficult than being a coordinator, so I would like higher compensation. My job role is completely different as well. I've pretty much taken on a massive amount more of responsibility and job difficulty on the expectation that I would be paid more for it, but after a month of working with that expectation I've found out that I'm not.	Yes
242	"I recently applied for a position in a VT branch of a major insurance provider. During my application, I had to agreement to private arbitration for any legal disputes before, during, and after any potential employment.   In addition to signing away any right to pursue a class action, disputes covered by the arbitration clause include things like sexual harassment, unpaid wages, discrimination against protected classes, overtime, and other issues clearly covered by both Vermont and federal labor law.  This is unlikely to ever be relevant for me, but I just want to understand, because this seems a little nuts to me. Basically, if this employer were to, say, refuse to pay me for wages I had earned, and I couldn't work it out through negotiation on my own, we would then go to a ""neutral"" third party selected by the employer. This neutral third party, while technically supposed to make a judgement based on actual law, could really do anything. They could just say, ""lol, you ain't gettin' paid"", and then I would get no money. I would not be able to appeal this decision... Is this correct?? I guess I don't understand the point of labor laws existing at all if employers can just have people, for practical purposes, sign away their rights. This can't be how it works, right?"	Yes
243	My grammar is terrible so I apologize in advance.   So i just recently left my job because of many reasons. The other people there and myself have always notice that sometimes our checks have been a little off. Some times they seem short. So far it has not been more then comments and that is it.   Today i got my check and it looked weird, i looked at all the itemized info like any check, and the numbers looked off. So i went through with a calculator and when i took the gross pay-net pay, then i take that difference and subtract all of the things being taken out: taxes, etc. And there is still an amount left over.... but there is no place for it on the itemized section. I looked back on my other checks and same thing, all different amounts, anywhere  from $20- $80  I called a girl that quit right after me. She looked hers over, and the same thing. Some of hers didnt even have the itemized section of what was taken out.   Am i crazy or is this weird.	Yes
244	Until recently I worked for a large bank and knew before leaving that I had used up more holidays than I was entitled for the amount of the year so far. I was told it would be deducted from my wages but it wasn't. They've now written to me asking me to repay the £400 I owe. Am I legally obliged to repay it?	Yes
245	I've an ongoing dispute with my employer for over a year now. We've been going back and forth through the state Labor Commission over wages and unpaid overtime. Thus far we haven't reached a resolution.  Recently, my boss handed me a memo that detailed a bunch of new policies about when to clock in, clock out, overtime, etc and asked that I sign the memo. I declined considering that a lot of what was in the memo didn't make sense and my boss wasn't able to clarify.  Payday has come and gone without my paycheck being deposited. Obviously this is a problem but what do I actually *do* about it? I have bills that need to be paid and I don't have the money to do that because my wages haven't been deposited.	Yes
246	(Throwaway for obvious reasons) I wor for a small business outside of Philly in PA, USA. My boss has an unsecured computer that both employees and customers are left alone with on a regular basis. He has never given us any instruction on what we can and cannot access on said computer. I was dicking around and I found that they keep massive caches of customer and employee information on the computer, with no password protection or anything. I found email lists with names and emails of all the customers; vet records for the dogs (it's a doggy daycare); email and phone number lists for all current and former employees, and a copy of each current employee's w-2, which list our social security numbers.   Can I pursue legal actions? And if so, what will probably happen?  They also have old texts and Facebook posts from employees screenshotted on the computer, but that seems like less of a legal issue and more of an ethical one.	Yes
247	"I’m moving for a job. My future employer has given me a set amount for relocation reimbursement, but I need to submit receipts. Per my contract, I will have to do a partial payback to my current employer (didn’t stay the specified time). Ideally it would be nice to use some of the moving stipend to pay off my current employer.   Here are my questions:  1.	Can I set up an LLC moving company and hire my own company to move me? And then submit the invoice? I would rent a moving truck and then use family/friends help. 2.	What is the legality of this? If I can’t set it up under my name, can a family member set it up for me?  If it’s legal:  1.	How difficult would this be to do? Could I use Legalzoom or something similar to set up the LLC? Would there be any other costs? 2.	How hard would this make taxes? 3.	Is it worth it?  Thanks for your help. Throwaway account for obvious reasons."	Yes
248	State: Arkansas  I work as a pizza delivery driver, and I work the late shift, which consists of me being at work 5pm to 12-2am. When I'm finished I go through the clock out process with the night manager which is one of two people, and I sign the sheet that has my miles, tips, and hours for the day on it. The past two days I've noticed is been clocked out significantly early, how do I approach this legally? One of the closing drivers told the same thing is happening for him.	Yes
249	Hey guys,  I've been serving at a restaurant for a little over 4-5 months. A few weeks ago I was appearing on the schedule less often, and recently, the schedule was sent out and I wasn't on it at ALL. I hadn't been informed of anything, or talked to by anyone about this happening, but since there has been some tension at work regarding myself and other employees, I wondered if I had gotten fired.   So, naturally, I brought it up in the group chat that our coworkers and managers use to communicate with each other, asking if I was fired. My manager texted me, saying they *needed to investigate something regarding my past behavior, and before they got any conclusion I was suspended.* I asked him *what past behavior*, he said he *didn't know, and needed to talk to a few people first.* Furthermore, *there was no conclusion, and they may never get a solid conclusion.* So I asked him *why am I being suspended if he doesn't know what he's suspending me for*, he responded saying *you should ask yourself what happened, that (I) had said something to a coworker about something which was against the interest and honesty of the restaurant, there was no conclusion, and he was going to talk to a few people then talk to me.*  I was so confused, I know that there is no law requirement saying you have to tell someone why you're firing them, but he didn't say I was fired, he said I was suspended.   It has been over 2 weeks since he told me this, and has still not gotten back to me, nor has he put me on the schedule as I'm still part of the chat and see it every week.   Is there anything I can do?	Yes
250	So, long story short: my child was admitted to the hospital I work for. Their lab value ranges in their EMR were set to adult values, so my kid was discharged without treatment. I took her to a different hospital when symptoms didn't resolve and her pediatrician (employer) acted as though we were exaggerating the pain.  New doctor points out her lab values were very off. Turns out kid has bone infection and will likely need many future surgeries since the bacteria ate away some of a growth plate.  New doctor's opinion is this would've been avoided if initial lab values were addressed. Also that if my wife and I had listened to the original doctors, my kid would be legless or crippled.  So I'm in a rough position. I don't want to lose my job, but I am facing many days off work, many long trips to specialist, likely future surgeries, and a whopper of medical bills from both hospital stays. Not to mention the suffering of my kid, 5 (so far) days of being hospitalized, one surgery, and future pain from this.  If I would sue, can they terminate me?	Yes
251	I was hired as a full time worker, receiving benefits such as PTO, vacation, and holiday pay. When i was hired i was working 32 hours a week (which is considered full time to the corporation). about 6-7 months ago my manager cut a day of work and my hours fell under 30 hours, but i still accumulated benefits and maintained full time status. I have always been available to work 30+ hours but the former manager scheduled me less. Now there is a change in management that noticed this, we worked out a schedule where i went back to working 30+ hours (i have this conversation recorded on my phone). Corporate HR rejected the idea of me working those hours and changed my status to part time, took away my benefits and are asking me to pay back the benefits i had accumulated (holiday pay, PTO , vacation) on full time status, totaling to over $1700. I came into work when i was told to come in, and no one mentioned anything to me about loss of benefits or meeting 30 hours in the last 6 - 7 months. i get paid biweekly so thats at least 12 pay periods that this went unnoticed and was never notified to me. Now they want me to pay them back because i worked under 30 hours at the request of my former manager, even though i was available to work 30 + hours. if it means anything, the former manager has left the company and moved to the other side of the country from us.	Yes
252	Just like it says in the title, I'm paid $27,040 salary plus a tiered commission based on my sales. My employer claims he doesnt have to pay OT and expects me to work late to meet with clients and also has me work 8 hours overtime every other week for marketing events outside of work.   Obviously its time to find a new job but my question is, is he correct? I can't find anything concrete through google.	Yes
253	Weird situation but this is where I'm turning. I am in sales and share a territory with another individual. My colleague has had issues adapting to the workload and was written up for performance.   Here's where my issue starts. They have ties to a higher up in my company. They were able to work something out where she was not to come Into the office, but rather look for a new position outside the company. In the mean time their side if the territory was left without support and those who needed her support reached out to me. It just so happened thay while they were out looking for a new job, her territory landed some big deals and netted her with a commission check that doubles my own. But I supported the territory and picked up the slack for them while they were gone. This went on for 2 months.   They were unable to find a job and are now being allowed to return to work where they are to simply try again. Conveniently when quarterly commission gets paid out. I'm a loss for what to do here because I feel quite used by my company. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
254	Mainly referring to working in assistive living (nursing homes) but I guess this could apply to any employer.  I recently acquired a med-tech certification and they gave me a hard time about receiving a copy because they were afraid I would take it and apply to jobs elsewhere.  I'm pretty sure I never signed any kind of contract to complete the training and the management at my facility keeps trying to refuse giving copies of licenses to employees but I don't think they can legally do this.	Yes
255	"I am male, and I recently had several job interviews at a company that is ""WBE certified"" and several of the questions were in line with the one above.  ""If a female co-worker was promoted ahead of you, how would that make you feel?""  ""Can you work in an office where most of your co-workers are female?""  I didn't get the job, and I kinda feel like I'm lucky since so much concern was front-loaded about gender. But I felt like most of these questions about gender were invalid in the least. For example, I see no reason why gender has to play any role in being a good manager.  Anyway, did these questions cross a line?"	Yes
256	So, I work at a small oil and gas company in Oklahoma who has just recently award people non voting incentive units as a part of our compensation. ( but only after it vests in a few years and only if we make money after the equity partners get their money back as well) Obviously they have recommended consulting a tax advisor but as I understand it, we become members in the LLC. We have been given 30 days to file a tax election with the IRS. Various pdfs indicate this can impact my w2 status but not sure if that is true. Advice? Who to contact for advice?	Yes
257	Feeling torn about this and just looking for perspective. I work at a private hospital. On our internal email server (no external communications outside of the building), a department head's secretary (by way of the CEO it turns out) forwarded an email, explaining that the hospital held a position against the ACA and encouraged staff to contact their legislators in support of repeal. The email also request that once the employee contacted their representative(s), they should respond to the email so that the CEO could have a record of support for stats. Surely this isn't legal? It's one thing to encourage staff to contact legislators WITH THEIR OWN OPINION. It's a whole other issue when there is a possibility of discrimination based on participation. Just looking for thoughts.	Yes
258	Hello - I am a IT consultant whose business is formed as an LLC in Delaware. I was providing services to a company in NY who further subcontracted me out to a company in NJ.  My question is related to employment at will and deception.   I previously was consulting through my company with a law firm in NYC. I was not challenged enough so I made the decision to move on. The problem is that my decision was based on this new company telling me they had lots of work that would keep me challenged  and that has now turned out to be false.  I signed up to do one thing with the company and after I had started, they completely changed the scope of the project on me and I was doing something I didn't sign up for. Additionally, they told me they just needed me to do this thing first (which I did) and then they would get me going on what actually signed up to do.  That didn't happen, the project ended and I am now sitting here without a job, where as had I known what I was actually walking into, I wouldn't have the made the decision I made and could have still been working where I was or someplace else.   What options do I have here?  I do have sufficient documentation showing what I signed up for.   TLDR: Employment at will I made the decision to leave a company based on false information the new company provided. Project scope and length were completely fabricated. Had I known what I was actually walking into I wouldn't have made the decision I did and I would have still been employed.	Yes
259	"throwaway account. Apologies for the length.  **tldr:** I am being forced to work again with an HR person who, in the past, refused to do his job and put my physical safety at risk. How do I protect myself this time with documentation in case I need to go to a lawyer? Are there other resources for disabled people?   I work for the Federal government, and my agency is headquartered in Washington, DC.  According to the agency's internal website, we have a Disability Office whose role is to help disabled employees determine reasonable work accommodations with their managers.    **PAST EXPERIENCE:** A few years ago, I was injured and needed ""reasonable work accommodations"" to enter and leave my office building, because it was not wheelchair accessible.  Of the Disability Office, Mr.X, wrote me *in writing* that the office's role was *not* to assist disabled employees and Managers, but to file paperwork for OPM.  My manager and I stopped working with this office and tried to figure this out on our own.  At the time, I was in too much physical pain and not in Washington, DC, so I wasn't able to figure out how to escalate this.   **PRESENT EXPERIENCE:** Fast forward to the present, I have another medical issue requiring ""reasonable work accommodations.""  Against my desire, I was forwarded to the same Disability Office. And then was told I was assigned to work again with Mr. X.  I emailed his Manager and requested a transfer, sharing his prior communication. The Manager disregarded my request, stating the office now cares about customer service, and Mr X is timely with his reports.  Subsequently, Mr. X emailed me, claiming to be ""delighted"" to meet and work with me, and asked me to fill out more forms.    I am distraught that I will again waste precious time and resources to work with Mr. X when I need to focus on my health. But this time, I'm now back in Washington, DC, and would like to be prepared to bring this to a lawyer, if needed.     How shall I best document my interaction with Mr. X, especially if this needs to be taken to a lawyer?  In my reply back, should I acknowledge the past communication? I don't want to lie, and claim I look forward to working with him, because then they could claim that I was satisfied with his prior help.... does this make sense?  Also, are there other groups that help disabled people receive ADA services? Lastly, do you think I have any recourse for the Disability Office's and Mr. X's past refusal of service?"	Yes
260	Hey all.  Today I had an interview to volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters in Kansas. The questions were super invasive and made me very uncomfortable. For example:  -Have you ever questioned your sexuality? -With what sexuality do you identify? Are you sexually active/do you do anything to satisfy your sexual needs? -Why did you and your ex-boyfriend break up? (after asking if I've ever been in a serious relationship.) -In what ways was your ex-boyfriend physically abusive? -Do you take medication for anxiety or depression? -Do you currently or have you ever seen a counselor, psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist? -Have you ever had thoughts of suicide? -What was your suicide plan?  I understand some of these questions are for the safety of the children, but don't questions have to be relevant to the position? Doesn't this violate discrimination or disability laws?  Any answers are appreciated. Thanks everyone.	Yes
261	Like the title says, four years ago I was involved a workplace accident that left metal shards in my chest. I had followed all company protocol and they paid for the surgery to have the metal removed. The surgeon said everything was removed and the surgery went well.  Fast forward four years and I have a chest x-ray for some breathing related issues and guess what, the doctor missed one of the shards. What are my options here? Truly, I just want the metal piece removed, I don't think suing them would be a good idea, but I could be wrong. I was laid off from that job 2 years ago, can I get them to pay for surgery to remove the remaining shard?  Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
262	Okay so this is a UK based company. I just received a P45 letter stating that my last day of work was at the start of April. I'm on 0 hours so I usually only work the summer holidays and Christmas. I will now be free to work often but due to an abundance of staff I will remain on 0 hours. However I worked in May and received my pay fine, the letter does state my last payment which I received last month. I am covering shifts this month and I am due to work very shortly so I'm unsure how I have somehow 'left'. I'm concerned that I now won't get paid for the shifts coming up but it's odd how it states I left in April but then mentions my June pay which came from May. As it's a weekend I can't get hold of anyone and I'm unsure what to do. Can a large employer remove you without notice?	Yes
263	I recently quit a debt collection company.  When I was hired roughly 6 months ago they made me sign an employment contract for 1 year with the term that if my employment ceased before the terms of the contract that i would owe the company an amount of money that would diminish over the course of the contract. I just got my final paycheck and it has a letter saying that I still owe them an amount to buy-out my contract and gives the remaining amount due.   The letter also says that authorized per the employment agreement and allowed by federal and state laws, that they reduced my pay for the final 2 paychecks to minimum wage and applied to the amount I owed (they sent both of my final pay periods on once check for some reason or another)  I was wondering what I should do next and if this contract itself has any legal weight. I asked when signing the contract and upon leaving if I could see or get a copy of the contract and I was denied.  So as to the specifics of the contract I'm not really sure what it says. I also know that employers can garnish your wages but I though they had to notify you and go through the legal process first.  I live in the state of Nebraska  (This is my first post so please be gentle)	Yes
264	My 50's mother in currently in a temp (6 month full-time I think) position and a permanent position opened in the vacancy of her coworker, same job just permanent.  She was told not to apply because it would interfere with her position possibly going permanent. Within a week of that, the application on the other position closed and she was also told her job was not being changed to permanent. They were going to close her temp and open an identical perm job in her slot that doesn't have a new application period but is pulling from the list of candidates from the job she was told not to apply for. She was told afterward that they were specifically looking for someone 'energetic and outgoing' in both positions. Given the fact that she was told she might be changed over, and was told she wasn't right after application closed, it is really fishy. Is this a defendable age discrimination case?	Yes
265	"As a preface to this story I drive a truck for the nation's largest retailer and they pay me very good (six figures good).   I was on my off day and took an out of town trip with my wife and kids in the family minivan. We started to approach the small town of Uniontown AL and I was immediately pulled over by a police officer (he passed me going the opposite direction then proceeded to do a unturn to get behind me). I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam.   I know the obvious answer is to ""lawyer up"" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well?   And to revisit my beginning statement where I drive truck for the nation's largest retailer... They will not tolerate a serious violation on my mvr. So I'm possibly facing a $100,000/yr job loss. Who knows, they might be understanding and give me a slap on the wrist but either way I'm scared!   Where do I go from here?"	Yes
266	I'm employed for 8 hours a day, but spend half of those hours working from home. The employee who has replaced me for my leave just informed me that she quit due to a reduction in hours. They've made it so that all work is done in the 4 hours, essentially making her a part-time staffer. I'm concerned that I'll be returning to either a part-time job (with no benefits I will have no reason to stay) or a different position that requires me to be onsite for 8 hours (there will be NO way to get daycare this close to my return-date and would not be worth the pay/hours away from home even if I could afford care). Is this simply unethical? Or illegal? Yay for being a new mom and having this new stress added to my leave!	Yes
267	Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if any more information is needed.  Thanks in advance!	Yes
268	"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_mealperiods.htm For reference.  The law, as I interpret it: If I don't get a lunch within the 1st 5 hours of work, they need to pay me an extra hour's worth of pay. So if I get to work at 6 AM, work until 1 PM, get a 30 minute lunch then, then keep working till 5:30, they need to pay(All numbers pre-tax):  1) 6 AM to 1 PM - 7 hours of straight pay. Say $20/hour for a total of $140   2) Nothing from 1 PM to 1:30 PM - Unpaid lunch   3) 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM - 1 hour of straight pay. Another $20/hour, total of $20   4) 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM - 3 hours of overtime @$30/hour  - Total of $90   5) Since I didn't get my lunch at the correct hour, one more hour of pay at regular time - $20    I learned about point 5 recently, and did the math - it ties out to within the dollar on pre-tax amounts if 1-4 are included, but 5 is nowhere to be seen. Am I correct in thinking that they're missing that pay?  Additional details, since so much about labor law is in the details:  1) I work for a bank   2) I'm salary non-exempt   3) I'm in an operations position   4) I don't oversee anyone   5) I'm not in the entertainment industry     Standard: If correct, the usual advice seems to be ""Go file a complaint with the labor board, be prepared for retaliation."" My current plan is this: I have a mentor who's midway up the food chain without a dog in the fight. I'd like to give the company a chance to fix it themselves. I figure I can talk with him, see if he can get a review of pay going, and hopefully everything will be fixed without needing to go to the labor board. Else, off to the labor board I go, most likely.   Is anything wrong about my reasoning? Have I made any fatal mistakes anywhere? Is my interpretation of the law incorrect? (The law in question I'm looking at is also on the break room board)  Thank you!"	Yes
269	Have a legal issue i need to research (this is not related to me, but a project I have) and since i have not yet studied worker's compensation i would like some advice how to begin my research (I have access to Westlaw and Lexis)  A client was receiving worker's compensation, and died in 2010.  The settlement in his case was around $75,000.  The worker's compensation carrier asserted a lien with the client's law firm for $220,000.    Does the client's firm have to honor that lien, will the firm be liable, or will the client's estate be liable.    How would the lien holder try to enforce the lien?  Rather than giving me a straight answer, i would like only advice how to begin the research (ie key words, maybe the applicable statute, etc)  This is a learning experience for me so i do not want the answer handed to me.	Yes
270	"Looking for advice on pursuing a freelance scammer. My close friend was just ""scammed"" out of 50 hours of digital work that was agreed to be paid after completion.   Payment was per hour ($100.00) which the client agreed to multiple times through email. There are emails even letting the client know how many hours have gone by and if they wish to continue, in which the client replied that they wish to continue the process.   The job has been completed and now the client is arguing that it took too much time and they are not paying the amount they owe.   Is there anything my friend can do in order to receive payment? Is suing an option?  Thank you for the help in advance."	Yes
271	So, I'm probably about to take a position as a server and wanted to know how paying child and tips works. I know I can expect normal garnishment from my check, but I want to be able to get ahead and put a good dent in my back owed.	Yes
272	"My employer is cracking down on bathroom breaks and is starting to insist we only use the bathroom during scheduled breaks and lunches, unless we request a job accommodation via the Americans with Disabilities Act. ""No exceptions."" The company, or at least this branch of it, has been making some shady policy changes recently that rides a grey area where ethics and legality aren't clear. So this isn't just about me, but an entire work force as well.  -  Illinois has no laws requiring employers to provide breaks other than meal periods. I believe OSHA has some requirements for bathroom breaks but I haven't found clear wording on that, or whether it differentiates bathroom breaks from rest breaks. I don't think it would. The company gives us two 15 minute breaks during an 8 hour shift and a one hour meal period.  -  This is a desk job where we spend all day talking on the phone.   -  I have been told that I go to the bathroom too often and I either need to hold it or get a job accommodation through ADA, which if approved would mean clocking out to take bathroom breaks when they aren't scheduled. Other people are getting the same talk, some of whom have medical conditions that make them have to go more frequently (UTI, diabetes, Crohn's, etc.). Some have suffered medical issues from holding it. I will withhold my personal situation.  - My questions, and questions on behalf of others are:  1. Would this be considered an ADA job accommodation if it's forcing the disability to be handled off of company time?   2. Would clocking out like this have any relevance to the Equal Pay Act if it's forcing the person with a disability to make less than an equally qualified employee without the disability? I don't know if it only takes into account actual time doing work activity, but that goes back to unclear bathroom break regulations.  3. Instead of ADA, would FMLA be an alternative? Seems like either is rather extreme for needing to relieve oneself, but here we are.  4. What about otherwise healthy people that need to use the bathroom and can't wait for the next break? Drank too much water/coffee, diarrhea, or other non-disability-related waste disposal need?  5. Relating to the previous item, is this a reasonable policy when some conditions necessitating frequent bathroom breaks clear up in less time than it takes to get an ADA request approved in this company (around 30 days last I heard)?  6. What does OSHA or other labor laws say about employee rights to bathroom breaks?  -  Any input that can be provided is welcomed. I have no preconceived notions about the answers to any of these questions. Any sources I can be linked to to get a better understanding would be great--whether it's for or against any of the items listed--if it's convenient for you.   - Thank you for your time."	Yes
273	"Repost because nobody responded, I could really use some help.  I am currently a student working at a camp, and am in Canada. So we had a training week, in which we worked 35 hours total.   Under the contract, we are to be paid ""A weekly amount $480 will be paid for employment-- not to exceed 40 hours per week."" They said that because we worked 35 hours during training, they can deduct 5 hours of pay. But I interperted that as no matter how much we work, 1hr,10 hr, we get paid 480 a week.   They replied stating another line in the contract: ""Pay will be deducted for days of work missed, for whatever reason, and calculation of said pay will be on a pro rata basis.""   If that was their argument, I was calling bullshit (figuratively) because no day of work was missed, and that line states that you can deduct 96 for every day of work missed (Pro rata).   Can an lawyer be able to confirm that I am under just grounds?"	Yes
274	I was laid off in mid June, and I'm curious about several things, including my annual reviews (I was laid off at the same time that our managers were supposed to go over reviews with us) as well as anything related to why I was laid off.  I sent my company a request based off of [Oregon Revised Statute 652.750](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2016orLaw0115.pdf), but they only sent me my non-compete and a secrecy agreement that I had signed.  I'm not sure what to expect.  I don't know what my personnel files consists of, but I want to make sure I get everything I can (including ones I'm unaware that exist, if that makes sense.)  How can I make sure they give me everything that I have rightful access to?  Thanks!	Yes
275	thats as basic as i could put it and can elaborate more if anyone has questions about my actual work situation or if i was not specific enough. any advice either negative or positive i feel can help me understand.	Yes
276	Recently (a month) I accepted a job that I am very unhappy at and know will not work out for me in the long run. I am an at will employee and both the offer letter and the employee handbook mentions that management requires 14 days notice in case of quitting. Now would i be in any legal trouble if I quit immediately?	Yes
277	I recently switched jobs but when I received my last paycheck none of my vacation hours were on it. I assumed, since I've always been paid for my vacation time when I leave a job, that they were supposed to pay for the vacation time I earned. After searching google I found some sites saying that I'm owed and others that says it's up to the company. Does anyone know what the laws are about these things? This happened in Arkansas if that's relevant.	Yes
278	I don't want to give any serious details out, but my direct boss has falsely claimed that I have asked him out/ asked for his number and made advances towards him at work. None of these things are true.  Nothing serious has come of it, but is there any action I should take? This is just a shitty part time job but I don't want to get fucked over.   I only heard this from a co worker. It happened when my boss, another manager, and a few co workers went out for drinks, and I don't think anyone believed him.   Do I file with HR w/o proof? I don't even have an actual HR department, just a phone number. I just don't want to get into trouble for something I didn't do.	Yes
279	"I noticed a plummet in sales for this startup company I was interning at. About a month later, my now-former boss fired me (this Monday) with his reason being that I was the reason he experience a net loss when it comes to packaging. However, this is strongly false, as I have suggested many times prior to packaging loss to try better methods of tracking inventory, yet he consistently said he wants to try to make his method work. I told him this, and I also told him that he has been experiencing packaging losses even before I started interning there. He ignored my counters, but answered my question of getting paid by the end of this week. He said ""of course"" I will be. Friday came and I did not receive any notice of payment, so I sent him an email and he has not responded yet. I should have been paid by today, but he has delayed it. Not only am I out of a job (which I am now in the risk of being homeless because my fiancé and I have planned on using our proof of income for our application), but he has not paid me yet.  I should mention that he has talked about renewing my internship contract and extending it until August (it was from Jan to May), but he has never done so.  In the old contract, it said he could terminate me at any time for any reason. However, I wasn't under a contract from May to now.  What can I do?"	Yes
280	"I deposited a paycheck last Tuesday (6/4) and ~$300 was deposited and the remainder was pending. The next day I went to buy gas and was denied, I checked my account and I was in the negative. My bank statement said the deposit was on hold and details would be mailed to me physically. I called my bank and they told me the other bank would not verify the transaction even after several attempts. Then after pushing them further they stated that they had confidential information about my employer's account and couldn't tell me anything, but that there was a very high chance that the deposit would be returned unpaid. I called my employer and they informed me that my bank has my funds and that I need to ""tell them to release the funds from the hold"". That sounds like it wont work and I am not sure who is telling the truth. I really need the money, I was not able to pay my bills on time this month and only have ~$200 in my account. Any help is greatly appreciated."	Yes
281	"So I went into work this morning and put my personal items (including credit card, money, and apartment keys) in the lockers my job provides. They're new and electronic (you enter a code). However, no one told me that the lockers sometimes malfunction and do not open. The tech part of the company was not available for work THIS WHOLE WEEK, and--surprise--my locker ""broke."" Without my keys, I was locked out of my apartment with no money or ID. So, I broke open the locker.  Boss calls. Says I need to pay for the locker. Is this right?"	Yes
282	"Hey, guys.   I live in Newport Beach, CA.   My situation is complex and I will try to explain it to the best of my ability. I was employed by a family owned pizza place in Newport Beach, CA. The business had three locations. As a delivery boy, I would drive pizzas to the person who placed the order and received the money to pay for the pizza along with a cash tip. I would pocket this. If the pizza was paid for through a credit card, I would obtain a signature from the customer. If the customer chose to give me a tip, it was available for them to tip above the signature on the receipt. I was cashed out in full at the end of the night.   This is not problematic.   This is what is problematic.   I never received any cash tips from inside the restaurant (there was a tip jar) and never received any credit tips that were left on a receipt. I have filed a wage claim form, gone through a preliminary conference, and now I am scheduled for a hearing. My ex-boss is claiming the following:   ALL THREE LOCATIONS EARNED $220 IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD OR $440 IN A MONTH     This would mean each store earned around $15 a day just in tips. (keep in mind we are in Newport Beach, CA, there is no way the stores made that little per day).    I almost know for a certainty that the locations earned way more than this amount. How can I make sure he is telling the truth? How can I refute this?   He is also claiming this:   BECAUSE (my name) WAS A DRIVER, (my name) WAS NOT ENTITLED TO IN-STORE TIPS. ONLY SERVERS WERE ENTITLED TO SAID TIPS.   1. My ex-boss never distributed tips to any other employees, if he did, the amount was always $20 and was allocated every month, not every two weeks. From co-workers, I have heard that they claimed to never have been tipped out and never have received any kind of tips (these are the people working as cashiers)   2. On a busy night, as a driver, I would take at most 6 or 7 deliveries that averaged 2 hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes of driving time and delivery of pizzas. Keep in mind this was only on an extremely busy night. Usually, more often than not, I would take 3 to 4 deliveries which would average at about 1 hour to about 1 hour and 20 minutes. My shifts were 4-5 hours long. During the times I was not driving, I was serving guests alongside the cashiers. I would take phone orders, place orders in person, interact with guests, take food to tables, clear tables, clean the restaurant, bathrooms, do dishes, etc etc etc (My point is that I served many many people and my ex-boss is claiming that because my position was a ""driver"" that I was not entitled to any form of tips)   How can I prove that I served food and his logic is flawed and not factual?   I have most if not all of my pay stubs and I have all my W-2s.   Please please please please help.  If more information is needed I will provide whatever....."	Yes
283	Thanks in advance. I am posting for my girlfriend who recently got put into this position. She has a chronic pain issue that makes her unable to work a few days a month. She applied for FMLA with her employer but was 30 days too early so she was ineligible by the date, otherwise she would have qualified and been approved.  Her employer's reaction to learning this was to force her to move positions and take a roughly 12% pay cut as well. It seems as if this was a direct reaction to learning that she would be able to protect her position and pay rate in 30 days when she will be eligible. Anything that can be done?	Yes
284	I'm working with a company on an eCommerce site as general help (customer service, manufacturer communication, photos, etc.).   It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out.   Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor.   The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily.   I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.  Any resources or thoughts are greatly helpful!   States involved include CO and DC.	Yes
285	TL;DR My SO sometimes only gets 3 to 4 hours of sleep in between shifts. Is there any requirement for adequate time between shifts?    My girlfriend normally works a shift from 7am to 3pm. However they sometimes are needed to work mandatory overtime from 7pm to anywhere as late as 2 to 3am. Considering a modest commute of 20 minutes and night / morning routine, she ends up only getting maybe 3 hours of sleep some nights. It's also worrying because she has to drive a vehicle for work and might be too groggy to be on the road.     Are there any rules for giving time in between shifts? I researched briefly and only read something about 24 hour maximum working. She works for the county government so I assume they aren't doing any shady business but thought I should ask anyways.	Yes
286	My wife is a part time teacher and part time server at a very popular restaurant in our area.  In June of 2017 she had a radial fracture after slipping on a floor area in the restaurant that should of had a mat on it.  She was put in a cast and placed and granted workers compensation shortly thereafter.  She remained until workers comp until October when was cleared and requested to return to work.  For a ballpark figure she typically earned 2-300$ a weekend day.  Hostessing is 12$ an hour.     Since returning to work she barely gets a shift a week, mostly hostessing which is hourly as opposed to tips.  She would typically work weekends.  This month she has not been scheduled at all.  We feel that since her injury she's been slowly phased out and now is unofficially fired for an injury due to the owners negligence.  Any advice appreciated.  Thank you	Yes
287	"So, bare with me as I write this! My girlfriend has a degree in Film/Communications and roughly about a year n half ago one of her old professors came to her asking if she'd like to help edit a local man's film. She met with the man and all the material was shit, she agreed to try and edit and make it salvageable. She was able to finish it and he was able to air it a local arts theater about 8 months ago. The original agreement was for them to pay her ($250) on the spot at the airing, well that never happened. The man and his family started making excuses about how they wanted some stuff changed before paying her. At this point she was already frustrated, but agreed to help out. Well several months go by of her trying to meet with them and more excuses or them canceling on her. The last meeting consisted of her and his parents, where they basically tried to tell her they weren't paying her anything until they were 100% satisfied with the material and they were expecting her to hand over what she had, so at that point I refused to let her hand anything over until they paid what they owed. After that meeting and one more failed attempt to meet with her they just went silent and at this point she just basically wrote it off as a loss instead of trying to go out of her way to pursue it. Well it's been about 5 or 6 months since and now suddenly he decided to text her telling her how he'd making a new movie and how he wants to pay her. Well she works  50 hour weeks and doesn't have the time to meet and really doesn't even want to meet in person, so she responded letting him know she' doesn't have the time, but would be more than willing for him to send her a payment or a check in the mail and then she would send him the Flash drive with all the data and movie. Suddenly he went from ""hey Sam"" to ""I'll just take to court Sam. I don't do my business like that and that's that.""   Sorry for the long winded paragraph, but basically I'd like to know what kind of legal actions we should take and what to do from here. We're right on the border of Michigan and Ohio and if we were to go to court it would be probably be Ohio if that helps any!"	Yes
288	"Basically, I work as a software developer for a company in NY. Here for almost a year. Today, the company both rolled out a new employee handbook, referred to as the ""culture code"" and the ""employee innovation and proprietary information agreement""  This agreement appears to be a mashup of a non-disclosure and non-compete, but being a developer - I am really concerned with this. Apparently, even if fired/quit - any invention I made is to be considered theirs for 6 months after employment.   Whatever - so to ""continue employment"" I must sign and agree to whatever stipulations are placed in both the handbook and the ""invention"" agreement. If I refuse, I assume to be terminated.  I'm okay with this. However, would I qualify for collect unemployment? Per [NYS Title 7 - 593 - Disqualifications](https://www.labor.ny.gov/ui/dande/titles/title7.shtm#593) - I don't see any specific case of which this could apply to.  Basically, I would not be terminated either (a) voluntarily or (b) for misconduct. The first devils advocate thought that comes to mind is ""well you voluntarily are not signing the document they set forth to you"" - but on that note - assume the document wanted agreement to ""selling soul of first born child."" In other words, how can I be expected to sign simply whatever they say?"	Yes
289	In TX tipped minimum wage is 2.13. The regular min wage is 7.25, which is supposed to be made up in tips. I'm not making the regular minimum through tips, so when is my employer supposed to pay the difference? On my biweekly paycheck? At the end of the year? Ever? I can't find this info anywhere!!! Thanks in advance for all help.	Yes
290	He was pulled aside after a shift and accused of theft. The LP guy said he had video evidence, fingerprints, and if he admitted it he'd let him keep his job. He then took his phone and wouldn't give it back until my friend went to the carrier to have them print out a receipt as proof of ownership. The LP guy then called the carrier store to speak to that employee to confirm that my friend had in fact walked in. After that, he said he was still lying because he must be friends with the employee at the carrier store.   He then said if he gave up whoever stole it he'd be rewarded with a check. Said his boss was on vacation so he'd like to wrap this case up before he arrived. He also banned my friend from using his phone and that if he was ever caught he'd personally escort him out and have his job.   Apparently to even take your phone in the trucks it has to be registered and a sticker is placed on the back. My friends sticker faded so it didn't have the info the LP guy wanted. However, when they checked the records of the registered phones her serial number, the IMEI, and all the information added up. The LP agent then accused my friend of making a counterfeit sticker to put on it so he could steal phones.   What can he do? If you guys have any more questions I'd be happy to provide more information. This is the gist of what has happened.	Yes
291	Alright so I've tried googling this but have no guts on my specific situation.  I'm a server and the owner has 3 more restaurants all within a block, so we swap and take things we need from the other 3 if we ever run out of anything. Occasionally we will run out of a certain liquor and they will typically send a server to go grab an unopened bottle and bring it back to the restaurant they work at. Is it legal to walk it if you're under 21 since it is for business and you're on the clock?	Yes
292	Hello, I recently quit my job at Papa Johns due to constant understaffing and extreme stress. I know they are obligated to pay me my hours worked, but I still have not received my check in the mail. Are companies required to send it in the mail, or is there a chance I will need to go pick it up? I haven't returned the uniform yet, but they can't withhold my check for that, can they? Any advice is appreciated.	Yes
293	Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley [United Sates] tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if you need further information.  Thanks in advance!	Yes
294	"Sorry this is a second post.  This is a separate issue.  I work at a corporately owned restaurant as a bartender-and there is a lot of shady practices.  Right now they are attempting to get me to quit/ fire me and I need to know what my rights are and if I am in a position to file for unemployment insurance in Ontario- and how to go about it.  Here's the run down:  *  I've been asked to resign in writing by the GM- they've threatened to fire me if I do not. * There is a lot of pressure to resign and the GM is angry when I do not * I did not resign, but I have been outright removed from next weeks schedule (they expected me to resign) prior to my refusal  * This is the second time I've been removed from the schedule- in November for 2 weeks I was given zero hours AND name was removed from the schedule- complained and was given hours * Have been asked multiple times if ""I am happy here"" and ""why haven't you resigned""  or they don't ""understand why I keep working here"" * Was provided with 3 writes up immediately following refusal to resign: I did have a bad week last week, however was not informed in writing or verbally reprimanded for anything after it happened. * Have not been provided with an opportunity or plan to fix any issues in the write ups.      I feel a strong pressure to leave, and clearly am a person non grata at the business- I know they want want me leave, yet don't seem to want to fire me and am attempting to force me to resign.    Where does this leave me?  Can I do anything via the Ministry of Labour?  Am I in a position to collect unemployment insurance while I find a new job?  Advice please?"	Yes
295	Occasionally the safe will be short at work. Last night it was short $100. The GM said that since they have no way of knowing who did it each employee who worked yesterday must hand over $15 or else they will be terminated for theft. Is this legal?    Edit: I am in Arkansas	Yes
296	I was working contract for an oilfield company and resigned from the position. My boss has since been bitter and threatened not to pay me. I quit because he was inconsistent and unreliable with paying me. The time limit for acquiring my checks are 21-28 days after the invoice is created. It's day 28 and he has yet to contact me. What is my next step?	Yes
297	EMT here; I found out my partner is getting about 200/week from a manager at our competitor in exchange for telling everything going on here. She provided a copy of our operations manual and got 500.00 for it; one of our encrypted radios that she reported missing they gave her 1000.00 for. Do I have any responsibility here or is she just an ethics nightmare?  And is corporate espionage just a lousy thing to do, or an actual crime?	Yes
298	Hey, so I'm getting laid off in the state of Pennsylvania. I have a bit of advanced warning, and I know they are going to offer me a shitty contract employee position that pays by the job.  I'm not going to accept that job, and am actively looking for work. It won't pay nearly as well, and involves being out in the field 100%, while my current position only requires occasional field work.   Can I file for unemployment in my state? Or does my rejecting the shitty job disqualify me? I'm pretty surey boss offers everyone he fires a shitty job to avoid paying unemployment to anyone.   It won't affect my decision, but it will help me plan financially.   Thanks!	Yes
299	Hello,  I was terminated from my job on April 24th this year.  I knew my health insurance was good through June 1st in which case I used it.  Since then, I thought my family was uninsured while I wait for benefits from my new job but I've received an updated insurance card from a new insurance company (Aetna switched to United Health Care) and my wife called them and they did, in fact, say that all of my benefits are active.  I have also never received any termination paperwork or COBRA information in the mail to this day.  My question is can I still use these benefits even though I think the company has no idea that they are paying for them?  (They are an extremely unorganized company with nobody looking over financial matters, so I think I may be slipping through the cracks.)	Yes
300	I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.  First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying. I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.  I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.  As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.  Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.  **TL;DR, sick, boss doesn't believe me, what do?**	Yes
301	"I just got ""fired"" (he didn't say I was fired directly and didn't give me a pink slip or any notice like that but told me ""leave my restaurant"") after turning in my written two week notice last Friday. How should I follow up? Can this hurt me if in the future an employer calls for references? I've never been fired and am not sure what to do."	Yes
302	Hello. The company I work for requires a yearly hands-on competency test. This year, they have mandated that if you miss your testing time, and don’t give 24 hour notice, you will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction. Obviously, it is illegal for an employer to deduct wages without approval; however, my employer seems to think they’ve found a way around that. There is an online test that you must take beforehand, in which 100% is required. The very first question is along the lines of, “I agree that if I miss my hands-on test, I will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction”. To me, this sounds as though they are forcing you to agree to a payroll deduction in order for you to stay employed. Is this legal? If not, any advice on how to approach management with my concern? I do not want to agree to this, as I can think of multiple scenarios where I may have to miss my test, and be unable to give 24 hours notice. Thank you for your help.	Yes
303	Hey, y'all. Any employee law information you can give me, either state or federal, as well as any advice on resolving any legal matters as quickly as I possibly can would be greatly appreciated!  So, since I teach during the school year, I have employment over the summer with a summer camp. I signed no contract with my employers after receiving the job offer - only an employment application and information for payroll. I accepted the job on the premise that I would be paid an hourly wage as I did last year for the same job, but I was told after approximately a week of work that I would be paid a flat rate of $450/week.   The new year also came with some new rules for the camp counselors. We cannot leave the campus without permission, and can only leave for 2 hours at night, one-at-a-time between 11PM-1AM. We were also told that we would be getting overtime pay, and if we worked overtime, to log it on the final week of the payroll cycle in which we will only be present on campus for 1 of the 7 days.   On another note, I was offered a better position at this camp initially, and then they took the offer back to give it to another candidate after I had already made living arrangements for the summer. But I'm not sure that I can prove this/it will hold up in court.  * 1. Since I am required to be present unless given permission and am only allowed 2 hours per night off campus with that permission, does this mean that I am on call 24 hours? If so, can I be paid for the hours that I am not necessarily actively doing something since I am essentially required to just be around?  * 2. Is keeping me here for a month with no release okay? How can I get some time away from here if I want to see family or when I have to move my permanent residence in 2 weeks?  * 3. Do I have a case against my employer for not paying overtime and asking us to alter our time sheets even though this was discussed in a private meeting and there is no written record?  * 4. Can the camp be liable for my expenses since they took back a job offer after I made living arrangements? Again, I'm not really sure I can prove this part.  * 5. Who do I report the above issues to, and how long will it feasibly take to get fixed? Is it possible to resolve some of these issues within a couple of weeks or will I be toughing it out until the end of the camp?	Yes
304	Hi /r/legaladvice, throwaway here.  I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options. On my separation agreement, they extended my exercise period from 90 days to 2 years, which made me not buy the shares and wait for an exit or something like that. Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.  Around 10 months after the separation agreement, my options were cancelled, and the CEO said this was because the extension wasn't allowed under the stock option agreement. A few lawyers went through the agreements and said this was BS. Despite this, she (the CEO) tried to make a monetary agreement for a fraction of what the shares are worth for me to give them up.  I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.  Should I try emailing the directors explaining my story, or go straight to a lawyer and send a letter of demand?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
305	I don't think she has a case but now that's she's of more sound mind she's annoyed she was fired because of a hospital visit related to her PTSD.  Basically she was a contract employee for a company when she had an issue that ended up with her in the hospital.  They held her for 4 days but couldn't find a bed for her in a ward better suited for her so eventually released her to my care.  (Ultimately a mistake because she ended up in the hospital again for worse symptoms for a whole two weeks but I digress).    I never contacted her work during those 4 days, I honestly didn't even think of it, I was spending those 4 days sitting in a chair in her hospital room. Upon her release I do contact them and let them know what happened, she still wasn't really in the shape to talk to them but since her job was basically ticket assigning and chat moderation she agreed to go back to work right away since it was simple and done from home at that time anyway. They ask for a picture of her release paper work showing the days spent in the hospital and leave it at that.  I let her know she said she'd handle it, sent them a picture and that was the end of it for a few hours.  A few hours later they contact us saying she sent a picture of the wrong thing, I look and curse myself for not double checking her because in her addled state she did send the wrong thing.  She sent the picture of the paperwork that basically just said they set her up with an appointment with her normal doctor to follow up about the issues with her PTSD and the hospital stay.  I grab her normal paperwork and see that since she transferred hospitals at some point they only had the 2 days at the second hospital listed not the first two.  So we head out to the original hospital and get the paperwork showing all the days she spent.  I'm sitting at the gas station outside our house when we get a call from the contracting company and are told that they have ended her contract and she doesn't have a job anymore.  They do kind of have a history of this.  Two or three months prior to this another coworker of hers who was actually employee there for over 4 years had their contract ended the day after it was revealed she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  I don't think she has much of a case because I don't think contract employees have much at all in the way of rights.  Also they didn't actually know she had PTSD the only thing that told them was the paperwork she accidentally sent them, she never told them herself at any point.  Either way I said I would ask.	Yes
306	So I had just started working at papa johns and on my 4th day or so I had to leave early for a family emergency, they didn't even let me leave early even though I told them I had to drive 2 and a half hours for a family emergency and then my car got stolen when I got to the city I had to go to. The general manager was texting me the whole week prior telling me when to come into work, so I texted her the day my car got stolen letting her know the situation, this was Thursday and my next shift was Saturday. I realize my mistake was not calling after I had not received any texts but at the time I was too stressed to deal with that situation. So upon returning I find out I'm getting fired for a no call no show because she wanted me to call her not text her. What can I do about this? Small claims?	Yes
307	"I truly apologize for the wall of text, I am very frustrated at the moment and more than anything trying to document the situation in a public forum, as well as vent a bit. I do apologize if this is against this subs rules.   I arrived to work at my restaurant today as I always do, clocked in, and moved to the line where food is served, as my job entails ensuring that orders are accurate, prepared on time, and delivered to the appropriate diners.    After working for less than 15 minutes. I was immediately approached by my manager, and asked to step outside with him to have a conversation.   He immediately accused me of being intoxicated, stating that I had been slurring my words. He had not heard anything out of the ordinary, but an un-named source had reported the ""slurring"" to him. He stated the I did not smell of alcohol, nor did I appear drunk, but he was, ""worried something was going on.""     After speaking with him for about 15 minutes, pointing out that I have never had any alcohol on the job (before or during), did not smell of alcohol, and was clearly not drunk. He appeared to agree with me. Moments later, he asked thay I clock out (depriving me of a shift that I desperately need) and leave immediately. Additionally, he mentioned that he would ""let everyone know know that I was simply being sent home because I was ""sick"", as the staff had all already been told I was ""drunk"".   I relieve there may well be no legal recourse here, thought this feels very much like classic defamation, especially considering all of my co-workers were well aware of my manufactured drunkenness.   If there is nothing I can do, then so be it. I guess I will just be the guy who shows up to work drunk, except I don't, and never would.   TL:DR: accused of showing up to work drunk. Was not drunk, at all. Was sent home with no pay. Anything I can do?"	Yes
308	"I work at a state park in Nebraska. I am currently the only one working in a small store. On my off days someone else works so I have 2 days off. My hours have recently been changed to factor in a half hour lunch, and I am currently at a point where I work exactly 40 hours a week. However, my boss told me that I will have to take a ""working lunch."" That essentially means I remain in the building and continue to work through my lunch, but I am not paid for it. My math shows that I am missing out on 2.5 overtime hours every week.  I am currently a part time employee, so they do not want me working over 40 or else the state gets upset. I told a colleague about my situation and he suggested I keep working until I am done for the season, then pursuit legal action. Tonight at the end of my shift I'm going to collect all past pay stubs and keep them organized.   Am I being wronged here? I just want an outsider opinion on the situation."	Yes
309	Not sure if this is the right thread, off sick due to a very personal issue because of stress (no I'm not bluffing it's real), I originally wanted to go back to work however my GP advised me not to. Now I am undertaking therapy and don't think I am ready for work but knowing the nature of my company they will do everything to get me back. What rights do I have? Can a OH Nurse overturn the sick note?	Yes
310	I filed for unemployment on July 4th. I had no hours at all from July 2nd to July 12th. That's basically two weeks of no work and I see no reason this will change. I am in effect unemployed.  I quit my previous job. My concern is that I will be denied unemployment because I quit that job, because when I look at the eligibility verification, it lists only the job I quit, not the job I have now where my hours have been cut to nothing.  I should say what is going on his not due to any misconduct on my part. I have been trying very hard at this job, but nothing I do makes the store manager happy. So she cut me down to no hours for one week, four hours the next, making me basically unemployed. I assume she isn't firing me because she is trying to get out of me possibly getting unemployment.  If anyone has any idea for what recourse I have, I'd appreciate it. I am looking for a new job but it's been slow going.  If I get denied I do plan to appeal, I'm just wondering what my odds are of not getting denied, since I'm filing unemployment for the job where my hours have been cut, not the job I quit. I live in massachusetts.	Yes
311	"So I work for a fast food restaurant (franchised, locally owned) and I have some concerns about what the owner allows for breaks. Here are some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/c40EX) of the state labor law site that say a 10 min break for 4 hours and a 30 min break for 5+ hours. My employer schedules me regularly for 5pm-close shifts (closing is at 10pm) but closing takes an hour or more. Since I am only /scheduled/ for 5 hours, I am given one 15 minute paid break at the 1.5 hour mark or close to then. Should I be getting more?  Also, sometimes I work a 3pm-close shift (8 hours including closing) and get either two 15 min breaks or one 30 min break (either the second break is unpaid or half of the 30 min break is unpaid). Is this legal?  The owner owns two of these places in town, and at the other one all breaks are unpaid and closing takes until at least 11:30pm. Is this bad/worse or is it considered the same?  On a side note, a (17 year old) coworker was recently ""encouraged to quit"" after working there since she was 15 for pointing out the child labor laws (see screenshot album). She would work 5pm-close shifts (more than the 3 hours max for 14-15 year olds and the 4 hours max for 16-17 year olds) on school days and 8 hour shifts on weekends and summers. She also got the same break schedule as the rest of us even though, as a minor, she should be getting more.  Is there anything I can/should do about this? I need this job through mid-September when I start a full-time job with benefits (yay!). Should I wait til then?  Thanks for any help or advice you can give me! I also have some concerns about worker safety and food safety but this post is really long as-is so I just focussed on breaks."	Yes
312	"I've been experiencing some problems at work and my boyfriend suggested I ask this subreddit for help. I'm a lisensed cosmetologist working in a chain salon in New York State (not New York City). There's been rumors for years that my employers do various illegal shit. One of those things was docking our hours. The rumor was that they'd would change our time clocks to remove 30 minutes for a break when no break was given.   In my line of work it's common for hairstylists to not take a real break. When everyone is booked for the day and there's a waiting room full of people, sometimes you just keep working.  Last summer me and some coworkers found what we believe to be proof that our employers were docking our hours. When we were playing around with our new POS, we found a page that said ""Time Card Audits"". This page had entries listing everytime our manager fixed our time clock (we were at the salon at the right time, but the computer was frozen so we couldn't clock in, we accidentally clocked out for break instead of clocking out at the end of the day, etc). It also had entries with my boss' name attached to them where new time in/time outs were recorded - a  30 minute break added to the middle of the day, maybe a second break added later in the day. There were also audits recorded where it looked like my boss would move a certain girls clock in time from 8:45 to 9:00 (we usually weren't scheduled to clock in that early, but we're expected to do so to open up shop). There were nights we had to stay in the shop an hour or two past close because we were so busy, or someone got caught up on a color, and on some of those nights there was evidence that our boss would move our clock out time back to the normal closing time.  The reports spanned about 7 months if I remember correctly, and they suggested I had about 50 cumulative hours removed from my time cards.  I have been under the impression that while it's the law that an hourly worker is ALLOWED a 30 minute break, it's not required for them to take one. I was also under the impression that it's against the law for hourly workers to perform regular duties off the clock, like cut/color hair.  When my coworkers and I discovered this, they wanted to call the labor board. One girl wanted to sue the company. A few days later, when they had time to think about it, they decided against it - they were to afraid to quit/get fired. I decided not to do anything because if I got the company in trouble, my coworkers would have also been blamed (we're fairly sure our employers knew what we were doing).  A few months later my manager announced that our employers decided the new policy was, if you get a chance to eat, even if you are not clocked out for break, you are given a break. This happened one day when we ordered a pizza. I told her I thought this was stupid, shoving a slice of pizza in my face in between haircuts is not a break, and that I was pretty sure that it was against the law. The official policy was never put into place, and my manager assured me that my boss would no longer adjust our time cards.  This was probably a lie, because the other day when one of the girls opened up her time card to clock out, she had been given a break when she had never taken one. When I checked the time card audits, the log had been mostly wiped - a few irrelevant audits from the beginning of the month were all that was left.  Most of the girls I used to work with have left, and I've been looking to quit anyways, so I'm preparing to potentially go to the board with this. I have the reports from the time card audits previously mentioned printed out, as well as the mostly clean ones I found a couple days ago. Is the labor board just going to tell me I should stop wasting their time? At one point a girl I worked with years ago called them about an isolated incedent, and they told her our boss wasn't doing anything wrong, or that at least she wouldn't be able to fight them on it. Should I sue them? I really dislike these people, but I am pretty poor. Should I just quit if im gonna be all butthurt about it and leave it at that?"	Yes
313	So I worked for a pretty big steel fab company, and was terminated because I was arrested (I had a miscarriage and forgot to go to court). Obviously I take responsibility for that. I want to know what to do now. My old boss is going around the town where I live and the town where I work telling everyone I was arrested and quit my job(which I didn't). He's telling bartenders, waitresses, or just talking about me with his friends in public. This is an older executive of the company, and the town is EXTREMELY small to the point where I saw one of the bartenders he told while at shopping and she came up and asked me how I was doing since being arrested. I've had many people come to me and tell me they heard it from him specifically. I believe it's cost me another job with a graphic design company who's president knows him. Is there anything I can do?	Yes
314	For the last 5 months my paycheck have been arriving late. By a week or more.  I have proof that they were later for the past 2 months.  What can I do?  It's hard to make and keep a budget.	Yes
315	Here's the situation: I'm an engineer. I've been working at my present company since May 2014. My wife and I are moving from Canada (Alberta) to England in August. My manager, who is a close friend of mine and knows we're moving, accidentally let it slip to my director yesterday that I was going to be leaving the company. My director called me today and asked me about it, so not wanting to lie, I told him that I would be leaving soon, but made it clear that I would be available to work until August 11th which is a week before the move. 5 minutes later he emailed me and he is now asking for me to submit my 2 weeks written notice by the end of the week, in effect shorting me of 3 weeks of work (and thousands of dollars in pay.) Do I have any options or am I screwed?	Yes
316	Hey Everyone,  First off, I want to say that I believe this would be the best place for this, but if you know of a more relevant subreddit for me to go to please let me know! Also thanks for the help in advance.  Ok, so I'm 20 y/o, in Nebraska.  I'm working and paying my way through college.   I am currently working a part time job in the afternoons 3-4 days a week for a cleaning service, Jane Doe's cleaning service (not the actual name).  I am getting paid hourly wages, every other week by form of a personal check. I have not signed any paperwork or anything like that, nor does she intend to have me sign anything. I keep record of my hours on a sheet of paper essentially. She's a very honest person, not shady at all, I've gotten to know my co-workers and there are no complaints or anything. Everyone is very friendly and have known each other for a while.   She had told me during the interview that I would be paid like I previously described and would have to take out my own taxes and keep record of all that.  What I'm wondering is what I need to do legally for tax purposes since there is no paperwork that I have filled out, and she is paying me by personal check based on an hour sheet that I fill out every day.  Do I need to mark it down as work income, or do I need to mark it down at all??(kidding on that last part)   I'm afraid to spend any of the money I have earned from the job just bc I don't know what I'll end up needing to do with it later on so all help is invited!!!	Yes
317	"Background stories: [part 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/work/comments/6jppv8/noticed_an_employee_acting_very_strange/) [part 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6lrybr/work_reported_an_employee_who_is_making_me/)   I work in an office area in a warehouse. To make it short, I've been experiencing an employee/stalker since June 23rd, 2017 in the workplace. I've noticed a pattern in his behavior of pacing near me and attempting to contact me during my lunch and breaks. He has been confronted by HR that he makes me uncomfortable and to not be around me after I have reported him a second time. I have reported THREE incidents to my HR. She claims she does not know what to do and that he does not 'listen'.  * 1st incident: Reported the first time explaining I am uncomfortable during my lunch and breaks and that I had a feeling an employee was recording me. I had a gut feeling when I saw his phone angled differently, along with his slow pace of walking. HR made the excuse that his eyesight was bad, my manager said the most wrong things like: ""Stand up for yourself and say something,"" joked that there has been 4 marriages in the company, and to try being ""friendly."" * 2nd incident: He attempted to say hi to me and I ignored him. I got up to go to the office and he was behind me, chanting ""you need a physical"" 3 times. I reported it and he was confronted by HR and my manager. They confronted me shortly after and told me that the employee told them he did not attempt to contact me, and that he was chatting with two other people who were around, which is FALSE. He attempts to talk to me when I'm alone. HR and manager told me his lunch and break times will be changed, and that she wanted 'proof' and gave me permission to record. * 3rd incident: Yesterday. Employee passed by, pacing by slowly near the door-less entry of the area that I sit in. I grow extremely uncomfortable and after my break was finished, I went into the office and confronted my HR telling her that I can't focus, and that he is effecting my work. Luckily I caught the incident on my phone and was able to show them the 'evidence' that they wanted, which is ridiculous. During this time, my manager said more stupid shit like ""would you feel comfortable if all 4 of us talked"" and ""have you tried to confront him""? HR asks what I want them to do, and I tell them ""I don't know"" even though the clear answer is I WANT HIM FUCKING GONE! After my first break, I changed the location of where I have my lunch and last break. Near the end of the day, he had the audacity to walk into the office and be near me, talking to a fellow office co-worker. He has never had to step foot into in the office prior to that.  Assuming that the warehouse manager was confronted yesterday and that the employee did not see me in the usual location for my lunch and last break, I'm assuming he had the intent to violate my safe space in the office. I felt so fucking violated and I was trying my best not to visibly show that I was uncomfortable.   In addition to his unacceptable behavior, he has walked out on the job a couple of days ago and came back the next day. He has been late to work multiple times and he is currently on a 3 month work-probation. I don't know why they won't fire him when there's so many things he's getting away with. I'm assuming that the only reason is because the warehouse positions are so hard to fill.   I have not confronted the owner of the company since she is out of town, but I definitely will this upcoming week. What should I do until then, and when she does come back in town, how do I approach this issue? I really like my job and would like to grow my position with this company, but this employee is seriously creating a hostile work environment. It's so ridiculous that my HR and manager wanted 'video evidence' when I reported him a second time. I've spent all my breaks and lunch busy recording on my phone.  edit: sorry for the awful grammer. I am really, really emotionally distressed right now. If anyone wants clarification, I will be happy to provide details. It sucks that this has going on for way too long and that I even worry about work on my days off."	Yes
318	Thank you in advance for your consideration.  I am the only warehouse employee for a company in Illinois. I ship out orders all over the world, mostly through UPS and FedEx. Every day UPS and FEDEX stop by in the afternoon between 3pm-4:00pm to pick up the outgoing packages. But on Fridays in the summer we close at 1pm, meaning UPS and FEDEX can't pick up the packages on those days.   My boss told me I have to take all of the packages on Fridays and load them into my personal vehicle and drive them 15 minutes out of my way to UPS and drop them off. I have to do this after 1pm when I am off the clock. Basically, I'm being ordered to load hundreds of pounds of boxes into my sedan and drive them around on my personal insurance while I am off the clock.   I am very ignorant of these things so if I'm wrong, I accept that, but it seems like this can't be legal, can it? I feel like I'm putting wear and tear on my personal vehicle and taking all the liability while also working for free.   Reasoning with my boss is impossible. She is extremely petty and unreasonable. She once fired someone for bringing up serious concerns about some red flags regarding the financials of the company. Basically, discussing my concerns with her will get me nowhere. Her only boss is the president of the company who is barely ever around and he always just sides with her on things because he doesn't want to deal with it.  I've worked here for almost a year and it is painfully obvious that my boss does not like me, even though I receive high praise from everyone else at the company. I'm afraid if I speak up she'll fire me. What should I do?	Yes
319	"Hi /r/legaladvice!  I have been working in a salon industry for a substantial amount of time and was even Assistant Manager at other salons I worked at. I recently moved home during my year off before grad school and I started working at a salon at the beginning of April. I told the owner that I would be leaving at the end of July to go to grad school which is why I refused a management position with his salon. During the interview I asked for a certain amount per hour and he increased the dollar amount without any provocation. I thought this was a great opportunity for me and I took the basic sales level position.   Upon starting my job I was given sales goals and was told (unlike many others) that as long as I hit my goal I would receive 10% commission. He handed me an employee handbook and as I started to read through it line by line the owner told me all I had to do was sign the last page. I told him that I just wanted to read through in case I needed to initial any part or if I had questions about a section. He instructed me that there was no other place to initial and that I don't have to read it because it was straight forward. He pressured me into signing the last page without being able to fully go over it and I was not given a copy of what I had signed despite me asking frequently for one.   There weren't any problems in April or in May. I met all of my sales goals and was given my commission on the day it was promised. In early June I arrived at the salon location I was opening and found a letter he had left for me instructing that my hourly pay was now decreased by 20% with no mention of change in commission structure. The only other employees that received this letter were all going to school at the end of the summer but their letters stated specific hourly pay changes and changes in commission structure. Many employees quit but I decided to call the owner and alert him to the fact that I was promised at least a certain dollar amount per hour and it was his decision to increase it and now after the 20% decrease, I was below the amount I had asked for in my interview. He agreed and decided to bump my pay up to my requested amount in the interview.   After this conversation took place, he then gave me a very high sales goal and put me at a salon that wasn't busy enough for me to meet it. However after a couple of weeks he and the scheduling manager began asking me if I could cover shifts at a busier store for other employees. After accepting the shifts I was now working full time (40hr/week) after just wanting to do a max of 30. On the final day of June I ended up selling $1300+ for the busy salon and surpassed my sales goal by $9. July 1st was the end of the week and I was already clocking in 40+ hours when I asked if I could go home early since the salon died down. There were multiple employees there who could have taken care of our clients. The assistant manager told me that it was ""ok for me to leave 1 hour early"" considering I had to go to a second job that night. The salon was closed Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday for 4th of July. On Wednesday I was scheduled for 11 hours, Thursday for 12 hours, and Friday for 11 hours. On Wednesday I had worked all day and did not take a break. I saw that we were slowing down at the end of the day and when another assistant manager came in to close (who would've taken all the appointments anyway thus leaving me with nothing to do) told me that I could leave early again since there were no clients coming in and I had already been there for 10 hours. I went home and heard nothing.  I came in on Thursday fully intending to work my 12 hour shift because Thursdays are very busy and I knew they would need help. I worked non stop without a break until 5pm when the owner (whom I haven't seen in days) comes in and hands me a letter that he is terminating my employment due to ""excessive absenteeism without the approval of a supervisor"". I was livid. I initialed the document that said that I did not agree with the terms on which I was being terminated and left.   He is supposed to be paying out commission this week and I'm afraid he won't give it to me because a co-worker sent me a copy of the employee handbook which states on the last page that if you are terminated you are not entitled to you commission. I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here. Clearly I was forced to sign a document in front of him and I wasn't able to read anything from it because he never sent me a copy and I feel like he took advantage of this situation because he clearly gave me a sales goal that I wasn't supposed to meet last month but I did and I feel like he's worming his way out of paying my commission. He knew that I would be giving my two weeks at the end of this week (after I was supposed to get my commission check) and I feel like he tried to beat me to the punch. I have NEVER been in trouble at this job and I know that he can terminate employment for whatever reason but I feel like I worked for free essentially. This commission check was supposed to be $500+ and help me for school.  TLDR; Was given a huge sales goal last month that wasn't intended to be reached. Surpassed the goal and the owner terminated my employment for things that were approved of by supervisors. Now I fear he won't pay me my commission due to an employee handbook he forced me to sign without reading."	Yes
320	I was cleaning out room and came across a written check from my employer that is over a year old. I know there is typically a 6-month period in which checks need to be cashed but my boss is giving me a hard time about getting a new check reissued. Are they legally allowed to refuse to rewrite a check that wasn't cashed after a set amount of time? Trying to make sure I am not getting screwed here. This is taking place in NJ if that has any bearing on the matter.	Yes
321	Here are the questions I have so far:  1. I am in a field that has mandatory overtime i.e. if someone does not show up for a shift, the previous shift has to work the next shift and possibly the one after that in emergency situations. How would that work if the strike started during or at the end of my shift?  I could not get a straight answer on this from Googling, and I believe it's illegal for me to not stay if the next person does not show up.  2. I understand that the union may fine me for working during a strike. Would that apply if it was due to mandatory overtime?  3. Is there anything else I should know about strikes in healthcare or in general?	Yes
322	Hey r/legaladvice, do you think my girlfriend should do something about her latest manager? To keep it straight and to the point: her new manager told her employees to start thinking of a few days to go on vacation next month. When asked why, she responded that any employee who couldn't take vacation would have to work 1 less day per week.  Is that even legal? Is there something my girlfriend can do before she is forced to drop from 40 hours to 30-32 a week? Losing 1/4 of your income is pretty harsh so Im hoping that there is a way she can defend herself from losing that money.  Some minor details: This manager just replaced the previous manager who was fired for raking up more HR charges than Weinstein.   She is new and was hired from an entirely different industry. There was an interim manager that worked in this company for 18 years and surpassed all previous metrics from the previous manager before being replaced by someone who never worked for this entire industry before!   This new manager wants these employees to go on vacation because this company doesnt take vacation out of the payroll budget that is involved with the managers bonus.  This is a forbes 500 company. Idk if that pertains, but I figured it might be worth mentioning  Thanks in advance to all who may be willing to help :)	Yes
323	"A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine (I am a supervisor) got into a yelling match with me over me asking him to do something he didn't want to do. He did not directly threaten me verbally at this point, but he is twice my size and was attempting to intimidate me; including him coming up close to me and asking ""You wanna say something to me?"" In a threatening tone.  I contacted our director, and the other supervisor, to alert them to this. The other supervisor comes in because they live close and I was very much under the impression I was not safe at work. The co-worker that threatened me returned; thinking I was out of the office, he began to brag about how he was about to come back in and attack me.   At this, I ask him to leave for the day and all hell breaks loose. He and the other supervisor start screaming at one another, as myself and other had to hold the two back from one another or there would have been a fight. Finally he leaves the office, and having heard what happened, our director comes in to speak with him. Our director leaves, the asshole who threatened me got to work the rest of the shift. I was promised that the situation would be resolved and I was more than happy to be patient. Weeks have passed and literally nothing has been done, even the bare minimum that the director promised.   Now when have HR coming in tomorrow with an eye to fire all three of us involved. I'm at my ropes end with this company, and I've been told by a few people that if I'm fired that I'd be in my right to sue them. Is there any truth to that?"	Yes
324	Husband works in the oilfield.  They want to close down the yard here and relocate him to Oklahoma.  If he says no they say he has to quit so he won't get severance or unemployment.  What are his options?  Is this legal?	Yes
325	Looking for an employment lawyer to help with a situation where work is refusing to make an accommodation for a physical injury connected to my job. At this point I'm just looking for advice on what my options are (there's no court case at the moment).  Does anyone have a recommendation? I'd love to find a lawyer who is good at working out difficult situations without escalating a conflict.	Yes
326	"So an interesting thing happened today. There have been rumors for a while about a potential list of employees who will be laid off. Someone in the office noticed in the printer queue from our HR manager (This printer is a public printer and used for most of the office) Seperate documents in the queue with titles that would say ""termination notice - employee name.""  Things got out of hand really quickly and the entire office knew by the end of the day. HR probably scared for their own job quicky called a meeting explaining who was the person who originally saw the Printer Queue as they will be fired immediately and if no one comes forward they will start making assumptions on who that person is.  I would like to know who is in the wrong here and do they have any legal standing"	Yes
327	"I have a boss that intentionally leaves me out of important meetings and assignments (he makes me do all the work, but never includes me in emails or meetings); so I dont get any recognition or limelight in the corporation. To list a few examples:  He has NEVER invited me to a meeting with the head of our dept, when my peers in other depts, all do.  My boss has also said that in order for me to get promoted, I need face time with the head of the dept.  Because he has a 20+ year relationship with this executive, he doesnt want anyone else getting the attention.    My boss has several others that work for him that manage other groups.  When we had target setting meetings with heads of each dept, I asked if I could attend and he said no one on his team would attend other than him (in other words, he would represent all of us in all meetings) - later I found out, the others did in fact attend the meetings.  Have proof of this in email.    There was a company open call for nominees to participate in a task force - my boss sent an email to his team asking if any of us were interested.  I said i was, and he later verbally told me I couldn't because I was looking to change depts.  Which makes ZERO sense, and he is just fishing for excuses.  This task force would be me in touch with major players in the organization and I feel like he doesnt want that.    He has made comments like: ""why is XYZ off today? they want to have a life outside of work?""....""we are glad XYZ left the company, b/c he always had family and kids issues and never worked late""  He has taken his (personal/home related) anger out on me...when I called him out on it, he said he wasn't aware he brought his personal life at work when it was utterly OBVIOUS.  He never agrees with my thoughts in meetings with others; uses sarcasm or interrupts me almost always, when others at the meeting agree with my opinions or thoughts.  Any advice would be highly appreciated.  This man has caused me serious stress. I have frequent heart palpitations resulting in appointments with a cardiologist.  I had huge nodules on my throat that ended up being benign, however doctor says they are caused by stress.  I experienced a bout of serious migraines which  led me to get a brain scan.  I'm at my dream job, but I cant handle this anymore.  Please help."	Yes
328	"First time posting here:   I work as a purchasing agent. Yesterday, a salesmen who is the boss' son believed a 6 figure order I had placed was wrong (it wasn't). While things were being figured out on my end he screamed in my ear and my coworkers ""I SWEAR TO  GOD GUYS IM GONNA GO OUT TO MY CAR RIGHT NOW AND GET A GUN""  He calmed down. The order turned out to be fine and he was fine. But it made me feel very uncomfortable - and I'm a bit on edge. What happens if next time the order is not correct?  I have not gone to human resources because, well human resources is his sister and that will be a brick wall. He frequently verbally abuses the employees. The owner of the company is his father. It is a small 10-15 person company.   I'm not sure if I should get police involved? OSHA? Or what steps I should take here, any advice appreciated."	Yes
329	Myself and fellow employees at my place of work have requested time off in writing for doctor visits, family time, etc.  We all received approval, in writing, from the company owner. Is it fair and legal practice for our employer to penalize us by putting negative points in our employee record with the company and then write us up for it?  We have all discussed this at length and agree that this is unfair and ethically wrong. Good and loyal employees are being penalized for trying to take care of themselves (doc appts, etc) and they are so fed up with the backwards system our business uses that they are looking for work elsewhere. What our employer is doing is entrapment to the point where we are afraid to even ask for time off, for fear of disciplinary action if we have too many points on our record according to the owner and his HR manager, who also happens to be his wife. This severely hinders our ability to take care of our own health, our families, and other personal responsibilities that need addressed. The owner is known to also have legitimate mental issues and he often creates a hostile work environment by being rude, condescending, lashing out verbally and belittling the employees, to their face and behind their back to the rest of us. There are a myriad of problems within this workplace, but we would like to start with the above mentioned issues at the moment.  Please, any advice or referrals for our options legally would be much appreciated.	Yes
330	"A couple months ago, as title says, I was offered a job through a contracting agency, which I accepted and relocated for (only a few hundred miles, but still a trek when relocating all your belongings).  The day before I was supposed to start, I hadn't received any onboarding documents from them so I started to get a little worried and tried to make contact. They ignored me all day until that night when they told me that there had been ""some mistake"" and I no longer had a job.  I was able to maintain some sort of contact with them for about  a week after, in which I was told they could give me some compensation for things like **relocation, security deposit, one month rent**. However after this they simply stopped responding and I never got my compensation.  I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to move forward with getting said compensation from them."	Yes
331	"Hi guys,   Canadian here working for a US employer, and signed an ""at will"" employment contract so all of this might be moot (not sure about cross border law, hence the Reddit thread)   Long story short I got a new boss and he appears to be laying the groundwork to dismiss me. First the shenanigans:   - He hired two of his buddies and they go out together and exclude me.   - I work in sales and they hired us account executives a lead gen person... Only she didn't even know I existed until I reached out, so she's been working for them and not me for about a month now.   - My boss is a total moron and makes countless mistakes in paperwork that gets sent to customers, and then he turns around and blames me for lacking attention to detail.   -He'll forget to follow up with customers and then throw me under the bus to His boss.   - He's a fat piece of shit, and makes jealous jokes about me being thin, my superior martial arts background, pedigreed work history, etc.    I can do no right. I tell a short joke it should be longer, a long joke it should be shorter.   The past 2 months there has been a marked increase in *written communication.* Everything is documented in email form, so I'm pretty sure I'm getting setup.   I tried speaking with his boss who simply told me to ""manage my manager.""   I'm afraid of HR because I know they exist to protect the company, not necessarily me.   I've been forwarding emails to myself, along with copies of the mistakes he has made, Skype messages, keeping notes on conversations, etc. Is this valuable?   What can I do?   Thanks Reddit!"	Yes
332	Hey everyone. I recently got laid off and am seeking full time work. I just received an offer from a local guy to buy cars for him and his business . They said they need vehicles for their business and will supply bank drafts if I negotiate the deal and I receive a commission based on what I negotiate. I just wonder what a dealership and bank will think when I walk in with a lot of cash available and buy high end vehicles.  Is this legal? do dealerships even care?  Thanks you guys!	Yes
333	I'm looking for a new job and am willing to contract.  Some recruiters, I'd say less than half, have language that states I agree to accept the position if the employer wants me (at the negotiated rate).   Is such a contract binding?   If so, if the job is at will anyway, what prevents me from joining for 1 day and then quitting, say if I don't like the office smell?  (promissory estoppel issues perhaps)  More curious than anything, because I occasionally agree to such terms, but only when the money is so good that I really would take the job.	Yes
334	Hear me out i understand work can be an unpleasant and chaotic for all parties. But im genuinely infuriated by the horrible and incompetent management at my work. They neglect to intervene when coworkers berate and make crude jokes about each other. They are often attentive to customers, but neglect any of the needs and concerns of coworkers. I was literally in a yelling match with my supervisor before we both got told to go to HR to mitigate things, mostly in the supervisors favor. Is there anyway i can at least threaten legal action via phone call, letter etc. to get them to listen to my concerns more? How would i go about initiating this? Would i have any protection from being laid off?   A little background as well, this is in a high end restaurant setting in a country club. These sorts of jokes and crude playfulness are common in the food industry i know. But the shitty management doesnt do anything to sufficiently quell or mitigate things.	Yes
335	I'm on mobile so hopefully this turns out okay.  So recently at my wife's job a couple of dishwashers started selling lsd. My wife was the assistant manager, she tried talking to the general manager about it but turns out she is buying it from them and wanted to sweep everything under the rug. Fast forward a few weeks.   At the end of Monday night my wife was cashing out her drawer at the end of her bartending shift. It's short. Alot of people were in the drawer that night and my wife is very good with her money. So naturally she's a little peeved about being the only one that had to cover it but she did it anyways. The general manager wanted to talk about it but my wife was over it at that point and left, resulting in a write up the next day.  That evening my wife and her general manager exchange some texts, basically my wife calling the general manager out about buying lsd from minors and allowing it to run rampant through the store, the general manager wanted to talk about this in person so my wife agreed but only on the conditions that there is a third party present, like the regional manager.   The regional manager texts my wife and says that a third party isn't required and she is being terminated for not agreeing to talk to her manager without a third party.   Is any of this legal? Aren't you entitled to a third party  being present in a situation like this? How in the hell is my wife the one being fired when there are people selling and buying acid on premises?  The regional manager says the GM has talked to her about the drugs and they are handling it, but I have the feeling that she is believing everything the GM is feeding her which certainly doesn't include that she has been buying and using acid.  Someone please help I have a feeling none of this is right and my wife was fired wrongfully.	Yes
336	"Need advice due to conflicting info from fam/friends, also /r/personalfinance didn't like my post tagged with Employment.    I am of the opinion that since my former incarceration info is sealed that I may now maintain complete assurances that I have never been convicted of a crime or having been arrested. Anyone who Google searches may find old data, which is why some are telling me I should ""own up"" and be truthful if confronted about these in an interview. This is tantamount to waiving my rights which I think is a horrible idea.  Would an employer not be in gross violation of civil rights act and fair credit reporting act if it was even brought up in an interview?? How would I address this topic strongly and respectfully if confronted?  Wouldn't equal protection also mean my expungement would also apply to an employer for any other state in USA?  I am looking at my first few interviews soon since fully cleaning up my record and also earning my bachelors and I don't want to deal with nonsense."	Yes
337	"Work from home. Have MacBook. MacBook died today--against company policy to take it to Apple Store or anywhere other than our IT department. Problem is... I work for the top sales rep at the company (he's in CA but I'm in UT) and IT is based in TX... I leave for a week on Monday for Amsterdam which is not a vacation, as I planned to work the whole time there. My computer died this AM (hard drive issue on MacBook, never encountered it before) and my boss is insisting I need to take my vacation days since my computer is broken and they won't be able to fix it for ""some time"" (our IT dept is sooooo slow).... they COULD just ship me a loaner laptop to Amsterdam since our company is global and it wouldn't be an issue,,,. But my boss is legitimately trying to force me to take my vacation days ""since I'll be out of the country anyway"". Is that legal?!?!?"	Yes
338	Working part-time and get paid bi-weekly. Just over a month ago, one of my days was not registered and wasn't paid. I emailed management, they said I'd get it the next pay period. That didn't happen either.   The week in question, I managed to get a lot of extra hours and ended up with 50 total (including the 8 that weren't paid). I finally got back in and spoke face-to-face with a manager and they sorted it out. With all the fuckups, I made it clear that those were OT and that I had 42 hours that week and those 8 would have made it 50. (With the understanding that anything over 40 in a week is OT.)  I was told that the only way I, as a part-timer, could get OT was while working more than 8hrs in a day. The whole OT after 8hrs is foreign to me, but I know I've seen it as part of the union contract.   What I would like to know before I escalate this is... is the manager right? I never received a copy of the union contract, so I'm not sure what my rights are from that side. I just thought federal law required payment of OT for anything over 40.  Right now, I'm just kind of pissed at the fact that it's been over a month and I still haven't gotten paid for that day and nobody seems to give a shit.	Yes
339	"Hello everyone, please help me out.   My Mom needs to get her insurance done, so I need to report my earnings from Wendy's to her report. The last month I worked at Wendy's was January 2017. Recently, I called and they gave me this site to go to which is called netsecure.adp. This is the site that shows all the times they paid me, and I need it to show it to the insurance people. I put in all my information and when I click ""enter"" it says my account is ""locked"". So I call back my Wendy's place and ask the guy if he can help me. I say, ""Can I have a number to talk to? What can I do to fix this? I really need this for my insurance."" He doesn't give me a number to talk to at all. He says I'm locked out my account because I don't work there anymore. I told him I really need it for my insurance, in which he replies ""I don't care"" with a chuckle. Please, someone help me out. I have contacted the store manager last week but she has not gotten back to me!!!!   Thanks everyone!"	Yes
340	So I was working part time at this Bikini place for like 3 years, in Feb of this year they said they laid everyone off because of lack of work. Literally no one came in anymore and they were turning the place into a warehouse office, some of the windows were already being replaced, and there was saws and stuff. So the last week of Feb my manager Shana called me saying EVERYONE is getting laid off except for the HR/ceo people on the 3rd floor. The retail store will be closed. So that very day I went into the work and asked them is this true, and they said they are closing the retail store and only the private owners will continue running it via online.     Flash forward to today, I see they made a post on Facebook saying 4th of July week sale, Come on in! The store was open.  Now is it only open for the 4th of july week?  Or did something shady happen in Feb? Because they typed a letter for me to give to unemployment saying the store was closed and everyone got layed off.	Yes
341	"So ever since I got hired at this job there has been an issue with a co-worker and there is a long list let me just start   #1: complains about every thing I do.

342	"Like the title states I'm currently employed in Chapel Hill North Carolina and am interviewing for a new job this coming Wednesday. I've only been back from vacation for 13 days and if on Wednesday I am offered a job and give my two weeks notice the same day I will not be safe from the 6 weeks restriction.

343	I pressed charges but it doesn't matter because my DA said it wasn't a strong enough case to prosecute so all charges were dropped in May. I was told how to pursue them on my own but I needed time to heal and be away from the case due to having a shitty detective and DA. I was planning on this week going to go get the paperwork to begin the process over again.  My question is they can't fire him due to him being in the system so what can I do to get a rightful firing? Or more how do they see he is a danger because this will not show up on his background check until he is arrested with is based on a grand jury.   Please do not suggest switching jobs I struggle to hold any jobs for more than 3 months and I've been here for 8. I can't switch and live a fulfilling life. What can I do?	Yes

The policy is that quitting results in your last check dropping down to minimum wage ($7.25 an hour in my state) Wondering if im screwed or can fight this. This is in Iowa	Yes
345	"I'm currently employed in GA and my boss is trying to force me to resign... My boss mislead me to believe I could work remotely and relocate to another state (not in writing unfortunately) and then changed her mind weeks later. She has been trying to get me to submit a resignation letter since I plan on moving (even though I work remotely now in GA). I told her I wasn't ready to submit the letter (as I don't have another job) and she decided to find a replacement for me anyways. She hired the person under the guise as ""help"" for me but has made announcements in meetings (in front of me) that I will be leaving.   She also requested for me to be present in the interview process for my replacement and told the applicants I was leaving the company. She is going to continue pressuring me to submit a resignation letter and I'm ultimately afraid she will fire me for misconduct. She has said in the past that no one will get unemployment on her watch, etc. I'm afraid that she will create a reason to fire me for misconduct... How can I protect myself in this situation?"	Yes
346	This is Washington State, US.   I applied to work for a company called [Fun Flicks](http://funflicks.com/). It was a strange process to get this job. The interview was conducted outside and was really casual. It seemed too easy to get the job. It was an unusually small amount of time from application to being on board. Almost all of our communication has been via text, and I have not been shown the building they operate out of. I gave them my application with some sensitive information on it, that's all I am worried about. None of the information seemed out of the ordinary for a job application, but it is still concerning. They said I was 'on board' in May, and nothing happened after that besides some texting about the position. The last time we talked was a month ago. It all seems very odd. I can't even find one in Washington on Google maps. Either they are sort of unprofessional, or something sinister is afoot. What can I do to check the legitimacy of this company/job offer? Is there even a scam like this? Thanks	Yes
347	Hi reddit,  Got an issue here with a (currently suspended) employee in my place of work, we have not yet hired a legal rep IRL as I would like to get some advice first before we decide to make the investment.  Issue is below:  Employee declared that they had resigned from their previous place of work when we interviewed them. Been employed for a year (passed probation) and due to a tip off (came from outside the business we believe, somebody from their previous place of work), we have now discovered that they were actually dismissed for fraud from the last employer (when they told us they resigned).   Reference check was done before being offered the position (as per usual), but reason for leaving was not disclosed by the references (we always try and get the reason for leaving if possible). We have no signed documents from the employee confirming their reason for leaving; only written information is interview notes when we interviewed them, but obviously they would not have signed this (and new employees do not normally see their interview notes).  As stated, employee has passed probation so we cannot simply dismiss that easily. Currently suspended employee and waiting for a meeting date, but unsure if we have a case here… he's suspended with pay so I doubt he's worried, probably just got his feet up at home.  Management does not want this employee working for us any longer given what he was dismissed for in the last company and intentionally did not declare it in this one (and as we are an insurance-based company, something like fraud is obviously going to raise warning flags. As stated he is currently suspended (with pay) and is waiting for a meeting date with his manager and HR. He has no previous warnings or anything as such on his record, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't socialise that much (which can go either way to be honest, if he is up to something with our company then it would make sense to keep to yourself).  Thanks to all that read / give advice!  - Catherine (Assistant HR manager)	Yes
348	"I posted last week about being laid off due to suggesting that I wouldn't be returning after maternity leave. The gist was that my work provides childcare at a cost, the cost is daily, not as needed. This drops my income down to minimum wage and if I am out sick or take a vacation, it's below minimum wage. I simply can not afford their childcare at my wage. I expressed these financial concerns to my boss and less than a week later, I was given a date that my employment would change form full time (40 hours) to ""on call."" I was told by commenters that they were within their rights to lay me off and due to the size of the company, they don't have to comply with FMLA and PDA.  **Current issue**: Since I've been told that I will be laid off at the end of the month, the work place has been... difficult. I received a formal write-up for a small mistake in which my boss stated that she never writes people up but she *has* to write me up. I've been ""spoken to"" twice regarding my behavior while working before today. Today alone, I was spoken to regarding multiple issues ""I created."" The environment has officially gone from stressful to toxic.   Our workload has been light all week and the boss has been sending people home. I offered to go home today *if* she was cutting again. According to her, it was beyond my authority to request this. Despite my lack of authority, she decided I *could* go home and she approached me to ask if I wanted my full lunch break, a short lunch break or no lunch break. I decided on no lunch break but said ""I need to pop into my room to grab a snack to eat."" She took this as ""I need to go somewhere to get a snack, I'll take a short lunch."" We were obviously on two different pages but did not realize. The person who was sent to break me was incredibly irritated when I was confused, my boss ran into the room I was in while I was dealing with a child and yelled at me ""Do I just need to lay you off today?"" I said no, I just want to do my job. She took me outside to continue to lecture me about how I keep calling shots that aren't mine to call. I told her that I just want to do my job and I try to be easy to deal with and I'm sorry she feels this way, I'll try to stop.  I'm just so lost and confused because I work hard, I show up on time and there is so clearly a personality issue between me and the boss and I can't figure out why I am being targeted for doing the same thing everyone else does. I say yes to every task they ask of me and every time there's been an issue, it's because I'm asking for clarification or support and that's the wrong thing to do. I'm not even comfortable requesting support to go use the restroom and I'm pregnant and have to go frequently. I almost feel crazy at this point.  Ok, work vomit over. I want to quit now. I have evidence that I am going from a full time employee to an on-call employee with no shifts for the first two weeks of feb. My husband claims I can file due to constructive dismissal. After today, I don't want to go back (even after saying I would while my boss was yelling at me). I'm already worried the constructive dismissal would not be enough to be eligible, especially when I *do* have shifts on the book. I want to be able to decline those shifts and still collect due to the environment. I am also concerned these new complaints against my alleged behavioral issues will mean I'm not eligible. If I quit and present my case, is this enough? Should I continue to work for the next 2 weeks? Thanks  **tl;dr** Boss is mean, I'm already laid off for a future date. I want to leave now but I keep getting in trouble. I need an income badly."	Yes
349	My gf works in hospitality, she closed out her drawer and made her drop into the safe at work which then got stuck and did not make it into the safe. After she had left her coworker came and stole the envelope out of the safe. They have cameras and caught him on camera doing this. He is denying it and will be taking a lie detector test. The owner of the business told her that if he doesn't fess up she will be responsible for paying him back. Im trying to figure out what we need to do. Apparently this is a problem with the safe and she has always made sure to check to make sure her drops made it into the safe, apparently this time is got stuck on the side and she did not notice it when checking and thought it made into the safe. I'm just worried that if he does not fess up etc that they will try to hold her paycheck, it was around one thousand dollars stolen and she does not have the money to pay them back.	Yes
350	"Location: I do not want to get too specific because it will identify me. If there are major laws that apply to this that are state specific please let me know.       Background: I am a software engineering intern at a major ""non-tech"" company. I was told at orientation that interns were not allowed to work overtime- but that if we went over a bit we would be compensated for it and it wasn't too big of a deal. I have been working here for several weeks now and every pay cycle I have received a bit of overtime- nothing major. Maybe an hour or 2.       This pay cycle I was supposed to receive 2.5 hours of over time- the reason being that I was unable to leave work at an earlier time so I went over 40 hours. Instead of sitting and doing nothing until I can leave I continued to work. I found out that the online time sheet i fill out was manually adjusted to remove ALL overtime I have worked this pay cycle. I was told this is because ""interns are not allowed to work over time"" but nothing I signed through employment seems to indicate that. I did a quick run through all the documents I signed ctrl + f for terms like ""intern"", ""overtime"" and nothing came up.      I am absolutely furious that I ended up wasting time at work that I will not be compensated for. What are my rights? Since I am an intern I don't think I can afford a lawyer (and a company this big surely has some pretty decent lawyers I'd assume). I just don't know where to go from here on out.      For what its worth- this company has had controversy over overtime pay in the past which I found through some googling. I don't want to allow myself to be treated unfairly just because I am an intern. Any advice?     In case it isn't clear: I am an hourly intern unlike most of the full time employees who are salaried."	Yes
351	I'm wondering if any employment attorneys can help me identify the basic criteria for a successful hostile work environment claim. Specifically, suppose an employer has acted negligently, but perhaps not intentionally so, in a fashion that adversely impacts an employees career or mental health, is that sufficient for a hostile workplace claim?   As an example, say you work for a company where you need special licensure and that company screws up the process, keeping you from working. Is there a claim there?   What if your company prevents you from working for an extended period, which results in problems for you elsewhere? Say for example an 18 wheeler driver has a bunch of cocaine discovered in his trailer shipment. He has nothing to do with the coke smuggling but gets suspended for 6 months by his company anyway. Is this a hostile work environment?  What if an employee is excessively drug tested or scrutinized at work?   What if an employee is pressured to accept unfavorable workplace evaluations as a condition of returning to work?	Yes

353	Hi!  I work for a company in Philadelphia. I'm salaried and paid every two weeks. Last pay period the checks were delayed a week and when I received my check I noticed NO taxes were taken out. The amount of the check was for my take home pay. I complained and a few days later the proper check was issued with my salary and taxes taken out to give me the take home pay amount. At the same time, other employees paychecks have bounced. Now, again, my paycheck is delayed.  I want to quit this job and get my owed paycheck, plus the paycheck for the last week I worked.  I plan on quitting today or tomorrow because as of now I've worked three weeks for free and my boss doesn't seem like he's going to pay me.   How can I go about attempting to legally collect my owed pay?	Yes
354	Work in a place where traditionally lowest on the totem pole does the hard crap work. It sucks but eventually you earn your stripes someone new comes along and you do less and less of the crap until one day you rarely if ever have to do it.   Here and there over the years I have had managers try to jump someone over me (usually because they are female or older and less capable) pushed it to the main boss and they agreed that was not cool. Couple of times this resulted in the newer employee quitting because the work is that disagreeable      New group of managers has decided the traditional way of doing things (and also the way all similar departments in the company still do it) doesn't matter to them.   So now it seems that the young men no matter seniority get to do all the hard work, while being told that what we do is the top, not the bottom.   Are there and laws that protect us? (CA)  Feels real shitty	Yes
355	Last month my ex-husband purchased a new car and came to pick up our two and five year old children for his visitation without car seats. He expected to be able to borrow my car seats which I declined to share with him. He has come twice to pick them up without appropriate car seats.   The first time he left angrily after I refused him my car seats and didn’t contact me about making other arrangements to see the children. He did not see them all for that visitation which was supposed to be for four days.   The second time he arrived we were outside playing and, my ex-husband  managed to scoop up the older child and get him in the car. I made it very clear to my ex that I would be calling the police to report his car the second he left if he didn’t have my kids properly restrained. Again my ex left without the children and has since left me several voicemails about how he’s taking me to court for violating our custody court order and denying him his visitation. He also thinks that the car seats belong to the children and should come with them like their clothing.   The lawyer I used for our custody agreement is currently on vacation and I haven’t been able to consult with her yet. Do you think it would be likely that I could be forced to share the car seats?  We have it in the custody agreement that he has to pick up the children because I have a degenerative eye condition that may make me unable to drive in the next few years and we don’t live in an area with public transportation.  The main reason I don’t want to share the car seats is my ex seems to be making it his personal mission to destroy or lose any clothing, toy, or other item my kids take when they spend time with him. I had to buy the oldest three pairs of winter boots this past winter.	No
356	"Currently separated, going through a very ugly divorce battle with my (hopefully soon to be ex) wife...neither of us can afford attorneys because of financial troubles (excessive debt) accumulated by her when we were together.  Not to mention, she cheated on me for a year before I found out.  During that time, she got herself in to legal trouble (related to the cheating) which caused additional financial hardship.    However, she has managed to get an attorney through a women's legal center somehow by lying about me and how I have treated her.  When, in truth, I endured about 10 years of mental/emotional abuse from her before I decided the marriage could not be saved.   Now that she has an attorney, and I don't, she is trying to ""stick it to me"" with a vengeance.  She has kept the children from me on occasion (to be vindictive) when it was my rightful visitation time, and she also says negative things about me to our daughters.  Are any of you aware of lost cost / pro bono options for a father that has been taken advantage of but is still trying to do the best he can for his children?   It doesn't seem fair that she can lie and get an attorney for free, and I, the law abiding father that has never missed a child support payment and see my kids as much as possible, can't?  Thank you in advance for your time, I appreciate any advice you can offer that might help me find an attorney, or an organization that could help me find an attorney."	No
357	OK so to start, I'm subletting an apartment in NYC, so my name is not on the lease. (I actually never saw the original lease because my previous roommate left and it's been hard to contact her..) Anyway, the lease is over at the end of this month and I will be moving out, so the landlord / brokers have been scheduling showing. Fine with me. However, it has happened more than once now that the super has opened up my apartment and let people in without ANY notice. When I brought this up to the broker, he said that the original lease stated that even if I don't have any notice at all, the landlord and super can just enter whenever they want even if they don't let me know. Is this legal??? My feeling is that even if it was on the lease (which I doubt) it's probably still illegal and would be considered trespassing. Can anyone point me to official NYC law or wording about this? I'm feeling really disturbed by this...	No
358	My wife and I are splitting, we're divorcing, we're done. Not going to get into who's fault or whatever, but there's a big issue.   She took my debit card, basically taking access away from money. Basically she decided to hold the money over my head. The account is joint, I have a card with my name on it and she has one with ours and it goes to the same account. She would basically give me cash when I got paid and tell me to get another bank account, which I eventually did but the latest paycheck still went into the account. She would drop the money off and yet I wouldn't get the full amount. Basically she's leaving me with nothing and also controlling how much I can have. She told me she is closing the account so I will no longer have access to it. Fine. We need to split.   Here's the twist... I found the card. Apparently she didn't think to chop the damn thing out before throwing away (and apparently she needs to work on her skills because she missed the garbage can) And the account isn't closed. I check the balance and found she has a lot more money than previously thought. I'm sitting here with my card wondering if I have any right to withdraw whatever money I want. And I'm confused... Do I? I mean... It's our account, she took my debit card, and the card has my name on it..... What do I do? I need to pay bills, I have a mouth to feed and she just left me with nothing. I could take the loss and wait until I get paid again but during this split she's done nothing reasonable. Everything done, especially the money situation, has been uncalled for. It may sound mean, and like I'm trying to get revenge but that's not what I want. I just don't want to starve the next two weeks. So... Do I have a right to withdraw the money?	No
359	I stopped at a stop sign and checked to see if there was any incoming traffic from the left. After checking, i proceeded to turn right but then I saw a person in front my car, crossing the street. So I quickly pulled over my brake and the person saw me coming at her and she quickly back paddled. Then she walked over to the driver's seat and when I pulled over my window to ask if she was alright, she said she WASN'T alright and asked for my information. So i gave her my phone number and my name and she just walked away after verifying my phone number... She was not on the ground, and from my perspective at the time, the only contact that my car had with her was with her hand at the front hood of my car trying to maybe.. prevent the car from lunging at her?   Is there any charges that I can get from this incident?  I am residing in Washington State.	No
360	My mom suffers from bipolar manic depression. My wife and I went to go stay with her 7 years ago. She threatened to call 911 on me when she was having a manic episode. I called 911 to get them to come take her back to the hospital to get her some help. She lied to the police and told them they pulled her hair. My wife told them she didn't see me do that. They took me to jail anyway. I plead no contest to get out of jail because I was pretty ignorant at the time and had my ability to purchase a firearm prohibited. I still can't afford a lawyer. What should I do to get the false conviction off my record and restore my 2nd Ammendment right to purchase own and carry a firearm. I want to be able to defend my family and myself in an emergency. Please help. Thanks	No
361	My friend was/is on probation for a DWI. He had a month left and he got violated because he tested positive for alcohol twice in a row.  He is currently in county jail and they haven't given him a court date yet. He's been there almost a week. My question is how long can they make him stay and can they sentence him with a full prison sentence even if he paid his restitution and has been on probation for 5 1/2 years.   We reside in New York State.	No
362	"Hi, our business entered into a 3 year, $35/month bottleless water cooler contract with a local provider. Due to dissatisfaction with the service (the machine has needed service several times and not enough water is cooled at any given time), we would like to cancel.   The provider has offered to change the machine. Otherwise, the contract provides for a $150 removal fee in the event of cancellation. It also says, ""If provider terminates a rental term under this Agreement or any Add-on Schedule due to Customer’s default, including but not limited to, non-payment of any amount when due, improper care, usage or handling of the Equipment, or failure to perform any other obligation hereunder, Customer will be responsible for payment of all fees for the remaining term(s), as well as for all damages and removal and shipping charges incurred by provider.""  As a result, they are seeking $630 for the remaining 18 months of the contract (in addition to the removal fee). We understand a cancellation fee, but to what extent is it legal to charge the full duration of the contract? Thank you."	No
363	I haven't moved out yet, but one of my roommates did. They charged her $10 already (they just did a walk through) for not replacing drip plates on the stove.  My parents own rentals and the extremes this place goes to to make money is crazy compared to what my parents do.  I know, should read lease before signing, and I did. And we figured this would happen. Unfortunately as students we're limited to large corporations with lots of money and lawyers, as more local owners won't rent to us. Also I was constrained by a budget, and this place was the only affordable one I could find for this coming year that offered what I needed.  Basically everything in the lease has a clause that they don't have to follow their rules if they don't want to. For example, we were promised $500 on move in day. Our lease says we'd receive it by 30 days at the latest but we didn't get it until 60 days. The lease also said that it was up to management discretion to follow the timeline a lease.  So they have a list of charges for various things, but can also withhold deposits and charge for whatever else they deem necessary according to the language in the lease.  When we moved in these drip pans were most probably not new. Our carpet wasn't clean at all, even though they charge for professional carpet cleaning if we don't pay and turn in a receipt ourselves.   So, if they charge but don't replace the drip pans or whatever else, and just pocket the money, would I have any way of finding out? I'm moving out because this place is awful. They definitely never held up what we expected out of a place to live, I could provide many examples of problems we've had with them but I'll leave the it at the gift card incident since I don't want to bog the post down.  We are fed up and sick of this place. Just trying to figure out navigating a large corporation, I'm mildly familiar with landlord tenant laws but the kinds of leases they have vs what a small owner would have is miles more protective of their rights. Looking for some guidance.	No
364	This is happening in Houston, Texas.  I signed a lease stating that I was to move in to the apartment on July 8th (I signed about three weeks before this date) and would receive a copy of the lease on the move in date. Relying on that agreement, I arrived July 8th and gave the leasing agent the cashier's check for $735.48 and received the keys to the apartment so that I could begin to move my belongings into the apartment. I did not get a copy of the lease, the reason they said was because the manager was not there to sign it. I had recruited the help of several friends to help me move the larger furniture. When I went to the apartment there were several issues:  The newly installed shower was not finished.  Neither of the two smoke detectors were functional.  There was a large crack in the sliding glass window.  The carpets had not been cleaned in any way.  There was a severe infestation with pests in the kitchen. After speaking with the leasing agent I was told that the carpets should have been cleaned, shower finished, and apartment sprayed for pests. They informed me that they would call the cleaning company to clean the apartment that night (July 8th) and that I would have to wait to move in the next day (July 9th) so that the carpets could dry. The assistant manager offered a concession equivalent to the prorated rent for July 8th and 9th and informed me the manager was not going to be in until Monday (July 10th).   On July 9th I returned to move in and I found the apartment in the same condition, it had not been cleaned and none of the issues had been addressed.  The morning of July 10th I returned to the apartment complex at 9:00am to speak to the manager, meaning I had to go into work late to be able to talk to her. She told me that the apartment would be cleaned that day and I could move in later that day. The people I had recruited to help me were not able to help me move July 10th, I had a work obligation today (July 11th) and will be out of town the remainder of the week until the morning of July 17th, making that the earliest possible date I could move in (if I am able to get help from friends).  The manager offered concession of rent from July 8th until the date I move in but said they would not pay for movers despite the fact that I had help lined up to move the weekend we had agreed I would be moving in and now have no help to move. Are they legally obligated to cover moving costs for me due to me having to hire movers because they were the ones to breach the contract? The relevant section of the Texas Property Code I believe is Title 8, Chapter 91, Sec. 91.004.  What if anything am I entitled to?  Thanks for any help.	No
365	Hey guys I was in a motorbike crash on the 2nd July, I was going down the motorway in the fast lane and it turned into a merge lane so I merged. About 10 seconds later all I see is brake lights come on so I tried to brake aswell, couldn't slow down fast enough so i had to swerve to the right and clipped the rear right side of the car in front, now comes to my problem. I have decided not to claim and just wanted to fix my bike up myself without getting insurance involved but I have just had a claim made against me by the other party involved. My insurance ran out on the 12th so I wanted to know if I would still be covered and how to handle the claim against me. Any advice would be helpful .	No
366	"I was blackout drunk. The girl said nothing happened. Ex-father-in-law said he saw sex. I fought the case for a year. Assistant DA said they were going to bring in an expert to say the girl had ""Stolkholm syndrome"" and felt the need to defend me since she had a history of sexual abuse. Lawyer advised I take a plea for a county year and 5 years felony probation with the requirement that I ""p.c. 290 register while on probation."" That's a direct quote from my minute orders.

367	Hello!   Today I moved out of my student-centered apartment complex. It was fully furnished when I moved in, and over the course of my stay, I broke the chair that came in my room. No problem, the replacement fee was like 30 someodd dollars. The chair was never replaced by maintenance, however, and when I tried to log into our resident portal this morning, I was told I currently cannot access the account. This is where the itemized list of charges and payments was housed, and we were given no indication that we would not be able to access it at any point. While I do have payment receipts that show on my bank account, it's not itemized, and since I paid for the chair in one swoop along with rent and utilities, I can't prove that the money I paid was for that charge.   There is a good chance that when they evaluate my apartment, they will see the broken chair and charge me again. Is there any recourse for this? Or any way to regain access to my account and my records at all? Without those, it becomes a game of he-said she-said, and I feel certain I won't win.   Thank you!	No
368	"My wife and I recently got married and headed over to the social security office in our city to change her name. She decided that she ""hates"" her middle name and thus requested it to be changed to her mothers first name. Normally, they don't ask you questions about a maiden name change if you have your marriage license on you.   Long story short the name got changed and about a month later, which is today, we headed into the DMV to update her license to a newer version with her new name on it. They told us at the DMV that the name was changed without a petition of the court indicating a lawful name change. How can I get this fixed? Why did the social security office allow us the get the name changed if it is unlawful? What course of action should I take?    Thank you for reading my long post.    TL; DR: Wife and I got married, tried to change her middle name to something unrelated, social security did it, DMV told us we messed up and sent us to the clerk court, now we either pay money to fix it, or change her name back."

369	Shady Landlady Issues  -FYI  We had some trash we were going to remove on the 4th of August, it was stated if she could get it removed significantly sooner - we would be willing to eat the cost out of the deposit.   Trash was picked up on the 3rd, invoice itself was created on the second - which I recall from GAAP, this is not a good rule of thumb.  Invoice contains NO breakdown, NO sign of gst, NO backup whatsoever.  What are my options?	No
370	[Virginia, USA] Throwaway.  I do architectural surveys and while I was on one, I saw what I think is evidence of child neglect.  Ant infestations everywhere, the child's feces in the trash can (like they were using it as the toilet. not cleaning up an accident), trash on the floor throughout the home (that they rapidly tried to clean up while I was there), stains, and otherwise disarray.  Obviously I want to help the kid.  But I'm I concerned about being there because I was on the job.  I know I'm not a mandatory reporter by Virginia's standards, but if I do report I can remain anonymous with the reporter (and that I'm protected on the report even if I do give them my name and information unless the court wants me to testify).  But I'm concerned the mother will know it's me (since I don't know how many other strangers came into the home) and try to get me/my company in trouble.  My boss is not particularly understanding.  It's a small family business, and I'm debating even telling him about it if I do report.  I believe I am protected from retaliation for this, but I'm not sure how far it goes.  What is my best course of action to legally protect myself while also reporting this to CPS?	No
371	I got a speeding ticket that I did not deserve (there were circumstantial factors at play, not going to get into it) while passing by a small county in Colorado 3 hours from where I live. I would contest it but I don't want to make the drive and deal with going to court in general. I looked up the ticket number and it says it's not in the system. Today I finally got around to calling the court and they said there is no record of it anywhere and had me call the Denver DMV. The DMV said there is no record of the ticket at all; the lady thought that maybe I received a summons and I was past my court date (which would explain nothing showing up), but it's a speeding ticket with a court date set for 8/4 (I think). She told me to call the police station to look into it. Legally, am I supposed to call the police station? I spent a bunch of my time dealing with this and doing everything I can to pay it and I don't really think calling the police station and sorting out whatever paperwork is my responsibility. Is it? What happens if I don't do anything?	No
372	I have been assisting a family member (the respondent) with a separtation. I have all correspondence and pleadings to date. Some letters and emails are between the respondent and the applicant's lawyer. Some are between the respondent (or myself) and the respondent's lawyer. Legally, can I make these letters, emails, and forms public online? The application, answer, reply, affidavits, and financial statements are part of a continuing record that is already a public record, is it not? And I have the respondent's (since all of this information was mailed or emailed to him or myself) permission to do so. We are hoping to change lawyers. Until we find a lawyer who is a better fit, I thought that by sharing all of this information online, anyone who has the time can read the information and offer advise. I thought there may be legal professionals who are retired, or suffer from insomnia :), who may be interested in helping. That is my reason for wanting to make this information public.	No

374	So, I slept with a friend of mine a while ago, and she hasn't talked to me since we broke up four months ago after dating for about a month - the day we broke up, she told me that she was pregnant - and long story short, it's starting to look like there's a good chance that I'll be a parent within the year.  I've met with a few family lawyers in the area, and thankfully, it sounds like there's a fairly good chance that I can swing joint legal custody when I'm sued for child support in the next six months to three years, as long as I don't make any major mistakes.  However, the friend that I hooked up with is still incredibly upset, and never wants to see me again - I spent the better part of three months trying to get in contact with her, but, it's no use - every time I try to talk to her, she tells me how foolish I was for leaving her.  That being said, if a joint legal custody agreement is reached, but we assume that she retains primary physical custody, can she arbitrarily move anywhere that she likes without my consent? That is, could she move hundreds of kilometres away to avoid me, and not be worried about things like parental child abduction?  Would my only recourse be to spend tens of thousands of dollars in court to get her to move back, or move closer to her?	No
375	Please help.  I am a young woman undergoing a divorce for a very short term marriage. Here's the deets:  1. Married for 6 months - Separated for 8 months. I left, he filed.  2. No children 3. Annulments/dissolutions out of question - Can't agree on retrieving my belongings 4. He has wedding jewelry and engagement ring, wedding money, and all my premarital belongings (lived together 5 years).  I left with only the clothes on my back. 5. He has only let me retrieve anything I could list with the aid of a magistrates order. (i.e. he kept anything I didn't specifically list - things like college diplomas/tax return documents/mail/family heirlooms etc)  I have not been allowed on the property since January 2017. I want a walk through to pack because it's impossible to list everything I owned. 6. Got my clothes back after 3 months - clothes damaged 7. Got some family furniture back after 7 months - damages 8. He is asking for my 401K (he has worked for 7 years, I have worked for 1 - I have stopped contributing once I found out he wanted it, but don't know what judge would rule in his favor)  9. Attempted court ordered mediation, but could not agree on time to meet with mediator (his choice of course)  My lawyer is very...relaxed.  Tells me I don't need to prepare anything for our defense for our pretrial that's upcoming.  Any advice?    1. Should I be working to build a defense?  I have photos of damages, harassment, texts proving he still has my jewelry, proof he deposited all the wedding money into his own account, credit card statements proving I purchased a bulk of premarital items that he wont let me retrieve, etc. But my lawyer says I don't need any of that.  2. Does he have a shot at my 401k? Does he have a shot at the money saved between marriage date and now? Or between marriage date and date which I left the martial residence?  3. What happens after the pretrial?  Wishing I was more educated on my rights. Please help. Thank you Reddit fam.	No
376	I recently moved to Texas to be closer to my son. The agreements we had before this move (through the courts) was 50/50 legal custody and 100% physical to the mom with myself getting reasonable visitation. It was going mediocre, with the mom being flaky with available times or canceling on me last minute saying other things came up. I already have a court date in August to get formal visitation. On July 6 the mom told me she was going to Washington state to visit family and would be back July 28, today. Last night at 8 pm Washington time she texts me she might be back now August 10th. This has all been through texts and she won't return my calls. I have been unable to serve her court papers since she has been gone.  1) Is this some sort of violation of reasonable visitation or does it not matter since I do not have custody? Is it worth it to have my lawyer mention it to the judge?  2) will this get in the way of my court date since she has not been served yet? Who even knows if she will come back 8/10?  Also just me venting, she claims she works but after this I am posivite she does not have a job and is lying about that.  Thanks!	No
377	Hi Reddit,  Moving out question about my fridge and annoying roommate. So I am moving out of my 3 bdrm apartment in Indiana when lease ends, July 31 and have utilities set to disconnect then. I and one roomate are moving out, but the third roomate renewed lease and found two new roomates.  She is in a different country for the month, and I believe has not set up utilities after I have told her she needs an account. I emailed management, and they told me she does need an energy account to start Aug 1.  I am worried about leaving the fridge plugged in for a month, which management has told me to do. No one will move into the apartment until August 20, though the lease starts Aug 1. She has a ton of food in there which will spoil if she does not have electricity. I do not want to get charged for damage/rot if she does not set up electricity...I would rather just chuck her food but I'm not sure if I will get in trouble.  I feel it is not my responsibility to make sure she sets up an account.  What should I legally do ?  TL;DR unsure about leaving fridge plugged in when roomate not setting up utilities	No
378	"First post here, apologies to mods/everyone if I am missing anything. I'm sure I did.   Thanks for taking a look. Here are the basics that I know.   The 1st floor unit flooded The owners insurance is paying for the repairs from the walls in 1st floor owner Stephen thinks it will flood again because the sump pump backed up  Apparently the developer used fill around the foundation containing some type of debris that is now filtering into the sump pump and breaking it. So he is correct it will likely continue to flood   He wants to spend $5000 for a forensic engineer to come evaluate the foundation+ floor and take samples from around the outside of the foundation to asses the fill used.   The engineer will then make an assessment on the costs to fix everything   He then wants to use this assessment to take the developer to court to pay for the needed fixes to solve the issue.   He has touched base with a firm who specializes in this litigation who has ""won numerous claims"" similar to this, they told him this is an open shut case with multiple precedents set.   This had been an issue previously and the developer admitted fault and came and made repairs... but Obviously did not work.   The 3 years liability for the developer runs out October 31st of this year.   I have so many questions... Is the association liable for this? Shouldn't this have been disclosed prior to my purchase?  If so can I sue them to remove myself from any liability for repairs needed for the building?"	No
379	"My wife and step son have been given injunctions from his ex-fiance in a malicious manner. He was served first and we just worked out how to get him out of the house he owns with her. He was the one seeking legal advice from officers because she was being violent and destructive. Officer told him there wasn't really anything that could be done since she also owned the house. In response to the officer contacting the ex, she filed an injunction and won, taking away some of his rights and putting it on his record. After the injunction the ex was attempting to contact my wife and not leaving her alone, so my wife filed for an injunction against her. In the interest of trying to never acknowledge the ex again, my wife did not go to the hearing. In response, the ex filed an injunction on my wife. What is worse is the ex works for my wife's pain management doctor. Between that and the ex knowing how much the two are into owning guns and going to the range, this is clearly malicious. She is constantly telling lies to persuade the judge to grant these injunctions. I feel like the judge(s) would pass any and every injunction presented to them at this point.   What I am asking is will legal action be worth pursuing?   I left out a lot of detail for simplicity but I think I have touched on the main points. What this woman is doing is one of those things where you say ""there ought to be a law against this.""

380	I'm self representing right now. My ex got an attorney and asked for a continuance. He was arrested but not charged since it was his first physical, and an apparent minor, offense. I have over 70 pages attached to the restraining order detailing the abuse, however, and the statement I wrote that I was going to say today included more dates of verbal abuse and threats.   I have a few questions.   My local DV legal aid may not be able to represent me due to having so many other cases, but I'm not in the financial situation to get a lawyer otherwise. I have called a few places to see their rates but I'm pretty sure it won't be possible. I'm also 32 weeks pregnant right now, 35 weeks when we go back.   So, my questions are:  - What should I do in order to be completely prepared for what this might consist of if I cannot find an attorney to represent me?   - I've googled and googled and googled. It seems honestly hopeless, but are there other organizations that can help me? (Trying not to name drop. It rhymes with Steve.)   - What should I expect from his attorney, if anything?  - His lawyer offered me a stipulation of a 6m-1y temporary restraining order. I've heard it's not wise to take it. Why?  Thank you in advance.	No
381	My parents have a roommate/ex-friend who has been living with them approximately 2-3 years, and they have had a falling out.  She has become rude (swearing at them, ignoring requests for monetary help she used to provide), and is ignoring things like cleaning up after herself and her animals.  She used to be an ideal roommate, but you know, stuff happens.  I told my parents to make her sign a lease when she got there, but they never did.  I told them that it would protect them if/when this went sour.  I can't blame them- they have never lived with roommates, and they haven't experienced the kind of shit that can go down when  personalities clash (I sure have...).  She gets her mail sent to their house, and I believe she is a legal tenant.  She told them that she will leave by the 22nd of this next month, but in reality, if she hasn't been sent an eviction notice, she can stay as long as she wants.  I have looked up some forms for them to send her, but they all cite lease violations for notice of eviction, and since she hasn't ever signed a lease, how would they go about evicting her?  Do they have to have her sign a new lease, and then evict her when she violates it?  I am totally lost on this subject, so any help is much appreciated!	No
382	Hi legal advice! This is one of my favorite subs and an old situation has been bugging me on and off for years. At the insistence of my partner at the time I let the situation go but I've always wondered what I might have done.  My partner and I lived in a daylight basement of a split house - we had the entire basement and our neighbors the whole top. When moving in, the landlord mentioned in passing past plumbing issues but said all had been resolved. After a few months, our section flooded with backed up wash and toilet water (approximately 2-3 inches of poop scented water), leading to the damage of some electronics. The culprit was deemed the upstairs neighbors flushing 'flushable' wipes which caught in and blocked a poorly designed section of plumbing, leading to sewage backing up through a floor drain. Upon talking to the plumber, the landlord had been previously advised the system would continue to backup until the bad piping was replaced but he had elected to do nothing. Basically, he lied to us about the plumbing issues being rectified. We confronted him about this and, as he claimed to have insufficient funding to fix actually fix the issue, offered to let us out of our lease early and with only ten days notice. He also offered, via email, to replace the electronics if we provided him with an appraisal of value.  We proceeded to find another home while the apartment filled with sewage water another three times. We literally found floating nuggets of feces at one point. The smell was awful so we stayed with my parents. During this time, the landlord became aggressive, repeatedly telling us that he would hold us fully responsible if he found we had contributed to the clogging in any way. I provided the valuation and the landlord dragged his feet, never giving me a date for which I'd get a check. After a couple of weeks, I demanded an update on the status of the reimbursement. He claimed due to my rudeness he had rescinded his offer to replace my damaged goods. We attempted to get the plumber to provide us with written documentation regarding the landlord's refusal to fix the plumbing. They called the landlord to get his permission, and he promptly called and lambasted us.  Upon finding a new unit, we gave written notice and calculated prorated rent for ten days. After delivering the notice to the landlord, he became extremely aggressive, saying we would pay for the entire month of rent or he would take us to court. I wanted to prorate the amount anyhow, especially since the apartment was uninhabitable, but my ex-partner was spineless and insisted we just give in and forget it. I was a chump and went along with her, despite wanting to take him to court.  After leaving, he refused to perform a post-move walk-through with us but deducted the entirety of our deposit due to the state of the apartment, all caused from backed up sewage, and claimed the window mount air conditioners were all missing, a complete fabrication, and demanded we compensate him for their value. I told him to get bent and he threatened to sue but never did. All in all, we were out about $1200 (~$2500 if you count the electronics), not a lot but a sizable sum at the time.  Oh sages of /r/legaladvice, what sayest ye? Should I have taken it to small claims court or was it not worth the trouble, as my ex-partner insisted? I actually still have everything documented, could I possibly even sue now, four years later?	No
383	I got a speeding ticket about a week ago in Florida. Not my county but next over. Its only $131 and I just want to pay it and get it done with. I called and the lady said give it a few days and told me to check again and I did and its still not there. They use a 3rd party ncourts for payments. They have no record nor the county clerks office! Don't they have to make it available for me to pay? What are my options here? Should I challenge it? I dont mind paying I just need it taken care off to not worry. What should I do, and the officer also did not mention anything about points on my licence, is was doing 79 in a 70. He followed me for 25 min through another county until I entered his just to nail me.	No
384	I bought my home about 3 years ago.  I had seen that the FHA was changing their rules for cancelling PMI, I made sure I got a conventional loan and could cancel the PMI when I had 80% LTV, which I double checked on the mortgage papers I signed.  About 6 months after I bought the home, I was informed that Fannie Mae was buying my mortgage and BlahBank would service it.  The letter they sent informed me nothing would change except where I sent my payments.  Now, I've reached an 80% LTV through a combination of my payments and the house appreciating.  I called BlahBank to remove the PMI.  They researched my mortgage and sent me a letter saying that I have to meet Fannie Mae's standards to remove the PMI, which are stricter than my mortgage documents.  I spoke to another representative from BlahBank told me that because Fannie Mae owns the mortgage, they have to follow those policies.  He's said he would look into it and send me some paperwork, but I'm dubious they'll send me anything besides a restatement of my last letter.  Waiting until I qualify to remove my PMI under Fannie Mae will cost me around $5-6K.  That's enough to hurt, but likely not enough to justify hiring an attorney.  Isn't the mortgage I signed a contract?  Can Fannie Mae unilaterally change the terms just because they bought the debt?  If the next letter comes with the same information, I'm planning on sending a QWR.  Is this the kind of situation those letters are used for?	No
385	My dad owns a small business in a mall in Southern California, but the landowner/mall owner has given him an eviction notice to leave because they want more profitable businesses. He's looking into other locations, but my father's unsure of how to negotiate. This is his primary source of income. I honestly feel like the landowner is going to charge the rent at a ridiculous price just to force my dad out. We know that the landowner has already done this to three other family businesses in the mall. Each time he says he's sympathetic and will help them relocate to a less popular area in the mall, but he has gone back on his word with all three. We don't really have the financial means to sue.We've also recently paid for new carpeting in the space because a neighboring business leaked water. Please help! :(	No
386	I'm 17 at the moment and want my baby's father in the delivery room. My dad threatened me saying he will call the cops if my baby daddy showed up and I'm scared because BD has statutory rape charges since he is 21. After my baby is born I know my dad wont let my BD see his child either. My mom is on board with my dad. Is there anything I can do? I don't want to be at home because my parents are emotionally abusive but I can't move out since I'm 17. I know in Texas it is legal to move out (I love in Texas) but I have to be financially responsible for myself and my baby. I rely on my partner, but my parents have and will try everything they can to make sure my partner is in jail. Is there anything I can do? Or he can do, considering he has statutory rape charges?	No
387	"My father was insured under Medicare and was diagnosed with diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis by his ""primary physician"" (which is basically a group of nurse practitioners) back in August-October 2016. They took x-rays and claimed that the mass in his right lung was due to his lung slowly hardening from pulmonary fibrosis. My father's condition grew worse over the next couple months and my mother requested for him to be admitted to the ER for further examination. They denied my father this opportunity because they said his condition ""wasn't severe enough."" They led my father to believe that his drastic weight loss was from diabetes and that his breathing issues derived from pulmonary fibrosis.  On May 3rd, 2017 he was admitted to the ER because he had trouble breathing. They took a biopsy and determined that he had Stage 4 Lung Cancer. On June 2nd, he passed away.  What can I do? What documents will I need to defend my case?"	No
388	I live in Virginia. I pay child support, I dont make a lot given I am still in college. My ex is going to college too and needs day care for the kid. She said my child support will most likely go up. If I am already paying child support at a set amount relative to my income, is it really going to go up and how much. I am trying to talk with her about going together and finding a nice place we both agree on since i might be paying for it, I have a right in where he goes right? Speaking of rights, I havent been to court yet to establish my time with him, I work all the time and go to school and can see him only when I am free. It works, but should I go to court and get it all down for the record? I am 24 she is 25 and still lives at home with the kid her 28yo brother and her mom, I live on my own with roommates. What is best for the kid is for her to watch him, but once I graduate and get a job, I want to get 50/50 so I don't have to worry about being screwed in child support. What is my best option, I can provide further details if needed. Thanks &lt;3	No
389	My friend and I had signed a lease and gave our banking information for an apartment unit on July 27th for one year.  Today I found out that our unit has been double booked and the lease has been signed by other people who had signed to pay a higher rent ($1495, we signed for $1150).   Apparently, the owners said our rental price was too low for the three bedroom unit we are renting..but we had already signed the lease with the property manager or whoever was showing us the property with that price ($1150).   She's calling me back later today, but I just want to know what I need to do or say. We had signed the lease already, can they just drop us like that?  I have an email copy of the lease with the rent stated and date we signed.	No
390	My son is currently in an inpatient psych unit. He may be discharged within the next couple of days because his insurance doesn't think he needs that level of care. His psychiatrist disagrees, but insurance has the final word. It has been mentioned to me that his father and I could say we aren't taking him home because we couldn't provide the care he needs and then the state would step in. This is called a 51A I'm told.   I have no desire to do this and will only do this if we feel he will hurt himself or others once he is home. This is one of the reasons he is inpatient at the moment. He is absolutely no better today then when he went in there 2 weeks ago.   Anyone have information on what happens if we do this? How do we get control back of our son? Who would make his medical decisions? Would we be able to see him?	No
391	"I bought a house about nine months ago for my mom and sisters to live in. I'll call it my house for ease, but I don't live there. I have met the neighbor but have had little interaction with him. We aren't in good or bad terms, just neutral.     The backyard neighbor and my house share a property line and a single shared fence of 88 feet. The fence is a wooden privacy fence that is nailed from their side. The fence is older but solid. A few slats are kind of loose and I'm sure there a few nails popping out (I can't tell for sure though, because the nails are all on his side). He also shares a fence with his next door neighbor, the exact same fence (age and style and condition).     This past spring they extended the fence to divide our side yards for the purpose of enlarging the fenced in area of their backyard. This new fence is bright and shiny and perfect in comparison to the older, shared fence. He asked if we wanted to replace our ""old falling down fence"" while he was extending his. I was out of town but told him I didn't think so, although he was welcome to have his fence guy send me an estimate. He did, an estimate of $2000, to which the neighbor added he would pay $200. I didn't respond to it (was out of town caring for ailing grandparents and life got busy, plus that's kind of a laughable offer).     Last week he sent me a text that said his niece had run into the fence and gotten cut and needed stitches and ""could we PLEASE start looking at replacing the fence or taking care of much needed repairs?""    I have no problem at all with taking 50% financial responsibility for replacing a few slats and adding some screws where nails are popping out. I do not want to replace the whole perfectly good fence, almost entirely at my cost, simply because he wants me to. I suspect that he would like his whole backyard to match his new shiny fence section. I would even take 100% responsibility and go replace the few bad boards myself but I would have to jump the fence and go in his backyard to do so.     I am worried he might try to sue if I don't replace the fence, claiming I was negligent or something. I'm not sure why he thinks I should pay $1800 and him $200, or what I can do other than pay a contractor a crap ton of money to replace a perfectly good fence just to cover my butt.     Any advice or suggestions?   TL;DR: neighbor wants me to pay for and replace a perfectly good shared fence, I can't do the minor needed repairs myself because it's his yard, and I'm worried he trying to establish grounds to sue me."	No
392	"Hi folks,  I live in a 3-person apartment in California. All three of us are on the lease. I suspect one roommate might be encouraging the landlord to evict the other two of us. I don't believe our small city has any specific rental laws re; eviction, so we're just bound by state law. The roommate's complaints:  * My other roommate occasionally plays music too loud in his room, though not late a night. * We mop, but don't mop frequently enough. * We scrub the counters and sinks, but not frequently enough. * We, infrequently, leave a pan or two in the sink overnight (once every two weeks or so). * Sometimes, small messes (e.g. a bit of flour powder from cooking) are left scattered too long on the sink top. This usually gets cleaned up quickly (e.g. soon after cooking) but every month or so, we might * The smell of the foods we cook bother him, though we run the fan and open the window. * I once restarted a what I thought was a malfunctioning router while he was gaming (I didn't know he was home). * I make too much noise walking in the apartment (creaky floorboards and I usually stay up until 1:30, though I try my best to slink and wear slippers). * We don't shut the lights off every time we leave the room. We do when we intend to permanently leave, but not always if we're going to other rooms to retrieve something or take a call.  Otherwise, we pay our rent, treat the apartment well (the landlord frequently comments how amazing it looks), keep things always sanitary, and don't engage in illegal activities. Does my roommate have a case that the other roommate and I are a ""nuisance"" and thus could be evicted for cause?  **Context for what set my roommate off**  My upset roommate frequently sends out long and vaguely threatening rants to me and my other roommate (""There's scum on the sink behind the faucet. Here's a picture. Clean this up. I will not ask you again"" ""You left your cutting board on the counter and I wanted to use the counter. Move it immediately"" ""You left the dishwasher door open too much. I had to close it.""). I have many emails and text messages containing these rants.   While I was away on vacation, he sent me some pictures of a extremely minor mess (flour spill + oil spatter; 10 sec clean up time), which I didn't make, and told me to clean it up. I finally lost my temper and to him to knock it off and not bother me on vacation and that the kitchen was perfectly usable in the state it was in. He ranted over text message for a while and then told me that I'm welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. I told him he's welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. He told me that he was the original tenant in the apartment and kindly allowed me to move in and live with him and therefore am morally bound to follow his rules.  ** My commentary**  I agree that, given the standards of cleanliness my roommate demands, the other roommate and I are a nuisance ***for him***. However, I argue that his standards of cleanliness are unreasonable and that my other roommate and I are already meeting him much more than half way. Frankly, I think he has serious control issues and possibly has some form of mental disorder (e.g. no eye contact, shuffling walk, no furniture in his room, never laughs or smiles, never accepts invitations to socialize, etc...).  He does have a point that my other roommate and I are messier than him. However, that's because he doesn't actually use the apartment. He comes out of his cave in once in a blue moon and has a fit when he sees that everything isn't spotless at the moment (i.e. he doesn't consider how long a mess has been there). He doesn't cook or use the kitchen or use the living area. His complaints seem to be primarily about minor aesthetic issues that eventually do get cleaned up regardless or things that he could solve on his own without any difficulty (e.g. he can spend 3 seconds moving a cutting board someone forgot, in a rare instance, to put away if he wants to use the counter). We all have our own bathrooms, so thankfully that's not an issue.  We also know that he allowed the apartment to be illegally sublet at a profit prior to our move-in, but we don't have any evidence beyond the word of the guy who sublet the apartment (and maybe he has some paper-work, but he probably doesn't want to get involved).  We also know that he had previous conflicts with one or two of the previous tenants.  I asked him to compromise and understand that living with roommates always comes with minor annoyances but he told me something like, ""It's unfair that you would expect me to do extra work for anything I didn't cause."" In the context of this conversation, it was regarding the fact I forgot to close the dishwasher door after unloading and he had to close it as he walked by.  ** My question **  * Does he have any legal basis to get my other roommate and I evicted? * Now that he's officially complained to my landlord, what options do my other roommate and I have to present our case and make sure the landlord doesn't see us as bad guys? Both of us intend to move out when the lease terminates, regardless, but I'd prefer to not have to deal with any ensuing landlord issues."	No
393	Hi there,  Few days ago, I received a letter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stating in that I had used the toll road twice in locations in Massachusetts in which that wasn't me. The requested payment was $2.60. Even though the amount was very little, I do not want to pay for the amount for something I didn't do.   So, I started googling on what I should do because I was afraid this was some sort of scam. I started reading articles about a lady who didn't know she was being charged and ended up owing $49,000 as a result. I started worrying about what I should do to resolve this matter so it doesn't come back to me again.  I apologize if this is not the right post for this subreddit. Could you please guide me to the correct one if that's the case? Thank you for taking your time to read my post. :)	No
394	My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	No
395	I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	No
396	I'm designing a product which moves a bed out of the way to enhance a small room space.   It uses motors and a controller. Unless the CRAZY happens 4(1500lb) cables breaking it will be safe.   It will not allow anyone to be on the bed when moving and will move slowly as not to injure. It will also stop the motor if there is an obstruction.  I'm unfamiliar with liability law/insurance so I'm wondering how to go about getting this started.   I understand developing an LLC to separate the company liabilty from my personal assets but I don't understand how much coverage I should get when taking costs into account.   Thanks R	No

398	"Hi all,   Here's the situation: *In Nov of 2016, I go apartment hunting. My husband really wants a pool and we find a building downtown with one. I'm meh on it, but he is really keen on it. The rent is $2400. It's a 15 year old building. *Our second choice was was a place for $1900 in a nearby neighborhood. New construction. *In the immediate neighborhood, around our building rent ranges from $2000 up. Another contender nearby was $2800 for the same size, but amazing views and brand new.  *The pool was the thing that influenced the decision. *Moved in in December 2016. *The pool was closed for remodel at the end of January 2017, along with the rest of the building - lobby, all amenities, etc. *It's August and it's still closed. :) The last note that went up was stating that it would be done by end of July. We've spent 6 of 8 months living without the one thing we wanted here. *ZERO was said about the impending remodel. *Yesterday, when having a ""lively"" discussion, one of the leasing agents stated that ""[Management] didn't want us telling about the remodel..."" *Yes, the rental agreement has a note that management can close amenities, but the common sense reading is that this is for a temporary and limited duration - not a half year!  Naturally, we're pissed. We are moving out, but it's been something that sticks in our side like a thorn. If we had known, we would not have moved into an impending construction zone. These types of projects don't happen overnight, so it seems unreasonable they they wouldn't have known this was coming. Their failure to inform us of this seems like there's some culpability here.   What are my options? Ideally, I would like to drag them into small claims and go for a small sum of money from them. That said, I'm not sure if this is small claims eligible. Thoughts?   Located in Washington State."	No
399	At the beginning of July, I had bought a money order to pay my rent to my landlord. His office was closed for a small vacation and he was due back the next day, so I filled it out, put it in an envelope and dropped through the drop slot at his office. It landed about five feet from the door. This was on July 3rd.  July 7th - he messages me about missing a rent payment. I get up with the money order vendor and it was cashed on the evening of the third. They won't tell me where or who; I have to pay for an expedited scan of the endorsement.   July 8th - I contact local police to file a report and am told that nothing is able to be done until we learn whether or not this was a mistake on my LLs realty office or it was stolen.  July 10th - I receive a scan via email of the front and back of the money order. LLs name is scribbled out and another name is written above it. LL has no idea who that is, but i recognize the name from around town. I file a police report again and give info on who I am pretty sure this person was.  No info is included on where cashed the order; am told I can receive that info via mail appx. 2 weeks later.  July 21 - I receive the letter and am told it was cashed at a bank one town over in Ohio. I go over there and they say it was done via their ATM and they have no idea why it was approved as those are apparently approve at an office whenever someone wants to cash via ATM. They tell me there is nothing they can do more than just confirming it was cashed at that ATM.  July 22nd - Went to local PD and gave info on where it was cashed.   That's all that I've done so far. My landlord is not wanting to file a report themselves unless it's required to get the rent payment back. He is obviously wanting the missed payment and I simply can't just give him another payment. What are my options in terms of recouping my money?   At this point, do I just wait until local police get back to me? Is the bank liable for cashing the forged money order? Since it's been cashed, I assume moneygram is going to say no on a refund. Do I just wait at this point?  Thank you all for taking the time to read this.	No

When I called to inform her that she needs to provide this list and also include accrued interest, she claims she only sent the letter to fill a legal void and is intending on taking me to court for damages not covered by the damage deposit as well as rent for every month the apartment sits empty.  As far as the damages go, she needed to paint and replace a 12x12 section and a 12x3 section of carpet, however, she stated that she is replacing the appliances and redoing the bathroom as well as the kitchen counter and backsplash and suing us for those costs not covered by our $975 deposit.

401	"My parents were in the process of renovating an expensive historic home when they divorced, ten years ago.   The mortgage has been paid one way or another since then, but nobody has liven in it, but both are still on the mortgage.  Parent A would like to get the home to rentable condition, and start making income. A has already invested money in restoring the home.  Parent B would like nothing to do with Parent A, hence why this issue has not been addressed for so long.   Parent A is concerned about Parent B coming after A's rental income or the value of the property, and wants B to sign a ""quit claim deed"", eliminating A's interest in the property.   I advised B not to sign anything, after some googleing suggested that this would not eliminate the responsibility to pay the mortgage.   Would it be possible to informally draft a contract that covers these concepts? Or is an attorney strongly advised in this situation?  - While A pays the mortgage, B won't make any claims or interfere. - If A pays off the mortgage (or refinances), B will sign the quit claim deed.  Both have a large amount of illiquid assets.   Any other advice?"	No
402	I know limited details about this, my friend was contacted by her uncle, he asked for a place to stay. He violated a probation in washington state, and had a warrant issued as a result. He came to Minnesota as he has a lot of extended family. He reached out to my friend asking for a place to stay, and she agreed.  Is letting him stay at her apartment illegal?  What sort of legal trouble could she face?  If they find him at her place what will happen to her?  Im trying to convince her its incredibly stupid to let him stay there, apparently he had federal marshalls show up at his home in washington, but he had already fled the state, so it seems pretty serious. Do marshall normally show up looking for someone over a probation violation, or is it possible he's commited a more serious crime and lying to my friend?	No

I slowed a little bit and was not in the lane of the bus. A person pulled out of the plaza unable to see my vehicle and hit in to my front fender. There is little damage to his vehicle. We exchanged information and got photos of the damage on both vehicles and license plates and insurance information. Police have not arrived yet and I have already made a claim. What next?

404	Have a rental property in Queens, NY, with a husband and wife on the lease and allowance for 1 dog. Tenants have been a nightmare (domestic disputes, cops called multiple times, late with rent, etc), and now are going through a divorce, and each is claiming that the other is responsible for rent and refusing to pay (lease lists them as jointly and severally liable). In addition last time I was on site for maintenance I saw they had 2 dogs there instead of the 1 allowed by the lease (but can't prove it otherwise, no photo).  Plan on starting eviction process and utilizing an attorney since I'm pretty sure this will go to trial, but wanted to see what typical costs would be for a fairly straight forward case for an attorney from start to finish (they draft letters, handle serving papers, filing with court, and going to court date etc.). Would it typically be a flat fee or an hourly rate?  Thanks!	No

My visitation is Saturdays, however, mom called visitation monitor Friday that we can't meet because she was home in South Carolina for a funeral.

406	I'm not sure this is the right sub, but someone told me I need a civil attorney, and the ones I've called about my issue have told me they don't handle this kind of thing. Not sure where to go.  So, in January I went on terminal/ transition leave (a period of vacation time accrued during your enlistment and used at the end of your contract to help your transition from active duty to civilian life). During this time you are still technically in the military and therefore covered by Tricare (the military's health insurance). I planned to start my new civilian job during my leave specifically so my health insurance would overlap and I wouldn't be left without.  I had just moved to my new location and was unexpectedly rushed to the ER, because of inadequate care previously provided to me at the military hospital I was stationed at. An improperly placed IUD that caused massive amounts of bleeding and needed to be removed. My primary military hospital denied the claim to Tricare (even though they were the ones who fucked up), leaving me with a $3,000 medical bill. I tried calling my primary care provider multiple times to get this fixed, I tried looking for a Tricare representative at the hospital and was told there wasn't one. I was even lied to at one point, told the necessary paperwork was sent in- only to follow up with Tricare for them to tell me they hadn't received a damn thing.  Conveniently everyone's voicemail box is full or they're not answering. Been given the runaround over and over again. Emails and promises gone unanswered, calls not returned, and no one of any use that I have talked to. I have been trying for five months in between my 10 hour work days and with the difficulty of a 3 hour time difference. I finally had to pay the damn bill, so now I'm in debt.  This is a breach of contract. I signed with the knowledge that I would have health insurance until I got out of the military. I feel like I've been taken advantage of; since I was so close to getting out, they probably figured there wasn't anything I could do about it. If you have ANY advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

408	So my husband left me basically overnight for a coworker of his. I've tried to be nice and let him see our son and even take him to his house that he shares with his new girlfriend.  My problem is that he will not see him unless he can take our son there and I'm uncomfortable with this because I don't know where they live or what the house is like therefore I have no idea where my 3 year old is when he's with his dad. His girlfriend is only 18 (he's 26) and has friends over etc. I don't know any of these people so I'm uncomfortable with it.  I have no money for a lawyer yet don't qualify for legal aid. I don't know what to do. I understand I can do a temporary custody order but I don't know how fast those are effective or how to fill out the forms or anything... any help would be appreciated I'm lost.	No
409	Looking for advice on how to apply for apartments with an emotional support dog. I haven't had luck finding dog friendly apartments but I want to know my options on notifying the potential landlord about my dog. I know that landlords can't discriminate based on ESA's but I'm worried that if I tell them about my dog they will make up another reason. Can I not inform them of my dog until after the lease has been signed? Or do I have to bring it up earlier in the process to avoid being on the wrong side of the law?	No
410	My friend recently got into a little legal trouble when he was drunk. He is required to take Random Enhanced BA (breath analysis) testing. His question was if there is a difference in the substances they test for in a regular BA test, and if there is a possibility that he would be randomly tested for something else. He wants to avoid further legal trouble so if anyone has any further information on the matter, it would be greatly appreciated.	No
411	I'll preface this by saying I've been ticketed for this before, went to court, did a day's community service, wiped my hands of it. So recently I was at a park drinking, some officers came around and ticketed me. Especially since I only thought it was a ticketable offense, mixed with the fact that it was dark out, me and my friends were not yelling or playing music, I stuck around after the cops left. Not even a half hour later some new cops came around and arrested me, telling me I shoulda listened the first time around. Now I'm facing a real court date.   Will they probably just give me a ticket in court or am I facing a real problem here? I had no other charges in the system when I left (I double checked). Should I get a lawyer? This is my first arrest ever so I have no idea how to handle this.	No
412	My best friend's father works for the MTA making $35/hr. All of his primary children are at least 18 years or older and are capable if not employed in a job. The issue involves financial and parental burdens on his children.  The father currently has two sets of families: the children and a passed wife he's lived with for at least 20 years, and another family birthed from infidelity dating back to about 15 years ago. He has rarely visited his second family until after the loss of his legal wife due to breast cancer 5 years ago.  The issue persists primarily on the financial impact that is affecting both his youngest son, age 23 (my best friend) and his oldest daughter, age 19. His 23 year old son has moved out since graduating college to Long Island. The father was assisting in paying student loans and is also responsible for the rent at the apartment he and his daughter live in. For the last two months at least, the father has rarely been home, when he does go home does not bring any food for the daughter, has stopped paying student loans, and is at least a month behind on rent. They fear he may be splurging his money on the other family or other things, but he is not around enough to confirm/deny that, nor does he often respond to their calls/messages. The daughter works a part time job until the fall semester starts and so she has been the one to maintain herself for the time being.  It's still unsure what will happen if another month's rent goes unpaid and if the daughter will be displaced and have to live somewhere else. Currently, grandparents are the most immediate resource even if their apartment is smaller and already crowded.   What options does my friend and his sister have for her living situation in particular? There's only so much I can do living in another state (TX) to try and help them out.   Any suggestions or advice are greatly appreciated.	No
413	I'm making a short documentary to submit to my university, and was wandering how I can keep within copyright laws. Im already getting music composed, but was looking at other options for some sequences.	No
414	"I recently moved out of Tacoma for work and had to break my lease early. I understand that I am responsible for the rent until they find a new tenant but the law only says ""reasonable attempt.""   I moved out two weeks ago and cleaned the place way better than it was when I moved in (3 months before) but they have not posted a listing for the apartment yet. The WA landlord tenant act says they don't have to drop everything and post it right away but they do need to make a reasonable attempt.   At what point can I stop paying rent because they are not doing anything and how would I go about it? I assume there is some process other than just stopping payments (which would probably not end well for me).   Side note - They are borderline slumlords that don't take care of the properties or fix problems. The place was infested with mold that started creeping back in after I moved in and I am very happy to be out of that place."	No
415	I have a friend who has a probation violation warrant out. He skipped out of dwai probation 3 years ago because his life was unstable. This was his first offense. Since then he's kept a steady job almost 2 years, started taking college courses and kept a stable apartment. He's ready to turn himself in and deal with the consequences. His goal is to get bail. Go to court. Hopefully be reinstated. Then comply with all probation rules and complete it. Any advice on to go about that? He has a lawyer who offered a flat rate of 2,000 for help. But he can't afford that and makes too much to qualify for a public defender.	No
416	"A little over a year ago my sister had her daughter (rightfully) taken away. A year later she had her daughter back for a home trial, and then got busted drinking and got arrested. The little girl is back in foster care, the same family she was with for almost a year.  Social Services is filing for permanency.    Through this whole process me and our mother have been trying to get information about how to be considered for taking care of the little girl. She is now 3 years old.  A month and a half ago I had a conversation with my sisters social worker who told me ""I shouldn't be telling you this but there are questions as to your mothers mental health"", and then asked me if I wanted to be considered an option for the little girl to live with and I said yes. She said she would send me paper work.     That night she left me a voicemail telling me ""we have no indication your mother has been ruled out as an option, in fact I don't have any indication that she's ever made herself known as wanting to be considered for taking care of Little Girl.""    My mom had social workers interview her at her home, she's constantly been asking for the paperwork she needs to fill out (She filled it out once and the County office claims they lost it.)   A few weeks ago Social Worker found out that all my phone calls are recorded, and told me to speak with her supervisor from now on instead of her.  I've since tried calling Social Workers Supervisor to ask about how to get the paperwork I need, no response.   My sister was served today. She has a Permanency hearing on Monday.  I texted Social worker and said that I was checking in about the paperwork she said she would send me a month ago. She then texted back and said ""I had to wait until the permanency petition was completed. I will be sending out letters hopefully this week.""   My concern is that this process is being pushed along because she wants the foster parents to get custody of Little Girl. They are great couple, but MN State Law as far as I know places a stress on the requirement to give special consideration to FAMILY first. And that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm suspicious that it's because one of the foster parents is her Coworker.  (they are both social workers for the county.)   I have: - Audio recordings of her making (seemingly unfounded) statements that there are ""Questions to my mothers mental health.""  - Audio recording of her telling me that my sisters previous case worker ""wasn't very good"" about keeping records.  - She also said that she hasn't really looked at any records that may have been kept because 'Up until now I haven't had any reason to.""  - There apparently doesn't need to be any record/proof that they made any effort to contact any family members whatsoever - She left me a voicemail telling me that she has ""no indication"" that my mother ever wanted to be considered as a placement option - I have the text from her saying that she couldn't send me the appropriate paperwork until the petition was complete   I've been trying to read up on everything but I can't comprehend fully if these are actual violations of her job, or if I am just biased in interpreting things.   Any help is so greatly appreciated!"	No
417	"So I recently moved into a new place, but my old landlord keeps dodging me. He keeps saying that he's sending my security deposit back from my old place, which I left absolutely spotless, but it's been two months and I'm still missing my entire deposit. I thought of recording him on the phone where I request either the bill for the damages or the deposit back, but don't know if this is the best idea. For the record his real estate ""company"" no longer exists and the only address is a PO box he gave me. Is this an issue of I should've been smarter to begin with or is there anyway I can still get my somewhat large deposit back? Thanks for all your help"	No
418	So I purchased a monitor in January and never opened it till this week since I was so busy with looking for a job, family members getting married and graduating. Online they advertised that the monitor is 60HZ but when i was calibrating my monitor it said that it was 50HZ.  Im not looking to sue. I just want a simple refund so i can buy another one.	No
419	"Hey everyone!  I'm a Canadian, wanting to attend a professional degree program in the US. I have some questions about US Education Law and would like to find a lawyer, but I'm currently in Canada where I'm assuming most Education Lawyers will be experts in law that is specific to Canada. Is it possible to ""meet"" with a lawyer remotely and where would be a good starting place to find such a lawyer?  Thank you."	No
420	Starting in September, I'll be moving into an apartment with 5 other tenants. It's been brought to my attention that one tenant, well call him Tommy, hasn't paid any of his fees yet (security deposit, last months rent) but has signed the lease. Is there anyway to remove him from the lease or is he legally contracted to pay up?	No
421	Last month I submitted a proposal to modify my child support. The child support was modified and I thought all was good. My ex wife said it was fair and was not fighting it. The letter I got said that no hearing is required unless one of the parties requests a hearing within 30 days of the notice and motion. I just got a summons to go to court next month over this. Why?	No
422	I have a new neighbor in my building and they're getting spectrum cable.   I rent, but my lease clearly defines the backyard as part of my lease. The spectrum cable trunk and taps are in my yard.  Given that my union is currently striking spectrum, the 'replacement workers' haven't undergone background checks or meaningful training, I have concerns about them breaking things in my yard, and i'm not comfortable with a scab in my yard unsupervised.   Can I legally restrict access to the yard, since my apartment is the only one with access?	No
423	I'm hoping this will be coherent but my head is still kind of spinning so we'll see.   My brother(M21) and his fiancé(F26) have twin boys (6 months). They are not married, they rent an apartment together. He is sole earner, she stays home with the kids. He is an alcoholic, he's textbook abusive (gas lighting, emotional abuse and two weeks ago he pushed her around enough to leave bruises) and it has come to light he's been cheating for who knows how long.   My SIL (for lack of a better term) is at a loss of what to do. She's at her mother's with the kids, but apparently there is nothing legally stopping my brother from forcefully taking the kids and going to NJ. SIL is concerned for the kids safety, my brother consistently drives drunk. She has photo evidence of the bruises he left, the cheating, the horrible things he says to her. But she doesn't have the money to retain a lawyer. And he has grandparents who are well off and have paid his way out of trouble for 21 years. He keeps threatening her that if she leaves, she'll never see the boys again and that his grandparents will pay for the best lawyer to destroy her.   Please help me find resources for her. What options does she have? Will she lose her kids to someone so toxic and harmful?	No
424	"Hi guys, sorry if this takes a while to read. I thank you for your patience.  To make a long story short: two months ago, someone messaged me asking for help with an investment fund. He said that he had spend 13 years working on an software trading program that accurately predicts the foreign exchange market. I realized that he was woefully unprepared to run or manage a fund and consulted him on how to set up a fund. He likely was not going to pay me but that's fine, I wanted him to succeed as accomplish his goals. I later realized that it was very unlikely he had programmed an worthwhile arbitrage code, as he claimed to have, because he showed a lack of understanding for basic macroeconomic concepts. Furthermore, his trading policies involve SEC violations and using boiler room tactics for obtaining funding. Additionally, he nonchalantly expressed that he could choose however much to give back to investors, whenever--indicating a ponzi scheme like distribution. When I expressed my disagreements, he commanded me to get back in line and told me to get him ""operating capital"" for his fund. He had also mentioned knowing cartel members (with implied threat), and saying that he wanted to work with them, thus signaling a money laundering scheme. I requested that he stop what he was doing and told him that I will not be providing him with operating capital. He then told me that he had recorded all of our conversations and will release all my information public (where I work, live, etc.). He will then call my workplace and pretend to be a client being harass by me, as well as actively seek out my clients and harass them. The gist of his intent is that it'd be easier for me to bribe him to stop, then to file all the legal proceedings to sue him. Furthermore, he is seeking out attorneys to assist him in harassing me as well as file a lawsuit for having called what he was doing a ponzi scheme.  --- My question is this: Assuming that he finds a corrupt attorney willing to assist him, do I have the grounds to sue this attorney for morality clause violations?"	No
425	Australian, but all help is welcome. Tenants that have been living there for around a year and a half have been crying their clothes and not using proper ventilation causing mold. I've made many attempts to fix the issue, installing fans and creating more ventilation (have evidence) yet they continue to keep causing it. They plan on breaking the lease which in fine with but not so happy they are attempting to get compensation for this. I plan on getting local advice soon but please comment, all help is welcome. Additionally I have evidence that I have made many attempts to do right by this current tenants: painting the house, fixing things/paying for fixing things.	No
426	Let me premise this with the statement that a) aside from a mild case of heat exhaustion on my roommate's part, we are both fine health-wise and b) we're not going to be TOO incredibly broken up if it turns out we can't do anything, it would just be a major help with this past month's expenses if we can get compensation.  The a/c unit in our apartment broke down a total of four different times before finally being replaced on the fifth incident we reported.  During the initial downtime, the temperatures in our apartment maxed out at about 95 degrees in the daytime.  We were told it was simply an issue with the capacitor, which they replaced.  It worked fine for a week, then cut out again.  Then it cut out about three days later.  The facility's repair guy brought in a portable window unit to help cool the apartment down while the repair went on over the next day and it was left with us by the repair guy to cool down the apartment faster.    After another couple of days, it broke down again, was fixed, then broke down yet again later that night.  The complex decided to completely replace the unit, and again we had the window unit for another four days or so while they worked and to help cool the place down once the A/C was back.  Our electric bill for this month is over $300 (we're in a two bed/two bath that is about 975 ft iirc, and our average summertime bill is about $200 or so at most).  I was wondering if we can ask for compensation since all of the extra cost came from running their a/c unit under the instruction of their repair guy.  Again, this is nothing major, and I'm not going to be upset if there's nothing we can really do, it would just be a help to deal with the bills for the month.	No
427	"My 21 year old deaf stepdaughter is a full time college student at a prominent university in New York - our home state is Florida. She signed a lease for an apartment at a student housing complex (not affiliated with her university) last November, along with four of her deaf friends. In the process, she signed my husband's name as a cosigner to this lease. We just found this out in the last two weeks.    To give you some background info, because of her deafness, she essentially operates on a lower maturity level than most people her age - she acts and functions on about a 16-17 year old level. While I understand this is not an excuse to not act like an adult, we genuinely believe she didn't understand what was happening or what she was doing or how serious it was (she STILL is having trouble understanding the gravity of the situation). The entire time she dealt with this student housing complex, she thought she was filling out an application, and that was what she had communicated to my husband and I at the time. When she asked him for information about financials, he thought it was for a credit check for the application. She rushed all this at us last year in a few hours one afternoon while we were at work - everything had to be immediate because the housing complex was pressuring them to apply because ""all the apartments were going to be leased so fast."" He never saw the lease, and she signed his name to it without him knowing she was doing that. He would not have signed this lease if he'd known or read it. She didn't tell us anything about this until two weeks ago, because suddenly all her friends are also not going to live in this apartment because none of their government funding, which all five of them rely fully on, is going to cover off campus housing, even though the apartment complex told them it would be no problem. So really, there are five students here who have signed this lease, and none of them plan to live there.    I have no idea what anyone else's parents are doing, but we've tried explaining the situation to the apartment complex, and they are adamant that the lease is binding and the only option is for the students to find someone to relet their rooms to. However, if none of them move in August 1, the entire rent defaults and is due immediately for everyone. They all live down here in Florida, and only are able to talk to their friends and post on facebook groups to find someone to relet to, which is proving futile. The apartment complex has placed them on a ""relet list"" but they only refer to that list once the entire complex is full, which it isn't at this time. We're now on the hook for over $10k for this because my husband's name is on this lease.    I don't know enough about real estate law, or if there's anything we can do about this situation, or if we're just stuck because our name is legally on this lease. We're trying to get in touch with the legal services at the school, but because it's still summer, it's hard to get a hold of anyone. Is there any way we can get out of this lease? What would happen if we pursued legal action against our daughter for signing my husbands name without her knowledge? While paying the $10k bill monthly or immediately is really going to be incredibly hard for us, we could feasibly consider paying for a lawyer if it could get us out of this lease.    TL;DR - deaf stepdaughter fraudulently signed our name to lease as cosigner for student housing; will not be living there, can't get out of lease.  Is there anything we can do?"	No
428	"Company A provided service to two appliances in my rental house in 2013 and 2015. My tenants put in a maintenance request on one of the appliances a few days ago and the company I hired for this service reported that there was evidence of improper work on the appliance in question. They checked the other appliance in the house and found that the same evidence was there for that one as well. The certified technician reported that both appliances are in need of being replaced and gave me an $8k estimate for the work. He said he could possibly ""put a bandaid on them for the short term"" but put it in writing that in his professional opinion, they need to be replaced. The bandaid costs $1600 and he said he cannot warranty the work. He told me outright that he could perform the service, charge me $1600, and an hour later tell me it didn't work costing me the $8000 to have them replaced.   I asked the technician for some details about why he thought it was the previous company, and he gave me some jargony information. I have evidence that Company A serviced both appliances.   I spoke to a lawyer who said it sounds like an open and shut case. That he'd work on a contingency fee, submit the paperwork, and expect to hear back from their insurance company for a settlement (he said that's what typically happens). I know for a fact Company A has liability insurance.   I'm not sure if it matters or not, but the two appliances have been serviced 9 times in five years by Company A, and there's always been some problem with the work. I don't think one of the 9 times featured them fixing an issue the first time out. It always warranted a second call. One of the appliances was installed brand new by Company A in 2013 and a major part of the other appliance was installed brand new in 2015. Typical lifetime of each produce is 10-20 years.   Do I really have a case?   The biggest issue for me is that I have tenants that I have to take care of immediately. I can't wait for the courts to go through, and my lawyer advised that I go ahead and get the appliances replaced because I have tenants. This is really costly as a landlord, and I only became a landlord after my job transferred me unexpectedly. I wasn't able to sell my house (thanks housing market crash!), so I got renters. I can pay for the $8k, but it's going to put me in a bit of a bind if anything else comes up.  If it were me living in the house, I'd probably try to tough it out until I get more clarity from my lawyer and see how the court case was going to go. I might even just try the $1600 fix and see if it keeps me well for a few months for me to get some extra funds together if anything else occurs. But again, my tenants have to come first here.   Thanks for any advice you can give!"	No
429	I live in a basement apartment in a condo. I rent from the owner of said condo. There is another basement apartment in the same basement, but separate.   In my unit, there is no smoke or CO detector. I really didn't notice at first but I just checked everywhere to be safe (as I have one very small window and was making a safety plan). Am I supposed to have one? It makes me a little nervous, if I can be totally honest. Can I ask for one to be put in?   I am 99 percent sure that there isn't a state law that requires this, but I'm pretty sure there are district rules regarding it. Just not sure where to find it. The county is Boulder if it is helpful.   Anyway I'm just trying to find out if this should be provided by the landlord or if I need to get a battery-powered one or something like that.   Thanks!	No
430	I'd like to file a motion for my ex and into only communicate through a court approved site like MFW. My ex is either hostile/vulgar or ignores important questions regarding custody. He lately will only communicate with me through the kids which is not beneficial to them in any way. How do I go about filing a motion without hiring a lawyer? Does anyone have experience with MFW?	No
431	Recently got my first traffic citation for speeding and for tinted windows. Want to know if i should plead not guilty on both tickets and go to court and when i go to court, remove the tints on my car and plead not guilty and plead guilty and pay the fine for the speeding with the possibility of not having points added to my license. Like i said, this is my first traffic citation. How should i approach this? Any advice is greatly appreciated.	No
432	My in-laws recently rented a vacation house for a week so the whole family could spend some time together.    While there, my three year old son got into some nail polish, unbeknownst to us, and tried to paint his nails.  Unfortunately more paint got on the rug in the room than it did on his nails.    We tried all week to get the nail polish out, but were only mildly successful. At the end of the week we told the in-laws what happened, and offered to pay whatever cleaning services were necessary.     We just spoke to the in-laws this morning and they informed us that we've been billed $2,300 for the rug. They're going to send us the invoice, but it sounds like the rental company is actually making us buy the rug itself.     I am also going to ask my in-laws for the rental agreement, because $2.3k seems absolutely insane for nail polish spilled on the floor at a *rental* property.     I am pretty sure that legally they can't charge us for more than the rug's current value, so I will be looking into where they got the rug from- but what else should I be looking at to cover all of my bases?	No
433	I was recently using Airbnb to rent a room for the summer (~10 weeks) in Brooklyn. The host and I got along well enough at first, but she is far more germaphobic and detail-oriented than I. She has a long list of very minor rules (e.g. close the shower curtain when it's not in use), and I failed to comply with a few of them. They were innocent mistakes and no actual damage was done to her property or the apartment, but the Airbnb policy does allow her to cancel the stay if I fail to follow her rules. She's also not obligated to refund me anything less than 30 days after the cancellation. I am not disputing that she is within her contractual rights to do this.  I politely requested she at least put the room back up on Airbnb and refund me the remaining rent if she finds a replacement. She adamantly refused, saying that because she's not in the wrong she doesn't need to do anything like that and can just keep my rent. Is she required to take steps to mitigate my losses here? There were 3 weeks left in the agreement, which comes out to over a thousand dollars in rent. I understand I can't demand an outright refund, but is she required to at least put the room back up for rent and pay me back what she can if she finds a replacement?  Additionally, I believe her landlord does not permit residents to rent out rooms, but I'm not sure if that has any relevance here.  Thank you.	No
434	I never took my husband's last name and now we're divorcing. We have a child together and I'd really like to have the same last name (his). Would he be able to protest my taking the same name as my daughter?	No
435	I'm a 2L student currently, and my friend is having all sorts of issues with his previous landlord. Basic facts:  * Signed lease for the apartment (never got his copy of it though), landlord only owns 2 units * Broke the lease 3 months early and moved to Kentucky, agreed on a subletter with the landlord * Assessed damages (all legit, he kinda wrecked the apartment) for the entirety of the deposit when he moved out and subletter moved in * Now the lease has officially expired (yesterday) and the landlord sent him a bill (via text message) for another $430 beyond the security deposit he has already kept. New charges are for additional damages cause by my friend that 'weren't assessed' when he moved out, plus a couple cleaning charges.  My questions: how much time can my friend negotiate for to pay back the $430 in additional damages? What kind of things should he be asking to see from the landlord?  Thanks!	No
436	Water service stopped completely 2 days, ago going into this weekend. Looking for advice on how to either get regulatory leverage on the Landlord to get the water running again, or to be able to use this situation as a means of legally breaking my lease, if possible (this is the latest in a long running series of absurdities in this living situation and I'm tired of fighting).  In the bills that the landlord sends out so that we can pay our split of the it (single meter for 3 units) there is is an outstanding balance of over $15,000. I guess they finally decided enough was enough  I've called code enforcement on the matter but have not been able to make contact with the officer overseeing my case, and now it's the weekend and I doubt they have weekend hours, though her voicemail doesn't explicitly state this. I'm bracing to go without water though I will make calls tomorrow at the least.  Is there anything more I can do? are there any regulatory agencies that could force the landlord to be proactive on this? Is there any way I could use this situation to break my lease?  I don't want to take over the water bill b/c of not wanting to be accountable for collecting bill payments from 3 different people and possibly being stiffed and because the usage rate indicates that there has to be some kind of leakage going on.  Any advice would be appreciated.	No
437	After many years I finally decided to cut off contact with my mother a few months ago.  I'm well into adulthood, but the abuse has had some pretty lasting effects.  She came to my house tonight, unannounced, at supper time to give my children birthday gifts.  While she was here she mentioned that she was thinking seeking a lawyer with the intention of suing for visitation rights.  What legal rights does she have to my children?	No
438	It is a laughable number. This is in addition to the $1200 deposit they're keeping. We left the house in good condition, given we had lived in a 5 person roommate situation for 3 years. We weren't expecting the full deposit back, but were hopeful for a couple hundred bucks or so. Any holes or dents were nicely patched, we steamcleaned the carpets, professionally cleaned the empty house, pressure washed the garage floor and every concrete patio, cleaned the gutters....you get the gist. The repairs they are charging us for are absurd and unreasonable.  What options do we have to go against this? They are threatening to send the debt to collections if we dont pay within 30 days. There are 2 names on the lease, do we each get that debt? Is this one of those things that they throw out an insanely high number and settle for way leas later? Does renters insurance help with this at all?  I dont even know where to start with this, any help is greatly appreciated!! The rental company is Waypoint Homes if anyone has any experience with them.	No
439	"I had wrote a review about the property, as I'm sure I'm allowed to do, but when I was in class, the landlord came and visited my girlfriend. She said ""Since you're so unhappy, you have until September 2nd to find a new place."" My girlfriend freaked out. You know like what are you talking about, no we're super happy (Because I graduate and we will leave town in ~4 months) Anyways she made my girlfriend go and write another review to make up for the (deservedly) bad review. She agreed not to evict us. Now I feel like this is not only unethical, but illegal, and I am wondering if I would have any legal recourse? Basically extorting us for bad yelp reviews"	No
440	The reason I'm asking is because my girlfriend (17) lives with her mother who is incredibly abusive. She had a huge fight with her today and she told me that she can't take it anymore. I offered her to come and live with me and my parents, but to do that, she'd have to become emancipated which is something her mother would never allow. She IS financially independent of her mother. She works full time and makes enough to support herself and pay rent to stay with my parents.    What would it take to get her emancipated?	No
441	Hello Reddit, First off all, sorry for the grammar, I'm posting this on my phone. So I'm living in an apartment complex close to campus, and my lease expired Aug 8th. Originally we planned on renew our lease for another year, but since the rent for next year increased a bit too much over the budget, we looked and found another place that we can moved in July 24th. Now we just received our offer for renewing the lease at the beginning of this month (with the new rent rate). However, our current landlord required us to give 60 days notice before moving out. Our landlord put us under month to month payment instead of a renewal. That would put our move out date to Sept 12 (we put in our written notice July 12).  My question is, are there anyway we can avoid or minimal the rent for an empty apartment for a whole month of August and a part of Sept? We are college student and we can't afford paying rent for 2 places with 1 place being empty. Thank you	No
442	My father left when I was young and never paid any child support after the split. He has reached a debt of about $50,000 and is somewhere in Georgia or South Carolina. I still have a way of contact and could find him if need be. Being in college, I could really use this money he owes me to pay the bills and make a down payment on a house after graduation. My mom won't pursue the issue herself, despite him using my sister's social to rent homes only to not pay on them. What can I do to begin receiving payments or put him in jail? Thanks Reddit.	No
443	I was recently charged with underage drinking and disorderly conduct (urinating on a tree on private property). The cop did no breathalyzer tests, I had no alcohol on my person, and didn't admit to drinking at all. He just assumed i was drinking because I was at a party. He searched me and didn't find any alcohol on my at all. He said he was going to charge with disorderly conduct but not an underage. This was two days ago. Today he called and said his boss told him to charge with an underage as well, even though he technically has no proof whatsoever. Both are summary offenses but I can't afford to have my license suspended for underage drinking.	No
444	**Background:** I am a 27 year old female. I have been with my now ex boyfriend for about 6 years. I was a stay at home mom to his special needs child from another marriage for about 4 of thous years. Very unexpectedly 4 days ago he decided that when he returned from deployment we would no longer be together. Since then I made a post on /r/personal finance discussing my financial status and asking for advice on how to get on my own two feet again. Many responses urged me to seek legal advice and try to get my ex boyfriend to pay me more than what he is offering me. **I do not wish to take him to court. I am happy with what he is offering.** However, due to the nature of him being deployed and me still living in his home until he returns I am seeking advice on how to cover my ass legally so to speak.   **Details:**    - Location: Virginia Beach, VA    - He and his ex wife and her new husband are all active duty Navy     - He bought the home himself I am not legally tied to it in any way    - The only account of his that my name is on is our cell phone bill, and I have a solid plan on how to exit that smoothly    - He has offered to let me stay in the house until he returns from deployment in September    - Neither one of us are petty, spiteful, nor hateful people- but shit happens and we are trying to deal with it maturely     - There has been no talk of taking legal action and I don't think there will be but I'd rather be protected rather than naive     - Due to a job offer I may be out of the house sooner than he would like (by about 4-6 weeks depending on his return date) and will find proper temporary housing for our.. well now his dog.      - If at all possible I would like to never have to see him face to face again.    **My Current Plan**    - Make an itemized list of what I am taking from the house    - Have a witness present when I remove items from the house    - Have witness do a walk through of the condition of the house     - record walk through on video and send it to him before he returns    - ask his ex wife to take the dog temporarily until he returns    - discuss prior to me leaving landscaping plans with my ex       - I will surrender the keys to his ex wife with his written permission. **My Questions**    - Will the ex wife be a reliable choice as a witness or do I require someone less bias (she loves me and has a healthy amount of hate for him)? Or should I ask the next door neighbor? (we're not close and sharing something so personal with him seems very odd but he is someone we both would trust to stay impartial)    - speaking of written proof, do emails and facebook messages count?    -  is there anything else I should be thinking of to make sure I am protected in this situation?    **THANK YOU** Thank you so much for your advice, help, and support in advance.	No

446	So my father has been in jail/prison for a while now, and my mother is a narcissistic bitch who blames any problem she has on him. I don’t want to visit him with her.   She says she doesn’t want me to go with anyone except her, so that’s a problem. It’s probably been almost 8 or 9 years  My question is, if I visit him with my grandparents (his side) and she somehow finds out, can they get in legal trouble for bringing me without asking her, since I am under 18  Also if he is located in a different state does that affect laws?	No
447	Hello everyone,  I'm located in Pinellas County, FL (city of St. Petersburg). I'm looking to add to my middle name/hyphenate it.  i.e. first, middle-middle, last name.  Do I have to file a petition for change of name to legally add this additional name to my middle name only?  I'm debating whether it's worth filing the paperwork, paying the fees &amp; investing the time.  Thanks in advance!	No
448	"It's a long story, I'll do my best to keep it short. Back in March, I started renting a room in a house I found on CL (mistake #1). I came to find out from the other roommates that the ""landlord"", we'll call him D, wasn't actually the owner of the house, but the only person who's on the lease. The landlord is our next door neighbor. I also found out that D was in prison for insurance fraud, and has been in trouble for scamming and stealing in the past. I have no problems at all with any of the roommates (there are 5 of us right now), but the rest of them are all having problems with D right now, and a couple of them are threatening to move out. I was talking with one of the roomies roday, and she told me the tenant who had my room before me was evicted by D the same day he paid rent, and wouldn't return the money. This really worried me when I heard this. I know he has to give me a 30 day eviction notice, he can't just kick me out, but my main concern is getting my deposit back. What should I do? Should I lawyer up just in case? This guy is a psycho, I'm starting to get a little freaked out. Thanks for reading."	No

450	I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	No
451	Using a cell phone for privacy reasons so please have patience with the formatting. This is a multiple part situation and I will answer any and all questions to provide more detail and get better advice.  My girlfriend and I have been together 5+ years now. In that time we have purchased a home and had a child together. We have had several unsuccessful pregnancies and I have no desire to get married and it seems everything has taken a toll and we are on the verge of splitting. The marriage part was a well known fact. Before we became a couple I knew marriage wasn't something I wanted and was very vocal about that. Seems like this amongst other parts of our relationship were ideas she basically ignored figuring I would change my mind eventually.   Here were are with a two year old and a mortgage and things are unraveling. Her behavior has become erratic, hiding things, lying about situations, in general I can barely have a conversation with her without her screaming and storming off. I've told her several times if she isn't happy we should consider going our separate ways so our child doesn't have to grow up seeing us fight. This is why I am here. I already know what's going to happen. If I decide to start the process she will go off the deep end. Times when she has had too much to drink she has threatened to take our child from me. I know deep down that if I take the first step she is going to come after everything, our child, the house, everything we own just out of spite.   I am losing my mind, I can't function thinking about what's going to happen. We might have a few good days so I relax a little and then out of nowhere she blows up and I am worried she's going to show up with the cops and try to force me out of the house. Everything I own is here, everything in my life is here, no family and no where else to go. I started my own family and now I am waiting for it to be taken away from me.   What rights to do I have with our child if she packs them up and goes to her family's house? What rights to I have if she tries to kick me out of the house/accuses me of something so the police assume I am a danger (yes, a real thought of mine)? What rights do I have in Massachusetts that will make sure I get to see our child an equal amount of time when the dust settles.   Again I apologize for the format and rant. I didn't know where to begin, what not to say or how to finish. All I know is everything I have in my life could be gone and I have to know what my rights are so I can fight for them.   Thank you for your time...	No
452	"Is it normal for a California court to fudge up your records?   I was supposed to have 2 previous arrests ""dismissed"" via expungement and well, they never did I guess. It took me being denied a really good job 3 years later to figure this out too.   I have the court documents that say my charges have here by been dismissed but my DOJ record is saying something different. What do I do? Do I have any sort of recourse against the court house for not getting that job. (I'm sure I don't, I'm just pretty broken up about it)  Thanks Legal Advice!"	No
453	Okay, I'll try to keep this short. Last month, our AC unit leaked under our kitchen floor, and damaged the vinyl flooring. It was found to be no fault of ours, and the landlord replaced the water heater (thinking it was the cause before discovering it to be the AC unit) and then had the AC repaired. When he went to replace the kitchen floor, he said that they would just do the entire kitchen, counters sinks cabinets everything, and that it would be done within a week, and that our insurance (that we got through them, which they required) would cover a hotel stay. They told us the work would start Wednesday and be done Friday, but we got a hotel thru Sunday to be safe.(This is all around the week of July 21st) We return on that sunday to find that none of the work had been done at all, even with the 2 extra days. We get a hotel again (still out of my own pocket) for 3 more days until Wednesday. When we come back, the new floor and cabinet is in, but we have no sinks and counter. He tells me they will come put the old sink back on that Friday (the 25th) but that we will have to wait 2 weeks (until August 3rd) for them to come put in the counters. So until then my kitchen is basically unusable as a cooking area, and they also didn't put my dishwasher back in with the temporary sink.    August 3rd comes, and we go to work, expecting the work to be done when we get home as they said. We get a text around 10 asking if one of us would be home (which they did NOT ask us to be, we have the texts where they set the date of the 3rd and said nothing about us being there) and we say no but they can let them in (which they have done every time up til now with no issue, sometimes without our consent! we woke up that Wednesday the 19th to them working in the house that morning, we had no idea, they were just in our house!). We get home and we still have no counters. I call the property manager and ask, and he says he was under the impression it would be done, and we would be there to let them in so said the owner. So i call the owner and get no answer, and i text him asking for what date so i can be there if need be and its been 4 days and no answer to any of my calls or texts.   How long do I have to continue paying a full months rent for an incomplete house? I barely just got refunded for my out of pocket expenses for the hotel, and it didnt even cover how much we've had to eat out these past weeks while our kitchen was basically unusable. Do i have any options here to force them to fix the kitchen, or legally break my lease? Because I am done with these people. At one point they told me that I needed to be in touch with the contractor if i wanted information, but I didn't hire this guy, or ask for these renovations! Any advice would be great, sorry for the length of the post.	No
454	My landlord made a day care on the first floor i live on second floor  and tells me i cant sit outside in the porch until 6:30 when the daycare closes..its a 2 family private house is this legal .I live in NYC..	No
455	Sorry in advance for the length. I live in CT, fyi.  Seven years ago my then-wife and I bought a condo. It was put in her name but everything including the down payment was split down the middle. We divorced four years later in July 2015 (without lawyers) and we agreed that I would continue living there since she could move in with her mom rent-free. The divorce decree said I would continue paying half the mortgage until it sold and at that point we'd split the money we made (if any). I wanted to cut my losses and walk away since the condo isn't tied to me at all, but she refused to sign the papers unless I agreed to continue paying half the mortgage until it sold.  She said it'd go on the market as soon as it was show-ready. I gave it a good cleaning and bought some nice decorations and new couches for staging. it looked better than when we bought it. She said then it'd go on the market in the spring because that's when most people look for new homes. That never happened. A year ago we agreed that my new girlfriend could move in and take over paying half the mortgage until it sold. So, at that point my ex wasn't paying anything except property tax. After several months it still wasn't on the market. I told her it needed to be put on the market and sold ASAP so we both could move on with our lives. She said she met with a real estate agent friend and the condo is now worth a hell of a lot less than what we paid for it. She said we'd have to keep paying the mortgage for 3 more years until we sell it to break even.  This is unacceptable. It's been 2 years since the divorce and we've made no progress. I desperately want to move and be done with my ex once and for all, but because of our divorce agreement I feel stuck. Moving and taking on a second mortgage/rent is not a possibility -- I barely make enough to cover my bills as it is.  I'm planning on meeting with a lawyer soon to see what my options are, if I even have any. Before I do that, I'd like to hear what /r/legaladvice has to say. Would it be possible to take her back to court and have the divorce agreement revised? I want nothing more than to walk away from this damn condo and create a new life with my girlfriend.  *tl;dr: I agreed to continue paying have the mortgage of a condo in my ex-wife's name. She is no longer paying her half of the mortgage as that's been taken over by my girlfriend. Ex expects me to continue paying for another 3 years so the condo will break even when it sells.*	No
456	Hello. I live in Vermont and for about two weeks now, our water has been contaminated with diesel fuel. You can smell it on the water. I had consumed it, and had negative health effects for almost an hour (this was me testing confirmation bias ). I've never been given notice by the landlord that the water has been contaminared. I have talked to my neighbors in the same building as me. They have the same problem. I have been told the only way to force legal action is to pay several thousand dollars to test the water, and show the results law enforcement or some other justice agency. Several thousand dollars I do not have.  I was wondering if you had any ideas on how to force the issue legally speaking?	No
457	"So I have this friend who is currently trying to undergo a divorce. He wanted to start now, but he has to have 1k up front. So it will be about two ish weeks. Well, assuming child support doesn't stack up against him.   Anyway, his soon to be ex is a sucky person. She is overdramatic and always tries to start problems. Throughout their thirteen year marriage, she would walk out or kick him out and always do something dramatic to try and get him to chase after her like they do in all the romcoms.   This last time was it for him. She slapped him in the face and he shoved her back and held her against the wall, telling her to never touch him again. He didn't slap her or hurt her in any way. He restrained her. So what does she do? Goes out and gets a restraining order against him and feigns ""domestic violence"" and deems him unsafe. She realized that was pushing it over the limit because not even hours after filing it, she tried dropping it.   Whether it was through text or messenger, she would spam message him appologies and threats intermittently, which I know is grounds for her not being able to get a restraining order later on. Well, ""protective order"" I think.  He is done with that nonsense. And this woman finally realized how good she had it before. She has a job, but it doesn't pay well. And pretty much the moment after she did this and they began the ""separation"" phase, she was demanding money. She wanted like, 1500 bucks per month in child support. (We used a chart and consulted a lawyer for the actual cost he should pay.) She dropped the order the following week as soon as she could and has been repeatedly begging and threatening him throughout the last three weeks now.   She is also wanting him to pay rent even though he doesn't live there, or she will take the kids away.   He doesn't have a problem helping his kids, but we know if he keeps helping her she is just going to make it worse for him. And she said that if they do a divorce, she will make it harder on him than necessary because she is vindictive. She wants to do a legal separation so that she can still have power over him.  We have logs of all the messenger conversations and texts between them as written record and he avoids speaking in person as long as possible. He is paying child support and is picking up his kids a couple times a week.   But he tries to keep minimal contact with her, even when she continues threatening him and saying questionable or incriminating things.  Should he continue speaking sparingly? Does he need to go ahead and pay all their bills? And what should be his course of action throughout this ordeal? Sorry if I'm missing details, I'm typing this on my phone while waiting on a game of Black Ops to queue up. I will add more later."	No
458	Currently, a family member has legal guardianship of my sister who is not fit to care for her. I would like to obtain guardianship, but have not been able to get in contact with legal aid. CYFD claims that there is a 90 day window that I can use to gain the court's favor, but I'm not sure how that works. Where do I start?	No
459	Landlord told us that we could get an overnight parking sticker for free from the city, but it turns out overnight parking stickers don't exist. He told us all of his tenants used that lot and had for years so he clearly lied. We have already paid a security deposit but not rent, can we cancel and get our money back?	No
460	"Have scoured the internet for this one, but all information only mentions BAC or rolling retest violations being reported or forwarded to VASAP/court system.  Are the ignition start/end times data being analyzed as well for possible restricted license violations? Or can you only ""get caught"" for that by being pulled over? Just want some clarification. Thanks!"	No
461	"Background: When we purchased the house it came with an HOA credit.  Once the credit ran out, the HOA started sending bills to the wrong address.  I failed to pay my bill (as I never saw it), and the HOA sent a collections agency after me.  The collection agency then sent a letter to a completely different address. Again not the current/correct address (though the correct address was cited in the letter) or even the address the HOA was sending bills to. I never saw those letters until the person living at the address accidentally opened a letter and notified me.  I called the HOA and they informed me they have been sending bills to the wrong address. They asked me to send them an email to explain the situation and correct the address, which I did and I copied the collection agency.  So now the collection agency sent me a bill asking which charges i want to ""dispute"". I will absolutely pay my HOA fees, but I do not want to pay any late fees or any fees charged by the collection agency.  I am curious if there is any legal action I can take against the HOA. Can I sue them for their incompetence? They have affected my credit and may potentially affect my ability to keep/renew any security clearances.   Or should I just shut up and pay everything (including late/collection fees)?  Thanks people smarter than me..."	No
462	I live in WA state for reference.  Suppose that I vacate my apartment, and the landlord sends me an itemized list of charges from my security deposit within the 21 days, along with a small refund check.  Is there a deadline to dispute the charges? Also, does cashing the check imply that I accept the charges?	No
463	Ill try to keep this short. My friend was recently given custody of his child in Texas. Yet he has to pay back child support in Oklahoma. In the mean time she does NOT have to pay child support until she gets paid back in full.   WTF?  Thats the gist of it. I was there when the court awarded him custody of his son so I know its legit on that part. But my friend claims that because he was behind by 6k, he can not receive child support until he pays off the remaining balance.   How does this work? What can be done to fix it? This guy is seriously living in poverty until he can start to receive some money here. He worked 40 hours a week and has more than 60 percent of his check taken by child support. She recently started working again after finishing rehab and still does not have to pay child support.   How does this work and what can be done to fix it?	No
464	Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pg3g8/md_tenant_brought_2_cats_to_my_condo_lease/  She informed me on Monday that she brought 2 cats into the property breaching the lease. I told her my realtor and I were coming to the property on Wednesday to inspect/assess the condo as it is going for sale. She changed the date because according to her she is traveling.  She is letting us in today for 5 minutes.   What are my legal resources if she becomes difficult with entry to the unit?	No
465	As far as I can tell this is not allowed per the law I found below. Are there any issues I'm not seeing? Who do I report this to in Colorado or what is the best way to approach this situation? I'd like to pay rent with my credit card but the fees the landlord charges are extremely high.  Colo. Rev. Stat. §5-2-212 (1) Except as otherwise provided in §§24-19.5-103 (3) and 29-11.5-103 (3), C.R.S., no seller or lessor in any sales or lease transaction or any company issuing credit or charge cards may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit or charge card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means. A surcharge is any additional amount imposed at the time of the sales or lease transaction by the merchant, seller, or lessor that increases the charge to the buyer or lessee for the privilege of using a credit or charge card. For purposes of this section, charge card includes those cards pursuant to which unpaid balances are payable on demand.	No
466	"I do not understand the legal logic in the following immigration situation in which I currently find myself in.  US Citizen with wife who is not US citizen, albeit married legally in USA over 5 years ago. We have 2 US citizen children, of very young age, currently living with wife in the foreign country. After being legally married in US, I moved to wife's country for a few years.  Wife wants to immigrate to US, so does husband (me), for the betterment of the child's education and livelihood. Husband then comes to USA to establish residence and attains a good job to prove an ability to provide for wife (as per regulations in the affidavit of support) .   Immigration services estimates 12 months before issuing a visa, while a Fiance visa will take 6 months (i.e. I go to foreign country, take a ""spouse"" and bring her back). All communications to the USCIS yield little in terms of additional information on the case. Also no way to expedite the case unless she is from an extreme situation, which she is not.   Can someone, please, explain the logic in this situation, or even better, tell me how I can see my family again."	No
467	I am a naturalized citizen and have been planning to change my first and last name for quite a long time. Unfortunately, I am currently going through a divorce in the state of Illinois.   Will the court reject my request for a name change if I am going through a divorce?	No
468	I did a quick search and it turned up little so I apologize for any redundancy.  To preface this, I am currently a Paralegal student so I have some law background. I know very little compared to lawyers (which is why I am here) but I do understand jargon and procedural etiquette.   I live in Washington state.  I received today, taped to my door in an envelope, a 10 day comply or vacate notice for violating my rental agreement. The violation stated in the notice is for an unauthorized pet, except I do not, and did not, have any unauthorized pets. The notice was not delivered to me personally but was posted on the door, and as of today's mail delivery have no received a copy in the mail. I have prepared a written response categorically denying the allegation because it is, essentially baseless. I live with my girlfriend and best friend of the last ten years, I am certain there's no bullshit going on behind my back that I'm not aware of, no visiting pets that could have been mistaken for ours, and quite simply put no actual evidence that we have any unauthorized pets.  We do have one cat, who is on the rental agreement and who we paid the deposit for. The property manager is aware of that cat. Again, there are no other animals, not even any tiny rodents, mammals, fish or reptiles, literally nothing.  Before I deliver my written response to the property manager and have the discussion, is there anything else I should be aware of? Any procedural stuff I need to handle before we talk about it? Should I avoid talking to the property manager until after I have submitted my written reply? Movement on unlawful detainer hasn't started yet because I received the notice today (dated yesterday) so I know I don't have any reply to issue to the court (yet) I just wanted to make sure all my bases were covered.  If they disagree, my kinda-mentor/professor is a local lawyer that handles landlord-tenant cases and doesn't represent the management company that owns the property, and I'm sure that she would represent me if it ever came to that (though it shouldn't). I have corroborating paperwork from the vet showing our (again totally legitimate) cat has had a vet visit recently, but otherwise I don't have much in the way of hard proof other than inviting them into my apartment.  Thanks in advance for any/all help and sorry if this is a waste of time, I just wanna make sure everything gets handled properly because I am certain I am on the right side of the law.	No
469	Firstly, we're located in Oregon. It's been a long road and there's so much information that I'm not even sure to begin, so I'll just list the facts. My SO impregnated his (now ex) girlfriend after a couple months of seeing each other. He already had a son from a previous relationship and has shared custody of his 8-year-old with his son's biological mother. His son's biological mother is a heroin addict and is not in the picture at all.   The newly impregnated girlfriend (who I'll refer to as Megan for this post) and he decided that they're going to try to make it as a family because she wanted to keep the baby. SO's relationship with Megan lasted a little over 3 years and during that time, Megan attended a community college and was a stay-at-home mom for both the 8-year-old and their shared son. SO worked full-time and paid a majority of the bills. She used her refund checks from student loans to pay the rent only. The 8-year-old was encouraged to think of Megan as his mom. The end of the relationship seemed amicable and mutual. They even hugged after the breakup. Megan requested that SO not stay at the house anymore, so he started to stay with me. He and I were best friends and I lived in a small one bedroom apartment. There wasn't enough room for the 8-year-old and SO didn't want to leave Megan financially devastated because she still did not have a job. He continued to pay all of the bills for Megan which was about $1,100 a month and he would go to Megan's house each night to put the boys to bed. They were trying to keep up consistency so that the routine didn't change that quickly. He even spent his days off over there so that the boys didn't miss any time with him; he was at Megan's house as often as he was before the breakup. This pattern continued for about 6 months and during that time, SO and I became romantically involved. As soon as Megan discovered he was moving on, the entire situation became very hostile and ugly. Turns out she was harboring love for him still and had deluded herself into thinking they would get back together. Fast forward about a year and SO and I have moved into our own two bedroom place. The 8-year-old is in our care. His little brother is now a toddler and he lives with Megan. We have countless harassing texts, voicemails, emails and FB messages from Megan who has been a continued nightmare. She even went as far as to attack my SO's professional profile on both FB and Amazon. We have screenshots and countless prints of her erratic behavior. She became very fixated on me and insists that I'm taking her life away from her. She's convinced that I'm an evil mastermind and said she was going to make sure that I never got to be around either of the boys. A little about Megan, she's a very intelligent person, but she's also conniving, capable of delusions and has an obvious superiority complex. SO and Megan are still in an ongoing battle for their shared toddler and that trial will take place this September. SO recently received an email from Megan where she informed him that once the battle for their shared toddler was over that she fully intended to take him to court over the 8-year-old. She's not legally or biologically connected to him, but they did develop a mother-son relationship for a little over 3 years. We were still letting the 8-year-old see her every weekend until she threatened to take him away from him father. Her email wasn't stating that she wanted parenting time or visitations, she wants take custody of the 8-year-old and have him in her home. Can she legally do this? I'm baffled as to how she could. The attorney we spoke to said that her chances of winning were nonexistent. Megan has been very confident and stated in her email that the attorney she spoke to said the state of Oregon does recognize her parentage and she can take SO to court over the 8-year-old. Please help. We're stressed and quite frankly, I'm not sure what to believe.   TL;DR My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend helped raise a child for 3 years. She is not related to the child nor did she and my SO marry. We have a lot of documentation that she's not a rational or reasonable person. Can my SO's ex-girlfriend win rights to a child that's not hers?	No
470	"I live in Oregon in the US btw  I have been receiving phone calls from a ""company"" called Bahama Island Cruises based in what they call the ""Orlando promotion center"" for a few months now. I have received over 20 calls over the past few months most of them wake me up during the day because I work graveyard.  The past six times I have talked to an ""agent"" and told them to put me on the do not call list, stop calling me, and have also told them that its illegal to keep calling me when I have said this (I'm pretty sure it is right?) The last time the ""agent"" said that they weren't a telemarketer (lol) I told him that he is calling ME trying to sell ME a stupid trip that makes him a telemarketer he replied with ""have a great day...""  What can I do to report this ""company"" I would love to see charges brought or their business shut down. I am already on the national do not call registry. I really need the help it is making me insane I don't know what to do."	No
471	I received a ticket for urinating in public in Fullerton, ca at about 2:30 am after all the bars closed and nowhere to relieve myself. The ticket was marked as a misdemeanor.   I understand that it is mostly at the discretion of the prosecutor and that I should seek an attorney. I'm worried that I won't be able to get the ticket reduced to an infraction because I have a DUI on record from almost three years ago.	No
472	"I just moved from one apartment to another in Orlando, FL and received an email notice that I was going to be sent a ""refund"" check for roughly $2000 from my previous apartment's realty management company. I was immediately confused and thought there had been an accounting error. As it turns out, $2000 had been removed from my checking account. Since I was not expecting this charge, I was charged heavy overdraft fees and my account was completely drained. The check has arrived in the mail and it's for a third of the sum that was taken out of my account. My roommate received another third of it and I think my guarantor (i.e., mom) will shortly receive the last third. I am absolutely livid that this money was removed from my account without warning and sent to other people. Especially when they didn't automatically draft my last months rent (also without warning) and I barely caught it in time to pay without late fees. I know I can get my money back from my mom and my roommate, but what would have happened if I didn't have a good relationship with these people? I could have been seriously screwed. Anyway, I'm planning to make some angry phone calls tomorrow morning, but I'm not sure if there's any action I could take to get the late fees refunded. Also, I already cashed the check they sent me because I have next to no money after they took so much out. Was this a bad idea? What should I do? There a million and one other things that happened to me while living in this apartment and I wrote down everything, but this is the icing on the cake."	No
473	Long time lurker, first time poster in the sub.  Our landlord has chosen not to renew our lease which expires today. I co-leased with my father who is electing not to leave. FWIW, my father is mentally ill and does not have arrangements to live elsewhere.  I have moved out of state this week expecting my father would leave as well.  The landlord is saying I would be liable for the apartment because of my father. Since they've chosen not to renew the lease, I'm not sure if I can be liable for my dad.   I would call the cops and have him removed but since he was formerly on the lease, not sure what I can do.   Any thoughts to remove my dad would be great. I would also appreciate advice on how to handle the leasing Office.	No
474	The setup: Roommates A,B,C signed lease and roommate D agreed to move in a month later and add himself to the lease.  B+C are a couple. A is me.   A+D paid 2/3rd deposit under A's name (D didn't have a bank account or credit) and C paid the other. B has no job and asked ACD to split three ways for two months until he gets a job and then we'll split four ways.  Two months later, B has no job, and A confronts him  A and B have a fight, B threatens A and A is forced to move out for safety concerns. (Still with me?)  The lease is an all for one, one for all lease meaning since I left I'm still responsible for all of it if they stopped paying rent as well as they've responsible for my portion since they kicked me out. It was never changed to update tenants or anything. Rent has been paid and it's now almost up. D is still not on the lease.  Landlord knows the situation but let everything play out as long as he got paid.   I want my security deposit back (remember I technically paid two thirds of the deposit), B and C will probably state since I left (they disagree about kicking me out or if I left willfully, I have texts to prove the former).  BCD want to continue the lease for another year but I want to end our lease and they can sign a new one. The landlord stated he doesn't want to get in the middle of it and wants to just roll over the security deposit and have ABC figure it out on our own. However B and C have no intention on giving me any money back.    How does this get resolved?	No
475	Hi, I'm in NYC and I currently live in a dorm with a signed lease. A license agreement to be precise. Move out date is 8/13. I'm just wondering how long they can hold my security deposit for. My suitemate moved out earlier than me, at the end of May, and she still has not received her deposit back. I'm wondering if there is a legal time period in which they need to return it. I've had some issues with this place and I want to know before hand. I'm planning on having them do a walk through with me so I can have on record that the room was in the condition I left it. I just want to be prepared. Thanks in advance!	No
476	I signed a 2-month lease and an addendum saying I get half off for the month of June. I paid the full amount in June and went to the office to talk about getting half month off on my next lease.  I've come into the office 5 times about this and the manager is never there. It's July 8th now and I've gotten charged a late fee of $70 so far. The 'employees' have promised to email/call/contact the manager and she never does anything. I went in once and one employee went outside to talk to the manager for 10-15 minutes, then came back in and said she'll solve the problem tomorrow, which she didn't. She called me back in June and told me to wait until July 1st and she'll resolve the issue since she can't change anything in the system until then. July 1st I came into the office and she was on vacation indefinitely. They were closed the 3rd and 4th, and I got billed a late fee on the 4th.  What are my rights here? I am not going to pay a full month rent, and I am sure as hell not going to pay these late fees.	No
477	This was first posted under r/relationship_advice but it was suggested that I might want to post it here too.  My mother been a total Bitch to both me and her husband for over a year. This has got me worried that my stepfather who is the nicest person I know might say enough and leave.   My mom has mental issues and she doesn't always take her medication and that can make her paranoid and really grumpy. She has been really bad this month and when I asked her if she was taking her medication she told me she doesn't need me to tell her when to take her medication.  She has been very hostile towards her husband ( at supper last night he asked her to pass the salt she threw the salt container at him. She said she was sorry later but worried he is going to say enough and I will be stuck with her being even worse because I he helps keep her acting out sometimes.  I don't know what I can do. My stepfather is the best thing ever to come my way. He helps me with so much and treats me like his real daughter. He loves me. He doesn't just say it ( he says it lots ) he also shows me by his actions like never lying to me helping me with school and when I have a problem I know I can tell him and he won't freak out on me. He has family time once a week most of the time my mom doesn't even participate.  My mom never tells me she loves me and most of the time I am sure she would be happier if I wasn't there. This is not new for me. I have been dealing with my mom's shitty parenting all my life but I don't want her to chase away the best thing in my life. I know she should be that and I want her to be but she doesn't care about me half as much as my stepfather. He has been my daddy for 4 years now and I don't want to loose him.  TL;DR My mom is not talking her medication and she is making both me and my stepfather unhappy . I am afraid my stepfather will leave me with her.	No
478	For starters my girlfriend and I signed a year lease four months ago that the only wording for smoking was “Smoking is not allowed.” We both took this as no smoking on the premises. So we smoke across the street and up a couple of houses.  Our landlord recently contacted us stating that there have been complaints from other residents of the property of my girlfriend and I smoking.  He claims this is breaching our lease, and will evict us if we do not comply.  Can he really regulate our smoking off the property? Can he move forward with eviction even though she and I both smoke off the property?  Really don’t want to get evicted here, obviously I know quitting smoking is the easiest way to solve the problem. Any advice other than that?	No
479	I am in Oregon, sister in trouble is in WA. Her public defender is terrible. Our family is kind of shitty, and I have no money for an attorney. She has been waiting for trial for a very complicated case for 2 years. Her court-appointed attorney has ignored all of the resources and advocate options as well as contact info for expert witnesses I have provided. He has condescended to me, yelled at me over the phone. I told him that I will only communicate with him via email.  He has been often rude and aggressive toward her, then seems to have compassion on their next visit. He has told me to send the information and contact info of the people I have spoken to, they have tried to contact him, and no response. I wrote to him and told him she felt bullied and disregarded. He seemed to be on her side for about a month, then back to the roller coaster approach.  She said she has written a letter to the judge and told me it had been ignored. I have so few details, her self-worth is shattered, she has lost her fight. She told her psych doctor she wanted a new attorney and she was condescending and dismissive.  I have contacted another public defender in WA because I think she can switch easily if someone else is willing to step in? That person did not contact me back, and I don’t want to continue barking up the wrong tree. I also am afraid that the next one might be worse.  What might my best strategy be? We have contacted all of the legal aid resources we could find, and have gotten very minimal response.  I really appreciate all of the great info here. Thanks for your time	No
480	Hi everyone, I live in a condo and have a neighbor who is kind of a dick. Last month a guy from Indonesia showed up and my neighbor said he was a friend of his brother's. This turned out to be a cover story for him finding this tenant on Roomster because our Condo Owners Association prohibits short term rentals.  This didn't really bother me at first, because the Indonesian guy is really nice. He's working at a hotel downtown and trying to start a life here. Well my neighbor is one of those people who hovers over his roommates and decided to kick this guy out because he leaves his bedroom light on when he sleeps (separate rooms). Now this poor guy is in tears and he has until Friday to get out.  My neighbor now has two rooms listed on Roomster, which now that I know what's going on, I'm not okay with. I'll be reporting him to our COA, but I'm really not sure if the tenant has any rights here. The [Roomster TOS](https://new.roomster.com/terms) is gibberish to me and I want to make sure he isn't getting taken advantage of because he's still learning English. I can't tell if a rental via Roomster would count as a lease under TX state law.  Any help here is appreciated.	No
481	Just need clarification on what counts as educational expenses for a child in Missouri. Is it strictly for college/secondary education (Tuition, room and board, books, etc)? I have a child going into elementary school and he is now required to have a laptop. I would like to be able to have this bill shared between myself and the ex.  Need some guidance on what exactly the education expense entails.  Thank you.	No
482	In the lease for my prospective new apartment there is a clause that allows me to terminate my lease, after 30 days notice. The clause states that I must pay liquidated damages equal to two months rent ($3160).   I do not mind agreeing to liquidated damages in the event of an early termination. Considering I must give 30 days notice and the typical turn around time for apartments like this is 60 days, I feel one months rent as damages should suffice.   How do I go about negotiating this aspect of my lease?	No
483	Hi all,   I turned 26 this year and got booted from my family's health insurance plan, was making almost no money as a contractor, so I went on Pennsylvania's public health benefits. Two months ago, I got a job offer and I needed to both start right away and move to where the job was, and in the personal tornado of making that happen, I just remembered that I never cancelled my public benefits.   The moment I took the job, I left the income bracket in which I'd been eligible to receive benefits. My health insurance with this new job didn't kick in until one month into it, so I've technically only had 'double health insurance' for one month. The only costs that my benefits have been covering in this overlap period are the monthly rental payments on a medical device I need - it's a cost that I could hypothetically reimburse the state for out of pocket.   What kind of trouble am I in? Obviously, I'd like to take action first thing Monday morning when their phone lines open up and report my mistake, but am I looking at any potential legal issues here?	No
484	My water bill went up $150 after the landlord sent someone out to power wash the house. I am responsible for the water bill, but the lease doesn't say anything about power washing. I called the leasing office and they basically said there is nothing they will do because there is no proof the increased bill is due to the power washing, but our bill has never been this high in the year and a half that we have lived here. My husband wants me to call a lawyer, but do we even have a case here? I'm not sure what to do at this point because we just can't afford this right now.	No
485	I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52). They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month. Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month. On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym). I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months. The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer. Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes. I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!	No
486	My husband had a DUI in Pennsylvania in 2009. He went through ARD to have it removed from his record. Will this impact his ability to enter Canada through Alaska for a fishing trip?  Thanks!	No
487	Texas  My husband and I are splitting up. We have a 3 year old son together. My husband has offered to pay me $600 a month in child support. $500 would go to child care and the extra $100 would be for anything else he needs. My husband brings home around $4,500 a month. He also has our son insured through his work.  Here is the issue - I want to go through the attorney general for child support. He doesn't want me to because he says I'll get more money from him and I 'don't need more money than that'. He says that he put me through school so that I could have a career and can take care of myself and that I really don't need any more money from him in child support. I make about half of what he makes monthly.  I didn't think this was fair, so I told him that I was going to get a lawyer for all of this. His response to that was that if I went out and got a lawyer to get more child support, he would ask that I take our son to an actual daycare. My dad has been taking care of my son since he was born. He watched him every day when I was in nursing school, and he watches him while I work. He's been to every single doctors appointment, he takes him to his T-ball practice and he does 2 learning programs with him at home - ABCmouse and a program with actual books and flash cards. He's doing really well with these programs. My son is very close to him and I feel safe knowing that he's with him.  So my question is - would I likely get more money in child support if I go through lawyers? And can my husband make me send our son to a daycare facility?	No
488	I am asking to leave my lease early since I am moving to a new state for work. When I asked that I transfer my lease instead of paying the lease break fee, I was told that was not an option they would consider.   Is there any legal basis for them to refuse a lease transfer without considering new tenants? I understand that they have a right to refuse someone they don't like, but to not even be open to the possibility of a new tenant and only allowing me to pay a lease break fee seems not only unfair, but legally dubious as well.	No
489	"Rental tenancy dispute over flood damages caused by faulty toilet that clogged and overflowed.  A close friend of mine was renting a downtown vancouver high rise apartment. She lost her job 6 months ago and had to move out since she couldn't make rent.   The landlord - a property development company that owns the entire building - told her that she could not break the lease. She looked for subtenants and found one. Subtenant was approved by the landlord.  The subtenant didn't know if she wanted to stay longer than a month.  But after the month, she really liked the place and decided to stay till the end of my friend's lease - which was the end of last month. My friend didn't have this extension approved by the landlord. They thought she was only staying for a month. (More on this later)  Two weeks before the lease came to a close, the toilet had clogged and flooded. Apparently, the subtenant had flushed the toilet and went to bed. But the toilet tank flapper valve was stuck open and by perfect fucking coincidence, managed to also to be clogged on the drain end.  Water flowing in. Water not draining out. The toilet bowl floods all night. Subtenant wakes up next morning and discovers the water under her feet. She starts putting down towels and attempts to unclog the toilet drain.   Neighbors notify the landlord at this point. They walk in with their emergency repair crews and start ripping out the flooring.  The property manger takes down a statement from the subtenant. The subtenant apparently told her that toilet was always faulty. That it had overflowed and flooded twice prior to this incident. But in those cases, she was able to plunge the toilet out and fix the issue herself. So she didn't think it was necessary to notify my friend or the actual landlord. She fixed the issues herself.  My friend and I were on a business trip far away at the time. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a hold of the subtenant. She was notoriously hard to get a hold of even before. She's an international student with some difficulty with English. At this point, she saw the condition of the suite with the floors ripped out and went and stayed in a hotel. That weekend she went back home to Taiwan.  Landlord is now claiming that my friend is reponsible for the entire damage since the flood was caused by the negligence of the subtenant. Since the toilet had clogged twice before, she should have notified either my friend or the landlord directly and made sure that there was nothing wrong with it. The damages are some $60k since the water went 4 stories down. I find this extremely hard to believe since the pictures the landlord showed us as proof very clearly shows the water didn't even go 6 feet outside the bathroom door.  My friend does not have any form of rental insurance. She is not in a great financial position to pay for this claim. She's a wreck at the moment. She has been living at home the last 6 months with her parents. Her dad is the guarantor on her lease. And now she's terrified that the landlord would go after her dad and force a sale on their house. They're not financially well off either, with major credit lines already racked up. So she's not in a productive state of mind at the moment. I am helping her out by scheduling meetings with lawyers etc.  So far, we've met 3 lawyers. Each have their own position on this.   Lawyer #1: The least sharp professional I've come across. I genuinely thought she was hungover when she met us. She kept insisting that 11:57 AM - which is when the emergency repair crews went into the apartment was in the middle of the night and not almost noon. Even after I pointed this out, she kept saying that no reasonable person would expect the subtenant to be awake ""so late in the night."" She said we had a 50-50 chance nevertheless. She wasn't clear on what is expected from a reasonable person in this situation. Buying a plunger and fixing the clogs herself is not enough to be not negligent? Or was her responsibility very clearly to notify the landlord about this issue that she already fixed herself?  Lawyer #2: He was super-optimistic. We walked out of there and my friend actually was happy enough to respond to a high-5 I gave her. He said we're going to delegate responsibility for this damage on to the subtenant. Since she is in Taiwan now, the landlord will have a hard time going after her. What we needed to prove was that the landlord understood and knew very well that the subtenant was executing the remainder of the lease and not my friend. Unfortuntely, the landlord explicitly stated in an email that when the walked in to do emergency repairs, they had no idea who the person living there was. Later, she responded by saying that she was the subtenant they had approved 6 months ago. But they had only approved her sublease for 1 month as part of her original plan. True. My friend failed to inform the landlord that the subtenant wanted to extend.  What would it take to delegate responsibility towards the subtenant? How can my friend walk away from this and point the finger at this subtenant? I am not sure if it's that feasible. Moreover, I think this lawyer was trying to make a quick sale and lock in the retainer (We paid him at the end of the consult for the retainer). He was super confident that we were going to win. He later emails us asking for basic things like the tenancy agreement. So not inspiring confidence here.  Lawyer #3: This was probably the only person we met who was telling us the full truth as it is. He straight up said we were going to lose on the negligence part. It will be found that the subtenant was indeed negligent. He suggested we ask the landlord for proof that the damages were actually the amounts they claim they are. I suggested the idea of offloading responsibility on the subtenant. He said that wouldn't go so well simply because the plaintiffs already know she's gone home to Taiwan and it would be very hard to get a hold of her, especially not worth it for this sum of money. Makes perfect sense. Why would they not fight with all they have to make sure the cross-hairs are on my friend and her dad.  This happened today. Confused on who to go with. Never hired lawyers before. L3 is expensive. I felt he was too professional and that he would only stick to the absolute proper and morally correct ways of doing things. L2 seemed like he was a conman trying to convince us that we would win easily. Could it be he can play his charm trick on the judge as well and it would work? He is talking about filing a harassement suit against the landlord's lawyer who is calling my friends dad pretty much every day now. If we are going to be found responsible for this if it goes to trial - maybe the strategy we need to apply would be to roadblock them on every single step of the way and make their lives as hard as possible so they won't even go through the effort?   L1 was garbage.   L2 is super sharp and honestly an extremely effective salesman. He is incredibly effective at producing convincing arguments. And not without supporting evidence and case citations, etc. L2 is young, inexperienced (2 years) and works for a no-name law firm in the middle of nowhere.  L3 is very straightforward and honest. I don't know if he is going to exhaust every possible loophole and sink to the level of doing whatever it takes (as long as it is legal, I dont care about morality or appearing to be an asshole). I didn't get the feeling that he is ready to do this. But he's more experienced in litigation cases. He is also part of a prestigious law firm in the region.  Any obvious things I am missing here? Any obvious choice?  There is a 3rd option. The landlord's lawyer spoke to me over the phone. He wanted to get a hold of my friend's dad. But I picked up and blocked it. He did mention that he wanted to see if there was a way to resolve this issue ""in good faith"" instead of resorting to measures that are irreversible. While I am not on the lease or related to my friend, I do have a substantial savings accumulated up over the years. Maybe just calling this lawyer who wants to talk and having a conversation with him directly would help resolve this quickly? My friend, her mom and her dad are all terrified and simply unable to be productive in any capacity since there is the real threat that their house is going away on top of their already exising problem of criping debt.   They want ~$60k for all sort of damage to the suite and to 10 other suites across 4 stories. Most of that is inflated bullshit, I am convinced. They've never provided an invoice or any sort of evidence of substantial damage in the emails. Would there be a reason why they would have all this evidence and not show it up front when they make their claims? My gut feel tells me if I personally write them a cheque for $15k, I can tell them to fuck off forever. Plausible or am I on crack?  Need some advice. Apologies if this is a giant wall of text."	No
490	Just like the title says, I paid to have a background check and such done and the application fee said non refundable whether we were approved or declined. The owner may not be leaving as planned and the house won't be availiable to rent. they used a service called rentscreener.com. Thanks in advance	No
491	Hi,  I'm in Virginia (Fairfax County).  I had to call 911 last night after my brother sent long emails detailing his suicide plans (he has been suffering from depression for years and had just come out of a treatment facility). He was taken to the hospital and put on a mental health hold.   I had to sign a petition to involuntarily commit him and must now go to a hearing on Monday morning to present evidence to get him further help (he does not want treatment). Is this something I should retain a lawyer for? Do you have any other advice? Thanks so much - I very much want to help my brother remain safe.  TL;DR Brother has been put on mental health hold; I have to go to a civil hearing for involuntary commitment for him on Monday - do I need a lawyer for this?	No
492	Hey guys so recently i signed a lease with an apartment complex near my university. prior to signing my lease i made sure to ask about my special circumstances that may have disqualified me of being able to sign a lease with the apartment complex. My special circumstances being that I am a completely independent student who has no guarantors, but receives certain financial aid that if counted as income, would qualify me to be able to sign by myself. Due to me explicitly telling the property manager of this, I was told by the property manager to make up information for the guarantor section of the online application (largely in part because it was a required part of the online application to be able to fill out the entire application) and ensured that he would edit the information later. Fast forward a couple days later and I sign my lease for the apartment complex. Fast forward a couple days more and I receive an email from the property manager reminding me that my 'guarantor' needs to sign his part of the agreement. Just reviewed my lease and it seems he has bamboozled me or maybe he forgot that I talked to him about this? my lease states that financial aid does not qualify as income and i must prove that my income is 3x the amount of the rent for me to qualify without a guarantor and any misrepresentation of information may result in a default. I can currently prove a monthly income of 2x the monthly rent based solely off of my job and my financial aid for the fiscal year would put me over the qualification for income if counted. So my question is did he bamboozle me or is there something that I should do to fix this?	No
493	I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?   I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.	No
494	You own a product and something breaks on it. You go out and buy a new one and replace the part that's broke with the new one. You return the product to get your money back. Is this consider stealing? If not is this illegal?	No
495	Our HOA is pursuing a lawsuit against the declarant of our building. The building is an old industrial warehouse/mill that was converted in loft condominiums. Evidently, the municipality inspected the entire building and overlooked several violations, huge structural problems with one facade and the roof. Certificates of occupancy were issued for each individual unit, but not the entire building. Somehow, construction proceeded. Years later, our HOA decided to sue the declarant for failing to remedy these structural issues, seeking funding for repairs. The problem is this: condo fees have increased by 200% in five years, as our HOA continues to levy assessments and fee increases to pay escalating legal costs. We have no transparency or visibility into the status of the case, we are all expected to continue coughing up money to fund an endless lawsuit with no guarantee of success. Potential buyers/investors have been turned away by the excessive condo fees, we have this feedback in writing from our realtor. Additionally, no lender will fund a mortgage for any unit within our building due to the litigation. Homeowners are trapped here, we cannot sell, and the constant fee increases without commensurate added value erodes our competitive advantage. Neighboring communities charge 1/2 our condo fee rate and offer twice the amenities (pool, landscaping, gym, tennis courts, etc). We have hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity, locked away due to the decisions of our HOA. I'll never buy another place in a HOA for as long as I live.	No
496	"I'm not sure if I even need any legal advice, but the potential is there if I don't get this issue cleared up with them by the 9th as that's when I'll get an eviction notice or it'll go my apartment's management company's lawyers.  I'll try to explain this as brief as possible. I paid June's rent via check, but apparently I only wrote the correct amount in the numerical representation on the check and not in the wording of the amount. So about a month and a half later I get a letter in the mail, stating that my check was not honored and was returned and a reverse payment issued. (The management company has their control numbers for the reversal of payment and the receipt for this reversal for records.)  I went to the office and showed them that the incorrect amount was deducted from my account, which they say should not have happened if it was not honored and payment was reversed. So I showed them a copy of the deduction and paid the amount that was left and because the check had the actual amount written in the numerical representation, would waive the return check fee. I didn't know at the time payment had been reversed as I just thought I owe the remainder. If I knew, we could've figured this out earlier.  At the end of June, I give them my check for July's rent, as I was going to be out of town and wouldn't be back until after the late date. But it turns out, they used ""July's rent"" to cover the cost of the reversal of June's rent. August, there's no issue.  The thing is though, I have not received any reversal of payment. I have received no refund, no return for any amount whatsoever. My bank statements show nothing being credited to my account in either the apartment complex's name or the management company. If I received the amount that was reversed, fine, sure, I'll pay what I owe, but that has not happened. There is no evidence that I have received the payment reversal. I am not paying an extra 95% of my rent to the company when there's still money unaccounted for.  Also to note, the reversal of payment amount, does not match the amount that was deducted from my account. So there's essentially about one months rent floating in the air somewhere."	No
497	My wife and I divorced 2 years ago. During the divorce she signed off on the house we owned jointly giving me sole possession. Since then I have had a new deed prepared in my name only so now, as far as the house is concerned, I'm the sole owner. However she is still on the loan which I've been making the payments on since she moved out in March 2013. I've never been able to refinance due to terrible credit and though it's improved since I'm still having issues qualifying. She wants me to refinance ASAP so she can be removed so that it won't show on her credit (she's trying to purchase a home elsewhere). Totally understandable and I'm trying to get it done but I'm curious as to my legal obligation to do so. For instance if I cannot qualify, does she have any legal right to challenge my possession? As far as I understood that when she signed away the home during the property division and a new solo deed was processed her rights to the property ended. Is this correct? I live in California for reference.	No
498	Something new and different for me. A couple of weeks ago I get a call from a lawyer whose name I don't recognize.  Apparently I don't remembering him.  About ten years ago my parents sold their house. At the time both were ill and in a nursing home so having power of attorney I signed everything at the sale.   The call was asking that I sign a deed because not all the property was properly signed over in the sale in 2008. He says he represented my family in the sale. After giving it some thought I vaguely remember my parents lawyer not wanting to handle the sale and recommending someone else. So this guy is probably legit.  He asked that I call the lawyer for the current owner (that bought the housed in 08). Same lawyer then as now.  So I did.    Talking to lawyer number two, who I also don't remember, she tells me that lawyer number one reopened probate, without ever notifying me. While I have a feeling that's probably just fine it kinda rubs me the wrong way. So number two asks of I can drive to her office and sign the papers. No, it's out of my way and it's her problem not mine. I tell her where I work (three different locations in a 10 mile radius) and tell her to call me when she's going to be in the area and I'll try and to meet up. She suggests someplace else.  I again tell her where I am during work hours and suggest she call me.   Week goes by I don't get a call.   Now lawyer number one is back in the picture. He left a message saying he just needs one minute of my time. He's stopped by my house unannounced twice missing me both times.  Maybe it's just me but that kinda bothers me. Leave me alone on my time. I've got some health issues and on tough days/weeks I'm completely exhausted at the end of the work day and just want to be alone and rest.   It's my nature to want to be a nice and helpful guy. But I'm also uncomfortable being asked to sign legal documents without completely understanding any possible implications. A lot of the time I feel like I'm physically and financially just barely keeping my head above water. I just can't handle any additional complications in my life. Do I just sign or do I ask them to please leave me alone and to fix their own mistakes?   Thanks for any insight or suggestions.	No

500	Newbie here looking for advice on my current legal situation. I'm a lesbian mom with a 4 year old child from a previous relationship. My wife has been in the picture since my daughter was 10 months. Majority of time is spent with us, bio father lives two hours away and sees her about once a month. All medical, school, etc.. is handled by my wife and I. When we enrolled her in pre-k last year, they required birth certificate and wouldn't let me put my wife as other parent. She is only listed as emergency contact. We have been legally married for almost 2 years. Question is, how do I go out about making my wife her legal parent/ guardian, without stripping any rights from bio dad? I know it bothers her that she doesn't have the same legal rights as him even tho she is a provider.. note that she is listed as other parent on all medical forms, never had issue until school. Daughter had surgery at 2 years old.. she was able to be there and sign all forms with no issues. Frustrated, just want her have the legal rights she deserves. Please help and sorry for the ramble.. thanks!	No
501	I'm currently in college in a city school where students typically rent apartments next to campus rather than living in dorms after their first year or so. Last year, around December, I signed a lease and paid a security deposit of $600 to live with two friends that I'll refer to as A and B. Before I could pay first months rent, my one friend A and I had a falling out with the other friend B in which B decided that she wasn't moving out. A and I decided to find people to take our spots in the lease and live elsewhere to avoid further conflict. The landlord of that property understood what was happening and said all was fine if we found other people to take our spots in the lease. The landlord said that he would switch new people to our spots and those new people would just use our deposits and pay us back since we had already given him money. A and I agreed that was easiest. So I found a girl who I'll refer to as S to take my spot. I told her that she would have to pay me back the $600 for the security deposit and she agreed. This all happened at the end of the year at the beginning of summer when we were both moved back home and S lives out of state so all our correspondence has been through text. So far, it's been 4 months and I've only received about $100 of what she owes me that I received in mid July. I texted her for the third time this morning, politely asking about the other money but haven't gotten any response from the other two times before today. I'm hoping today she'll respond but if not, I'm not sure what to do which is where I need advice.   I have all the texts exchanged between us two from the beginning as well the the money order and the Venmo transaction I received from the fraction of the cost that she's paid me. I'm planning on contacting the landlord if she doesn't answer today but I just need to know where I should go from here. Being a college student, $600 is a lot of money to me and I don't want to lose it. So, should I take legal action and if so, when? Or is there another way to solve this?  - I hope this is the right sub to put this on. If not, I apologize and would appreciate it if someone could point me in the direction of the correct one. Thanks!	No
502	"Hello, throwaway for obvious reasons. There has been some recent shady dealing at my friend's apartment building. I'm seeking advice for them and other tenants.  1. Summary of Known Wrong-Doings (some have been re-occurring for tenants' entire stay, some occasional)  -Potential future tenants referred upcoming vacant units by existing tenants. Potential tenants toured unit and wrote deposit checks to Building Manager. Signed receipts given to potential tenants with Building Owner info in heading. Building Manager cashed to personal account with no intent to lease. -Building Manager also has access to all tenants personal info/SS#'s, and requested same info from referred potential tenants under false pretenses. -Fees such as parking, security deposits, etc. requested as cash payed directly to Building Manager, sometimes with same signed receipt. -Rent requested in cash payed directly to Building Manager, for various reason given, with signed receipt.  2. Background / Context  Ex-Apartment Building Manager (live-in) did all showings/lease paperwork/maintenance requests/received rent/fees at the building - I assume employee of the Building Owner, not co-owner, contractor, etc. Shortly after learning of some of the above actions (not sure if there were any past incidents), the owners notified tenants the Manager was ""resigning,"" but did not acknowledge any wrong-doing or give any reason why, seemingly to distance themselves from manager.  Owners have been only rude and defensive. They have also accused some tenants who were misled to by the Manager of possibly being in cahoots and threatened taking action against them, legal or eviction (is this illegal?).   -Update: Owner has served a notice to vacate to at least one tenant who's deposit/last month was taken by Manager. They have all amounts included in the lease and a receipt for at least one of the fees.  3. Questions  Is the Manager liable as an individual for their actions, or are the Owners/management company liable as a business entity for their employee's actions? Is there any way for referred potential tenants to get their money back besides small claims? Would they seek from Manager as individual or Owner?  Don't businesses have insurance or contingency for their employee's wrongdoings that could cover this reimbursement? Would a lawyer work on contingency fee in the case of something like this? Is the Owner's lack of notification of criminal actions to tenants or unwillingness to reimburse potential tenants itself an unlawful act?  4. Organization?  Building has 40+ units. Above info is from network of approx only 6 units, learned from just chance encounters, so I would expect more people have had things happen to them or people they may have referred to move in.  Would it be a good idea to survey how many tenants have been potentially scammed in some way and if wrongdoing is widespread possibly take legal action as a group? This would at minimum connect those screwed over the most. Surveying/organizing would have to happen anonymously of course. In my state it is illegal to prevent tenants from posting info in public area, or meeting/organizing on their own.  Maybe just slide informational flyers under doors, with an invite to an anonymous forum/chat group to survey experiences? Any recommendations for a private chat/forum easy to set up greatly appreciated. Any advice also appreciated. Thanks."	No
503	I currently live in NYC and started renting my apartment in October of 2016. The building that I live in was previously an old boarding house that had rooms and shared bathrooms on each floor. When the building was renovated, the rooms were made into studio apartments. All of the apartments have a living space, small kitchenette area and bathroom fully contained except for mine. Apparently due to some type of structural issue they were unable to tear down a portion of the wall to join my apartment and the bathroom, so the landlord rents it as is with a detached private bathroom and the lease specifically designates it as private. The setup is definitely unconventional, but it is NYC and was surprisingly affordable so I took it. The bathroom door is right next to my apartment door so all I really have to do is briefly step out into the hall. The bathroom is always locked and before a few days ago, I was the only one with a key.   There are four other apartments on my floor, with two on each side of the building. Over the weekend, the opposite side of the building began having plumbing issues. My side of the building was unaffected. The landlord is apparently having a difficult time with repairs and the bathrooms are unusable. On Saturday evening I came home to find that the landlord had given the other two tenants keys to my bathroom without even telling me!!! I called him immediately and he made some excuse about it only being temporary, but it’s now Wednesday and nothing has been rectified. I’ve called him daily since then and he has since stopped returning my calls. I don’t know my neighbors very well and one of them along with her boyfriend has seriously questionable hygiene.  There are already cleanliness issues and I don’t feel like I should have to deal with that. I’ve also gone to use the restroom to find it occupied a few times. I absolutely don’t want to share my bathroom. I would have never signed a lease that didn’t offer me a private bathroom. The bathroom also has a small closet that I was using for storage so I also had personal belongings in there other than your typical bathroom needs. I don’t know what to do. I guess I have lots of questions.  What rights do I have in this situation? Is what the landlord did illegal? Can I break my lease if the bathroom isn’t designated private again soon? Does the landlord owe me some type of compensation for this? Can I tell the other tenants that I don’t want them in the bathroom so maybe they’ll start complaining to the landlord to get the repairs done faster?  TL:DR  I rent a studio apartment in NYC with a detached private bathroom. One side of the building is having plumbing issues so the landlord gave the other tenants keys to my bathroom without asking or notifying me. I absolutely do not want to share my bathroom. What rights do I have in this situation?	No
504	"Hello all,  We are a new clothing company based out of Phoenix AZ. We are in a very early stages of creating this business so I wanted to cover everything to make sure what I am printing is legal. Our shirts have sayings such as ""Kill ____ ____"". The blank spaces are the names of certain people such as politicians and celebrities. I wanted to see if I can legally print and sell shirts with this type of wording on them. ""Kill"" Murder"" and other violent terms. I know it sounds weird but I have made a couple and have people tell me how much they love them all the time. If you could help me out, that would be great."	No
505	"I live in a small rural town in NC.  There is a drainage ditch on the back side of my property, which I own.  The town has 7 storm drains that run from 3 different roads and all eventually spill into this ditch.  4 of these drain directly into the ditch, the others feed into it from another ditch.  So here's the problem.  The bank of the ditch is collapsing in places due to recent heavy rains and the volume of water running through the ditch.  I am about to lose my fence and storage shed due to continued erosion.  I contacted the public works department and they tell me that they cannot do anything to help me fix it, that it is solely my responsibility since it is on private property.  I checked my deed and there is no drainage easement, and the county has no record of it either.   My first thoughts were since they have no easement to demand that they stop discharging water on my property.  However, I came across NC general statute 561-21 which states that since it's been in existence for more than 7 years it is ""prima facie"" evidence of it's necessity.  The same statute states that I can petition the clerk of court to make an assessment and divide the costs to repair and maintain it among all parties that benefit.  My thinking is the main beneficiary is the town, but I would like your opinion before I begin pursuing anything in court or if there is some other option."	No
506	I'm the property owner of a single-family house in Charlotte, NC. I moved out of state for work and contracted with a realty company that places tenant-buyers in your property. The lease is set to expire October 1st, and the tenants have not provided me with any sort of closing date or indication they started the purchase process besides communicating with me directly that they intend on exercising their option to purchase soon.  I have been calling and emailing the realty agent and the company for over a year without anyone getting back to me. I need to send these tenants a lease renewal contract with their updated rent amount and total due for extending the purchase time another year, since there's no way they'll close before the lease expires. The agent is also the president/founder of the realty company.  I contacted the National Association of Realtors and they told me that my agent is no longer a member. I reached out to the Charlotte Regional Realtor Association and they confirmed this, and also told me that the realty company dissolved in February 2017. She confirmed this on the NC Secretary of State website. He is no longer listed on ncrec.gov.   I'm not a big shot investor. This is my one home and I am in this situation and now live in Oregon. If anyone could provide any advice I would greatly appreciate it.	No
507	I just moved into a new place, 2br, 2 bath. A good friend of mine wants to move in. Now, I already have a co-signer for me, who is prepared to take care of any problems that may arise. Would my friend also need a co-signer? He has little to no credit.   I have the funds to take care of anything by my own means, so the Co-signer will never be involved, really. I only got a co-signer so I didn't need to to expose too much of my finical situation to my landlord.   Thanks!	No
508	"I'll try to make this as short and factual as possible.   July 2016- Bankruptcy was declared and granted last year. In that, we lost personal liability in the home. We turned off all water, utilities, and contacted the mortgage company to advice them we were leaving state and leaving the home. We advised them we wanted to give it back and could no longer afford it. We have not made a payment since two months prior before the move. Not to escrow, taxes, nothing. I called and cancelled the homeowners insurance. I received paperwork stating it was cancelled and that money was refunded to the escrow.  July this year- The mortgage company turned the mortgage over to a new company that has sent us a deed in lieu of sale packet we need to sign to give them the home.  While checking our banking online (our bank also had our mortgage) I discovered a claim on the house. In it, it states there was a burglary/theft that occurred in October 2016. There is also an estimate for the bathrooms for repair and that appears to be the claim of damage. **I never received a call, I never consented to anything, and I cancelled the homeowners insurance.**  To further complicate things, I don't believe the home was broken into. Two of the three bathrooms had hidden water damage when we bought the house and moved in. A piece of ceiling fell in one right after we bought it, and we discovered black mold. We ripped down all drywall and treated the underlying wood. We had not replaced it yet because my husband lost his job, shit hit the fan, bankruptcy, etc, etc. The second bathroom had hidden damage in the sink and when we turned the water back on when we moved in, it became apparent so the vanity was ripped out (and fell apart when it was removed). We purchased all new items for that bathroom and as far as we know are still sitting in the garage of the house. We left that with the home because it belonged to it, just wasn't installed. When questioned on the phone with the current company about the state of the home, we told them this.   We are supposed to sign and mail the deed in leiu of sale package today or the house is supposed to go forward with the forclosure.   I can't afford a lawyer to ask about this, so I just want to know if anyone knows what the process will be in all of this. I have never been contacted once about the ""burglary"" claim and I can't tell for sure if it was a real break in or not. I'm across the continent now and I have no way of getting to the home. It's under the care of the mortgage company now and has been since we left in July 2016.  Is it better to allow it to go to forclosure, since I have no personal responsibility in the home and all claims will go against the property and not me? Do I continue and sign? Do I call? What do I ask? The mortgage and insurance company are the same ones still technically. The mortgage was originally USAA and now it's Nationstar, which is owned by USAA.   Any help that doesn't just say ""lawyer now"" is appreciated. I know that a lawyer is best. I know I need one. I can't get one, period."	No
509	"So we rented a condo for 2 years and about 8 months from a woman who seemed very chill for a landlord. She was not very good about tending to our matter, but we were ok waiting on a lot of things. We signed a lease that stated it needed to be updated after the first year, but never signed a new contract. We painted the condo as it needed to be painted and she didn't know how long it had been since it was painted. We updated the bathroom with paint and tearing down moldy wallpaper and such. She had terrible old flooring in the kitchen, that she said we could replace if we wanted, but never did. This is some backstory, here's the meat  We let her know about 60 days before we were moving out of our intent to move out. She seemed pretty pissed that we decided to move out, as we we're obviously steady income for her, but she seemed like she understood it was for good reason. About 45 days before, I asked her if we could use the security deposit as our final rent. After a bit of hassle, she allowed us to do so, with promise we would clean the condo and make any necessary repairs that we did. We agreed and began doing so. We gave her a date of May 20, we would be moving out, but coming back the 22nd to clean and give her the keys. She decided that the 20th, she would bring a prospective renter. We explained it would be bad that day, but she still decided to do it. I received a text that day that the carpet is ruined and everything was dirty. Again, let her know we were coming back that Monday to clean. Monday comes, we attacked the place, cleaned, had the carpets cleaned. The carpet cleaner said that the carpets looked like they have never been cleaned professionally, but they did offer a 30 day warranty, if the stains returned. She met with me, accepted the condo back, with the walls still painted, and other issues she left us with in tact. I received a text from her saying she was happy with everything. The next day, she texted saying that the stains came back, and if we ever rent again, they would not accept the carpet the was she accepted them, but she was going to replace the carpet, and literally said, ""just want you to know."" I told her to exercise the warranty. That Saturday, the 27th of May, she sent a long text message with receipts and such. She said she is going to charge us for the carpet in the living room, send her about $600 and that would be it. Again, only had issue with the carpet. She said they were only 5 years old when we moved in and we ruined it. She has had 2 other tenants before us btw. I said that according to statutes in FL and that since I have a text saying she accepted the condo back, we were done. She said that was before the stains came back. She said she was taking us to court.  About a month or so later, we receive court documents stating she was suing for the carpets, garbage disposal, dishwasher, blinds that were broken, floors in the kitchen, and paining back the condo. Almost $2k. She checked the box that said there was evidence attached, but nothing was attached in the documents. I only really took pictures of the carpet and bathroom, as the carpet was the only thing she ever said she had issue with. I also have the texts still that she accepted everything. What else do I need to bring, and will the texts be enough? Does she actually have a case with the other stuff, even though she never discussed that with us or gave us a chance to rectify? Any help would be great"	No
510	Tl;dr: booked hotel, they upped reservation price after the fact. called bank to reject the charge and now hotel is threatening legal action and am just wondering if they have the right to do that.  I was looking for a place to stay for a few days in NYC and had stumbled on this hotel. Thinking it was okay for the price I had booked a reservation to stay only to find out the price that I had booked it for was later raised and I was charged for it. When i called to try to cancel the reservation they had said there would be a cancellation fee equal to the booking cost, which had already been charged to my card months in advance of the reservation date. I called my bank claiming fraud, that was charged wrongly and today i receive a call from the hotel threatening me with legal action asking for triple damage charges. I don't know what to do and feel entirely wronged. I do see that I had told the bank fraud, where in fact that mag not be the correct way but I was so frustrated and flustered that I didn't know what to do. I really need help on this and need to know what to do to just get this out of my hair.	No
511	Hello, everyone. Long story short, I was about to break up with my then girlfriend, she thought trapping me would make me marry her, it didn't, now I'm in a shitty situation. We broke up, she moved back home, and refuses to communicate with me. I've tried to contact her and her family about the due date of the child (I know it's sometime in February, but that's all I know) but they ignore me. I only got a picture of the ultrasound because she posted it to my facebook wall in an attempt to embarrass me. She's also stated that she's not going to put my name on the birth certificate, which I'm not sure if that matters. I'm afraid she's going to try and keep the baby away from me. I may not be on good terms with her, but I want to take care of my child. I'm in Texas. What are my options?	No
512	My registration expired in January, I was issued a ticket at the end of June, so about 6 months expired. Car is registered to my husband, but I mostly drive it. Neither of us noticed the expired registration.  A week after the ticket was issued I went to the DMV to get new registration. I called the court this morning and they said if I came by with my new registration and court summons, I could pre pay and not go to court. Well I went all the way down there, and then they told me that I can't pre-pay (and they muttered something about misdemeanor amongst themselves) and said I have to attend court.   My court date is next Tuesday. Of course I am going to attend, but now I am very worried. Is this a big deal? Do I need a traffic lawyer? Should I plead not guilty?   I checked on Virginia DMV and I couldn't find any license demerit points associated with this infraction. I assume I will be fined but I have no idea what to expect.	No
513	I got married on July 2nd. We are a same-sex couple, and so instead of assuming names or hyphenating, we want to create a new last name that combines our two names into one. This is possible within Canada, and we plan on doing so, but this does change my wife's birth certificate, so it's permanent rather than an assumed name.  As a permanent resident in Canada, I am not sure how this will apply to my information in the US. I am a US citizen with a valid US passport.  I know that I need to apply for a new passport - will they accept the Canadian name change form? Do I need to get my name changed on everything in the US as well? I obviously have SS in addition to a student loan account and a bank account, but that's about it. I've been living in Canada for 5 years now, so there isn't much left in the US in my name. I will also be selling my car before we are able to complete the name change officially, so no need to worry there (the title), and I have a Canadian driver's license (already forfeited my US one).  Any advice or information would be appreciated.	No
514	"So basically my girlfriend just signed her lease and we were super excited about the place (I'm not living with her) and so we went to visit it tonight and there was this super sketchy guy (tenant) across from her door.   His door is directly across in a small hallway and it's nearly 5 feet away. Anyways, he just gave me the worst vibes, this guy had sunglasses on at 8pm, a cutoff, middle aged, and just had a creepy overall feel to him. He kept talking to himself and just looked like someone who isn't in the right mind.   Anyways I peeped my head out the door and said ""what's up"" and he just looked at me super weird with his sunglasses and paused for 10 seconds just staring at me and said, ""I'm sucking on my daddy"" and laughed and walked away. Then yelled, ""my suga daddy"" and ran off.   Is there anyone to break this lease?"	No

516	Howdy everyone,  So here is the setup. My wife and I bought a new home several months ago. The exterior needs to be scraped and repainted, so we hired a painter to perform the work. The painter started scraping earlier this week, and our crotchety neighbor has been threatening the painter and us that he will sue if there is any paint found on his cars.   The cars in question have all flat tires, plenty of rust, and moss growing on the roofs, but they are parked in his driveway which is next to our property line.  The painter offered to cover the cars in plastic while he is painting, but the neighbor aggressively told him to stay off his property.  The painter says he can do the work without any paint on the cars, but in case the crazy neighbor actually goes through with a lawsuit, is there anything that I should do in preparation? We've taken photos of the cars before any of the work started, and the painter is fully licensed, bonded, and insured.  Thanks for the help!	No
517	"Hi guys. I have a lot of questions. Thank your for being well versed in insane minutiae. I did a lot of googling about this and found only bits and pieces of answers    **Scenario**   I am a toddler teacher at a daycare with about 70 employees and two locations, NAEYC accredited. Our location is in a very old building. Today we came in to find that the storage facility connected to the designated break area (they share a door) is undergoing asbestos abatement. All proper signage, warnings, and info packets posted. The room was blocked off with a sheet of plastic and some plywood. None of the employees were alerted, nor were the families. We were also not offered alternative locations to eat lunch. This break room stores all of the food for the children, as well as all cleaning supplies, classroom supplies, extra toys, eating utensils, and a fridge where the employees store lunch and some snacks for children are stored. My boss claims the owner of the building told her to ""keep kids out of the break area because work is being done"" but that asbestos was not mentioned.     **Action sequence**   I am on the playground with my children speaking to another toddler teacher. I ask her if my boss is informing the families and she isn't sure. I indicate that I'm going to let them know that they should keep their children out of the designated area, as they are often in there. My boss's sister (this is it's own problem obviously) hears this and immediately texts my boss. Boss storms onto the playground, interrogating me about why I would want to tell parents about these ""chemicals"" and saying I don't know what I'm talking about, etc etc. When I immediately agreed that i would keep it to myself if she so wished, she continued. She said I just like to caused trouble, that I was a gossip, immature, strange thing like that. I mostly ignored her as I was with my kids, and holding one of them. At the end of her ranting she asked me ""Why do you even come here every day?"" I just kind of gave her a blank stare because that question made no sense to me. I reminded her that I'm putting in my two weeks notice on Friday (going to grad school) and She tells me I'm not needed and I should leave that afternoon and not return. So, humiliated and devastated, i did.  *Note: When I say boss, I refer to our assistant director, as our director is out of town. That's why i was waiting to give my notice, as the Director would return friday. The AD indicated that she was in communication with the director the whole time. I have had no luck contacting the director.*   **Questions**    *1* Does a landlord have any obligation to tell the tenants when asbestos removal is being done? Is the presence of children relevant?   *2* Does my boss have an obligation to let employees know that this work is being done? Does she have an obligation to tell the parents?   *3* Does the landlord have the responsibility of having the air tested for asbestos levels after removal?    *3* Is there anything shady about her reasoning for firing me? I understand at will and all that, but does the safety concern change anything?    *4* Will I be able to collect unemployment from them?    *5* Will I find myself in legal trouble if (now that I am no longer an employee there) I let the parents I know/have contact with that there is asbestos work going on?    I know this is a lot so I truly thank you for reading and considering. I am so lost right now and sadly no amount of googling is bringing me solid answers to these questions. Any help or insight would be incredibly appreciated. And if there are legal issues that may arise that I was unaware of, please let me know! This is turned my life right upside down. Help.  **tldr**: Asbestos abatement being done in a daycare, no one was told it was happening. I found out halfway thru the day when my coworker asked what all the cancer signs are about. Boss/acting boss fires me (allegedly with permission from real boss) for indicating that I wanted to tell the parents of the children who attend the daycare."	No
518	I'm trying to put out a piece of hardware that would be used by laboratories, so I guess it falls under the umbrella of lab equipment. Obviously, I would like to comply with all regulations, but was wondering what relevant organizations/documents I should take a look at. I was thinking along the lines of FDA/FCC maybe? Any help would be appreciated!	No
519	According to our lease, our ex landlord was supposed to bill us each month for water for 2/7 of the bill for the entire house(it was a duplex and were supposed to be billed for number of people in our unit vs total number of people in the house). Not once did he send a bill to us for the entire year despite our numerous documented requests for the water bill. Our lease has been up for two months now and our ex landlord is now saying he will keep the deposit and will settle the balance for the water with that, and will send us the remainder or bill us for the amount still owed depending on how much the water bill comes to. My SO and I do not trust him at all to bill us the correct amount and want him to send us the deposit that we are owed in full, and then bill us for the water, so we are going to send a debt validation letter to him via certified mail using a template we found online. Will this be enough to cover our asses in small claims court if he does not send verification of our water bill and/or does not return our deposit? What else should we be doing?	No
520	"I've been eating at a particular Carl's Jr restaurant. I am always greeted in the drive-thru with an immediate promotion, which I have to decline politely, before I get a chance to speak and order what I actually want. After my order is taken, the employee will always prompt me with an upsell, ""add a cookie for just a dollar?"" or something similar. However recently I noticed one employee was automatically increasing my combo to a medium, which costs more than the regular small size. At first I let it go. But today I decided to order inside at the counter. I recognized the employee as the same one that took my drive-thru order last time. As soon as I stated which combo I wanted, she automatically reached for the medium-sized soda cup and that's when I had enough. I pushed it back and told her that I didn't ask for medium, to please give me regular size.  I was very annoyed by this type of slimmy sales tactic--I wish I caught it on video (next time I visit, I will record with my mobile). Is this illegal? Can fast-food employees try to slip a fast one on me without first asking if I want the bigger size combo? I can only imagine how many people didn't notice and paid more without knowing, or guys like me who noticed it right away and now have to deal with this pushy sales trick all the time.  Is it worth writing an email to Carl's Jr. complaint department? Should I catch this on camera?"	No
521	As the title states, my evil MIL let it be known today that she secretly obtained a DNA test on my 8 month old daughter without mine or my husband's consent or knowledge while she was babysitting our child for an hour. I don't know what she thought the outcome would be, I suppose that part doesn't matter.   Apparently, she obtained a cheap drug store paternity test and swabbed my daughter and her husband's (my daughter's grandfather's) cheek. She must have forged mine or my husband's signature because neither of us knew they did this. My husband has explicitly stated he did not consent to the test and I obviously did not either.   I am angry and I feel completely violated on behalf of my child.  From what I've read, a lab needs one parent's consent before performing these tests. Again, my husband did not consent and I did not consent. Either they forged our signatures or the lab they used is up to some super shady stuff.   I live in Missouri. I plan on filing a restraining order against them first thing in the morning as well as speaking with an attorney about any charges that can be filed. Am I just reaching here or is what they did truly illegal and reprehensible by law?   Can the lab be sued for not obtaining proper consent?  Thanks in advance.	No
522	I recently got into a fender bender with the other person being at fault. Their car is fine, mine is not, and I have to pay a $500 insurance deductible to get my car fixed. Does anyone have advice or tips for how to get the other person to pay this deductible, or at least pay part of it? I've heard I can take him to small claims court, but how successful would I be in doing so? I'm a poor college student and I can't afford another $500 when I just spent that amount 2 days before on new tires.	No
523	I’m in some deep shit.   I asked someone for a rental application. They sent a document which I filled out and signed. This turned out to be a lease agreement which I’m now on the hook for. I just signed a sublease agreement with someone else. Now I’m on the hook at two places. What can I do?	No
524	"The accident happened in Irvine, CA. I was giving my girlfriend a ride to work on my motorcycle in the far left lane before HOV. With the intent of using the HOV lane, I waited for a break in the yellow lines, hit the turn signals, looked over my shoulder and then mirror, saw that there were no vehicles in the HOV, and made the lane change. Maybe ~10ft from the point where I changed lanes, I heard another motorcycle's tires screeching (assuming he locked up his tires), and the rider going down in my rear mirror. Pulled over and did a police report. He and his bike suffered some rashes; neither my gf, my bike and I were harmed. I received a warning letter from the DMV saying that I will be receiving a point on my license from that accident for ""failing to notice (the rider) approaching from the left rear"".  I got a copy of the report today and found out that in his statement, he said he was ""driving (his motorcycle) on I-5 s/b splitting lanes between the HOV and #1 lane (far left)..."". Is it legal to be splitting lanes in between four solid yellow lines? If legal, what can I do next time to prevent a similar accident?"	No
525	So, my girlfriend has been living in an apartment complex that houses primarily college students as it is close to campus. Tonight, she came home and thought her apartment had been broken into but it turns out it was a new roommate she had never heard of. This terrified her and she has no idea what to do. Her roommate is a 30+ year old women whom she's never met and doesn't even know her name. This is obviously extremely uncomfortable for a 19 year old college student. Anyways, the apartment complex didn't notify her about this roommate. She had actually received an email yesterday stating that it would only be her and another girl living there. But, this 3rd women just showed up and moved in without any notice. Is there any law against this? Should the apartment complex give notice of a stranger moving in? Any help would be appreciated.  This happened in Oklahoma.	No
526	The person whose trailer I hit wasn't present, but I left a note.  I'm trying to figure out whether it would be my boat insurance or Auto insurance?  I'm assuming auto, since the neither boat was present at the time.  Will my auto insurance cover damages to their trailer? (I have full coverage) and will I pay a deductible for that?  Its about $2400 in damages, and I'd rather not tell my insurance company and have my rates go up if I end up having to pay $1000 for the deductible when I can try to scrape up the money for the full amount.	No
527	"Expanded:  My father and step-mother need to find a new apartment. My dad is in the middle of fighting for state disability, and currently has no income, my step-mother's income is enough to pay the bills but they can't afford their current place anymore.  All the apartments they can afford have a rule where all occupants must have an income equal to/greater than 2-2.5x the monthly rent, collectively.  What is the legality of my signing the lease with them, listing my income, and claiming to be a tenant/occupant without actually living there?  Off the top of my head, I don't think it would be illegal, it would just appear as if I am renting multiple properties.  But I am asking you fine folks just to be sure.  Also, what are the potential ramifications if the rent does not get paid? I understand that they would be able to come after me for the money and I would be on the hook for any unpaid rent. But would it or could it affect my credit negatively?  Could an ""eviction"" on that lease impact my current renting status in my own apartment?  Basically I'm just trying to get an idea of what I would be getting myself into. I have not agreed to do this, it is something I am considering to help out my parents.  Thank you for reading, and thanks for any advice or answers."	No
528	"I have lived in the same apartment for 1.5 years and my renewed lease began July 1 (1 year lease). Coincidentally, I have been having bug issues since the beginning of July. I think it begins in early June when I heard an animal crawling in my wall. I made a service request to get it removed and the response was along the lines of, ""yes we have received multiple calls on multiple buildings with animals but there's nothing we can do this evening."" I think it died in my wall. Fast forward to early July, I begin to see big flies in my apartment, 1-3 at a time, as days past upwards of 5 flies. I keep killing them and think maybe it's the Texas heat bringing flies inside. I go buy fly strips, request a pest spray in my apartment and hope for the best. The repeat flies go on for a week or so and I continually look for cracks, open windows - nothing. My girlfriend starts to complain about a musky smell, I may be used to it at this point. Then one night I come home late and there are over 30 flies in my apartment! I couldn't believe it. I pack a bag and go to my friends house.  The next day I make an online service request and go to the office face-to-face. I bring up the fact that I made an animal request because I heard one in the walls a month ago and maybe it died. She said they could be it, they spent over $15k to patch holes in roofs and set traps (I want to call her fib because I don't believe they did) and the best they say they can do is go in my apartment and cut holes in the walls and maybe find something. They do and ""don't find anything"". The flies are swarming toward the window, and before anyone asks yes I am fairly clean as I don't leave food out, clean my dishes and occasionally leave a dish to be cleaned later in my sink. This is 30 flies. I have to stay at a friends for the next few days, and tomorrow (Monday) they are going to fog and clean my apartment, I have stayed one night because the flies are now gone I find that strange and now I'm worried they've laid eggs everywhere.   Now I'm dealing with carpet beetles. Small bugs keep poking up from the carpet and I keep vacuuming them up. I've had enough of this, I truly want to leave this apartment. Either a new complex or new apartment. What are my rights in this situation? Or, if I can't move, how do I make certain these issues are resolved?   I apologize for any odd formatting as I typed this on my phone. If any more description needs to be added about this situation please ask."	No
529	Title pretty much says it all.  I was born in Florida.  My mother placed her husband at the time as my father.  After 40 years I found out my father was not my bio father.  I have since located my bio father, completed the DNA testing and I'd like have my birth record reflect him.    Can this be done?    Thanks in advance for your help.	No
530	I live in Oregon. I have the opportunity to buy a property with cash. My Dad wants to live on it and build a home, which he happily wants me to own. No strings attached, no contract.  My question is regarding my security. If there is no contract between us, and he finds himself in debt, could a debt collector come after me? For example if he spends a lot of money on building a home, then files bankruptcy, can the house on my property become involved in his litigation?  Alternatively, if I wrote a contract with him, how could I protect myself from his potential debts?  It goes without saying, I know a lawyer will be able to answer these questions in more detail. Thanks for any advice!	No
531	"Hi Reddit! Thanks in advance for the help.  I am attempting to move out of an apartment that I currently live in in San Mateo, California. I alerted the landlord that I will be leaving yesterday, and he responded that I should have given 30 days notice as per the contract.   The 30 days notice before leaving (with a yearlong lease with a set end date) clause was not in the original contract. However, the landlord sent a notice 31 days ago which reads,   *""Dear Valued residents, Thank you for your concerned residency. Your rental agreement is about to expire and we would like to extend the offer for you to sign a new lease. Because of management changes, it is necessary for you to sign a new contract with us, even if you will be remaining on a month to month agreement. Below you will find your best available option to renew, as well as the rate for choosing a month to month agreement. New rental rates begin August 1, 2017.   Option I: 12 MO $2400   OPTION II : Month to month $2880   *If you do not respond to this notice by July 30, 2017, your rent will change per the month to month amount listed above. It is necessary for you to sign a new contract even if you are deciding to go month to month. If you are intending to move, please remember a written 30 day notice to vacate is required. So don't wait and renew today. Turn in the bottom portion of this letter to the Leasing Office and we will email your new lease paperwork to you. "" *   So I will alert them today that I will NOT be moving to a month to month lease. However, i am forced to break the 30-day notice rule. The only penalty stated on the original contract is that if I break the contract, they may choose to evict me within three days (which is fine, since the lease is up on the 31st.)  Is there anything I should know or do?  Thanks so much for reading."	No
532	"Moved in to a new place April 1st that I will not be returning to until September 1st. I have been transfering my share of the rent to one of their accounts yet I realized that every single month they pay the rent like a week late and every time I tell them to pay it on the first its all ""Dude chill"" and ""The landlord is cool with it"" even though when I met him he was some passive old dude, who I feel is just taking it late to avoid confrontation but could screw us.   If we do get charged a late fee or even get served an eviction for late rent, is there any steps I can take to cover myself since I was always transferring money to them a day before it was due? All our names are on the lease.  Or am I overreacting to this situation"	No
533	My older brothers house was raided by police. He has 2 kids which were taken into protective services. Right now I guess he is being charged with burglary, theft, possession of an illegal firearm, child abuse , possession of controlled substance. His wife is being charged with receiving stolen property, and possession of illegal substance. According to my younger brother who was staying there and witnessed the whole thing, all that was in the house was stolen stuff, and 3 meth pipes. Now I love my brother very much and I want to do what I can to help, but he's in Nebraska, and I'm in California. I don't think he can afford a lawyer so I was wondering if I could hire a lawyer from here to defend him in another state. I also want to see about taking custody of his kids while this all gets sorted out. Wtf do I do?There is more, but I'm on my phone right now.	No
534	My home lease says it is only for residential purposes. I do a lot of work from home and recently registered for a fictitious name (DBA) including placing an ad in the paper stating this that contains my home address. My wife is freaking out, thinking this violates/breaks our lease and we could be in trouble. Am I correct in thinking that operating a business from my dwelling and working from home are two different things? I'm okay, right? My wife is totally just being a freak, right?

536	Mom in Ohio is a permanent resident of a nursing home but underwent surgery in a hospital and upon her return to the nursing home requires physical therapy to recover. Medicaid has covered her permanent residency but then Medicare Part A steps in to cover the skilled nursing physical therapy she is receiving post-op.  The question about simultaneous status has arisen because we took her to an appointment outside of the facility (unrelated to the surgery) and we were informed that her status as a permanent resident vs skilled nursing patient matters for billing purposes. They explained if she is covered under Medicaid then they would bill them, however if she is currently covered by Medicare then the nursing home should be billed directly or her personally if the nursing home doesn’t deem the appointment vital.  So can you be considered both a permanent resident and a skilled nursing patient by a nursing home? Meaning the nursing home is concurrently receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid (the per diem and the patient liability amount).  This is my first post! I am sorry if it is not worded well, I have very limited knowledge of Medicaid/Medicare/Nursing Homes and am learning as I go. Also, I am cross-posting in hopes of getting it in the right place!	No
537	I gave my Landlord everything I had, applied to a new apartment  (got the call today that I got it) but now the Landlord is beating down my door, and I'm sure he threatened me through it a few times with coming in and ditching my stuff on the side of the road.  The pay rent or quit notice I was given is invalid, and they have not served me a Court Eviction paper, so I know what they're doing is illegal. I have reached out to a local firm to get legal back up in the situation but with the threatening and feeling terrified of leaving the apartment I am wondering if I should contact the police.	No
538	Hello r/legaladvice,  I am a college student who rents an apartment for school that has a year long lease. I just found out that my apartment was flooded with water (I live in an apartment complex, the tenant above me hung a coat on the sprinkler) and some textbooks and clothes of mine are now ruined. My landlord never contacted me about water damage in my apartment, and I only found out when one of my roommates called me telling me the apartment was trashed. They also completely tore up my bedroom, it now looks like a construction site in there. They never contacted me to tell me they were doing this, and they moved and mistreated all of my belongings in the process. My lease goes until August 1, but then they finally contacted me on July 11 (days after the water damage occurred) telling me I had to be out by July 14th so they could do construction. I went to my apartment to grab my things on July 12, and this is when I found out they already tore my room apart, and found my damaged textbooks and clothes.  Is there any compensation I can demand from my landlord? My belongings we're damaged in an accident I had nothing to do with, and I was not notified at all about damage/work they did. My roommate tried talking to them and they said they are not liable, and that we should have gotten renters insurance. I live in Pennsylvania and I do not have renters insurance. Please help.  Thanks for reading!	No
539	My boyfriend and I just moved into our first apartment on August 1st. When we looked at the unit, it was perfect. Within a day of moving in, though, it's started vibrating all day, every day. I understand that no place is perfect and that every apartment has its problems. However, this vibrating is to the point where I'm not able to be in most of my apartment for more than a minute without extreme discomfort.   When we talked to our landlord, she had said that a piece of equipment in the chain restaurant two floors below us was broken, and that was causing the noise. She said it would be fixed by the end of the week (luckily, they also own the restaurant below us, so at least they have the power to make those repairs). But it hasn't. And now I'm at the point where I spend the entirety of my free time out of the apartment or forcing myself to sleep to avoid the pain.   We're willing to wait out this week and see if they get around to fixing whatever is wrong. But we can't live like this long-term. If they don't fix it, what are our options for breaking your 12-month lease? Is there a way to get our last month's rent back if we do?	No
540	My sister, Anne, (30s) is mentally ill. I am not sure of her exact diagnosis, but she has been on and off medication and in and out of therapy since we were teens.   She has a 3 year old with her ex, John, who lives 1 hour away; John is employed, responsible, and a good dad. My sister moved back in with my parents when they broke up shortly after my nephew was born.   Anne has custody during the week and one weekend a month. John gets Nephew three weekends a month. My other sister and I live out of state and don't engage with Anne or the situation much.   Anne and our parents have a volatile relationship. Anne doesn't work, does not parent, and loses her shit if my parents try to set boundaries or engage with my nephew when my sister doesn't want them to.   Without getting into details, there's all kinds of damaging shit happening to my nephew - including some concerns that triggered a visit from CPS.   Suffice it to say my sister is an unfit mother, and my parents have been in what has felt, to them, like an impossible situation. They've been terrified for my nephew's well-being and have been hesitant to lay down the law with my sister because she's so volatile. They've thought it was better to put up with the insanity as long as Nephew lived where they could keep an eye on him.  But things have apparently come to a head. My sister left my parents' house several weeks ago, taking Nephew with her. They're apparently staying at a friend's house. Again, my sister doesn't work.   The last time John and Anne met to do the handoff for John's weekend, Anne refused to turn over Nephew and John called the police. So there are files with police and CPS related to this situation.  John has told my parents he is pursuing sole custody, and my parents are supportive of this. They have spoken with John's attorney and will be fully cooperative. John's attorney sent a certified letter to my sister at my parents' house, but she hasn't lived there for a few weeks and has not come to pick it up.   As of now, Anne does not know this custody suit is happening, and I am concerned Nephew will be in physical danger once she finds out. She is obsessed with someone taking away her son and will absolutely lose her mind. She has had violent episodes with family in the past.  My questions: 1. Do my parents need an attorney? Not necessarily to pursue their own rights, but just to guide them through this to ensure the safety of Nephew.  2. I'm concerned my nephew might be in danger once Anne finds out about the custody suit. How should that whole thing be handled?   I'm actually terrified that she'll find out while she has my nephew and may hurt or kidnap him, when really the best scenario is that she finds out while Nephew is with John.   Is there anything that can be done to remove him from her care for his own safety while the custody suit is ongoing?  3. Is there anything I can do? I feel so helpless.  4. What are we (myself, my parents, my sister) not thinking of that we should be doing?  Our biggest goal right now is just to make sure that Nephew is physically safe, now and when Anne eventually finds out about the suit.	No
541	Hi there, this is really sad and scary, but I think we've reached a point where we would no longer be helping our kids or ourselves to continue living together, and our goal will need to be divorce for everyone's happiness. That said, before I talk to my wife about this and we formalize a plan, I am looking for some advice about things I need to pay attention to to ensure equitable treatment around custody and financial wellbeing should things ever get to a contested divorce or otherwise acrimonious.  Children: My wife and I have child together (2) and a stepchild (7) (she is bio mom). We are on good terms with the father and he sees his child on weekend days.   Finances: We have separate accounts. My wife holds over $30K in debt on various cards and student loans. I have a few thousand debt on a line of credit. My name is on all the house papers and mortgage etc., hers was left off at time of purchase because we couldn't qualify for the mortgage with her debt. I can't see either one of us being able to hold onto the house if we divorce, we will need to sell it.  My fears are specific--that my wife will go on an out of control spending/gambling spree (she has a historic gambling problem) during a year of separation. She gets bitter and grudgey and this clouds her thinking when she is angry. Or, that my wife will play some unbeknownst to me card that allows her full custody of our child.   Any advice about steps to take before, during, or after discussions of separation would be appreciated.	No
542	Tl;dr: In Baltimore, MD, is it legal to rent my separate entrance in-law suite (with its own kitchen and its own bathroom but with one shared door that would probably remain locked on both sides)? If so, would the person be considered a roommate rather than a tenant? What legal precautions should I take to ensure this is done correctly?       Background: My husband and I recently moved into our 6 bedroom home in Baltimore City. It was a renovation, and we designed it so it can eventually be separated into two distinct residences fairly easily. Our main residence (front entrance) would be 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths and there would also be a small 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartment with a rear entrance. To do this (not including the legal steps of getting a permit of occupancy change), we'd need to turn one door into a wall, add a wall to divide a hallway in two, and install a small kitchen in the rear living area, currently used as a large mudroom. I don't believe we need to get any further construction permits since our renovation plan, which included stub out lines gas, water, and drain lines for the future rental kitchen, was approved by the city, so we plan to do the drywall and kitchen installation ourselves.    Because we think our parents/in-laws may need this space in the future, we're less inclined to separate the space fully and keep at least one door. I believe this is (aptly) called an in-law suite. But in the meantime, we'd like to rent it to friends or other folks, maybe Air B&amp;B it, etc. So we'd like to keep the door locked on our side as well as give the tenant/roommate the option to lock the door on their side.      I understand what I'd need to do to get a legal second apartment, but I'm less familiar around what legal/contractual precautions to take for renting an in-law suite to a roommate (or if that person is still considered a tenant). I'm also not sure if the shared door locking thing is considered a violation of the housing code if the rear apartment/in law suite has their own method of egress through the back door, which would be their main entrance. The property would be owner-occupied regardless of whether it's an in-law suite or a separate apartment. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!	No
543	My daughter was refered by her dentist to another dentist to see if a very small cavity needed to be filled and to consult about possibly getting veneers. She is 17. She went back and was gone for 2 hours. The receptionist blew off my requests for information about what was going on multiple times. When they brought her out she looked like hell. They had done an unauthorized root canal on her. I am pissed off. My daughter now has a giant silver molar that was put into place without asking. What do i do here?	No
544	First of all, we live in New York State. I'm gonna keep it vague because of privacy reasons but we are on Long Island.  Back in May, my parents and I decided it was time to buy a house. We had been renting for years and decided to purchase.   As a sidenote, I'm only 18, and am beginning college in 3 weeks. This is all my parents doing the legal stuff.  So we found a condo that was in construction and fast forward 2 weeks, we bought a unit that would be delivered by mid-June.   We put down $20,000 for various upgrades and just as a down-payment. Keep in mind, since we were renting a house before this and had to be moved out by July 1st. So, we thought that this was perfect. It would be delivered two weeks before we had to move, and we could move all our stuff with ease.  Boy were we wrong.  We were told there were delays with construction, and that it would be delivered within July 7th.  Then the date moved to the 15th. Then the 20th. It kept moving.  This wasn't a major issue because we would all be in Italy from July 6th to August 6th.  Our attorney here in NY was taking care of things, in her own way. Basically, she did a really shitty job. We asked her to call and be more forceful with the deadlines and she wouldn't call, she'd just say that she trusted the builders.  Well, now we're all back from Italy and without a home. Turns out, the construction workers lied to us. On July 24th, they said the house was completed and they were just waiting for the permits to live in it from the town. My dad went to the Town office and that wasn't true, the request for the permits was made days after the house was supposedly completed.  Now, we have all the permits and are waiting for the last piece of paperwork from the bank. We have no idea what we can do, or what's going to happen. We're lost.  AND we have no idea what our mortgage is gonna be. Apparently, we don't find out until we close and sign the contract.  TLDR: Bought a house in May, gave them $20,000 and various delays and lies from the company has delayed the house 2 months. We also don't know how much we're gonna pay and when we can move in. Currently homeless.	No
545	I rent a room/bathroom in company housing. I have a month-to-month rental agreement which specifies the room I'm staying in, and indicates that they must give 30-days notice to terminate the agreement (unless I fail to pay rent, in which case 14-days).  In a couple weeks, my company is having a big meeting with people from other offices, and needs to provide housing for these people. I've been informed that they want me to move to a smaller room, so they can provide my room for someone. I have one week to move. It's a hassle, as all my belongings are here, and I'd have to make a project of moving twice in as many weeks.  I believe they are not legally required to force me to leave, but I'm concerned that they could terminate my housing contract (or my employment) if I refused. I'm not sure what to do.  My state is one-party consent for recording, so I'm considering recording any future talk I have about this.	No
546	My wife and I have two very young children (both under the age of 2) who are babysat and adored by family friends who are about our age. They love our kids almost as much as we do. We're trying to make plans for the future, including a will, and want the family friends to raise the kids if something happens to us. They have accepted (tears of joy were involved), and we just need to figure out the legal path.  Our own parents are late in their own life stages due to the age at which we chose to have children, with the youngest of our kids' grandparents about 60 years old. We have concerns with the idea of our kids losing their parents, and then potentially having to deal with losing a new set of parents in their teens (or earlier--three of the four grandparents have serious health conditions). Only one, the wife's grandmother, has what might be considered an ongoing relationship, and that's only once or twice a month for 2-3 hours at a time, always with us around.  The problem is that we expect the grandmother and the father's parents to not take this well (that's a relationship issue and not in play for this post) and to fight it legally. We'd like to know what to expect when we select a lawyer to figure out the path, and what is involved in ensuring that there is an opportunity for the grandparents to be in our kids' lives but not have the opportunity to gain custody. This is prep work to make as easy as possible what is going to be, at least in some ways, a very difficult process.	No
547	I am not sure if this belongs here, if not I apologize.  I am 14 and will be a freelance programmer/developer for software design primarily and maybe web development. In the state of Ohio(my current residence) one of the jobs I can have is what I mentioned above. The only question I have is will I have to pay taxes.   Thank you for reading :)	No
548	I recently purchased a property and there is a community driveway for the  houses next to my property and the neighbors told me that my backyard was also once apart another  community driveway for the other three plots. It is no longer a community driveway because the owner next to the entrance of my community driveway blocked access for my next door neighbor and me. Is there any way I can verify that there was a community driveway there before and bring legal action to rebuild the community driveway? Thank you for your time.	No
549	Question on what I should encourage my in-laws to do.  My inlaws own about 50 feet into the neighbor's across the roads property.  This includes the neighbors well and they have documents indicating they have water rights to it.  Recently the neighbor offered them money to purchase this section but they declined the offer as they feel its worth more  I think they should of taken it for the following reasons.  Are these valid legal concerns  1.  Neighbor gets hurt on the 50ft strip, they are liable as it is on their property 2.  This strip has been openly viewed and used by the neighbor for around 30 years.  Could squatters rights play a part here? 3.  The strip has some overgrown trees on it, if they fall and hit the house, would my in-laws be liable for damages.  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WaMhR9V.jpg)	No
550	I recently gave my tenants 2.5 months notice due to selling of the apartment and change if use (new owners are moving in).   Tenants came back with 10 days notice and demand that I pay them half a month rent back because they are vacating property early than the end of their one free month.   Legislation doesn't provide advice for these circumstances and their phone line is impossible to reach cause I can't be on hold for 45 min while I work!!! Help!!!	No
551	Throwaway for obvious reasons.  Me and my SO have both jointly signed a lease for a house last year, and the lease runs out next May (2018). Rent is $740/month, and we split every single possible thing half and half. We never miss payments. I make $1600/month and she makes around $1900. I have $5000 in savings and around $3000 in rare jewelry.  My parents live a few miles away and they would not have a single problem with me coming back. I help them out a lot with the house and cars, etc.  Things just aren't going alright with me and my SO, and we both mutually agree we do not want to be in a relationship with each other.  I have excellent credit (760+), and I would like to avoid hurting it as much as possible. What are my options as far as getting out of this lease?	No
552	Hey all,  Did not see this in the list of threads or with a search, but forgive me if something similar has been posted....  I was recently involved in an at-fault accident when I backed into a coworker's car. I am hoping to resolve this out-of-pocket and want to ensure that I am taking the correct steps. Below is some information:  * State: MA * Total damage to other car: $1,500 (dent in BMW so bit more $$$ than I hoped for) * Other party was not in the vehicle * Insurance deductible is $500 but filing a claim will add 3 pts to my driving record, which already includes a speeding ticket from last May  Ultimately I am worried about my rates going up and I would rather take the hit to my bank account now than deal with the headache on my insurance record.   After doing some research, I am looking to have my coworker sign a *Release of Claims* and was hoping someone might be able to tell me if this is the correct step to take to close out the incident once payment is given. If so, is there a particularly well-formatted template to use, and does it vary by state?  Also, if there is anything else that I should be getting in terms of documentation please feel free to suggest. I do not expect the other party to swindle me into more money, but I also would rather be safe than sorry. I appreciate the help!   **TL;DR** - Had an at-fault car accident, will pay out-of-pocket but want to ensure that the incident is finalized with a Release of Claims.	No
553	Hi there,  I am writing this on my Fiancee's behalf and looking for advice on how best to deal with the situation mentioned in the title.  My fiancee is currently living in Texas with her mom and her daughter and is looking to move to the UK to be with me. He daughter is 4 years old and my fiancee has sole responsibility to her. The father is in another state, Mi to be exact, and is completely uninvolved with his daughters life.  Even when they were in the same state about 18 months ago, he had very little contact with his daughter, so much so, that he's not spoke to his child in over a year now. My fiancee has always tried to get him to speak to her, but has never had any luck, and now she just doesn't try anymore. He makes absolutely zero effort in her life. He does not pay any child support, never speaks to her, nothing. He is named on the birth certificate though, so as far as I understand it, as she was born after 2003, and him being in the birth certificate, he has full legal rights as a parent. His daughter no longer asks after him, and is at the point where she is calling me Dad, and this wasn't something we pushed her to do at all.  Now, we're trying to get a Visa completed so they can both move to the UK to be with me. As it stands, he verbally agreed to this, so to make sure we had something in writing, we went him a letter with all the details on it about the plan to move to the UK, and asked him to sign in and have it notarised in the local courthouse. He said he would get this done, however we've yet to receive back a copy of this letter which he said he has sent, so my fiancee is getting very stressed about this, and rightfully so.  I don't fully know the US legal system, well at all really, but wondering what our next step could be. I wanted to suggest that a visit to the local courthouse in Texas could be on the cards for her to request that she has full parental responsibility, even though he is named on the birth certificate, and try and allow her to make all decisions regarding her daughter. Or at least get court permission to allow her to move her daughter over here, even without his permission.  This guy as far as I know does not have a fixed address currently, and mixes between staying with his girlfriend and his mom, does not have a telephone or at least a number we can contact him on, contact is attempted over Facebook messenger, and that's about it.  Any advice on what our next step could be would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.	No
554	Some background: I am 17 years old. My mother is a narcissist who thinks the world revolves around her. She and my Stepdad have been together for ~14 years and have a son that age. They've been married about 7 years.  It's clear they've only stayed together for financial reasons and for the three children. My Stepdad loves me and my sister like his own, despite him not being our biological dad. He takes care of us financially by himself and has built a beautiful life for us. Over my lifetime we've gone from poverty to upper-middle class solely because of him.  My mother, on the other hand, has never worked a day in the past 16 years. She spends child support checks from my Realdad on weed, alcohol, and things for herself. (Clothes, takeout, etc.)  About a year and a half ago, Mom was arrested for domestic battery and obstucting a person trying to make a 911 call. I made the call after she attacked me and Stepdad after taking unprescribed oxycodone and mixing it with a LOT of vodka. She was in jail for about 2 days before stepdad bailed her out. We made her stay in a hotel for a week before she swore to change. We dropped the charges. ...and....she didn't change. She's always been emotionally abusive but it started to get worse. My sister, 17 at the time, just had a baby. He was ~5 months at the time. Moms bullshit caused her to move out Feb. 2017 with her fiancé. This caused Mom to be okay for a while, as she blamed Sister for all of our problems. Recently it's been bad again. It's clear she's on pills again as we know how she acts on them. (more background: She was arrested for prescription fraud about 7 years ago) NOW: Last night Mom and Stepdad got into a big fight. Stepdad had one drink with Bossman before coming home, and Mom freaks and calls him a drunk. This angers Stepdad so he tries to go to bed. Mom decides to go fuck with him and turn on the lights and slam the door to their bedroom. Stepdad breaks the lights out of anger. Mom keeps antagonizing him. Stepdad decides it is in his best interests to leave. I have video of Mom pushing Stepdad out the door. But Mom took all of Stepdads keys, including his work keys issued by his company to his work truck. She claims he's intoxicated and won't let him leave. She finally gives him his keys but won't let me leave with him because Stepdad isn't my legal guardian and claims he has no rights over me.  Stepdad is done. He's filing for divorce but we're scared of what is going to happen with me. I refuse to live with Mom but we don't know if Stepdad can get custody. My Realdad is a homeless druggie, all my grandparents are either blind or deaf, and I refuse to live with any of Moms family.  What are the chances Stepdad will get custody? What are my rights? All 3 kids agrees we would testify under oath that we fucking hate her. Is there anything we can do to give us a better chance? Stepdad is willing to give Mom alimony and half of what we own with no argument. He just wants me and my brother under his custody.   Tl;dr: Stepdad and crazy narcissist Mom getting divorced, trying to be in his custody despite no biological relation.  Sorry for any spelling, I'm on mobile.	No
555	Hello please help if you can! My fiancé now 27 got into an altercation with his child's mother when he was 19 and because of that they gave him a felony and made him register as an predatory offender for 10 years. Years have gone by and all has been fine. 6 months ago he got his first dui. They put him on probation for two years. In bad luck he recently became homeless and did not have a valid address for two months. The officer called him and told him to check in yesterday because they haven't heard from him since may. So he went in today and they arrested him. Now they are charging him with a felony and his court is in 48 hours (Thursday). We can't afford a lawyer, already told the people he was homeless. I am so scared what's going to happen! We are in the state of Minnesota. Please give advice or help I am so worried!!! -Gypsy	No
556	Up-front, this a very strange scenario, but it's true.   A friend of mine found himself in a very bad situation when he was living as the boyfriend in his long-time girlfriend's house when she decided to leave him. She disappeared and left him sitting in a house to which he had no legal claim. (She makes a lot of money.)   My friend had basically saved the life of another close male friend of his, and this friend, who was also looking for a real estate investment, offered to buy the house from his ex and let him continue to live in it if he simply paid the costs of owning the house. This was about a year ago, and I warned my friend that after his last debacle, he should insist on some legal agreement guaranteeing his right to continue occupying the house. I had suggested using an instrument like a Life Estate, which I knew about via family history.   I thought he had done this (He gave me reason to believe he had.), but he is stupid about these things and too trusting, so he didn't obtain any kind of legal agreement that would guarantee his right to occupy this house. He has nothing but a verbal agreement about his living situation; his friend assured him that he could live there for as long as he wanted, the rest of his life.   Fast-forward: he and the guy who bought the house have had a falling out, and the owner of the house is making rumblings about kicking him out.   Is there anything my friend can do to avoid being evicted from a house someone told him he could live in for the rest of his life? I'm afraid he's screwed. He has lived there less than seven years if that makes a difference.	No
557	"I'll try and keep this short.  Currently selling our house and upgrading to something bigger. Found a large house in an area we love, right in our price range. The house has obviously recently been renovated by the current owner, (new paint, carpet) but needs some cosmetic work and landscaping along with a new driveway. The basement is unfinished and musty, but assumed it was due to the gutters not being cleaned up and being empty. House is not a foreclosure. Disclosures do not list known flooding, and unknown if it had foundation issues.   During the home inspection the inspector noted bowing in a wall that had attempted to be repaired with I beams, and a wall anchor on another wall. Before this I didn't know what foundation repairs looked like, so very happy to have gotten an inspection. Further more horizontal cracks were noted on all other visable walls, along with evidence water had been coming in since repairs were completed. The inspector recommended that we contact the company that completed the work and find out if they guarantee the foundation repair. It does not appear that this information is available to us. Additionally the inspector noted that the lot had grading and drainage issues, and deemed all above as ""marginal, repair as needed.""  At this point it's more than we're prepared to deal with. Our contract lists a ten day period to request in writing repairs, and if an agreement can't be reached the contract is null and void.   Are we within our rights at this point to walk away from the sale?   Thanks much."	No
558	My landlord, Ben Leeds, refused my August rent check on the first because of a 'violation'. They are now demanding the check be made out as a certified check (CC or Money Order), and it must now include a $75 late fee. My first thought is 'is this legal?'  Here's the context: I have been living in an apartment complex since 9/14. Ben Leeds took ownership of the building in the spring of 2017 (March or April) and had us sign a new lease. We have documents stating that they will send us a copy. We have not yet received a copy at this time.   On 7/25 we received a notice that a vehicle parked in our space is in violation of their policy (the car was a gift to us from a friend, but we had not yet gotten the title transferred. It had been in the space since prior to Leeds taking the property). The notice stated we had 3 days to become compliant before Leeds would take action.  That evening I sent an email to our manager asking for an extension on the deadline, as I thought it would take longer than 3 days to become compliant.   5 days later, on 8/1, I received an email back saying this request was denied. They would be inspecting on 8/7 and would take necessary action if found not in compliance.   Later that same day, I saw they had returned the rent check. When asked, the manager said she was instructed not to take it. When asked why, she indicated it had something to do with the violation, and that they would be demanding the late fee once the check finally could be submitted.   The car was subsequently towed and no longer occupies the space.   I waited until today (8/8) before reaching out to the manager. I did not get word on the verdict of the inspection. She responded that she saw the car was removed and asked when I'd be submitting the rent check, to include the $75. I informed her it would have to wait until I returned from work tomorrow.   So first, can a landlord even do this? Refuse a rent check then demand a late fee? Second, if so, does the manager (or 'upper management' who apparently responsible in denying the request for an extension) have a duty to communicate their decision in a timely manner?  Third, does the fact that they have not sent us a copy of our lease make any difference here? Ultimately, do I have any recourse?	No
559	"Hi r/legaladvice!   I live in a multi unit apartment complex in California. There is a cockroach infestation in our building. There are cockroaches in our bed, refrigerator, toilet, all counters, drawers, our furniture, and more. Our neighbors below and next to us also have infestations.  We sent written notice to the office of the complex June 28 for the cockroaches to be eradicated. We also requested either separate accommodations or to mutually end our lease due to the level of infestation. The office refused our request and said they would send out pest control to spray for 3 or more weeks to remove the cockroaches, and we would have to live in the apartment throughout treatment.  We have not been living at the apartment since June 28 due to being unable to store food, cook, or sleep without cockroaches crawling on us. As of Tuesday, they have sprayed the apartment 4 times. We visited the apartment today and the cockroaches are still (alive) everywhere. The pest control only sprays the kitchen, bathroom, and cabinets in the hallway. They have made no effort to spray the bedroom (where a lot of the cockroaches are) and the entire living room.  We have continued to pay rent.  The complex is aware that we haven't been living in the apartment. From research, I've seen that 30 days in CA is ""reasonable time"" to fix an issue. I wanted to know what next steps we could take to solve this issue. Pest control told our next door neighbor that they recommend tenting the complex, but the management refuses ""due to turnover"". We have already had Code Enforcement come to the complex and issue a violation to the office. We have also given letters to all of our neighbors in the building with Code Enforcements info/contact information for the officer assigned to the case for them to call and complain.  I'm wondering what time frame would be required for us to be able to break the lease without penalty. The conditions are uninhabitable (and we haven't lived there in almost a month) and we do not want to continue playing rent on an apartment that is not healthy to live in."	No
560	"My daughter is being forced out of her rental in San Bernandino County, CA as a caretaker of 3 horses on small ranch. I am aware this action is within 6 month retaliation timeline per CA law. She receives $500 rent discount for working every morning &amp; evening feeding plus stall clean out/grooming which is when her employer/landlord would show up to practice with his [show] horses etc.   She moved in 7/16 and is a single mother (her kids live w/us)and student divorcing her abusive husband is prison so landlord/employer was sympathetic to her &amp; became a friend/mentor or so she thought after learning of husband's arrest for domestic violence (he noticed her bruises) He started gaving her extra $ on days he was there &amp; involving her in his horse competitions and she became friendly with his girlfriend, BTW he's 60ish and a wealthy workaholic contractor. In March her new  boyfriend walked out to meet him in the barn and he angrily asked who he was then turned around &amp; left. Afterwards, days then weeks would pass without him exercising his horses or removing manure he was responsible for disposing of. My daughter's not allowed to ride horses without him present and she was limited in ""lunging"" them in paddock during high temperatures, she knew he was neglectful but didn't want break his rules. Now 3 months later, after she asked for a/c repairs which were ignored, he's ordered her to move out within 30 days (CA law is 60 days for 1 yr+) he's still angry after she called gas company to check gas dryer but on inspection, they required him to install new water heater/stove which were previously flagged, never cleared from previous violation, they told her there's only one meter so she's been paying gas for other renter (never disclosed)  FYI he's 65, who owns a land dev. business far away &amp; doesn't hire legit people to fix things correctly. He's accusing her of neglecting the horses when she cares for them as if her own. He's harassed her when he brought out new, inexperienced girl to take over her job while she's still living there so she wants to find a place &amp; move out immediately but I told her to think first, not run away as he is counting on. He used to tell her to speak up for herself when he was a ""friend"" and I hoped I was wrong after cautioning her about his motivations.  His accusations include things she's not responsible for such as trimming trees, watering dead grass when he has no sprinklers, regardless of city water restrictions. He's unprofessional and using his personal feelings towards her to fuel this. BTW she hasn't yet paid rent this month, leaving it to the deposit he said he was going to keep, now she's got a 3 day notice to pay or quit. Best advice? Sorry for length, I shared details of personal nature for insight to his personal vendetta against her."	No
561	The lease started the very day I happened into what would be the perfect situation for my family, which was fully unexpected.  The lease states they require 60 days of intent to vacate at the end of the lease, and if this is not received, a new year long lease will automatically renew.  They slipped a note under my door two months ago.  I didn't sign anything but the original lease that states this will occur.  One extra bit of info - my original lease was set to expire on Nov 1st, 2016.  When it did, I asked that my next lease end in 9 months rather than 1 year, so that my moving day would be in the summer (as I anticipated an eventual move and this would be better with school).  So my lease *actually* would have ended exactly when I needed it to.  Sigh.  I never technically signed off on this, but the auto-renewal notice did say that the lease would end on August 1st.  The company has been good landlords, and I don't want to screw them over, but this is an extremely good opportunity for my son and me, and I can't let it go without trying my best.  I'm actively seeking another tenant to take my place.  But I'm curious as to what would happen if I cannot find someone and I wanted to break the lease - are those actually the only reasons one can break the lease, or is there some other loophole?	No
562	New York here. Ill just state the whole situation, so on July 3rd, officer caught me &amp; friend urinating behind a car by the beach (no bathrooms nearby). We talk to him at the car and asks us for our ID, I stupidly give him my fake ID name as i am under  the legal drinking age. He starts to type in info and i realize how stupid that was so i give him my real info. Officer cuffs me &amp; pats me down (was never read rights?) and driven back to station . I was charged with PL 245.01 (exposure of a person), was told likely an ACD for ~6mo.  Just a few questions, is it recommended to get a lawyer for this or is it something i could handle? i only ask because in my position a lawyer would be hard to afford. Am i entitled to a court appointed defender/lawyer or anything of the sorts? also if the only charge was the exposure of a person is a judge able to see anything reguarding the fake ID.  Any help is appreciated &amp; sorry for the wall of text guys, just bugging out seeing as my court date is the 17th and trying to figure out what the next move is.	No
563	"My roommates are trying to get me to move out because they are all quiet people who feel ""tension"" because my girlfriend comes over once or twice a week and we talk and hangout at normal conversational level. There's no lease, I've lived there for 6 months and been a model roommate otherwise. Disregarding that insanity, I have two questions:  1. Am I allowed to put a lock on my door? I feel like one of them might throw my stuff out while I'm not home.  2. They keep telling me they want their other friend to move into my room and I need to leave because of the ""tension.""

565	My boyfriend's mother is apparently pretty controlling. I have met her several times and she always seemed nice, but I have come to learn that it was a facade. One day, she was upset at my boyfriend about something. He had band practice, and she threatened that if he wasn't back by a specific time that she would report his car stolen. I don't know if she would have actually done this had he not been back in time.  He is 21 and not a minor.  Pretty sure actually filing the false report would be illegal, but is threatening to do so also illegal? This is mostly hypothetical because I am sure it wouldn't even be worth pursuing and risking my boyfriend getting cut off and unable to afford school, but I'd like to know.	No
566	Hello, this is a follow-up to my earlier post (I deleted it though). Basically, the story starts last week on the 24th when I signed a lease with a student apartment complex. I signed it electronically at 12:07 p.m. and I have a copy of it.    At 1:06 p.m. that same day, about an hour later, I get a call from one of their staff saying they ran out of units and I would have to be put on a wait list. I missed the call and called right back, unaware that he had left a voicemail. After that, I signed with another apartment complex so that I would have a place to stay for the semester, as I have less than a month before the term begins.    When I tried to explain to one of their managers what happened, they refused to terminate my lease. They said that I was told I was the last unit, and I have one now, so I have to pay the rent. I told them someone from their office called me an hour later and told me they had ran out and that I was going to be put on a wait list. I missed the call at first, but I called right back and I asked to be put on the wait list.    The manager told me they cannot cancel leases and that I had to pay. He said they don't know who told me there was no spots left, but I was not on the wait list at all. Not only that, he told me I was told I was the last unit even though there is no record of this at all. No voicemail, no email, nothing. Only a rent reminder after the person had told me there was no spots left, and I had not been assigned a unit then. When I made a fuss about this is when they told me I had gotten the last unit, not before. I couldn't remember the guy's name, so obviously they thought I was lying and just wanting to get out of my lease. I didn't know he had left a voicemail, so I resigned myself to the fact I had no proof.    Earlier today, though, I guess my notifications for my voicemail started working again. I got the name of the community member who told me they were out of spots and that I could be put on the waiting list. I also have a screenshot of when the voicemail was sent (on the 24th, at 1:06 after I had signed my lease).    The only reason I signed another lease is because they told me they were out of spots to put me in. Am I still obligated to pay rent even though they told me that?    Thank you.	No
567	Living in New Jersey and my landlord passed away. Have a signed lease through June 2018 but unsure of who to pay rent to. His wife and his daughters seem to have a battle looming over custody of his assets so definitely on edge. His wife asked us to pay her in cash but definitely don't want to put myself at risk of paying the wrong person and being forced to pay again. What should I do? When and how will we be contacted about who legally owns the house?	No
568	"A couple days ago, my mother went to the doc for a bump in her eye that seemed to be infected. The eye doctor examined it and said everything would be fine if she just rinsed it with warm water for two weeks. However, my mom didn't like this advice as she has been misdiagnosed before (years ago). Upon getting another eye doctor's opinion the next day, her fear was confirmed- the bump on her eye was infected and she needed surgery within 72 hours.  My question is: what can be done from a legal standpoint? I am sure that a complaint to the hospital will just be a slap in the wrist for the first eye doctor and I would hate for the same thing to happen to another person. I believe it to be utter unprofessionalism to say ""wash with warm water and rinse,"" and so I've came here to ask for advice.  Is this medical negligence, malpractice?"	No
569	I just moved out of my parents house (I live in PA). I impulsively picked an apartment based on price and not comfort (won't make that mistake again).   Anyway my toilet was not working properly. When I'd flush, nothing. When I'd flush and hold for a second, nothing. When I'd flush, and count to ~10, it would flush. So I text my landlord over and over asking for a repair, after 1-2 months someone finally comes and repairs it. But then when I would flush it would empty and refill 3 times. I was concerned it'd make my water bill much higher so I asked for it to be fixed again. A week later I'm informed somebody came by and fixed it. I'm excited to finally have a working toilet, yet when I flush it to test it, the exact same problem is there: 3 refills. Can I call my own plumber and have him/her fix it and send the landlord the bill? Or deduct it from rent? Additionally, this landlord has taken over a month for other repairs, so there is a track record of this.   TL;DR: landlord took forever to fix my toilet and it still isn't fixed. What can I do?	No
570	"Looking for advice/a restraining order. This woman has done nothing but torment my wife and my children and constantly enrage me. Wife has said she'd take care of it multiple times, but she still hasn't, years later. Now I do have some idea of the time-frame of the following events, but not all of them. Some of them were last year.  Here's a fun story about my Mother-in-law:  12/2015 It comes out that she's been cheating on her husband for ~3 years with her husband's best friend, it comes out her daughter did the same thing for 4 months. Threatens his life multiple times to everyone who'll listen, for five months lies to everyone around her about the whole situation because of ""what he did to both of them"", comes out that she's still seeing the bf, divorces husband and marries bf so he can get his green-card.  -Multiple times has run up to my wife in the store, immediately berating her over not letting the kids come around anymore. Kids now refer to her as ""scary monster lady who yells a lot"".  -Corners my wife when she goes to pick up the kids at her grandmother's house, again immediately barging into the house screaming at the wife.  -We literally move an hour away, just to be in a different area  where there's ""no chance"" of seeing her or bf ever.  -Wife graduates college, specifically tells friends, family, etc. not to even tell her mother about it, so obviously MIL shows up but hangs around in the back so nobody sees her until halfway through, then nobody tells me because they know exactly how I'd react. Thank god for family, right? Wife breaks down about it later. Great job guys.  8/2/17 0915 Shows up at my front door, knocks, gawks at my daughter, then son as I'm coming out of restroom. Is already almost in her truck by the time I reach the front door. Pulls out in a hurry. Kid says ""why was monster lady here? I thought she couldn't find us anymore.""  She has been told on all of these occasions by my wife and I both to stay away from my family to the point that she knows what we'll say before we say it. She is consistently and actively harassing, stalking and taunting us causing us to have to watch over our shoulders when we go out, as a result not really wanting to go anywhere. Would love for this bullshit to stop and for this bitch to stop getting away with trying to insert herself into our and our kids' lives. It's disgusting and disrespectful and I wish she'd drop dead.  **TL;DR** Need crazy MIL to stay away from my family."	No
571	New poster in this sub, sorry if I mess anything up  My mother bought her first house a few years ago, and the settlers gave us a clean bill of health for everything in it. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, and a company that does septic maintenance told her that apparently there was a crack on the tank that connects to the city sewers which was cemented over recently. Does she have any avenue to get recompense, getting the thing actually repaired will be a few thousand, and I believe she still has papers from the sale that say everything checks out	No

573	Hi guys, I crossposted this on r/realestate &amp; r/homeowners but this subreddit was recommended to me as well. It's a strange situation, and we can't figure out who to contact or what to do to buy this house. We've never owned a house so it's all very confusing to us!  Yesterday, we watched a video about adverse possession, and a house that is in his parents' neighborhood came to mind: the common consensus is that a couple bought it from the developer when it was built (2003), lived in it for a year, then disappeared and it's been abandoned ever since. This is in Virginia, btw, and it's never been put up for sale.  We went yesterday to go look at it and there is a key lock on the door and signs from Wells Fargo saying that it was winterized in 2011. Otherwise, the trim is rotting off, the siding is moldy, etc. We asked the neighbors about it, and they said that they moved in 2 years ago, but the house has been abandoned for 5-6 years as far as they know. They said sometimes the bank comes to mow the grass and check the windows and door, but otherwise no one goes in it. We suspect that it's not the bank that does this but the HOA. We were able to look inside in the dining room/kitchen, and there's a few things strewn everywhere - a blanket on the floor, one picture left on the fridge, and literally all the cabinets open and empty.   We got the number off the notice and it led us to Wells Fargo's real estate division. The guy said that they don't own the house and that he couldn't find any record of it. So, we went to the court house to see who owns it.   It's still listed under the original owners, whose address is listed as a PO box in a different city. We were able to find documents about the house, and this is where it gets confusing. The documents state Bank of America as the trustee, who then signs it over to Wells Fargo, who then signs it over to ReconTrust, who then signs it over to Orlan. The last two are debt collector firms. At first we thought the house was indeed foreclosed (but why never put up for sale?), and so we called Orlan to find out how to buy it. Orlan told us they sold it in 2014, and they couldn't tell us anymore. We came to realize that they had just sold the mortgage, but the house was still in possession of the original owners.   The most recent documents are from the HOA releasing a $1000+ lien on the house back in 2014, made out to the original owners, whose address listed at that time was a smaller townhouse in the same neighborhood (wtf?). We went to that house and they no longer live there, if they ever did. But if the lien was released, the owners must have paid it, right?  Soooo, then we decided to see if perhaps the property tax was back paid and if we could buy the house from the county, since obviously no one was taking ownership of the house. I called the tax collectors, who told me that the property tax was all paid up to date by a loan servicing firm. I called them, and the lady was surprised by how long the house had been abandoned for, but she couldn't tell us why the firm was paying for the property tax - she said it was perhaps escrowed into the mortgage.   She told us to check with the county and see how long houses can legally be vacant for, but we're worried that if the county goes and assesses the property and decides that it is abandoned and can be auctioned off, we won't be able to afford it at auction. It's worth $500k+ and our budget is $350k. We did as much free research as we could online to find the original owners, but they seem to be ghosts. They're in their 60's now, though, so the lack of social media presence is understandable. Adverse possession is also out of the question since the property tax is paid.   At this point, I'm going to try to reach out to the HOA today to see if they have any contact number for the owners, but it seems like reporting the house to the county is the best option to free it up. But, does reporting it risk the fact that it may go to auction and we won't get it? Or will the county perhaps allow us to make an offer first? Can the county even do anything if the taxes are paid and it has a listed owner? We're entirely unsure if we should just give up or continue looking into this.   Tl;dr 6yr+ abandoned house's ghost owners live elsewhere and may still be paying the mortgage, property taxes are paid up to date by another firm, mortgage has been sold several times, house is rotting &amp; HOA put a lien on it that has since been released. How do we buy it?  Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. If anyone knows any other subreddits where I can xpost this for more advice, it would be appreciated as well.	No
574	"Hello, everyone.  I submitted 60-day notice to break my lease with my current apartment complex because of noise complaints against a tenant. In addition, there are renovations being completed that have been handled poorly so I wanted to get an idea of what steps I should do next or what I could expect.  1) **Noise:** According to my lease, a tenant must:   ""Respect the privacy of your neighbors with regard to televisions, radios, and stereos.  Gatherings must not become loud, boisterous, rude or generally disturbing to other residents.  Residents playing loud music in their units, the common area or cars will be in violation of their lease and may be issued a citation for disturbing the peace.""  The city noise ordinance says:   ""As to multifamily structures including apartments, condominiums, or other residential arrangements where boundary lines cannot readily be determined, operate or allow the operation of any sound amplification equipment so as to create sounds registering 55 db(A) between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday or between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Friday or Saturday or 50 db(A) at any other time, as measured from any point within the interior of another residential unit in the same complex or within the boundary line of the nearest residentially occupied property.""  I have spoken to him in person, called the office over 10 times, emailed the office, called the courtesy officer twice, and called 911 once. Despite these notices, he continues to play music through a subwoofer on his television after 11 pm, often throughout an entire night.   Since talking/calling/emailing/911 did not stop the music issue, I decided to submit my notice because the behavior continued. I have lived here 4.5 years and this has been a constant the entire time. The apartment has changed management twice so I'm afraid they will ignore everything.   2) **Construction:** My biggest concern is the safety of the walkway and the lights. On July 6, the walkway looked like this:  http://imgur.com/71Jq3ZF  My boyfriend had to crawl over the boards to get to school that morning.  I feel like a small amount of debris is absolutely understandable, but this is not easy to walk over and it has nails sticking out.  The exterior lights have been out since July 5, and the manager's email says construction replaced the lights when they have not as of last night. The below image is the view from the sidewalk and the place where the light should be installed.  http://imgur.com/QpTPDTS  http://imgur.com/dziOj0P   **Reply:**  When I emailed corporate (after emailing and speaking to someone in the office) to bring the noise complaints and the walkway/lights to their attention, I got an email saying they would not release me from my lease.   ""I understand you have had some issues with noise from your neighbors that our on site staff has addressed with your neighbors.  We have also shared with you that we have a courtesy officer that could assist in these matters after business hours.  While I cannot address issues that occurred prior to the management change to [company name], you mentioned that you have emails that you could provide regarding your complaints to the office.  I would be happy to review them for you.    As for the construction, we have sent out numerous notices to the residents informing them of the days their buildings would be under renovation.  Understand that in the middle of this renovation some debris will fall but is being picked up on a daily basis.  We were unaware of the lights in your building but once we were made aware of this, we had construction put them back immediately.    Without further documentation that our on site staff with [company name] has not followed policies and procedures, I cannot agree to release you from your lease at this time.  If you would like to provide the documentation you alluded to in your email, again I would be happy to review them on your behalf.""    I'm not worried about this part, but if you read his reply regarding the fact they provided notice about the construction, the notices that were sent out regarding the dates the construction crew needed access to my apartment were incorrect.  The first notice stated the construction crew would need access to my specific building's apartments on June 29. The construction did not actually start until July 5.  The second email stated construction would replace windows for my specific building on July 18. The access to the apartment was not made until July 24.    I have not emailed him back yet, but I have compiled a list of my previous emails and dates I called the office, called police records to confirm I called 911, taken pictures at night of the unlit building and took pictures of the uninstalled lights.  I can pay a buyout fee of $1416, but I would like to avoid this because I feel like I shouldn't be penalized for all the times I've contacted management and nothing is being done regarding the noise complaints. I'm also uneasy because he was willing to say the lights were put back by construction when they were not.  At this point, I would pay the buyout fee just to leave here and avoid the hassle, but is there anything I can do to get them to let me break the lease? Any tips on what I should email back? I have a draft prepared with the pictures and previous emails."	No
575	This will probably get long. Sorry. All names are fake.   &amp;nbsp;  When I was younger and stupid (19 in fact), I married Chris. Chris and I had a long history reaching back to when I was 13. Chris is mentally ill in several ways, on and off drugs, has no respect for women, about 30 different charges in his arrest record over half of which are assault on a female, kidnapped his child with another woman at one point two days after the child had serious surgery (it took a week for our local police to get off their asses and do something about that one, and in the end I only think they did it because the child was on a prescription diet and Chris could not purchase it).... I personally was cheated on, hit, trapped in my home, emotionally abused, infected (deliberately) with an STD, financially destroyed... I have horrific stories of things that he has done to me, which I've never told anyone.    &amp;nbsp;  The reason I've never told most of these stories - not even to my therapist or my current partner - is because Chris seems incredibly normal to most people. He is very, very good at manipulating, lying to, and confusing those around him. Without getting into too much identifying detail, our marriage fell apart over the course of a couple months, and I left. Then he came to where I was staying, convinced me to talk to him, and ended up putting me in a situation where I could not physically stop him from having sex with me even though I told him no, nor call for help. Yes, I know what forcible sex without consent is called, and I don't like to call what happened that. Mostly because that was the night my daughter was conceived.    &amp;nbsp;  It took me a long time to completely sever ties with him - I am not proud of that - especially when he was able to use my daughter as an 'in'. He has now not seen her in over two years, almost three. It became very clear that he was not interested in seeing her, he was interested in using seeing her as a way to manipulate and torture me, bum money or a place to stay or rides, control who I saw and what I did, etc. I stopped the visits after one where he picked her up at 1 pm; we had clearly agreed she would be back before 4 pm, and he texted me after he left and said he'd decided he wasn't going to bring her back until 7 pm, and threatened to not bring her back at all. He had lashed out in that way because I'd told him he could not take my then-2 1/2-year-old to a comic con out of state for 3 days, where she would have been staying in a hotel room with him and 5 of his mostly-male adult friends, all of whom made clear their intent to drink heavily (not that it would have mattered if they were Mormon virgins, because there was no way it would have been appropriate for her to accompany him to that), none of whom had a legal license and insurance. Thankfully, he is not on her birth certificate, and as far as I am concerned, never will be - there has been no DNA testing and no legal establishment of paternity. So I was able to tell him to bring her back or I'd call the police.    &amp;nbsp;  Another thing that helped me be able to finally stand up and set firm limits was my budding/new relationship with James. James and I had a brief fling when I was 16, hadn't spoken for quite a while, and things just kinda sparked just under 3 years ago. Our relationship is wonderful in so many ways. I am with someone who respects and loves me, who doesn't hurt me or scare me, who tells me the truth... He is everything I could ever want in a partner. In addition, although I neither intended or expected things to end up this way, he is a wonderful stepfather.    &amp;nbsp;  We have had no contact with Chris for a very long time (other than one recent attempt to get some medical information for a geneticist visit for my daughter - he said he'd look over the forms and email them back 'tomorrow', a week later I gave up and filled out what I could myself). However, we do hear quite a bit secondhand from a mutual friend who Chris doesn't know keeps tabs on him, and a couple of my &amp; James' friends who he thinks are somehow his buddies. This is a small town, so it's less wierd than it sounds. About six months ago, one of my friends ran into Chris at a bar. He hung around for a few and overheard Chris spreading the rumor that James, my boyfriend, was a pedophile.    &amp;nbsp;  My friend specified that it seemed to be a sort of shitty joke, playing off James' chubby-guy-with-beard-in-glasses look. However, I was pretty ticked off, and I'm very aware of Chris' 'jokes' and how he likes to pretend he's just joking when he's really either being cruel or trying to manipulate people. I spoke to Chris' sister, who I do have a fairly good relationship with, and she gave him a pretty big dressing-down. The issue seemed dealt with and done.    &amp;nbsp;  And then a couple days ago, Chris called our mutual friend and was chatting with him. At some point in the conversation, he started trying to claim James was a pedophile, and his 'proof' was that I was 15 and James was 20 when I first met &amp; had sex with him. This is not true, I was 16 and James was 19, Chris knows that I was 16, it was 100% legal in our state (NC), and regardless it was a consensual teenaged fling that lasted all of two weeks! James and I are 2 years and 5 months apart, for the record. I am currently 25, about to turn 26; he turned 28 a couple months ago.    &amp;nbsp;  Our mutual friend is not patient with Chris' continual lying, and happens to quite like James, so he brushed it off and made a joke about 15 year olds being mature enough to make their own decisions. Chris became angry that he wouldn't play along and hung up on him. The mutual friend then told me about the conversation, and added that in a group chat he was in on Facebook with Chris's friends, Chris has brought this topic up 'jokingly' repeatedly.    &amp;nbsp;  If this was just harmless gossip, I'd continue to ignore it. However, again, I am a single mother of a five year old, living with my boyfriend - stereotypes are definitely against me. If the wrong person hears these 'jokes', I could lose my child while it was being investigated - Chris knows this, because when I was pregnant, he deliberately incited someone else to call CPS with similar spurious accusations, in the hopes that I would be under investigation when my daughter was born and lose custody, which led to my younger siblings not being allowed at my mother's house (where I lived) for a month while they investigated whether or not my pregnancy was the product of incestuous rape of an 11 year old male sibling. Again, not exaggerating this in the slightest. Chris is well aware of the intricacies of the CPS system and the ways to abuse it due to the fact that he spent most of his childhood and teen years in and out of it.    &amp;nbsp;  Knowing that the jokes/accusations have continued and that he is deliberately twisting dates/ages/events, it's clear that he is actively trying to make people think James is a pedophile, thereby implying I am putting my daughter at risk (there is probably also an element of jealousy that my daughter has another father figure). There is 100% no truth to this. However, we have no clue how to handle the deliberate slander, nor if we even should do anything. I doubt I could involve the police; they are notoriously lax in our town for anything that doesn't involve physical violence, and there's no proof he's saying it (or that it's meant maliciously, not a 'joke'). I can't prove anything he said over the phone to someone else, nor can I obtain Facebook chats in any form that would be legally admissable. I feel that any contact with him, whether direct or through an intermediary like his sister, would merely fuel the flames, so I don't necessarily want to try that again.    &amp;nbsp;  But, I also feel that something should be done. James is leaving the decision up to me, although he did say if he runs into Chris in public he's probably going to break his nose. Considering even if this went no further than gossip, James could have his reputation ruined - which in a small town, could also lead to him losing his job - I can't really fault him. In addition, whether deliberately incited or otherwise, it is 100% within the scope of possiblity that Chris' less savory drug-addict friends would attempt to corner and attack James. They have, at his behest, stalked and assaulted people in the past, including myself. Chris again has also kidnapped a child in the past, although I don't believe he has the financial/family resources to do that again and as he is not on the birth certificate it would not end well for him.   &amp;nbsp;   R/relationships felt this fell under a legal question, and suggested I post it here.    &amp;nbsp;  **tl;dr: My abusive ex-husband Chris has been systemically and deliberately trying to spread a rumor that my boyfriend James is a pedophile (he is not). Seeing as I have a 5 year old daughter, this goes beyond possible damage to James' reputation and puts our day to day lives at risk. I am not sure how to proceed or if I even have any recourse to handle this.**	No
576	Hi all. I really need your help. My sister was put on a 72 hour hold at a psychiatric hospital after she went in there to talk to a doctor about her depression and thoughts of suicide. 72 hours have passed and she wants to go home now but the doctor has put her on another hold. What can I do to get her out of there? This hospital is really horrible and provides no help at all. She is not taking any medications, which tells me that her depression is not that severe. They just want to exploit the patients and insurance companies. I have been trying to contact her doctor but no success so far. Please help!	No
577	I own an acre of land recently a company bought 40+ acres behind me.  I have tried calling the zoning and planning board to no avail no one can tell me whats going on.  I am wondering if they may try to buy me out if they do what should I expect?	No
578	I'm a guy and will be getting married later this year. As I understand it, here in California, it's $435 to file a change of name petition. My fiancée will also be changing her name, to take me (new) surname. I *believe* the $435 covers a family, assuming the changes are done at the same time. If so, makes sense for us to change them together. Can anyone verify?	No
579	On 7/7 my landlord texted me saying she was selling the house we live in. I was a little shocked but ok it's her house and we just rent it. Her text stated we have 30 days to move out. I responded by politely stating that since we are currently month to month ( we had a one year lease but stated on as periodic tenants) and have been living there over a year we were required to receive 60 days notice. I also asked for us to be served properly as I believe an unclear text message was not proper notice.   Landlord sent a certified letter dated 7/7 stating our move out date is 9/1. By my count the date should be 9/6. Landlord scheduled a walk through with her realtor a few days later which was fine. At the time she said she would forgo giving us our deposit back in exchange for us not paying rent for August. She said the house was in great condition (true). The Realtor wanted to put a lock box on the door which I objected to. We have dogs and I don't want people in and out of our home when we aren't there. She agreed and I asked for 24 hours notice of showings so one of us can be home.   Then the realtor sent a super aggressive photographer to take pictures of the property. Fine it was super invasive but it's done. Now the realtor is texting me wanting showings with two hours notice. I said no and gave her a list of other times that would work when someone would be home.   My question is:   Should I address the 60 thing or just cut my losses and move on 9/1? I want my landlord to give us a good recommendation. We are actively looking for new places but haven't found one.   What can I do about the realtor scheduling  showings? What are my rights?   Thank you	No
580	Hi,  I currently run a technology tutoring service for the elderly. I meet one-on-one with them in their homes and am paid hourly.

581	"I will do my best  to lay out the facts as I understand them. First I will say that this situation has baffled my BIL who is an  RCMP member (~8 years) and his corporal. Also, all information relayed to me from Pops, pardon me if some of my terminology is off.  * Me. Concerned child of frustrated Dad who can't process paperwork in peace and mourn his mother's passing for the bullshit his brother is putting him through.  * Dad. Power of attorney during illness, named executor of her will. He and Mom live 600-700 KM north of Winnipeg and have taken time off work travelling south to take care of the estate and arrangements.  * Uncle. He could be described as transient, ""lives"" (weekly rental) in a downtown Winnipeg hotel and works day labour through a government program. He has been what you might call the 'black sheep' of the family. Nonviolent but unreliable, unbalanced, and kooky. Borderline alcoholic for 30+ years (little to no other drugs). The rest of us are down to earth, stable, solidly middle class folks.       My Grandmother passed away Aug 1 from late stage, rapidly advancing cancer. Only just diagnosed in May. For the 3-4 weeks preceding her passing my uncle had been staying with her to provide care and assistance. He considered himself to be live-in although he still had rent paid up at the hotel downtown. Immediately after her passing he began referring to her house as his own. After a day or so of Dad's arrival, Dad started suggesting Uncle might be best to move back to his place so the process could begin working through the house. Argument ensued capped off with police being called (first of about 4 total over the following week) to have Dad and the rest of the family removed from 'his' house. Dad/Mom/Sis/BIL were all in from out of town and staying there at the time. They decided to give him the time alone he was asking for for a few days while trying to resume the paperwork and preparations   Flash-forward to today. Numerous attempts to reason with Uncle took place (each one ending with a call to police). Dad has spoken to clerks at the court house, City Police, three different lawyers. Uncle is officially claiming only to 'live there' (he has mail sent there) although rent receipts exist from the other place and there is no tenancy agreement. As this is a civil/property matter (court system) and not a criminal matter (police) Dad needs to have a Judge or Sherrif determine legal right to be there and place an order to have the police remove him. THE PROBLEM: the will has not yet been probated, and will not be for a couple of weeks. Dad has legal responsibility to secure the property and protect the assets BUT he has NO legal authority as the owner until the will is probated.  This now gives Uncle free reign over the house to (potentially) damage, (almost certainly) dirty and stink it up with cigarette smoke, while Dad is spinning his wheels waiting for the legal system to catch up.  Has anyone had experience with this sort of situation? Based on my knowledge and research there is no so-called ""squatters rights"" in Manitoba that Uncle can lean on, there is no tenancy agreement so nobody is required to serve 30 day eviction notice. He is literally 'legally trespassing' and taking advantage of a legal limbo situation while Dad waits for an appointment to have the will sorted out.  Does this make sense to anyone? Obviously this is not first hand, and I am leaving out the less important bits but I think that's the jist of it.  Can anyone offer advice? AMA!"	No
582	"Hi everyone,  Not sure if this is the best sub for this question, but this is the best I could find.  Please let me know if it's misplaced, and I'll gladly move it.  Suppose my roommate, whom we'll call ""X,"" and I are living in an apartment.  At the end of the lease term, X will stay in the apartment and renew the lease, but I plan to move out from the apartment and have my roommate's friend, ""Y,"" take over my bedroom in the apartment.  To do this, the management company wants a $50 application fee as well as a $150 ""transfer fee.""  In my mind, the application fee is reasonable because they have to make sure that Y isn't a serial kitten rapist or anything like that.  But besides being a naked cash grab, the $150 transfer fee seems ridiculous because a) they're charging us more than they would charge a completely new applicant, despite the fact that we're saving them from having to deal with turnover, and b) we're not switching people mid-lease, we're switching at the end of the lease term, so I don't see how such a fee would be applicable.  So, my questions are:  a) Is it typical to charge a transfer or replacement fee in this situation?  b) Are they even legally allowed to charge a transfer or replacement fee in this situation, since nobody is transferring within the specified lease period?    This is all I could find in the TAA lease that looks relevant: ****************************************** Replacements 30. Replacements and Subletting. 30.1 When Allowed. Replacing a resident, subletting, or assigning a resident‘s rights is allowed only when we consent in writing. If a departing or remaining resident finds a replacement resident acceptable to us before moving out and we expressly consent to the replacement, subletting, or assignment, then: (a) a reletting charge will not be due; (b) a reasonable administrative (paperwork) fee will be due, and a rekeying fee will be due if rekeying is requested or required; and (c) the departing and remaining residents will remain liable for all Lease obligations for the rest of the original Lease term. 30.2 Procedures for Replacement. If we approve a replacement resident, then, at our option: (A) the replacement resident must sign this Lease with or without an increase in the total security deposit; or (B) the remaining and replacement residents must sign an entirely new Lease. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, the departing resident’s security deposit will automatically transfer to the replacement resident as of the date we approve. The departing resident will no longer have a right to occupancy or to a security deposit refund, but will remain liable for the remainder of the original Lease term unless we agree otherwise in writing—even if a new Lease is signed. ************************************  Thanks in advance!"

583	I have these neighbors who have 6 dogs and 4 cats. Over double the legal limit for both animals and every time I go over and when I'm at my house I can see and hear them being beaten and abused. What are my options? Do I call animal control? What are my boundaries legally as far as helping/ protecting theses animals? Pls help!	No
584	We are purchasing a house in NJ and have already gone through the process of getting approved for the mortgage and set up a closing date for this Friday, July 14th. House has been appraised for slightly more than what we are purchasing and we are in a contract with the seller since a few months ago.   More background information: The house has been appraised that satisfies the bank, the repairs have been done that we and seller both agreed upon, our title company requested for a closing date to be set for this Friday, everything had been done according to what information we received before. However, the seller's title company and broker just did a title search on the house, last Thursday, and it came up that they have 4 mortgages on the house (one that is over 500K, even though the house is worth half of that), and is now in foreclosure status so we cannot move forward with the closing. According to the seller's agent the seller told them that all of the mortgages had been paid off, but the seller never provided the proof of that except for one of the four mortgages to the seller's agent.   Now we have already put thousands of dollars into this ordeal; 2,000 for the deposit, ~1,200 for the appraisal and inspections, among another few thousand for various other fees for the purchase.   We have emails from the title company and the seller's agent stating that we cannot move forward with the closing because of the unpaid loans on the house. Our agent told us that they already did a title search back in May and it came back clear, but now its not according to the seller's company. Our real estate agent and our loan coordinator have never come across a situation like this before ever as they told us. Which makes sense since the lender would not have moved forward with the loan process in the beginning if this was the issue. Both our agent and loan coordinator have told us that we can sue the seller and the seller's agent since this is in breach of the contract we signed in the beginning.   We are just baffled at the fact that this is all coming out a few days prior to closing and we are in a tight spot since we were supposed to move in next month. In addition, our current lease is up as well since we planned for moving into the new house.   We have already contacted a few lawyers and are waiting to hear back from them.   How do you guys see this situation? Is there anything we can do from a legal standpoint at all? What would you guys recommend?   Thanks guys any and all advice is appreciated greatly. If theres anything that I missed above about the issue please ask away. We are in dire need of help with this.	No

586	Hi!  I have a lease on a townhome but am not currently living there. My lease is up July 31, but the landlord has allowed new tenants to start moving in. Their stuff has been there since at least July 22. Once I found out their stuff was still there I called my landlord demanding a prorated amount of rent to be returned to me, as well as an estimation for utilities. This will total to approximately $500.  The landlord is now threatening to withhold my security deposit, stating that we broke a door (despite giving us the ok at the walk through).  My husband and I have again reiterated that we only want our prorated rent for the time that we know we had left the house and now our landlord is ignoring our calls.  Is it within my legal rights to seize property in the home that I currently still have a lease for? That is the next step we were going to take. Thanks for any advice.	No
587	Location: Alabama  My ex just served me with court papers saying I owe her $15k in back child support. I got hurt on the job several years ago and she knows I can't pay. She's just upset that I am filing for full custody and so now she's trying to get back at me. I just got a part time job a couple of months ago but didn't work for years trying to get disability.   Can the judge make me pay or send me to jail when I haven't even been working all this time? The child support was set when I had a job but that was in 2010. What happens if I can't pay?	No

589	currently in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, I'm working on getting out (all without his knowledge) I'm just trying to tie up loose ends. A few months ago I fell asleep in one of the recliners in our living room and when I woke up he had his phone out and showed me ALOT of pictures he took of me with his penis out and on my face in various different places. near and almost in my mouth from what I can remember. he only showed them to me that one time then refused to delete them when I begged him to. be he wouldn't even show them to me again when I asked. he laughed and thought it was funny and never showed them to me again. I feel so violated. what can I do? press charges? ensure somehow they get deleted??	No
590	Hi there! I live in Colorado and have a question about a security deposit dispute I'm having with my landlord. Colorado law states that SDs must be returned within 30 days, unless the lease states another period, which can be no more than 60 days. My lease stated 60 days.   I contacted my landlord (a company that owns a bunch of apartment buildings) on day 71 after my lease ended, inquiring where my security deposit was, as I hadn't received it. The leasing manager told me that it had been mailed out 30 days ago, and gave me the address it was sent to, which was wrong. I double checked that I had given her the correct address, which I had, and I let her know that it was mistaken. She apologized for the clerical error and said they would write me a new check and send it out asap.   I finally received the check in the mail 85 days after my lease ended, and found that they had taken out $134 from a $500 security deposit, and did not provide an itemized list of the reasons.   I'm planning to write a 7 day demand letter, since a) they did not provide me a list of the deductions taken, which is illegal, and b) CO law states that if the landlord sends the SD after the 60 day period, they are not able to take any money out of it.  I'm hoping for some advice as to whether the above checks out. I'm particularly wondering if the fact that they sent out the check within the window, just to the wrong address, at their own error, in any way negates the fact that they sent it late, or whether the fact that I received it 85 days after moving out is all that matters. Thanks for reading and I'd appreciate any insight, this is my first time dealing with something like this.	No

592	I moved into an apartment in Florida with a roommate and paid the entire deposit (chalking that one up to a life lesson). Now that we are moving out, I am moving to a separate state and she is simply moving to a smaller apartment in the same complex. Because she is staying, the complex is automatically moving our deposit from the current apartment into her new one, and not cutting any portion in a check.  Both of our names are on the current lease, only her name is on the new lease. Am I just out all this money or do I have any legal grounds to force her to send me half? Is there any way I can force the apartment to send a check instead of simply giving the entire deposit to her?	No
593	I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this	No
594	I'm going through a divorce right now and I was hoping to get some guidance here. Im currently stationed in Virginia but was married in Alabama and thats where my soon to be ex-wife is currently living with our 2 children. So we have a mutual agreement contract which states she'll be taking all payments of the second vehicle and Ill be giving her a certain amount of money for child support until our children have reached the age of 18. The contract is signed by both of us and is notarized as well.  So on the beginning of this month when the contract was supposed to take place she told that she didnt want to buy the car from me because she doesn't want it.  So now Im stuck paying for another car I cant afford and was wondering if itll be worth getting an attorny to help with that along with the divorce paperwork. Like what would happen if I got an attorney to press that case for me? What would be the negative consequence of her breaching a contract? Or would I be out of more money than before because I now have to take that route. I was also hoping someone could tell me how long we have to be separated in Alabamas laws in order to file for divorce. Ive googled and I cant find anything on an amount of time we need to be separated. I know Virginias laws and they're easy to find but thats not the case for Alabama since we were married there.   Im planning on getting an attorney but I want to have as much knowledge as possible before I do. If you have any questions please ask. I'm activr military and Ive already spoken with legal quite a few times but it always comes down to then telling me to find an attorney in Alabama without any real guidance.   Thanks in advance!	No
595	I own in a really strict HOA and the renters nextdoor have it in their head that I am somehow connected to some fines they got (I am not connected in any way). They have signed me up for PornHub, put my phone number and email on Craigslist in an explicit ad, and stared down visitors to my home who later mentioned it to me (I never told visitors of the issues.)   The landlord and property management company are non-responsive. The HOA is monitoring the situation.   I have made police reports and reports to the HOA where it made sense.  Is there something else I should do? Can I take another approach, like civil court?   x-posted	No
596	My mother, who I've been estranged from for several years passed away recently. I'm the only real family she had so I've begun the process to sort through the estate.  She always had some hoarding tendencies but I discovered after going to her house that she had become a full-blown hoarder. Like, rooms so full of junk that you can't access them.  I've run into 3 complications so far that I'm dealing with:  1. Despite an exhaustive search, there doesn't seem to be a will.  2. She was a renter, and the landlord obviously wants the house cleared out.  3. Under what I've read on NC law she would almost certainly qualify under the NC Small Estates law (I seriously doubt that in all that trash there's over $20,000 worth of property.) But under that law I cannot become administrator of the estate until 30 days after she died.  I'm trying to do the right thing by the landlords since they were personal friends of my Mom for over 20 years, and I've found a specialty hoarder cleanout company that can empty the house out.  So here's what my questions are:  1. Is it legally OK for me to clear the house out despite me not actually being the administrator yet? Everyone basically has already been treating me like one since there's nobody else to challenge me on it, but it won't be official for at least a couple more weeks.  2. The cleaners have said that since I'm not actually administrator yet that they want a letter from an attorney stipulating that I'm the only heir. How difficult/expensive would it be for me to get this?  Thanks in advance!	No
597	Brought a perfectly fine Mazda CX-9 to Pep Boys for new tires. Now it constantly stalls out and they say it's because of a cracked intake manifold. I've called my insurance company and filed a claim, but does anyone else have any ideas how to best handle this situation?	No

The video was 15 seconds long and she now claims that she was not a willing participant in the taping. Felony charges have been filled but I haven't actually been charged or arrested yet. I should know more in the next day or so. Needless to say I have an appointment with a divorce attorney first thing tomorrow morning. What are the chances that I will be charged and convicted of this and what does my sentence look like? I have no proof that she was a willing participant and there are plenty of texts saying ""I'm sorry. I thought you knew"" so it looks really bad on me.   I'm sure to be a nervous wreck over the next couple of days."	No
599	So we're in a conflict with my neighbor. There is a tree on his property but all the branches grow out on our side and it leaks sap all over ours cars in the driveway. They're constantly covered in thick sap. Asked him to cut it down he said no. So my plan is to cut all the branches that hang over my property line. I'm going to sheer all the limbs off tomorrow. Is that against the law?  Thanx in advance for any advice.	No
600	Hey so my roommate signed a lease with me and is mad that I am dating someone. So he was hoping to leave the place in a few weeks and stick me with the bill. However, he does not realize that he signed the lease WITH me. What are my rights? Is it up to him to find a new tenant? I have animals would that effect his ability to find a replacement? Do I continue to pay the landlord my half of the rent? I'm just very confused as to how I need to handle all of this. It was a one year lease and we are a few months into it. I've paid the dmg/pet deposit in full and he has also been slamming doors around the house and might intentionally cause damage.   Thanks for the help :)	No
601	10 years ago parents house added an extension on their deck. Entire room is elevated 8 inches with wood. The room extends past the cemented deck so a portion of it is just overhanging over dirt. Overtime water sipped in a bit and recently we noticed termites on the floor of the overhung area towards the house wall. Wall and a portion of the room needs to be replaced. Is there any legal action we can take or will it all have to be out of pocket? Thanks in advance.	No
602	I live in a [Mitchell-Lama](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/mitchell-lama-rentals.page) co-op.  I moved from a 2 bedroom to a 3 bedroom in 2011.  They never transferred billing of my garage fee to my new apt.  I wrote the management company &amp; CC'ed the President of the Board telling them to do so.  They didn't.  I figured screw them, I did my duty, I informed them, they ignored me.  I wash my hands of the situation.    Now 6 years later they're sending me a bill for six years of monthly fees.  My question is...do I have to pay?  Is there any kind of statute of limitations?  It is after all their job to bill me.  Their screw up, not mine.       PS:  Just so nobody thinks I'm that bad a guy...  After all, why shouldn't I pay for my garage space...  This was an incompetent, possibly corrupt Board with an utterly incompetent &amp; almost certainly corrupt management company.  They were already fighting with me on other issues.  So I felt justified not paying, if they're too incompetent to bill me, even after I brought the situation to their attention.	No
603	"In Dec 2006, I was in the process of making a move across several states. While driving up, I admittedly going WAY too fast, trying to make it to a job interview in my new state. (I previously had never had any traffic tickets.)  Anyways, I got pulled over in Dinwiddie VA, ticketed and cited with ""Reckless Endangerment"" for how fast I was speeding. This was also the last time I drove, as I was in a friend's car (with her egging me on, speedwise. No excuse, but I shouldn't have given in to peer pressure) as I had already sold my own to finance the move.  Because every last dime I had went to a new place to live, I couldn't afford to a.) pay a ticket or b.) even make it back to where I was ticketed to go to court.  It's been nearly 8 years, and having this outstanding ticket has been killing me. I've wanted to set it right, go to court, take my punishment and move on with my life. I've been utilizing public transportation for the last 7+ years, as I'm certain my license was revoked.  I'm still dirt-poor, but finally in a place, financially, where I'm getting close to having enough to afford a lawyer, the trip and hopefully the ticket, so I went back to the VA General District Court website for the first time in a few years, and it appears that it was dismissed last year?  Is that possible?  Under the ""Hearing Information"" it has two dates with different results:  01/28/2010- Continued  05/09/2016- Finalized  And under ""Disposition Information"" it says  Final Disposition: Dismissed  Everything else under ""Disposition Information"" is blank, or set to 0. (Like Sentence/Suspended Sentence/Probation/Operator License Suspension Time...)  I was expecting to pay something to the tune of $2500+ to settle this out. Does that mean it's gone and I don't have to go to court/pay a ticket?  Could I walk into a VA DMV (I reside in VA, just on the other side of the state) and get a new license after so many years, or am I looking at consequences for letting it go this long?"	No
604	So my fiance and I live in the Bronx and our lease ends on August 15. We've given our landlord ample amount of notice that we were leaving (about 4 months ago) and that we'd actually be gone by August 1. We even went on vacation for two and a half weeks last month and gave them permission to showcase our apartment in our absence.   However, since we've been back, the man who is supposed to be showcasing our apartment has not been the best at letting us know when he'll be showing up. On one occasion, he even broke into our apartment while we were napping. He thought we weren't there because we didn't answer our phone within the 5 minutes he called. He tried pulling the stunt again a second time, to which we said no.  The one time he gave us notice of him coming, nobody showed up. He didn't even show up.   My landlord just texted us stating that if there is a delay in renting out the apartment, we will be held responsible. Can they do that? We've only been back for two weeks. They've had and will have so many opportunities to showcase our apartment, can they legally withhold our deposit for this?	No
605	"Il  I was stupid and lucky. I parked somewhere with free parking for an event at a con. Only rule I could see was ""No overnight parking"". I get back to my car around 1am to someone calling  in my car to be towed. He said that once the mall closes you can't be parked there and it's a big fine. Luckily he let me go.   Now, this is just for curiosity sake, but he put a big sticker on my car window. On the driver's side back one. It isn't coming off easy, it's ripping like a sticker does and is leaving behind sticky shit. It's irritating. Is it legal for someone to vandalize my car like that?"	No

607	"I have a bug infested apartment due to bugs on the outside coming in. Got fed up after complaining and 1 failed exterminator attempt, so I wrote a review on the landlords FB pg. I was waking up to bugs crawling on my walls and being told nothing could be done again bc my downstairs neighbor is pregnant. I wrote a simple one sentence review saying there were bugs. My landlord verbally agreed to let me out at the end of this month. Now his sister, a realtor, screamed at me to take the ""slanderous"" review down or im stuck with the terms of the lease. She even told me to say I wouldn't slander him again and then I'd get written proof im out of my lease.   It's not slander, or even libel. I also have an email from his sister, the realtor, saying ""OK we will get you the written email that you are out of your lease"" more than a week ago. i deleted the post but she refuses to communicate with me. I'm in the middle of moving. I was told I could move. The review wasn't a lie. The review is deleted but I feel uncomfortable writing a letter saying I lied when I didn't and I think shes just retaliating bc she lost money on the lease. What are my options? Unfortunately the lease sucks and it's up to the landlord to break it, I don't even have a 60 day notice like some leases. Although it was dumb to write a review, I feel like I'm going through hoops to leave this apt. I should also mention the apt might be illegal.  Thanks."	No
608	I went to look at an apartment recently and decided I liked it. I filled out the application and paid the $45 fee, and gave them a check for the deposit, $400. They approved me and scheduled me to come in and sign the lease next week. I later decided I would rather buy a condo or townhome instead after talking to my parents and friends, and called to cancel the appointment. They told me that because I had been scheduled to sign the lease, if I didn't sign, it would be forefit.   When I get home tonight I am going to call my bank and put a hold on my check, does anyone know if this is legal or what recourse I have?	No
609	(To clarify, my license and insurance company are both NC, the accident took place in TN.)  I was driving down a main road in Johnson City with my roommate, getting ready to turn left—I signal, get in the left lane, make sure traffic's clear, and manage to get about halfway into the intersection before I'm suddenly hit from behind, taking out my passenger-side tail light. The lady who hit me pulled away pretty fast, all the way over to the right shoulder according to the cop I spoke to—regardless, I didn't see her at all, and thinking I'd just been hit-and-run, I got out of the intersection, pulled over, and called police.  Both me and my roommate talked to the cop, told him what went down—basically everything above (minus the part about the lady pulling over, I didn't find out she'd done so until well after the fact).   So two days after the accident, the cop we spoke to calls me and says I switched lanes illegally, cutting off the other driver. Not what I remember, but I figured at the time I might have gotten into the left-hand lane a little later than I thought I did? He claims to have traffic cam footage of me cutting her off, though (though he says he's not going to write me a ticket), and that I can drive out to the station and view it anytime he's working—I haven't had the chance to do this yet.  Then two days after that, the accident report becomes available online—according to it, I was alone in the car and I made my turn from the right-hand lane, across three or four lanes of traffic. My memory's not great, but it's certainly not bad enough for me to forget having done *that*—and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been possible to sustain passenger-side damage in that event, anyhow. I called the officer in question and gave him my roommate's name and DOB, and asked him to clarify the narrative in the report just in case I'd misparsed it.  Long story short, cop is claiming that I'm at fault and I'd really, really rather not have that on my insurance record—I've been driving for four years without an accident. I can't do anything at all about this for the next two weeks, as I'll be across the country. So I guess what I'm trying to ask is—what should my next steps be, and what exactly is going on here in the first place? Are they just counting on me being an out-of-towner and not willing to drive back for the footage?	No
610	Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm just looking for some quick advice. Yesterday, I got pulled over in Crownpoint, Indiana for going 104 in a 70.(Yes, I know it was stupid and I learned my lesson). The officer that pulled me over said he was only going to give me a ticket instead of something worse. I'm just wondering how much the ticket would be since I have to wait four to six weeks. Also, since this is my very first offense, does it lower the price or anything? Don't know if this means anything, but I admitted fault to the officer and told him I was in the wrong. (I guess that's why I got off with just a ticket and not a misdemeanor or anything.) Thanks in advance.	No
611	"I live in a small apartment complex west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin with only six units, so there's only one washer and one dryer in the basement (coin operated). The dryer broke in early spring, so I had to drag my laundry and bedding to a local laundromat, which is not an easy task since I have to park my car in a municipal ramp a block and a half away.  I have emailed my landlord four times: 6/9, 6/30, 7/12, and today (7/19). The first response I got was ""...that dryer doesn't belong to us and we have to call the responsible party to pick it up. New dryers should be installed in the near future."" The second response I got was ""we apologize for your inconvenience and will follow up with the vending company as to when the new machines will be installed."" I never got a response from my third email; I just sent the fourth one about 15 minutes ago.  Although the washer and dryer are not explicitly noted in my lease, there is a part that says ""pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 704.07, Landlord shall keep the structure of the building in which the Premises are located and those portions of the building and equipment under Landlord's control in a reasonable state of repair.""  **TL;DR:** Landlord will not replace the lone dryer on site and has only responded to two of my four emails.

612	My tenant breached the lease by bringing 2 cats.  I posted here.  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pg3g8/md_tenant_brought_2_cats_to_my_condo_lease/  I went to  the property. The carpets are destroyed and the whole place smells like a litter box. My realtor had to leave because he is allergic and was having a reaction.  I send her an offer to leave the premises by August 31 2017 and she can get the full Security deposit back. If she leaves by September 30, 2017 she has to pay for repairs to the carpet. The carpet was destroyed by the cat urine.  So anyway she has stopped all communications with me. We had this agreement that she would direct deposit half of the rent in advance every time she gets a paycheck. Her first half of the rent (for September) was to be deposit today. She has stopped all direct deposits.  I texted her politely asking her if she can give me an idea when she will be out of the property given that by her stopping our payment agreement indicates she does not intent to pay for September as usual. She did not reply.  So if she does not pay by September 1st, can I file for eviction September 4th? Can I file for breach of lease and non-payment? Or just for non payment.  Thanks in advance for any help.	No
613	"Earlier today roommate and I discovered that our landlord wedged a 6-7' long piece of wood to support a tree branch that is getting heavy. The wooden piece is in no way secure at all, simply wedged between the bottom of the branch and the ground. Upon inspecting the tree it seems that the branch is getting heavy and there is risk of it breaking off.  The tree in question is right next to our parking spaces and we are concerned that there may be significant damage to our cars if the branch fails. Now, first question: if the branch were to fall in this case, could an automotive insurance company refuse to pay out claiming it was an ""act of God""? Keep in mind the presence of the wood means that the landlord has identified a potential weakness in the tree.  We have spoken to the landlord about our concerns, and he says that he will tie a rope around the wooden piece and the branch to secure it. I'm not sure this would serve as a good permanent solution, as it would still be possible for a breakage to occur. So far he is unwilling to trim the tree to lessen the weight. In case the branch does fail, what legal recourse do we have? Would our landlord be liable for damages?   Any suggestions on how to deal with this scenario are appreciated."	No
614	Throwaway for obvious reasons:  I'm writing this on behalf of my sister whom after over 10 years of marriage is faced with a failing marriage. I would personally define the relationship as abusive on both sides. However the Husband physically has abused her on occasions and has basically financially dominated the household, where my sister gets what she gets and that's it.  There is also a business involved. I can get specifics as needed however I wanted to start a discussion.  My Sister was informed by her Husband that he's gone to a lawyer and has removed a good portion of the business account to an account in his name - apparently under advice from his lawyer. He's also cancelled all of the credit cards of my sister as well.  She still has access to the buisness account and asked me if she should take the money a lawyer on her side would want (5k is the number I was given) however I'm not sure on the specifics again.  Her plea to me is honestly, she doesn't know what to do. She's depressed all the time in an abusive relationship. There are two Children involved in their teens. Their assets look good from the outside however there is a mortgage that isn't getting paid apparently. Like I said, she's just overwhelmed and does not know what steps she can take.  Also - just as to why I'm doing this - he has keyloggers on all the computers in the house, tracks her moves through her phone. The only reason why I haven't gone numerous times to deal with him is honestly the legal ramifications. So I want to help my sister but honestly I don't have the answers so I feel I'd reach out here.  I wish I could give more but obviously my sister is ashamed of all this, as we come from a divorced household she views this as a huge failure on our side.  Thank you for any advice and I will do my best to answer followup questions if there are any.	No
615	My son’s father filed for a child custody modification last year. We are going to trial at the end of the month. The original judgment handed down by the court gave me primary physical custody with visitation for our son’s dad on Wednesday nights and every other weekend.   I cannot afford an attorney so I will be representing myself at the trial at the end of this month.   I have a few questions: 1. His lawyer emailed me a “take it or leave it offer” regarding visitation (for me) which I declined to sign. Since then, my son’s father has not let me see our son. His lawyer indicated in the email that I could not show the judge the “offer.” Is the lawyer allowed to say this? My son’s father has now said he will ask the judge for me to see our son a few hours each week.   2. DCF (Mass) was involved during a domestic violence incident in 2015 in which I was arrested and my son’s father had a 51A filed against him for abusing me. A 51A was filed against me as well because I was arrested in front of our son. At the time, our son was 4 months old (I had full legal and physical custody) and I was used to the abuse and thought it would make more sense for me to decline to press charges against my son’s father so that my son wouldn’t be taken into custody by DCF. How can I most effectively tell the judge the circumstances of that night?  Thank you in advance for your help.	No
616	I am one week from moving to a new state and out of nowhere my wife wants a divorce. We have a toddler aged daughter. She had been the one pleading for the move. Ive already quit my current job, and cannot get it back. I have no option financially but to take this job. The job pays significantly more than what I am making now. I am freaking out, if i leave the state, am i giving up all the rights to my daughter? She is hounding me now about rescinding our notice and allowing her to stay in the house we are renting. I am in shock right now. She locked me out of the house with no access to a car. I am worried ill never see my daughter again.  I am contacting lawyers and getting answering services. Hoping one gets back to me soon. Just hoping someone could give me some guidance here. I am completely stuck.	No
617	My wife and I signed an apartment lease that ends at the end of July.  We recently bought a home and moved into the home in early June.  We did this knowing that we would still be paying our last month's rent in July.  We moved the majority of our things when we moved into our home but left a few things that were not necessities in the apartment and planned on getting them before July was up.  We went by our apartment this past Wednesday and got a few loads of the things that were left.  We noticed that the pest control had come by and sprayed that day.  Today we went back to get the remainder of our things and when we walked in the apartment we noticed several lights were on and our stuff had been rummaged through and several things were missing.  There is no sign of forced entry so we knew it had to be somebody with a key.  We called and spoke with security to explain what happened.  He called and spoke with the apartment management and got back with us.  He informed us that management had let a cleaning lady in our apartment to start cleaning and this cleaning lady assumed that the previous tenants had already moved out and everything left in the apartment was free for all.  Property management never notified us or asked us if it was ok for this to happen.  He told us that our things are in a storage shed at the apartment complex and we will be able to get them back tomorrow.  We have no idea what all exactly was in the apartment before this cleaning lady entered so we're just supposed to take their word that everything that was taken will be in this storage shed tomorrow?  What rights do we have here?  Thanks in advance.	No
618	I am a student in Quebec.  Seven of us are moving in, and only two have signed the lease (as is common). I have not signed the lease.  We get verbal permission from the landlord to move some of our belongings in early. Half the previous tenants have left, so there is space. I moved in early with all my stuff. I sublet from one of the previous tenants, but did not personally get permission from the landlord, but  I find out later that this previous tenant did not tell the landlord.  Five days in, I start getting hundreds of bites on my arms and legs. It turns out that the place is infested by bed bugs, and has been for a while, with 4 ineffective treatments over the past year.  I move out and back to a friend's house, taking only the essentials -- clothes (which I treat in the dryer), and laptop. I leave the rest of my stuff in the house.  I tell the other future tenants, and the landlord calls a meeting -- tells us that the previous tenants are to blame, and that the house will get heat treated in the next week.  Some stuff (aerosols, a violin) cannot withstand heat treatment. I get verbal approval to go into the house and move it out before the exterminator comes.  When I turn up to the house, the landlord is there with the exterminator. The landlord tells us that we are getting steam treatment in just some of the rooms, rather than the heat treatment we were promised.  I argue with them for about 2 hours, and eventually they agree again to heat treatment. The treatment is scheduled for 10 days later.  I go in a week later to move out the aerosol/violin etc. and find that the landlord has thrown away most of my belongings because they were covered in bed bugs.  What are my rights? If I take him to small claims court, am I likely to win?	No
619	My mom has a copy of his will from 1981. The will is not notarized, therefore my family is wondering if it is a legal will. My mom's uncle, my grandpa's brother, is the executor.  If my mom needs a lawyer, which I'm assuming she does, she is in southern Cali and my grandpa died in northern Cali. Should the lawyer be by my mom or by my grandpa.   If the will is legal, my grandpa had two more kids after the will was written. What are those two kids entitled to get? My mom wants to add them to the will but I don't know if that is possible. If it isn't, I think she wants to give them what they are entitled to regardless of the will.   Last my aunt is also in the will. My aunt is bipolar. She is not really able to take care of herself. Most of the time she prefers to live under a bridge even though she has a home. My mom wants to give my aunt my grandpa's trailer but she is worried about leaving her money. She is hoping the money can go to someone who can monitor what is given to my aunt. But if the will directly leaves my aunt money is that possible?   Thank you in advance.	No
620	Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	No
621	I drank yesterday and while drunk cut myself because I was mad at my landlord for yelling at me to clean the bathroom. I live in this house with 6 other women, and they were bitching about me not cleaning the bathroom. I don't even fucking take showers, and they're saying the hair in the shower drain is mine. It's not even the right color. Because of that, my landlord now says I need to keep my bedroom door open. That's fucked up. Can she legally do that?	No
622	My Mum passed away 3 years ago and in her will she left her house to her partner then upon his passing it was to be sold and proceeds divided between the 3 grandchildren.Her partner and my sister never got on and he has made a will leaving the house to my wife and I. What recourse would my sister have to enforce the original will?	No
623	Hey everyone,  I posted here a few days ago asking about this but deleted it (I know we're not supposed to do that now, my apologies.)  (NYC) We saw an apartment with a broker from a big rental company, signed a fee agreement stating that in the event that we rent an apartment in that building we owe the company the commission fee. We almost signed with them but they would not wait over the weekend for our guarantor paperwork even though we had put down a deposit. We backed out and went to look elsewhere. We found a new broker who showed us a few places we didn't like and then he tried to show us one at the building where tried to apply to before. We got excited, applied, and got the apartment.   Now the original broker is coming at us for the fee which we thought we were going to have to pay. We did however find out that they do not work with the same company anymore and is asking us to make a check payable to this new real estate company. In the fee agreement, it explicitly states that we are only to make the commission payable to the company that showed us the building. Not to the name of the broker, broker, and certainly not a whole new company. After seeing this we decided to contact a lawyer who believes that that is illegal and we only have to pay if the original company comes after us.  The broker is not contacting me from any company and is instead sending me text messages directly. When I mentioned that we will not be making a check out to the new company they are requesting or them personally, the broker got upset and is now threatening legal action again. Basically saying that we have to pay the new company so they can process it through the old one.  This all sounds extremely fishy and again, nowhere in the one fee agreement that we signed does it say anything about a new company, the broker receiving the fee, or any transfers between companies. The only issue is the original company no longer has that building under it's listings and it looks like the broker took the building over to their new company.  We are contacting the lawayer again today but I was wondering if this all sounds like bluffing because to my untrained legal mind, we would've had to sign something saying that the fee can transfer companies before paying a whole separate entity instead of who it says to pay in our agreement.  Does anyone have any experience in NYC rental/broker laws?  Thanks for the help!	No
624	I am in Washington state. I am on a year lease and am pretty sure it states I forfeit my deposit if I move out early. This is a long one, so I don't blame you for not reading.  So it all started upon moving in. We did a walk through, it was 5pm in February, so it was dark out (we found all sorts of things after the walk through that I know they're going to try to screw us on).  To spare you all the details, we didn't end up staying there until the next night. When we went to take a shower the next day, there was no hot water. We fucked around with the weird instant water heater but could not get it to work. By this time, it was after hours on a Friday. After harassing them all weekend, we finally had hot water that Wednesday.    Then, they freaked out on us that we got a puppy. Even though we had told them we had planned on getting a dog, at no point did they tell us it had to be pre-approved or that there were age restrictions. We managed to haggle our way into a trade-off because of the whole water fiasco.   Then, they call us all the time, at least once a week. About hey, someones gonna stop by to do this or, in the summer time someone is going to have to do this. They wouldn't tell us how to get the dog's paperwork all done, and then kept calling us when we had done it wrong.  They gave us a call saying someone was stopping by to look at some water damage noted in the walk through. We say it's not a good time and they're like oh shit. Look outside and there is a van pulling in. Not much of a 24 hour notice. They left right away though.   In rolls spring/summer, and surprise! they do quarterly inspections (for our benefit of course).  They give the time frame of 9-5 on a weekday and that they need full access to the house. Also, somebody is coming to seed the grass, oh and we need to water it in, but no one has shown us how to work the irrigation system.  Plus, the dog can't be out there. All day long.   They do the inspection, and we get a letter that some areas need the weeds pulled. The areas aren't in the lease, but I decide I'm capable of handling that. A few days later, I get an email saying that they found a pin hole in one of the blinds with a shit resolution picture and that the slat needs to be replaced. I go inspect all the blinds and not one of them is damaged. After going back and forth over these fucking blinds for a month about are you sure that's our house? which blinds are they? bedroom 1, which bedroom is bedroom1? okay, where on the blinds is it? having to deal with a whole bunch of bullshit, sending them 20 pictures of the blinds in detail, they finally send the inspector back out, she goes, says she doesn't know why they didn't just mark it as fixed, looks at blinds, scratches off a piece of dirt and says they're fine.   Then they say the landlord is stopping by for a few days to paint the house and do other outdoor work but no one needs to be home. While he was there, he needed us to open the gate, and he took off our front door, so we went a day without a door in the heat.   Then comes the final straw. We had someone over, roofing the house. Once again, all outdoor work, no one needs to be home. Good cus it's a Monday and we have jobs. Well, I got home and my dog was gone. They had unlatched a gate and left it open. I drove all over the neighborhood looking for her. Stressing out major. I tried calling them, to ask wtf, pissed at this point. Then I get a call from them, saying some neighbor had called the landlord saying they thing the dog got out and that the landlord had left the gate open for the workers when he left. They said they would call back through to see if they had my dog.  I went outside, about to go searching, when I heard her whining. She was next door. It took hours to get her to stop whining. The neighbor had watched her all day, took her swimming, and asked around the neighborhood about her.   I called the management company letting them know I had the dog but that I was still unhappy with all this shit. They basically said, oh we will just note this in your file so it doesn't happen again. This is not good enough. I am so tired of dealing with them. The house and area is alright, but I am so sick of having to deal with this company. I just want to live somewhere, pay rent, and then move on. Not be called or visited by them all the time and then have them screw up this badly.   What can I do?  TL;DR management company sucks, indirectly responsible for my dog going missing, and a whole host of other issues.	No
625	I just got home today, and there was a letter wedged in my screen door that had a bunch of information on it describing our termination of tenancy. The thing is, my house isn't rented, we bought the house, and the name that the letter was directed to wasn't ours, although it was our address. Is this a scam? Should i just ignore it?	No
626	My wife's ex-husband took out a $20k student loan in her name back when they were married. It was a physically and verbally abusive relationship so she did nothing about it at the time or during the divorce and since the loans were under her name he said he was not responsible for any of them. Fast forward to current time, I'm helping her pay them off but sick of it and wondering if there's any legal ground for us to sue to make him pay it. He opened them up under her name but they were married at the time so in my mind should both be responsible, at worst case for half of it. Any advice you guys can give would be super helpful, or just let me know if I'm boned here and can't do anything about it.	No
627	The individual who signed a lease with the landlord has a two bedroom apartment and subleased out one of the bedrooms to myself.  The individual is currently living in the other room with dogs and did not specify in the sublease contract that there would be dogs living in the apartment as well. Furthermore, the individual left their belongings in the room I am subleasing.  The sublease agreement was without the knowledge of the landlord.  I am unhappy with the arrangement and looking to leave. I want to know if the sublease contract will hold up, as it was done without the knowledge of the landlord?  The individual's original rental agreement states they cannot sublease without the approval of the  landlord.  What are potential actions I can take to get out of my sublease agreement?  Thanks in advance for your help! (I live in California)	No
628	(Indiana and California, for the bot, but I think it's all federal.)   My former cell phone provider thinks I owe them $300. I disagree, but that's not really the issue here.  I sent a general dispute letter the first time it was sent to collections, asking for verification. Instead of verification, I got a letter back from the collection agency that they were returning it to the cell provider. Today, I got a new letter in the mail from a different agency.  I plan on disputing that one as well, but if the same thing happens, is there a point where I'm done? Or can the provider just keep sending it to a new collection agency every time I dispute it, rather than having them actually send the verifications they're required to provide by law?   Sending certified letters will eventually rack up more than the debt, but I'd hate for the one I don't send certified to be the one I actually have a solid FDCPA violation with.	No
629	"I wanted to start off by thanking everyone who replied to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5ywoop/tenants_are_revolting_against_other_tenant/). I appreciate the advice given to me.   To give an update of sorts: It turned out that the charges against Joe were dropped a few days after I posted here, the parent apparently coached the child into accuse Joe of molestation because she wasn't comfortable with a man at the daycare center. Unfortunately, the harassment against Joe and his family did not stop after that. Someone tried to break into his apartment in the middle of the night. I decided to install the cameras as was advised, and let Joe out of his lease without penalty. Joe and his family were grateful for this. So they left around two months ago.   Unfortunately, the other tenants have not calmed down. Now they have turned against me. Someone found out I let Joe out without penalty, and it pissed them all off. I got my apartment tagged with ""FUCK YOU PEDO"". I caught it on film but my tenants were savy to the cameras, and had masks (or stockings) over their faces to prevent their faces from being seen.   I took this footage to the police but they told me they can't do anything without their faces being shown.  My tenants have been purposefully waiting until the absolute last minute to pay their rent. My newspapers keep being taken. Someone smeared animal feces on my car window. Someone has been taking my mail. It's becoming too much for me and my own family. I sent a certified letter via my attorney to all of them, asking to cut it out. Someone cut up one of the letters and left the bits scattered in front of my door.  My question here is, can I evict all of my tenants? Is that possible?  If I catch them committing crimes, is that enough to convince a judge to removing their tenancy?  I've been logging and photographing as much of the harassment as I could. State is New Jersey."	No

631	So I was randomly home in the middle of the day on Tuesday because my dad was in town. How often or How much the neighbor flys his drone over my house I have no idea, I work 10-12hrs a day 5-6days per week. I live on 1 acre out in the country (unincorporated county) and all the houses are spread out so from no where on my property can you see any other houses at all, very private and secluded which is why I bought it. There is a great expectation of privacy where my home is, this is not cookie cutter track homes in the suburbs. I have a small parcel, but all nighbors are 5-25 acres.   So I know which house it came from as I watched it go back and land, but I had to leave to go back to work immediately and couldn't go talk to him also I was very angry and wanted to cool off first.  He hovers this thing directly over my house and goes down about 25 feet off the ground (10ft above my house). I'm outside with my phone out taking video of him taking video of me.  It was a really nice expensive drone. I wanted to shoot it down (shotgun obviously, rifle is unsafe and travels too far), but can't legally because you have to be 300ft from a property line to legally shoot a gun . The property is perfect square and is 200ft by 200ft.   Can I legally take it down with a sling shot or pellet gun?   Yes he'll come looking for it, but I have a key coded gate with 6 ft privacy fences and he won't be getting in at all. Dude is seriously invading the privacy of me and my wife.   He'll then file a civil lawsuit against me for the cost of the drone? Which he might win?  Can I file a restraining order against him for the drone shit? Should I go talk to him?	No
632	"Hello,  I recently moved out of an apartment... My lease was not renewed because the complex is renovating each unit, and they wanted me to move into a different unit (along with an $200 increase in rent).   Anyways, when I moved out I left the apartment clean, patched all the paint holes, etc. I didn't do a particularly thorough job cleaning the appliances/cabinets (I left them empty and wiped down, but didn't detail clean them) as they were going to thrown out during the reno.  Yesterday, I received my deposit back. The statement said that my deposit was being deducted by $55 for ""misc. damages."" The 'itemized' statement only had the beginning balance of the deposit, cleaning fee ($0), the misc damages ($55), and the ending balance of the deposit.  I know in Ohio, that landlords have to provide an itemized deposit... But how detailed does it need to be? I called the property manager, and they said it was 'likely' due to broken blinds and a damaged curtain rod, but wasn't sure. When i asked for more detailed information, they said that they weren't required to provide a more detailed statement because the management company is based in New York... I told that even if the parent company is based in NY, they still need to abide by Ohio State Laws, he got mad and hung up.  It's only $55, so I don't know if its worth pursuing, but I'm more curious for future reference. What constitutes an 'itemized statement' under Ohio laws for rental security deposits?  TL;DR: Security deposit deducted by $55 due to 'misc. damages.' Property manager unwilling to tell me the specific reasons for the deduction, due to the management company being based in NY, while property is in OH"	No
633	"On Jan. 31, 2012 I left my abusive (now ex) husband. The next day, I got a restraining/no contact order against him. Divorce was finalized 12/12/12.  Fast forward to 5/5/15. I was pulled over by the police and I wasn't sure why (I'm careful, don't speed, etc.). I was told there was a warrant out for my arrest for the past 3 years! I asked the officer to please double-check and re-run my license.  He did and told me the warrant was for ""Failure to pay a medical bill to [name redacted] Community Hospital"". Officer's exact words.  I was taken into custody and was in a holding cell for several hours while my son and my current boyfriend paid my bail. I was held on a $5000 bond for a $1000 medical bill.   On 5/8/15, I went to my mandatory court date. I thought I was going in front of the judge, as per my release papers. I  was actually taken into a conference room with the owner of the collection agency that was holding this medical bill. I tried to explain to him that I had no knowledge of the bill and no knowledge of a debtor's exam....I didn't go  to the debtor's exam because all papers regarding this issue went to my ex's house and I had the no-contact order. I had NO way of knowing about any contempt of court charge from missing the debtors hearing.  I was told by this man that if I missed one more payment or was late even by 1 day, that he would re-instate the warrant.   I have been paying $25/month for over 2 years now and they still say I owe over $700 on this bill. None of my $500 bail went for the medical bill....and this is a medical bill that I believe is actually my ex-husband's.   I did take the owner of the collection agency to court and was only awarded damages in the amount of $1000. I was not allowed to take the 2 police departments involved in my arrest to court. Both agencies harrassed me during my arrest even though I gave them  no problems whatsoever. For instance...when I was switched between departments,  I was put in leg irons and my wrists chained around my waist and had to ride in the K9 cruiser and I was told I was the ""new chew toy"" and they threatened to sic the dog on me for no reason. I was harrassed for ""ignoring the bill"". Mind you, my ex's father is also a bailiff in that particular jurisdiction and at the time I still had their last name.  One more point of interest....when my bail was paid, the owner of the collection agency who also posed as a judge on 5/5/15 was the one who signed for my bail! (I still have the receipt).   My question is, do I have any recourse in any of this? Is there some way to make all of this go away? I honestly cannot afford this bill and I do not believe it is mine....no one has ever sent it to me to look and no one will show me. I honestly do not know if it even exists.  How can I handle this. This bothers me and since this whole incident, I refuse to  drive alone and I  get scared to even go into the jurisdiction this happened in. This is negatively affected my life and I'm fed up about that fact. Please help/advise. Thank you!"	No
634	I need help, more accurately my grandma needs help. She is getting evicted at the end of August. She has had my mother staying with her. My grandma is the sweetest little old lady and can't see that my mother is a leech. My mother hasn't paid rent, she doesn't clean, she does nothing to help my grandma. She has the money to help get my grandma from being evicted but is just letting it happen. My mother is paranoid. Is manic depressive, and has bipolar all untreated. She is a leech to the point her own father wont take her in and he has done it once before.   I want to know if there is anything I can do to get my mother away from my grandma or to make her pay up. I would prefer to remove her from my 73 year old grandma.   I would rather have my grandma hate me over her supporting her daughter till she passes. My grandma also still works. My mother should be supporting grandma not the other way around.   I also live in albany, ny. They are on long island. I have a month to do something. If you need more info just message me please and thank you.  (Not sure if tag is right but I'm not sure what this would fall into)	No
635	Okay, so I live in the US (Colorado) and the boiler in our building broke last week. We haven't had hot water in 6 days, and every day they swear they were working on it, calling different contractors, etc. Management has been screening everyone's calls and emails. End of day 6, the water is back on and they say it's fixed. Day 7 at 2pm they email everyone saying it's permanently fixed. 4 hours later we have no hot water and they say it's still getting fixed. Their only offer to compensate us was ordering pizza for the building.  TLDR: Is it legal to make me pay a month's worth of rent when we didn't have hot water for 1/4 of it?   I have no way of proving it was 7 days ago since I didn't document it, but I did submit a work order about not having any hot water on day 2 of this fiasco. I'm concerned they may claim it was fewer days than it really was.   (For context, I commute 2 hours every morning and get home late due to traffic, so the errand of showering at the YMCA across town is an extra hour on my day and has been a huge hassle.)	No
636	**Background:**   My parents have been looking for an investment condo to purchase in the town I live in, they live in another state. They figured they would allow me to live in the home for rent, until I purchased something of my own. They are realtors in their home state, I am a mortgage lender licensed in both their and my state.   The tasked me with the search since they live in other state. I found a condo that we liked, they used the listing agent to put in an offer, I took on the role of the lender. After contract was accepted things got difficult. The realtor (Pat) and his collegue(Bob), respectively, represented my parents (Buyer) and Natalie(Seller). They were terrible, constantly missing paperwork, failing to perform even basic tasks (they skipped the inspection, left me alone with Natalie and the inspector). Because my parents are realtors they were able to get everything squared away legally because they knew what to do. There were many arguments about who was in charge of repairs and the items in the house, my parents and I simply said, we'd be sticking to the contract. Ultimately we said screw it on the repairs, we'll do them.  **Problem:**   Closing was scheduled for 45 days putting it on July 15th. Since that was Saturday, we suggested 14th or 17th. The seller asked for additional time to stay in the house. We said no, because the contract stated 45 days and we wanted to stick to it.   All day today I asked the Buyer's agent, Pat, to provide me with keys and meet me at property to ensure everything was in order. Pat said no problem, asked me questions about when recording and funding would occur (I am the loan officer for the lender). At 4:45 pm I told him recording and funding had occurred. He immediately sent me a message saying that the keys were in the shed but that Natalie was mad because she couldn't stay longer so she took the washer, dryer, and AC. I informed him that those items were in the contract and part of the sale. I told him I'd be filing a police report for theft, he said no problem, good luck. I also told him I'd be filing a complaint with the BRE for fraud and deceptive practices for allowing closing to occur when he knew that Natalie was in breach of contract. He perked up at this point, and realized he might be a little boned, claimed it's no big deal, it was all old stuff anyway.  The buyers contacted escrow and placed a hold on the money for breach of contract so it hasn't been dispersed yet. I'm hoping everything will resolve itself tomorrow, and the seller will realize their stupidity and return the items. But if they don't I am not sure what will happen, as I don't think escrow can unilaterally hold funds (they need permission from both parties), which puts ownership of the condo in a gray area.   Thoughts on how to proceed?	No
637	Hello! I just got married last month, and in addition to my wife taking on my last name, she and I are adding her maiden name as second middle names.  My question is this: do I need to do things like renew my passport and driver's license with the new middle name? I've heard things like the license won't even have both middle names on there because of space constraints, and for most of my transactions/official things, I won't even include my second middle name because of a lack of space in the form or inability of the form to accommodate a second middle name.  In essence, do my passport and license (and other similar documents) need to reflect my legal _full_ name? Thanks in advance!	No
638	TLDR: Landlord is ending our roommate's monthly lease, she refuses to move out and is threatening legal action.    I live in a household of 3 women, including myself. My roommate and I are on the original lease while the 3rd roommate agreed to a monthly sublease. Due to recent events, feeling overall uncomfortable and somewhat threatened by the new roommate, we offered her 30 days to find a new place. She claims we have no right to end her monthly sublease and has threatened to take us to court. With my limited knowledge of Chicago leasing laws, I understand we may not directly be able to end her sublease, however she has no lease with the landlord and he is able to end her sublease. He gave her a signed 30 day termination notice, she still attempted to pay rent after the notice and he didn't accept her portion from her. Is there anything else we can do to get her out of the house? I want to go about this as civil and legal as possible.	No
639	I am in an on-again-off-again relationship in which I have a six-year-old who I am almost positive is mine, and a two-year-old who I have always had questions about. She has blue eyes neither of us have blue eyes she doesn't look like me she doesn't act like me. So it raised my suspicion. I decided to do a home paternity test and found out that the chances that she is my child are 0%. I am named on the birth certificate as her father. I assumed it was the case at the time. I'm currently paying child support for both her and her six-year-old sister along with private schools for them both. Her mother constantly calls me a horrible dad and says that I should be doing more. What are my legal options at this point? I don't really know that I would do anything other than support this child, because I do love her. I'm just looking for my legal options. I am in Tennessee.	No
640	"Well to put it simply my roommates called the sheriffs office on me? They said i wasn't a legal resident and screamed at me and when i tried to go into my room they pushed the door open and yelled at me some more. but yea i've been living here for over 3 months and have been paying 500 dollars a month for half a room i wasn't late or behind on the utilitys they ""the three gay roommates that all have sex together"" decided they didnt want me there any more and said they wanted me gone by the first of the month. the current situation is that they called the sheriff to have me kicked out right now and i know that i am a legal resident and i have pay stubs with this address and my name on them going back months. so im wondering if ill be okay if the police actually arrive and what to say to them."	No
641	My mother had a heart attack in March and she's been in two different hospitals since then. The first hospital released her to the second with an idea that when she recovers there, she'll go to another rehab facility. She has not recovered and the issues are still going on. (For context, she was told she should have triple bypass surgery which I agreed to.).   I'm not sure what to do legally or personally at all. We have a house and I own a condo. Another hospital that wants to take her for rehab wants her on Medicaid, but she can't get on it because she has assets that go beyond the requirement. I also don't have access to all the financials in any case because I can't get my mother in her current condition, to sign a power of attorney.   Again, I'm not sure what to do.	No
642	"Hello all, kind of an extension to a previous post.   Recently, my roommates and I signed a lease and moved into an apartment that has a no pet policy. However, my roommate has an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) that has documentation for given to her by a licensed therapist in the state via telemedicine. We have done research, and found that we do not need to disclose an ESA to our landlord (correct me if I am wrong) under the Fair Housing Act.   Upon noticing that there was a dog in the unit, the landlord gave us a 3 day notice to cure our ""breach."" My roommate then gave our landlord the letter stating that the dog spotted was an Emotional Support Animal. Even after my roommate sent the letter to our landlord, our landlord asked that we either get rid of the dog, or we will be given an eviction notice. He stated that there is an ""undue burden"" due to having the dog, for the reason that under CA State Law, he must disclose that there was a dog living in the unit to future tenants, possibly harming future business. Is this true? Following this, he also stated that his attorney told him that we signed a contract under ""false pretenses,"" given that we moved in with a dog, and that this would override any discrimination to an individual with an ESA.   We have found a place for the dog to stay in the meantime, and want to bring the dog back, as it provides my roommate with the support needed to live not only in the apartment comfortably, but in the college town we live in. To appease our landlord, we have cured our breach. Even after sending him the letter, he told me that 1 of his supposedly 8 attorneys wanted to move forward with an eviction given we did not have the dog off the premise.   We have submitted a complaint to HUD, hoping that the fact that ESAs do not have to be disclosed upfront will help us out, and that our landlord's action is discriminatory.   Also, the lease specifies that PETS are not allowed. Because this is an ESA, not a pet, were we ever in breach?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you."	No
643	"Hi guys, this is my first time on Reddit but I figure if there's one place that I can get some answers without hiring a lawyer, it'd be here. So to start out I am a small time YouTuber looking to use viral videos in my channel in the context of ""Videos of the Week"". I contacted the publisher of this video 'Jukin Media' in hopes in receiving permission to use a specific viral video. However they told me it would be $1000 just to be able to publish in my video. So the most logical thing is I obviously cannot use it unless I am willing to pay them. However, I have seen this video all over the place, and I know for a fact that these channels did not get permission from Jukin. Also, YouTube has contentid which puts your video through a system that allows publishers to put claims on your work for using certain works in your videos. It also does not allow you to monetize. I would be fine with not being able to monetize and all of that, I just want to use the video. However I do not want to get a copyright strike when I post it or in the future. Am I legally allowed to post this video and just let the ContentId catch it, which would allow Jukin to monetize on my behalf, or am I violating copyright rules? Thank you"	No
644	Does anyone have a good recommendation for a lawyer that represents tenants or a plan of action to take?  I have lived in a brand new apartment since December 2016, and have had several problems with my apartment. I have been extremely patient over the last 7 months, trying to work things out with the property management. I have spoken to the property manager, district manager, and the vice president. The most pressing issue is that during the summer spring, there have 3 storms that have come through, that have resulted in an inordinate amount of water coming into my bedroom through the window. Each time it has gotten my bed, floors, and walls wet and each occurrence have contacted the necessary people to report the problem with videos and pictures. They said they fixed it after the first one, however I believe they mistakenly worked on the wrong apartment. In addition they entered my apartment without giving notice to me. I believe it is now time to pursue different avenues to get my expected resolution. I can find plenty of lawyers that represent properties, but am having a hard time finding a lawyer to represent me. Need recommendations or advice. Thanks in advance!	No
645	Hi, I'm hoping this is a quick question. My roommates and I are trying to break our lease in Portland, OR and are having some confusion about the lease break fee. According to Oregon law, it says that the lease break fee is capped at 1.5x monthly rent, but our lease had 2x monthly rent handwritten in. Does Oregon law supercede this handwritten addition, or are we obligated to pay 2 months since we signed the document?   Thank you!	No
646	I am 22 years old and mom and I rent a house together with my brother. Both her and I are on the lease. She is angry that I am not attending church and is pulling out all of my belongings to the bedroom and putting it in the garage. She is saying I have to live in the garage from now on and am no longer welcome to live in the house. What she is doing is illegal right?	No
647	My co-tenant wants off the renewal lease of a rent stabilized lease in NYC and we submitted a notarized letter from him and I stating such.

648	So my sisters husband that tried killing him self confessed in a phone call to his friend that the reason he tried killing himself is because he molested my nephew at age 5 (he's now 15) but my nephew does not remember and does not want to make a statement ... but also in this phone call he he confessed to it being 4 children all together and this was the unmonitored phone call they give u before u r admitted ... I'm wondering how the investigation process for that works and if someone could give me legal advice for direction on getting him prosecuted	No
649	"So my brother and I have been living together.  We are both adults (I'm 27 he's 34).  Last week we got into a fist fight.  He managed to get on top of me and attempted to gouge out my eyes before I forced him off by getting my pocket knife out and slashing at him.  That night after I got home from work I tried to talk to him and he said ""the next time you hit me I will assume you intend to kill me and I will take my knife, and I will gut your fat sorry ass.  I will carve your fucking face off before I gouge your eyes out.""  Now normally that would be enough for an arrest but I hit him about 20 times and gave him a mild concussion.  I want to make sure I can press full charges and have his 2 kids put into foster care with out legal repercussions my self"	No
650	I'm in desperate need of some help.  I am a 19 year old male who lives in Australia and I'm in a really bad situation and I don't know what to do.  2 weeks ago my girlfriend came over to my place to hang out for the night. Everything started off ok and I became pretty drunk after a few hours and I remember she helped me into the bedroom. Then all I really remember is waking up to find her on top of me with my arms tied to the headboard. I shoved her off and asked her what the fuck she was doing. That's when she told me if I tell anyone she will report me for raping her.  I don't know what to do, I feel disgusting I feel ashamed I have become so severely depressed I don't want to live anymore.  I want to report, I badly want to report her. But I know she will say I did it.  What do I do?	No

652	I was moving into a new apartment building and received an email from management that due to delays in building, I will not be able to move in September 1st as per my lease. Obviously this is frustrating considering not only does one expect a unit when you sign a lease, but they also only gave 1 month's notice when I signed the lease about 6 months ago.  They offered two remedies:  1) Break the lease free of consequence and not live there  2) Move in January 1st and receive $1,500  Luckily, I can stay with my parents who live nearby if I have to so I'm not homeless. The situation seems ridiculous.   Am I owed more than this by the management company? $1,500 is just slightly more than one month's rent and this is a massive inconvenience. Per the lease, if I had been living there and moved out prior to the terms of the lease, I would have owed two months rent, but they're not even offering that. The lease obviously says nothing about them not holding it up, but I'm assuming there's some kind of renter's rights.	No
653	"I own and rent out a 7th floor condo in a 10 story building.  I was an idiot and didn't carry condo insurance.  There was allegedly a leak in the joint between the common water supply for all the units above and below me, and the pipe that supplies my 2 story unit. My unit had minor damage,  but the two story unit below was devastated, mold etc.    When it happened, I was called and had to give a credit card to a plumber HOA called to fix the leak AND to a drying company to dry it out.  The  the dry-out company attempts to charge me for my unit and the unit below.  I investigate a bit,  determine the leak was common,  and refuse to pay for the dry-out in the unit below.  They eventually re-invoice me for just my units dry out.  The owner of the unit below sues me for repairs.  I respond via email the leak was in a common pipe,  not my responsibility.  Owner of unit below then re-files small claims suing me and the HOA.  We go to Small claims,  the HOA wants to arbitrate with the owner. I proclaim ""I'm not paying anybody anything,  do whatever you want.""   We all cram into arbitration torture chamber,  I say very little.  Arbitrator asks to speak to the plaintiff alone.  Then the HOA alone,  then we all go back in.   The HOA offers to re-imburse me for the plumbing repair,  but not the dry-out.  The HOA board member present said ""send me the invoice and I'll re-imburse""  So I get the invoice,  and lo and behold,  it says they repaired a 1"" pipe,  the common pipe.  When the HOA shared their evidence prior to arbitration at Small Claims,  they presented a picture of the 1"" common pipe,  the 3/4"" tee and the 3/4"" line into my unit.  It was a pinhole leak,  you couldn't tell,  they just draw a red arrow pointing to the 3/4"" pipe and said ""see,  It's not common"".    My tenant at the time took a picture on her cellphone,  she said ""I put it right up to where the leak was"",  that photo shows the 1"" pipe.  The access hole the cut into the back of my shower was directly centered over the 1"" common supply pipe.  The red arrow drawn in the HOA's 'evidence' and the access hole they cut don't line up at all.  Also,  the Invoice for my unit from the plumber is made out to a name I do not know or recognize in any way.  I have reason to believe the building has had a long running problem with pin hole leaks in the 1"" common pipe, and have routinely claimed the leaks were NOT in the common line,  and made the unit owner's insurance pay.  They have been doing this for years,  and got tripped up when I didn't have insurance.  WTF do I do now?"	No
654	First time posting on anything, I apologize if i am doing this wrong.  On July 9th at 9 PM the ceiling of my bathroom in my apartment collapsed after significant water damage from a leaking roof. I was aware of a drip in the bathroom on Friday July 7th and noticed the ceiling drywall was sagging downward a little and notified my building manager of the issue and they told me they would take a look on the following Tuesday. when Sunday the 9th came we had some rain and i saw the paint was splitting apart from the weight of the drywall and insulation coming through and immediately notified the building manager again and she told me she would be there on Monday instead. Unfortunately it did not make it till then and fell through. After it was all done the solution I was given was to move into the apartment downstairs and sign a new lease agreement after they go through the apartment and decide what needs to be taken out of my security deposit minus any bathroom damage and then i would pay the new security deposit as well as an increase in rent. I did not like that solution so i spoke with an attorney and was told that they have to provide me with temporary placement while they fix the bathroom. I relayed that information to my building manager and they did agree to it. It has now been a full week since the ceiling fell through and we have had three storms come through and they did not bother to cover the hole or even fix the roof and water has poured through the hole each time. As of right now the building owners do not fell that i am owed any of my rent back for the month of July and I want to know what are my rights and what can i reasonably expect to get back for the hassle of having to move my stuff to another apartment. I also took pictures of the ceiling before and after it fell through and a video of the water pouring through to the bathroom.  I apologize again if this is an incorrect format and if I left any important information out	No
655	"for legal reference, I live in Alaska  TL;DR my roomate is shit and I have shut off most of the breakers at the panel because he won't help pay the electric bill, which he has more than doubled in the time he's lived here.  can he get me arrested for that?  I have one of the worst roommates in the world (I'm working on getting rid of him)... and I'm getting really sick of him... I could write a book on the reasons why... but it really boils down to he is considered disabled, he flashes that victim card every chance he can, and uses it as a crutch.    Anyway, to the point.  he has lived with me for almost 7 years now I think... he is (currently) married and his wife lived here too, but she went to her home country because her mother was sick, and now she doesn't want to come back here and put up with him.  she plans to divorce him.  she also went back just to visit last year before her mother got sick, so she has been gone more often than here.  whenever she is gone, he stops cleaning up after himself at all... so, while she is around, he is not as bad, but he is abusive and that's why she isn't coming back.  she has been gone most of the last year, and so things have been getting bad.  to the point I have stopped using the kitchen entirely because it's too disgusting to use, and I bought a microwave, minifridge and induction burner to use in my room so I can occasionally cook stuff.  the burner tends to blow the breaker though so I don't use it too often.  but I digress again...  so... in all the time they have lived with me they have never helped with the electric bill.  She didn't really do much that used electricity, and initially he didn't either... so no big deal.  roughly a year ago though, my bill jumped from $60-$80ish to $200ish regularly.  last month was slightly under $250.  this was mainly due to him starting to grow his own weed (it's legal here and he mostly stayed within the allowed legal limits).  I do not smoke it or have any interest in it myself so this was not something I was part of.  so I asked him to contribute to the power bill and he said he can't afford it.  I've mentioned it to him occasionally since then and always get the same response.  when his wife went back for her visit last year, she gave him $3000 for his bills... he didn't pay a single bill... instead, he bought her something worth a few hundred dollars, and then bought a $2000 sex doll... he dresses it like Nelliel from Bleach... complete with hollow mask and a sword.  so... his wife for some reason didn't walk out the door when she saw that... but she mentioned to me that he wasted a bunch of money she gave him, and she wouldn't tell me what he bought, but told me to look in the room some time when he isn't around.    so... that's been grating on my nerves a long time, and that's just one of the worst examples, but hardly the only example.  we built our own 3rd bedroom in our living room so that each of us has our own space and the wife made that room hers.  last week I noticed the light was on and I looked inside to find out why, and I notice his computer sitting on the floor... just the main case.  I knew he had been using a computer earlier that day because I heard him typing in his room... he wasn't there so I went and took a look, and as I suspected... brand new alienware computer!  Also, he has a portable radiator style electric heater in there that was running full blast and making the room 90 degrees.  and this just a week or 2 after I paid the highest electric bill I've ever had.    so he and I had it out earlier and I shut off most of the breakers and told him not to touch the breaker panel because it's my electricity and I'm done letting him freeload. as usual he made lots of threats, like ""better make sure your bedroom door is locked tonight"" and then he threatened to call the police on me (which is really ironic seeing as how he has a really low opinion of any authority figure, especially police).  so... as far as the lease agreement, it's month to month, and technically I am the renter and subletting according to the landlord.  the landlord has actually never made me sign a lease agreement though... different issues entirely but I could write a post just as long about him.  he did once have me sign a fake agreement that said I was paying more rent than I was at the time, because he was getting the building appraised and wanted to increase the value.  I am 99% sure, knowing him as I do, that he has long since lost that fake one.  however at one point, in order to help my roomates, he signed a fake agreement with them so that they could use it as proof of residence.  he probably wouldn't even be able to find that one either if pressed though.  the utility bill is in my name only.    so... could I actually get in trouble for this?    the heat is not electric (and it's warm enough this time of year, we don't need it anyway), and I've made sure the fridge still has power, but because I know how he is, I will probably have to turn off the main breaker to the apartment when I leave to work tomorrow or else he will just flip them on until I get home."

656	"Quick backstory: I caught the ex wife cheating and asked for a divorce as a result. She gave a lot of lip service and crocodile tears before she just threw her arms up and went with it. In the agreement towards the marital home, she said that she would keep it. Our divorce decree states the following: ""8. Property Settlement: a. Real Property: Wife shall retain the marital home, located at REDACTED in REDACTED, and shall be responsible for all costs associated with the property, including the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities. Wife shall hold Husband harmless and indemnify him in regard to such liabilities. Husband shall quit-claim the property to the Wife within 14 days of judgment in this matter.""  Handed it over, she said that she would live in the house without issue. States also that my name must come off the house as of Jan 2019. So the mortgage was behind when I left, but I forked over my tax return (about 8k) to cover it, and was told about a week ago that she has no plans to make any future payments. This year she went to Disney World with her new husband, and just spent it there... however she has made every payment up to now, and I want to save my credit, as I just got into the Excellent range and was looking to buy a home once this one sells. For about 6 months, I was told that the house was going to sell. Unbeknownst to me, ex-wife took out a lean, with my name, on the house to bring the payments down. So when she went to sell, the bottom dropped out of the deal when they found the lean. I don't know where the 28k extra came from, but the decision to do this occurred once I signed the quit-claim. Last week, she tells me matter of fact-ly that ""I have no plans to make any more payments,"" since she got knocked up the week she met her current husband, and decided to take extra time off this summer when she could have worked. She DECIDED not to work. Yes. she had another baby, but she told me that ""she only got paid for 4 weeks off."" She also just moved into a 350k house with this guy and put a giant divide between me and the kids. A year ago today she didn't even know this guy.   Any case, I'm tired of the surprises. Surprise! I've been having an affair for 15 months. Surprise! I met some guy last Tuesday and me and the kids are moving in! Surprise! I'm also pregnant! The house I told you I was refinancing to get your name off, didn't get your name off! Surprise! NOW YOUR CREDIT IS GOING TO HIT THE TOILET!  No more surprises. I rented an apartment down the street so I could be with my children anytime, at the drop of a hat, and this woman decided that her tingles were once again, way more important than the relationship her children have to their father. I'm lucky that I have a 50/50 custody agreement, but I don't know what to do.   I spoke with my lawyer, who said that she could not represent me, but that my ex would be in contempt of court. I'm sick of this woman having jurisdiction to screw with my life over and over again. What does contempt of court mean? I asked but it was an inopportune time. This person can physically work, just refuses to because ""she just had a brand new baby"" with her husband and spent all of her money irresponsibly. She is still driving around in a car with my name on it that I help pay for... why can she just tank whatever deal she wants but she can tank her obligations to the martial home? I thought I was being really generous with her to keep her name on it. I had no idea that she was going to get knocked up and walk away from it. Her response to my saying that I will petition the court was ""what is that even going to do for you?"" I also found out that she stole money out of my son's college fund. It was only 1k, but this stuff is getting really old.   Any help that you can muster would be appreciated  Some guy in Connecticut"	No
657	I'm trying to enroll my child in kindergarten. I attended pre-reg in April and provided my lease and copy of utilities. All utilities are in my name. On lease my name is listed under occupants, but my step mother is the primary lease holder. (She signed for me 2 years ago when I first got back to the US because of the employment gap.)    Received letter stating that I am required to appear with the primary lease holder in person on a specific date/hours next week for her to sign an affidavit saying I live there. Apparently this is a new county wide requirement put in place specifically to [irrelevant opinion.] She cannot be here for it. She can't leave work and she lives out of state. They said she can't have it signed and notarized not in person. (She has never lived in the apartment and signed online. Basically my guarantor or whatever.)  I called the school board and they said a wordier version of too bad and that she has to come. Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated. I'm assuming I have to miss work and show up alone, but do I have any leg to stand on to get her enrolled?  Don't they have to enroll even homeless kids?	No
658	Basically this situation is really fucked up and my GF is losing her sanity from her psychotic neurotic mother.   &amp;nbsp;  I was told that I should open a case for the mother to request that she should be put in a home under the states care.    We are in Washington County, Oregon.   &amp;nbsp;   The mods asked me to remove the link to the google doc I have written up, so I will be posting it at the bottom of this post.   A user to the original post wrote  &gt;  *If you are drafting and filing something on behalf of another you are engaging in the unauthorized practice of law*  But I was told that in a circumstance like this, when the person is unfit to make the decision to be put in care, you open up a court case and let the state take over and make the decision to put the person under the states care. This person is unaware of her own mental state and the situation, is unable to comprehend what is happening.   Furthermore, I don't have any idea how to write a legal document, so there is no way this post in its current form is a legal document. It's just a document.   Since I didn't make it explicitly clear, there is no personal information here. at all. all names are fake.   &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, I guess my specific question is what steps to take to open up this case, and what kind of actual legal document I should send over to the court to get this going.  Civil court I think.   Really I'd just like advice. Okay here's the post:   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;   REQUEST FOR CASE TO BE OPENED FOR Bonnie Smith  CONTEXT:   &amp;nbsp;  Jenny Smith (Female, 32) lives with her 4 children, mother Bonnie Smith(Female, 64) and Joe Lee(Male, 23, author of document).   &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie is the current caregiver of Jenny’s son James Smith(5), who has a rare debilitating disability [redacted too specific]. Jenny took care of James when Bonnie was not working.   &amp;nbsp;  The situation a few years ago was that Bonnie had her own apartment, Jenny had her own, and she came to the home only for her shifts, though she continually refused to leave the house.    When Jenny moved to another house last year, Bonnie stayed at the new house longer and longer until she became considered a resident. Bonnie now takes care of James at all times. Bonnie also pays around half of the household bills.   &amp;nbsp;  A DHS case was opened last year, where Jenny expressed that for several reasons she could no longer take care of James, among the main reasons being her mental health and that she could not live with Bonnie anymore.   Different options were discussed, the main consensus was that Bonnie would move out of the house and continue taking care of James.   &amp;nbsp;  We no longer believe that Bonnie is mentally sound enough, nor physically healthy enough to take care of herself and James.  We also do not believe she is capable of holding a job.  We believe she may benefit best under the care of the state.   I (Joe) am soon going to attempt to take over the expenses of the house and Jenny is considering options for James including putting him in a home.   &amp;nbsp;  We were already planning to open this case, the timing of when has sped up to now as  Bonnie is currently threatening me (Joe) with a restraining order which would trap Jenny with her longer and affect my career, Bonnie is acting increasingly mentally unsound,  and Jenny is having a mental health crisis from prolonged exposure to this situation.   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  REASONING:   Jenny says she feels she has no control over the house.    Jenny says she feels that she cannot take care of the house while Bonnie is living here.    Jenny says she feels trapped in the house and unable to leave.    Jenny often feels she has to lock herself in her bedroom to avoid Bonnie.    Jenny says her mental health is suffering from Bonnie and adds (paraphrased);    ‘Bonnie has driven her past the limits of her sanity.’   she ‘cannot handle this anymore.’   she ‘is unable to begin healing until Bonnie is gone.’    Jenny says she feels she cannot parent her children.    We both worry the children have been damaged psychologically by Bonnie.   &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie does not respect Jenny’s authority in any way.    Bonnie refuses to leave the house. She makes it difficult for Jenny to leave the house.   Bonnie follows Jenny around the house and will not leave her alone when asked.  &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie acts “neurotic”(as an adjective) and believes that what she has to say must be said to Jenny, believing that there is an urgent matter to the point that she will stand outside of a locked door if Jenny is on the other side for long periods of time,   growing increasingly worried and paranoid as time passes,  more convinced of the urgency of her messages, raising her voice, beginning to whine cries, and changing the inflections of it ( it can sound like 3 people are talking).    If Bonnie is left feeling like this, she will begin pacing around the house mumbling to herself and repeating phrases in a scared tone, then grow angry and yell at anyone nearby including the children, in between randomly chuckling and shaking her head.    Bonnie will not sleep or rest during these times, and gets worse the longer she doesn’t sleep.    Eventually she will begin threaten Jenny (normally that she will turn off Comcast) if she does not do what she wants.   Bonnie is not aware she is acts like this, and grows increasingly defensive if accused, shaking her head and laughing while saying “no, no, no” followed by threats.    Bonnie will refuse to leave the house when she decides she needs to leave for the same reasons.   &amp;nbsp;  The only way Bonnie will leave Jenny alone is if Jenny screams at and name calls her at the top of her lungs, and Bonnie will then calm down afterwards possibly for the rest of the day.   &amp;nbsp;   If Bonnie cannot talk to Jenny, she will tell her paranoid thoughts and worries to the children.  During any fight with anyone, Bonnie will yell in front of the children.  One of Jenny’s children now screams and cries during these fights.   &amp;nbsp;  If Jenny attempts to punish her children,  Bonnie says the children have done nothing wrong, begs “Please stop Jenny, please stop”, then tells the children that everything is okay and that something is wrong with their mother, then rewards them.   &amp;nbsp;   The children have learned that they can manipulate Bonnie, screaming at her and name calling her until they get what they want because she will whine and beg them to stop until she does what they say.     If for example, Jenny tells Bonnie her daughter cannot play video games because she’s grounded, Bonnie will allow her to play when Jenny leaves the room.    Bonnie believes that she should not listen to what Jenny says because Jenny is being manipulated by me(Joe).   &amp;nbsp;   The children have come to know Bonnie’s behaviors as normalcy.    Any attempt at bringing outside family help into the family results in Bonnie yelling at them,    leaving them often traumatized within five minutes as they are not used to this kind of person.   According to Jenny, Bonnie’s physical health is failing and she is barely able to take care of herself.    Bonnie’s mental state has been the direct cause of her to get laid off at every job she has worked in the last decade before she began staying here.   (for example, she was laid off at the most recent company because she repeatedly insisted that not having the American flag raised high enough was illegal.)  &amp;nbsp;   ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS FROM Jenny:  The only time Bonnie acts decent is when she is attempting to manipulate someone.    Bonnie manipulates the children with gifts, and has taught them that if they are not being treated they are not loved.   Bonnie poops and pees herself everyday and rarely bathes.    Bonnie acts abusive and entitled after cleaning the house.   Bonnie spends frivolously spends her income then claims that Jenny has taken her money.    Bonnie attempts to make Jenny and the kids form sentimental attachments to trash so they will never throw anything away.(Note, she is a packrat)   Bonnie makes every situation miserable, is horrible to everyone even in public, no one ever feels peace.    Bonnie denies and immediately forgets anything and everything she does.   Bonnie does not believe nor is aware that she is not wanted in the house.	No
659	I have my court date coming up for getting pulled over with weed in my car. I was arrested and I got out on a PR bond. I'm not really sure what to expect or what I should plea. Any suggestions?	No
660	So, we noticed the beginnings of some rot on the siding &amp; decking over this past winter and decided to tear it all out and get it repaired.  When the contractor pulled off the ledgerboard for the deck, the siding was completely rotted out and came off with the ledgerboard.  We expected this, but what we did not expect is that there was ZERO sheathing or moisture barrier under the siding.  It's T1-11 plywood siding nailed directly to studs, no tyvek, no OSB sheathing.  The only thing separating the insulation &amp; studs from the outside elements is the cheap 8'x4' plywood or pressboard siding sheets.  Can I sue the previous homeowner (they had it built in 1983, original owners) or sue the inspector?  Does homeowners insurance cover this?	No
661	So 4 of us are trying to rent a house together. 1 applicant was living with his relatives when they were evicted, his siblings were counted as unknown tennants while it was counted that he was  evicted twice, the renter said we just need it signed by a judge that he's not liable. We have no idea what's required to start the process, do we need to set up a court date? Or contact the renter? Or is it just something you can go up before a judge and knock it out? How long would the process take?	No
662	Essentially title.  I previously posted about a minor fender bender. The other vehicle will cost ~$700 to fix, which is below the reporting requirement of my state ($1,000 or more total property damages).  My vehicle had some minor damage, but I don't plan on getting it fixed and have not gotten the damage valued.  Per my state, I'm required to report accidents above a threshold, but if I don't get the damage to my vehicle valued, and I don't care about repairing it, do I need to factor in my vehicle to the total estimated property damage?	No
663	My low income (not section 8) apartment building nickels and dimes us for every single little thing. There are some built in lights in the unit, but none in the bedrooms. You're expected to provide your own lamps for your bedroom. The apartment wants to charge us $10 each for these odd lightbulbs that don't screw in, they plug in. They claim that they cost $10 so we're only paying for the cost of the bulbs. Now I haven't been able to find these bulbs in stores, but I found some online and the most expensive one was $5.51 each. I have never been charged for lightbulbs in an apartment.  Since these lightbulbs are replacing burnt out ones that go in the lighting fixtures built into their property, and the tenants are expected to provide their own light source in certain rooms, I don't think the tenants should be paying double the cost for the bulbs. Thoughts?	No
664	My brother and his ex were never married and have been together for 6 or 7 years. They have 3 children and have lived in Iowa all throughout their relationship. They split up a couple months ago and had been sharing custody without any official agreement. She just left and took the kids, she is currently on her way to Georgia. What are his rights.  Where will a custody battle take place?	No
665	"My aunt and uncle have a building on the edge of their property line that is frequently flooded by runoff from their neighbor's parking lot water runoff that washes down a hill and into the side of the building.   They have asked the neighbors (a labor union) if they could do something so that their building is not frequently affected by the water that pours in from the hill, but were blown off by them.  My aunt and uncle have told me that the union's property is ""grandfathered in,"" so there isn't much that can be done. Is this true, or is there something to be done?"	No
666	Hello. My fiancé (30F) and I (37M) have been together around 4 years. We live together and have a 2 year old daughter. We have joint accounts including checking and credit cards. For the past 3 years I have been supporting her and our daughter exclusively. My fiancé was a full time student and recently graduated from college. I'm currently only making $30k annually. In the 3 years my fiancé had been going to school, I payed nearly 100% of all living expenses including rent, utilities, food, etc. After she graduated she was offered, and took, a teaching position making around $44k a year. She talked me into buying her a new car last month. The car is in both of our names as I am a co-signer. Our current credit card debt is around $25k. All credit card debt is in my name with the exception of one credit card, which she is an authorized user.   So a few days ago things got weird with her. She started going out partying and yesterday tells me she wants to split up because she's not happy in our relationship. This has devastated me because now I'm loosing everything. She's sticking all of our accumulated debt directly onto me while she will be also taking our daughter. She said she hasn't been happy for around 6 months and was contemplating on leaving, meanwhile here I am digging myself deeper and deeper into debt, living almost off of credit cards. She basically used me to get through college and now that she's accepted a job, she's going to leave.   I'm not sure this is relevant, but she's currently on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, of which lately she has been throwing away. She has become unstable.   So here I am. I'm asking for advice on what I can do legally to force her to pay for half our accumulated debt? Do I have any legal recourse? I know I should seek an attorney but I really really cannot afford it right now. Please, please don't berate me on my situation. I know I messed up. I made many mistakes financially. I can blame my fiancé for her continuous false promises of stability financially, but at the end of the day, it's all on me. You have to understand, I'm in a really really low end of my life right now. The bottom just suddenly fell out. In the past 72 hours we went from talking about buying a house next year and living comfortably financially to: my family being torn in half, my daughter being taken away and being on the hook for $25k in debt plus a new car loan on top. I'm asking for advice not asking to be belittle for being a dupe. I already feel like crap and cannot handle anything else. Thank you for what help you can provide.	No
667	The short story is that the repairs our landlord has done to this house, starting from long before we moved in, are dangerously bad - ie; tin foil and duct tape holding together pipes, rags tied around pipes in leu of insulation, etc.   The latest issue is that water started pouring through the furnace and electric outlets because the roof is bad, we asked them to fix it, they came and dabbed some tar in random spots on the roof and left.  They insist that this was appropriate (they didn't even know where the leaks were inside the house and didn't come in to look and see if it was even safe with all the electric and water) and we had to shut off power to the furnace and ceiling because of all of the water and the antique cloth covered wires.    We have a baby due in two months and with all of the water/electricity being maintained in this way, there is no way it's safe for us to keep living here.  So we (while completely paid up to date on rent) told them that we would not be paying any further rent and are moving out as soon as possible, with a maximum of 30 days.  We have done several thousand dollars worth of improvement on the house, and we even told them to keep the security deposit.  We were late on rent one time last winter and the wife came over at 10pm at night with no warning screaming and accusing us of being liars, when we were genuinely just waiting for a check to clear.  They are very angry with us for blowing the whistle and calling it time to go, so with the wife's history of late night drama, I don't really feel safe having them come in the house when we are already this stressed and trying to move.    They are demanding entry, demanding to start showing the house and threatening to bring the police over to let them in.  As far as my legal knowledge goes, they can't possibly do anything of the sort - can they?  At this point this whole thing just seems insane - I just want to move somewhere where I know that my family is safe! We are in Michigan and this whole thing started on Monday.	No
668	Hello,  My wife and I are looking to buy a house to use as a short term rental property in Rochester MN. Is anyone familiar with Minnesota laws as far as injury due to accidents of a guest? From what I understand this doesn't fall under homeowners insurance.  We would be advertising locally, on Airbnb, VRBO, and Homeaway. Does it make sense to start an LLC or does this change the tax status of the property? Sorry if none of this is very focused, I am trying to find a good resource to learn how to do this. If anyone on here happens to know a real estate attorney in Rochester they would recommend, we would appreciate it!   All the best	No
669	This is complicated.  We are trying to buy a house on an Indian reservation.  I am Native, he isn't.  The tribe and BIA won't put him on the land lease.  (white guy) I will not be on the mortgage. My income debt ratio is not viable as I am not working right now- I am a student.  How does community property speak to one spouse being on the land lease and the other being on the mortgage?	No
670	My grandma is 88 years old, and despite having three children, she suddenly only feels comfortable sharing her finances with her eldest. My grandparents had major dollars in the bank a few years ago, the last time my mom was allowed to see their accounts. My aunt has always been under financial pressure, and we believe that my aunt is taking advantage of their fortune to pay off their huge debts and allow her son to pay down his gigantic mortgage. My aunt, who was given power of attorney, has her own debit card under my grandmas account and sold our cottage without notice or allowing us to see any documents. Despite the will showing that the cottage should be split evenly between the three children, we only received a fourth, and no explanation. When we ask were the other fourth went, my aunt told us that it was going into my grandmas bank account (the one she has full access to), even though my grandma used to have more than enough money to cover living expenses for the rest of her life a few years back.  Before my grandpa passed away a few years ago, he warned us that there was money missing from his bank account, and told us to sue my aunt. He informed us that someone was making purchases with his money. After he told us this, my aunt and her family shut down all communication with us. Then my grandparents stopped talking to my family, and grandma has barely contacted me or my family for years (mental illness is a huge possibility). Every time we go over, my aunt insists on being there, not giving us a second alone with her. The scariest part of this is that is could have been resolved easily, had my aunt brought us to the bank and showed us that she hadn't taken unfairly from my grandparents account. My uncle has tried to sue them in the past and has not yet been successful. When I see them at family events they can barely look us in the face. It is very clear that they had been getting away with taking large sums of cash from my grandparents bank account without them or us knowing. Do we have a case of elder abuse or abuse of power of attorney?	No
671	My sister is pregnant and she wants to get an abortion. In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.  So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.  Ideally they wouldn't ever know about it but let's assume they figure it out somehow, can I (or her) be in any legal trouble here?	No
672	Obligatory this post is not about me but about my fiance (22 M). It is also necessary for me to say that him and I live in WA but his daughter lives in FL so this is a Florida state matter.  So my fiance got a girl pregnant when he was living in Florida. The child is now three years old (possibly 4 but I am pretty sure she's only 3). Anyway, his daughter was born while he was in basic training and he is now active duty military stationed here in WA which is where I met him and it is where he has been since. The mother of his child requested that he have a paternity test and he agreed. This was a little over a year ago. Since he has taken the test (it was positive), he has had to pay an ordered amount in child support since then which is automatically deducted from his pay and was slammed with owing around $12,000 in back child support which he now makes extra payments every month on that as well to keep him from going to jail. Additionally, the mother of his daughter refuses to let him see her or even have any contact with her. He always pays his support since he has had to and has no criminal history of any kind or any reason for him not to see her. I assume since he is required to pay child support, he has joint custody of the child even though he does not live there. He is also not named on her birth certificate.  So my question for anyone who has been in this situation before or anyone who has knowledge of FL laws regarding this, what rights does my fiance have to see his daughter and additionally, is it right that he now owes so much money in back child support from before he took the paternity test and how can we resolve this situation for him?  Also, there is talk from him about wanting to surrender his rights over. His logic is that if he isn't allowed to see her, why bother paying child support for her. So fine people of Reddit, can you give me any advice?	No
673	Hey all,  I live with two roommates in a well-populated city in Tennessee, USA. We pay our rent in separate checks in the same envelope ahead of schedule every month, including this month (July). A few hours ago I received a strongly worded notice that if I did not pay my third of the rent, plus a hefty late fee, within three days, we would all be evicted. However the check has been cashed (I have an image of the check and a receipt from my bank) and the money is gone from my account. Since these three checks were submitted together in an envelope, I'm wondering what my options are. Should I involve the police if the money was stolen from my account? I would prefer not to pay a second time, of course.  Any help is appreciated.	No
674	"Short version: My mother is mentally sick (depression) and is being coerced to regularly give someone large sums of money. I don't have enough details to go to the police. I don't think she's capable of caring for herself either. How can I ensure the safety of her self and finances?   Long version: This is long and I don't know where else to turn but the internet. My mother has been ill for a long time with a history of depression and bipolar II. We have a sizable family. A few years ago my father passed away; due to timing in everyone's lives, my brothers and sisters moved out (including me), to school or work or whatever. This lead to textbook empty nest syndrome which she never really recovered.  She eventually moved to NYC into an apartment that cost an obscene amount of money per month. Additionally, she leads a very expensive lifestyle she can't afford to sustain. She apparently has/had a lot of assets but I never did find out specifics of how much or where they came from but I don't care about that. Today I found out she has been giving money to an unknown stranger (she refused to tell me who, or why). I pressed hard but all I managed to get from her was ""he might hurt me"" if she refused. She repeatedly tells me she feels threatened and in danger but will not elaborate.  I am 8 hours away by car, 4 by plane in Bumfuck, Nowhere. I am only just making ends meet. My siblings live closer but only one of them is on speaking terms with her (her illness makes her unpleasant to interact with). Her friends have left her (likely the other way around), so she is alone. She is in a vulnerable position and it seems like no one is willing to help. And I can't help personally because of how far away I am. She's old and vulnerable.  Nearly all of these details are vague and nebulous. She won't tell me anything about where her money came from, or who this mystery person is or why she's giving him money or why she feels unsafe.   * How can I protect my mother when I don't even know what's threatening her? * How can I ensure she gets the medication and prescriptions she needs? * Can I legally force her into someone's care? Are there programs to pay for this? * I've no interest in her finances but how can I protect her assets so she can live comfortably?  * To be honest I'm not even sure I can convince her to budget even if all of the above was taken care of. * I don't think a nursing home is an option. Elderly abuse is a huge problem, and I'm not certain she'd let herself live in a nursing home.  I don't know what to do. Sorry for the brain vomit but all of this came up suddenly. I greatly appreciate any advice of any sort."	No
675	Hi all,  This information is all from my mom's memory and she told me as many details as she could recollect.   My mom is currently 56 years old (California current residence). She came from Guatemala in 1989 with my dad and oldest brother. They were caught by immigration. After paying a $500 fine per person they were let go with court dates etc. My mom actually was pregnant with me at the time. I was born and a couple of months later she went back to Guatemala to see her family. My dad (now deceased) attended all court dates but she did not because she was not in the country.   When she returned around '92-'95 she applied for a work permit and was granted one that lasted from 8-10 years. Around the time the permit was up she received a letter that informed her that she needed to apply for residency. She went to see a lawyer and due to fear told him she was in the country when she was required to appear in court but was unsure of what to do so she did not attend. (In reality she was in Guatemala and that's why she wasn't present but she has been too afraid to admit this fearing the consequences.)   She applied for residency in the mid-2000s and went through the process almost getting to end until she was informed that due to the 1989 deportation order it would not be granted. She was too scared to do anything else and that's where the situation is now.  My mom has been in the country now since returning from Guatemala for 25 consecutive years. I am 27 and a citizen that lived abroad for about a year after she had me. Currently she is married to an immigrant from Mexico. She has three children born in the United States including me aged 27, 25, and 17. She is still scared every day of being deported and asked me to please seek out any resources/advice I can regarding her particular situation to try and find options for her to become a legal resident.  I appreciate anyone and everyone's advice. Thank you so much.	No
676	"Hello /r/legaladvice,  In Georgia, USA. This is might be long, so I sincerely apologize in advance. My former landlord has not returned our security deposit after nearly three months now. Since my roommate and I moved out in the beginning of May, he has essentially ghosted us, seemingly deliberately not responding to our texts and emails, and dodging our phone calls. He told my roommate back in early June that he sent the check to my forwarding address. There was no evidence of this check. After waiting a full month (and then some because it was almost July) to pass, I finally sent him a formal demand letter by certified mail. He responded two weeks later with only a vague text message, saying he got a return check from me. There was no mention of the letter I sent him, but he said he had deductibles after his contractor took a look and he will be sending the list and remaining balance soon. I responded promptly, thanking and asking him to send it as soon as possible. Then we heard nothing from him again.   Ten days ago, I sent him *another* demand letter. He has finally *sort of* communicated to us two days ago, claiming via text message a list of numerous damages to his property. It was a lot of ambiguous stuff like, ""The fridge was messed up."" We have no idea what that entails. Still have not provided any monetary figures and when/if he was returning our deposit. We sent him an email back right away asking for clarification and again for him to return our deposit and he has gone completely silent again.   My question is: Can he even claim he is withholding money for damages after the 30 days allowed by Georgia law? Or does his limited communication still count as him expressing that he was going to withhold the deposit. Have we ruin hurt our own case by trying to communicate with him and work things out?   Some other things: *1. We have rented the place for two years—initially 1-year, then renewed for another year. Thinking now, this was a mistake because there were so many things wrong with the house and, of course, this whole situation now. But it was a good location and the rent was cheap. We thought we had spent so much time, effort, and money making the place livable, and were used to it.  *2. We gave him notice when we moved and we did not owe rent. We kept the place clean and well-maintained. He tried to convince us in April that our lease ended days earlier than it did and when we pointed what was clearly written on our lease, he told us it did not matter and it was common knowledge to everyone that the last day of the previous month was always the last day or a new month's rent had to be paid. And then he tried to say the lease date was a mistake he made that he never changed because he thought we would understand. And when we pushed back, he stopped responding and acted like it never happened the next time he talked to us. We have the impression that he is partially being vindictive now because he could not squeeze more money out of us. *3. Pretty much everything on the list of damages he finally sent basically fell into one of two categories: Either A) already existed when we moved in because it was a very old house or B) were things we had told him about but he did not want to repair or repaired poorly (ie. cheap materials or only replacing one small part when really the whole thing needed to be straight up replaced). He was even in denial about a gas leak and did not fix the broken front door for over a week. We took photographs of the condition of the house when we moved in and also took a video of us going through all the rooms of the house when we moved out. We also have text message correspondence with him where we told him about various house problems and asked him to come take a look at them (although there was a lot of verbal in-person assurances he made that we did not get down in writing, some of those things he listed a damages after he said they were fine).  *4. And this may or may not be a separate issue, but I do not know if there is any that can legally done about it now... We were responsible for the utilities for the property according to the lease, but what he failed to clarify until after we had already moved in was that he had converted the small 1(?)-car garage into a separate unit (that honestly did not seem up to code) and was renting it out. There was no mention of this unit in the lease. It had no access to the heating/cooling controls and there was not a separate meter for utilities. They were constantly knocking on our door to turn up or turn down the heat/air-conditioning depending on the season because they only had a vent coming from the main house. And we were stuck with the bill when the other tenants ran up the water or electric bill.   I an sorry if my post is a mess and if I said a lot of necessary things. There is honestly just so much, and I have no idea where to begin. I have also contacted my university's student legal services with my inquiry, but everything is a slow process in the summer semester, and I will be graduating shortly, so might not be eligible for legal advice there much longer. Thank you for reading."	No
677	So basically my gf's mother has always had substance abuse issues, until recently they were manageable. She lost her husband and has gone back to them harder than ever. Xanax being her drug of choice her young son has found her asleep in a bowl of food and in the garage with a cigarette. She just got out of rehab this last week and it didn't seem to help. She is going to endanger herself, the family's house/possessions and we don't know what to do. My gf of course consented to posting this. We are thinking of getting the license plate and name of the dealer that no one knows and is driving her around to find more drugs and calling the cops. Can they help? Any options at all here?  Thank you tons in advance and please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit.	No
678	A few years ago after my mother's divorce she found a boyfriend, things started out well enough but once he moved in it went over the edge. He physically abused myself, and emotionally and mentally everyone else in the household (Mother, Sister and I). They have since separated and gone their different ways. After the breakup however new details came to light as to his past. Apparently he had innapropiate contact with his children and with other children. This came to us as he had left an Ipod/IPhone when he moved out where he recorded conversations with a counselor at his children's school and a psychologist as he went through his divorce. He currently works as girls soccer coach at a middle school in Durham NC. Both my mother and I fear what he can do as he is a master manipulator. I want to bring this to light for his employer, but I want to get my ducks in a row, by finding the names of his children or ex-wife in Georgia. How would I go about finding this information? I know divorce records are publicly available but as I live across the country in Washington State I don't know if I'll be able to access them. Any advice is appreciated and I apologize for the text wall and any mistakes I may have made wether it be formatting or posting guidelines.	No
679	So my situation is this, my family ( me my wife my 5yr old 3yr old and 10 month old) were renting a house with no signed lease whatsoever. Numerous issues came up with home, downed rain gutters, broken retraining wall off porch and mainly squirrels living in ceiling all of which landlord did not fix. Ssooo I decided to pack up and leave without giving him any notice and now today he showed up at my job demanding to talk to me. Is there any legal recourse he can take???And if he continues to come to my work is that grounds for harassment??	No
680	"Hi /r/legaladvice,  I'll try to keep this as brief as I can, but I'm sorry, I know it will be long. I live with my boyfriend in the top floor of an eight-unit rent-stabilized apartment building in Brooklyn. Since we moved in, we've been having issues with our downstairs neighbors. The weekend after we moved in, one of them knocked on our door and asked if we were doing construction because he heard banging coming from our unit. We told him no and left on a cordial, if weird, note. He approached us a few times over the following month or so about the ""banging,"" and we told him we'd buy additional carpeting (since we didn't move in with much, and there is an 80% carpeting clause in our lease), but he seemed very frustrated when we explained that we weren't doing anything other than walking around the apartment and making your garden variety apartment living noise. He hasn't approached us since and graduated soon after the last time we spoke to banging on the ceiling with a broomstick whenever he deemed us too loud, which started at about once a week and has since gone down to once a month at the absolute maximum, always at seemingly random times.  Management's involvement started with a phone call sometime in October asking us to buy additional carpeting, which we did. Ceiling banging continued, and in January our neighbors called 311 about the noise and the police came to our apartment. I was folding my laundry in silence at the time, it was 12PM, and my boyfriend was on his phone on the couch... no banging, no music playing, no nothing. We don't own a stereo or even a TV. The cops told me the downstairs neighbors are ""very dramatic"" and that they've been to the building before for similar complaints, and that I shouldn't worry about it.  My boyfriend called management immediately after and asked them to address the issue, and their response was to come and inspect our rugs, which they did in mid-February. In March we received a letter from them stating that they could hear someone walking around ""heavily"" in our apartment from downstairs and that we needed to purchase additional carpeting and padding, which we did. (The vast majority of the hardwood floor, aside from what's covered by furniture, is now carpeted, by the way—I'm confident it is at least 80%.) I spoke briefly with the building manager to confirm that we'd purchased the rugs they'd requested and to address the most recent complaint alleging loud banging, which had occurred earlier that day. I told her the truth—that I'd spent the morning on the phone on my couch talking with a potential employer and, after that, that I'd watched Youtube videos on our bed while my boyfriend took a shower... nothing louder than that—and that we'd heard what sounded like hammering coming from the downstairs apartment.  We heard virtually nothing from either the neighbors or management and assumed the issue was resolved until mid-June, when we received a letter from our landlord's attorney stating that ""it is believed [the noise emanating from your apartment] rises to the level of nuisance, potentially justifying the termination of your tenancy,"" and:  ""You must ensure that you maintain a reasonable level of sound coming from your apartment. This must include a deliberate effort on your part to prevent excessive noise from your apartment, and the installation of soundproof padding under any and all rugs throughout the apartment. Should management receive any other complaints in regard to you and your invitees, we have been directed to seek the termination of your tenancy.""  We were understandably kind of flabbergasted by this, considering the only noise we make is really normal stuff—walking, opening and closing cabinets, cooking, showering, washing dishes—and, as I said, we have no stereo or TV (or pets, or kids) and have already purchased adequate carpeting. My boyfriend's parents spoke with a lawyer they know who advised that we should purchase soundproof rug pads and let the landlord know for now. We purchased pads (arriving tomorrow) and will confirm with management once we receive them, but I am really nervous about what the future holds considering what has happened thus far.  It's worth noting that there are no formal quiet hours in our lease—only the 80% carpeting clause, which we've complied with, and a vague statement that no tenant should disrupt the quiet enjoyment of another... nothing more official than that. It's also probably worth noting that there is renovation going on in both adjoining buildings and in another building two doors down, the noise from which we can hear (if only faintly) in our own unit. Like I said, our building is rent-stabilized, and we've never actually received a formal written complaint... we've only been notified that complaints have been received by management. I don't really know what the neighbors have been saying, other than that there is ""banging"" coming from our unit. Here are my questions:  * Do we have a legal right to know what these complaints actually say? * Given what's written above, is an eviction proceeding even a realistic possibility? What sort of proof would the landlord need in order to bring us to court? * Aside from buying the rug pads and informing our landlord that we've put them down, what can we do to advocate for ourselves? Is it worth seeing a lawyer and sending them a formal letter documenting that we've made reasonable accommodations and suggesting that perhaps the building—not us—is the problem... maybe asking them to test how noise travels or something? Our policy thus far has been to stay quiet and comply with requests, but it hasn't really seemed to, you know, work. * If the landlord DOES try to evict us, what should we do?  We have the opportunity to renew our lease and would really prefer to stay for a variety of reasons, but I don't want to get myself into a legal pickle if I can avoid it (and only have until August 29th to decide). I appreciate any advice anyone can provide!"	No
681	My ex-wife and I have 50/50 custody of our 14 year old son both legal and physical. Circumstances have changed in her household and we have both agreed to a new living arrangement for him. We want to just submit a notarized modification to the court, so its on record and we are both held accountable for it. What is the easiest form to file (there are sooo many), we both agree on this for our son and have no intention on letting the court decide what is best. We just want it on file. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	No
682	Good morning! I have a few questions about some apartment issues I've been having:  The board of the apartment building that I live in noticed a (bad) smell in my floor's hallway a few weeks ago. I moved in 6 months ago and am the only new tenant on the floor. For this reason, and I assume because I have cats, they contacted my landlord and told her I was causing a smell and needed to take care of it. The smell, for the record, is a musty, mildew-y, mothball smell. I've had cats my whole life. They only smell if they 1.) pee or 2.) the litter box hasn't been scooped; neither is the case.  So, following a thorough cleaning of my apartment, the board once again contacted my landlord and said the smell is still there and she needs to do something. At this point, I had just returned from vacation and noticed the refrigerator wasn't working - I lost a lot of food and there was a definite odor, and while it didn't match the one in the hallway (and the timelines don't line up) I told her maybe that's it, cleaned out and bleached the refrigerator and requested the maintenance man come take a look. After a week, he still hadn't been there and, although cleaned, the fridge still had a rotten food type smell coming from it.   He finally came last week and, while there, contacted my landlord and said there was floor damage from a potential A/C leak (which I hadn't noticed) - my landlord requested to come inspect the apartment herself because there was so much happening. She came this past Sunday, and CONFIRMED that my apartment does not smell anywhere except by the fridge. She then proceeded to blame me for the broken refrigerator (which is over 8 years old), the leaking A/C (??) and a pipe leak from earlier in the year (again, nothing I could've done to cause that)  She is now requiring that, by the end of the day today I: 1. hire a deep cleaning service to remove the smell to appease the board (which, again, isn't my apartment) 2. hire a bi-weekly cleaning service to ensure them smell doesn't return  3. provide vaccination proof for my two cats - who never go outside or interact with other animals.  they were vaccinated early last year and reacted terribly to it and I don't want to put them through that again if it's not legally necessary. and, if she can legally mandate this, what are the required vaccines?  so my question is - what, legally, can she make me do?   any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm extremely stressed out about this entire situation	No
683	An officer came to my home to speak to me after I specifically told him on the phone that I wanted to speak to him the following day instead of the day that he called me. When we spoke he asked me a broad question to which I replied yes. He took that as an admission of guilt and said I was guilty to everything. Now a police report is going to be filed. Everything was in person, I never wrote a statement and there is no real solid evidence against me besides that I'm a suspect. This is about a texting harassment case.  Basically my question is what will be in this police report? Will he say I'm guilty even though I answered a broad question?  Montgomery County-MD	No
684	I had a minor flood from my upstairs bathroom which caused my downstairs roof to collapse causing water damage. We contacted a restoration company to potentially mitigate damage and or prevent further damage. They brought in de humidifiers to remove water. No damage was done to our floor from the leak. This morning we noticed that their equipment was leaking all night on to our floors, after cleaning the water we noticed our flooring had warped from this sitting water. We contacted the gentlemen and advised him that his machine leaked all over our floor and he blamed us. Stating that it is our fault since we have dogs in that area and little children that go thru there and a carpet that we set down near it (he did not advise us that the dogs might present a problem and he did not advise that the hose running a long the length of our home should not be touched what so ever and therefore limited foot traffic should occur in that area) he would like to file a claim against my insurance company to fix the flooring. I have not yet paid him. Should I allow him to file the claim on my insurance. I am unsure if this is my fault or his and if there are legal ramifications, or if I should just let him file a claim. Would just like some guidance.	No
685	I apologise for how long this may get, but I want to give as many details as I possibly can.   My best friend's mother bought him a house last year. He convinced me to pay near 1,000$ to break my lease and move in with him in January. So we paid rent at the house to cover the mortgage to his mother. There was no lease, just verbal agreement to pay the rent and utilities.  So about 5 months into living there (2 months ago), my friend tells me that he wants to sell the house and gives me no say in it. So they began showing the house, all the while never giving me a 24 hour notice for showings. They told me that I could move back to Arkansas with them, but I can't because I'm starting school in TN and out of state tuition is an extra 2000 dollars. So I started to keep my eyes peeled for an apartment.  Last week my friends mother (the landlord) comes into the house and tells me that they got an offer on the house and that I have 2 weeks to get out. She also informed me that she would be in the house every 7 o'clock morning Monday thru Wednesday to fix some things the buyer wanted done. Being that I work really late I just went to stay at my mom's.  I happened to find an apartment, but I had to throw all the money I had on the deposit and I still can't move in until the 6th. The landlord texted me and told me to leave the rent on the counter on the 25th (the day rent is always due) and I told her that I couldn't, that moving is costing me too much. She then proceeded to threaten me with false accusations of terroristic threatening against her son (my friend and I got into a huge argument over the situation but I never said ANYTHING like that nor would I ever). So I told her I would just stay here at my mom's until I can move into my apartment.   I packed as much stuff as I could and moved it all here to my mom's, where she really doesn't have room for me and my things, and left my furniture that I can't get until I have a moving truck. My 2 cats are currently locked up in a small room here at my mom's.  So I come back to get more things to bring and I find out that the lady who is buying the house requested that the locks get changed. So now I can't even get into the house to get my furniture unless I call the landlord to call the realtor to let me in. All my stuff except for my furniture was moved into the garage that's also locked. Luckily I know the garage code.  I just want to know, is what they're doing unlawful? Could they seize my property?Do I have grounds to sue? I probably won't sue, seeing as it's my best friend's mom, but I just feel like I'm being taken advantage of. If you have any advice or questions for me let me know.	No
686	So basically i live on a quarter mile long driveway that i share with my neighbor who we were always friends with and kind to but he is at the very beginning near the road and I am tucked away in the woods at the end of it.  We have beach access and our neighbors have right of way to use our driveway and a path on our property only as a means of traveling to and from the beach. They have come over numerous times without warning to watch the sunset on a section of our property that leads to the beach (rather than the actual beach because they can't make it down the waterfall/stream that leads to it).  We've asked them a few times now to let us know before hand (mainly after an incident where a bunch of strangers and cars unexpectedly showed up for homecoming pictures on our land not the beach) when they are going to come down and we have always been ok with them watching the sunsets on our property leading to the beach as long as they let us know ahead of time. So basically the other day while my mom was at work and my dad was working in our garage they showed up walking down the driveway uninvited and without plans of going to the beach. My dad was outside with our three dogs (Rottweiler, golden retriever, and weimaraner all sweet hearts with no previous signs of aggression even in a house with two toddlers) and my sisters when they decided to walk down with a stranger and there three dogs (a lab, a golden retriever, and an 8 week old Australian shepard puppy they just got a week ago but hasn't met my dogs before).  My neighbors were supposed to be getting married on the section of our property that they always watch the sunset on so they said they were walking down to show the guy they brought with him the work they thought they were going to be doing to our land in preparation for their wedding.  I was not home at the time but i guess while my neighbor was walking ahead with the stranger, his fiancé was standing on our property surrounded by her dogs and now my dogs who ran up to see what was going on. I'm not sure how long the dogs were interacting for but the puppy was new to all three of my full grown dogs and the rottweiler ended up biting her and breaking her leg.  She was taken to the vet and had four puncture wounds as well but they weren't serious.  We were all very surprised to hear of the situation and upset as we are all dog lovers and offered to help in some way but we've never been in this type of situation before and didn't know how payment would work for something like that (we were still going to try to help even if we weren't liable) but my neighbors seemed pretty cool about it and said that wasn't a big concern of there's at the moment. So the dog eventually went in for surgery but never woke up from the anesthesia (we're guessing the dog was given too much for it's young age) and our neighbor told us when it happened and said to not call or text today because his fiancé and step daughter were very angry (at us? the dog? themselves? idk). So the next day my dad was coming home from work and stopped coming down the driveway because my neighbor was out and apologized for the situation he was in and my neighbor went straight to telling my dad that he has a couple thousand dollar pet bill that he's going to send him as well as a receipt for the dog that they spent $2000 on at a pet store.  Now my parents were trying to handle this situation as nicely as possible since we felt terrible and have to continue to share a driveway and think about this relationship longterm but feel like we aren't really fully responsible and don't appreciate how our neighbor is acting like it's completely our/my dog's fault and is going to demand this money from us for the incident without taking any responsibility of his own.  We've tried contacting an attorney just to figure out if it truly is on us but all so far have only been for dog bites on humans. Sorry for the grammar mistakes this is just like the 10th time reciting this so I'm getting kind of tired of it and just wanted some other opinions and feedback on the situation.  After them demanding the money basically my parents don't really want to help them pay the bills at all unless they have to but we believe that my neighbors are mostly in the wrong here and that we definitely shouldn't have to worry about the cost of the dog when the vet is the one that killed it even though my dog caused the need for surgery.  Thank you so much for any feedback this is just causing my family a lot of stress and I'd be happy to elaborate more or clear things up that weren't explained well if questions come up.  TL;DR  Neighbors have always been close friends and are legally allowed to cross a piece of our property to reach a beach that only we have access to but they always stop before getting that far and hangout on our property.  They've unexpectedly dropped down numerous times after us asking for just a heads up beforehand but they thought it would be a good idea to do that the other day with no intentions of going to the beach, a stranger with them, and their three dogs (one of which is a brand new 8 week old puppy that my three big dogs have never met).  Eventually while they were down on my property, uninvited and not there for the reason their supposed to come down, my dog with no history of any aggression bit their puppy breaking his leg.  The dog needed surgery but died due to reasons unrelated to the injury and afterwards my neighbors started acting like it was all completely our fault and that we had to pay the full vet bill as well as the cost of the dog.  Also just an FYI incase it comes up, the beach I'm referring to is public but surrounded by 40 foot cliffs and we have access to the only semi easy way of getting down on our property but my neighbors never go all the way down to the public part they are supposed to (again this wasn't a big deal to us when they would tell us ahead of time)	No
687	"Hindsight is 20/20. I realize now my mistakes: Holding rental property with out deposit or signed lease or any money what so ever.  The wife of the couple 23f and 23 m military put me on the spot several times.    Things I've tried to graciously provide but is turning and in fact turned into a nitpicking negotiating, bulldozing nightmare.  ""Reduce the pet fee since one pet is emotional therapy but will not prove it""  ""Let us paint (before even seeing the house it's recently been professionally painted for 2k)""  ""Let us meet you in the middle of the night, give us directions for an hour, invite all our friends and bang on the door,oh we forgot the money, we didn't bring the signed lease, we couldn't find a printer, we don't want to sign the lease until we pay and didn't want to pay until we found out your a real person not a craigslist killer""  Everything screams (I'm an idiot me the op and they are entitled)  They've been in the house since 1am Saturday, can't get them to answer to meet up for the lease and payment, they promised they would but like everything else they just end up doing what they want.  When I called this evening they finally answered and instead of giving me a time to meet they say ""we don't wanna pay the full month and want you to take off money from the deposit we have a list of discrepancies, and instead of 865 we want to pay 500""  I explained I already did the walk through with them every appliance is new, we did not provide a washer and had warned them that, now that is a bargaining chip for them.  I saw the writing on the wall and said  ""You've not paid any money you've not signed a lease and you've not stopped making demands-it's clear I'm not going to make you happy this isn't working""  He says ""I need a week"" but also cusses me out and threatens me that they haven't signed anything so he doesn't have to do ""jack S----""  I say ""please no hard feelings but this will never work you've not jumped through any of the hoops that tenants are supposed to and I've had to do every single thing what your asking me to do now is too much special treatment""  The house could pass a military inspection it was spotless ontop and behind appliances professionally cleaned.   They are not in the same reality... I know really shouldn't have let them move their stuff in but they were ""please don't make us get a storage unit tonight just for one night"" and he is a marine who just got back the beginning of the month, I didn't know things would get so out of hand but they kept pushing.  I ended the conversation by saying I might be able to give you 48 hour but I need you guys out because I really did hold the house for you and this has gotten out of hand, your not wanting to pay and your taking advantage of me (my stupidity in reality).  What do I do? I need to know my rights, I am getting a property manager but I would like to get them out since they have no intention of really paying and keep stalling.  I have his commands number but I do not know legally if they are squatters or what I have done. We only want them gone with out retaliating in the form of damage."	No
688	I received papers about a property that was foreclosed on. I lived there 12 years ago and will not be returning. Needless to say I cannot go back to reclaim the possessions and they are not of high value to me. Location: US Territory Virgin Islands. Is the term to go in and remove all the contents by court representatives or is there more to the term than this? I cannot afford legal fees.	No
689	A sprinkler broke on the property and is fixed. The tenant receives a water bill much higher than normal and so requests reimbursement from the management company. The owner rejects the reimbursement. What happens next? Who pays for it?	No
690	The original CC&amp;R's were recorded on 6/9/11 and stated that control of the HOA would be transferred to the homeowners when 67% of the lots were sold or after three years.  I purchased my home in May 2014 and my building was the last building the developer attempted to build (the original plans included many more units).  According to the CC&amp;R's, the three years had lapsed and HOA control should have been transferred to the owners in June 2014.  Later in November 2014 an amendment was filed to change the conditions of control to remove the time period entirely and change the 67% of lots sold to 100%.  Again, this amendment was filed months after control should have been transferred since the original three years were over.  Sometime in 2015 or 2016, a large majority of the undeveloped land was sold to another developer but a small lot in the back of the area was retained by the original developer.  Nothing has happened to that lot since 2011 and there are no plans to do anything with that lot.  According to the amended CC&amp;R's, homeowners cannot get control of the HOA until that lot is sold.  Also, this lot is in a terrible location.  It borders a light rail track and is mostly undesirable (would make a nice area for a city park though).   What does the developer gain by sitting on the undeveloped lot and retaining control of the HOA?  Can a developer arbitrarily change major parts of the CC&amp;R's without homeowner approval?  Is there anyway to enforce the original CC&amp;R's since the amendment was filed after a crucial date?  Is there any recourse to homeowners to get control, if the amendment is valid, since the developer is just sitting on a small piece of land?  Thanks for your help!	No
691	I just moved into my house this past weekend and the refridgorator was not working. I informed the landlord and he said I had to wait until Monday for him to come see it. He came to see it and had  maintenance come by to see it. The guy said the fridge had to he replaced. It is now the day after that and I have had to throw away two trash bags entirely full of food that I had just bought. Is it possible yo have him replace the food??? If so what laws can I quote for that. Move in day was the fifth and it is now the 8th. The fridge was not the only thing wrong with the house when I moved in and my two other roommates can confirm this.	No
692	Hello /r/legaladvice ! So this situation is still unfolding but I have a couple questions for you. I am in the process of moving across country from the east coast to Washington state. I was there last month for a few weeks and got a studio apartment and moved in, stayed there for a few weeks before headed home to grab my car and move there for good. Now I have always carried renters insurance though I forgot to get it right when I moved in, more on that later.   Now I have had a bidet on my toilets for years now and can't go back to toilet paper lol. When I moved into the new spot I quickly ordered one on amazon and installed it. amazing as usual. I was there for about a week after that and did not notice any leaks. I flew home to Boston and have bad been here about 10 days when I get a call from my property manager saying that there is a leak in my downstairs neighbors apt and they want to enter my unit the check. I immediately started thinking about what could possibly be leaking, and was worried the only thing it could be is the bidet. Anyway at this point I did not know that or anything, however my property managers call reminded me that I still had forgot to get renters insurance, I immediately purchased it.      Now here I am 2 days after the initial call and my fears are confirmed, though luckily not as bad as some of my mental images of there being a foot of water in my bathroom. So it was my bidet, I don't know what happened as I have never had a problem with leaks but I am told I am responsible for the damage and they will send me a claim.    So I am wondering about the dates of buying my renters insurance. It was activated the 6th, I don't know when I will receive a bill for damages but I imagine it will cause my insurance provider to be suspicious. My question is, since I did not know of the cause of damage or that I was liable when I purchased the policy would this constitute some kinda of fraud?    Sorry for any spelling errors I kinda just spat this all out as I am anxious about it and feel super bad and embarrassed. I will need to bake my downstairs neighbor some cookies or something.	No
693	I'd prefer to leave my location out as it is quite a small place and I don't want people knowing about this for obvious reasons. It is in Asia if that helps any and I am willing to PM the country to anyone that asks.  Basically I overheard my brother on the phone mentioning that he had videos of him and his girlfriend in compromising situations and I told my parents as well... they needed to know. I was told that they knew and that my mother had accidentally seen the video when she went to turn off his computer.   Both him and his girlfriend are under 16 and my parents have confronted him telling him how illegal this is and stuff but he is just not listening and denying everything. There was no like actual sex but just other stuff in the video apparently.   Legally how fucked is he?	No
694	i live in California. my former housemate is withholding a portion of the part of the house security deposit that was meant to be returned to me, saying that i personally damaged the house more than our other housemates. is this legal? the landlord sent him one large check for him to divide among all the housemates and the check he sent me was smaller with that reasoning. the landlord has written permission from him to send one check. my housemate is withholding 180 dollars. what are my options?	No
695	So in my lease for an apartment, there was a clause that stated if I didn't check out after my lease ends, they would apply a 300$ holdover fee per day. However, I vacated the apartment a week before the lease end date, and was unaware of any check out procedures. 1 day after the lease ended, I received a call telling me that I had a check-out procedure I needed to follow. I was not technically living in the home, and everything was vacated and ready to lease to the next tenant. Is there any way I can fight this fee?	No
696	Basically what happened was that my sister called to get internet for our new apt, and we were rejected by CenturyLink because the person who had lived there before had an outstanding bill of $200+. The representative even had the gall to ask my sister if she wanted to make the payment on behalf of the former resident, (why on earth would we do that for a complete stranger...? Honestly...) which obviously has ticked me a bit.    No, I don't know who the resident is, there are absolutely 0 ties between me, my family, and whoever used to live here. They rejected literally on the basis of the past resident having an outstanding balance, (my sister has a call recorder on her phone so she emailed me the audio,) yet, they require your SSN in order to make an account with them...    A friend of mine told me it's total BS and I could actually report them to the BBB for taking unnecessary sensitive information and rejecting us based on someone else's records. I've never heard of such a preposterous way to be rejected, and honestly I just want some decent internet for my home.     Also sorry in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. Idk where to post it...	No
697	She asked for all original copies so she could bring them to wherever and have them copied. She said I wouldn't have to sign anything and it would be fine, because they just need proof that the person coming here knows a citizen from America.  This seemed really sketchy to me, 1 because I haven't known them THAT long... and 2 - she asked not to tell my mom (who keeps all of those documents for me) and lie to her and say that it was for work purposes.  My question is - is this as sketchy as I think it is? My mom told me it was definitely not OK to give those documents over and not to 'vouch' for anyone coming especially someone I don't know.  What are your thoughts?	No
698	Insert the standard throwaway disclaimer here.   Back in the late 90s-early 2000s, I dated a guy. We moved in together for about a month in 2001 - long story short he punched me in the face, I dumped him and that was that. No kids, no pets, no community property. It was a clean break.  Fast forward 16 years to about a month ago, my fiance and I were at the grocery store and he noticed someone acting really weird, ducking in and out of aisles, following us around. It was my ex. We ignored him, finished shopping, and went home.   Today - I got served with divorce papers from the ex. I was (and am) totally baffled. Apparently he hired a lawyer, filed with the county, etc - everything you'd do for a regular divorce except that we were never married. I know the rule of thumb is to ignore the crazy until you get served, but here I am with papers in hand. What do I do now?	No
699	Hello,  As the title says, I am on my ex (husband's) insurance plan as a dependent. I am not able to get onto a different health insurance plan without cancelling this one. They say that only the primary account holder can have me removed from the plan, but my ex and I are not on speaking terms. Is this legal? Do I really have no say in this? I live in Canada, btw.  Thanks in advance...	No
700	Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.  I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.  Thank you all	No
701	Hello! I am a landlord in NJ.   We have a rental property and our renter wants to kick out her ex-boyfriend. He is not on the lease, but she did get our permission to have him live there. He has been paying us the rent for the two of them - she has been paying him cash and he cuts us the check. My questions:  -- Can she remove him from the property?  -- Do we need to officially evict him, even though he not on the lease, or is this an agreement between the two of them with him subletting from her?   Essentially, they've broken up and she wants our help getting him out of the home she is renting from us.   Thanks for your help!	No
702	Hello! My four friends and I rented a house for the past school year.  We moved out on May 14th. We still have not received our security deposits back from the landlord because he just told us one of our friends didn't pay rent for the spring semester yet. We confronted the friend and he said the landlord was right and he'll send it in asap (which he did). This was about 2 weeks ago. We still have not received the deposits back and have not heard from the landlord. Is he allowed to withhold ALL of our deposits for one person not paying their rent?	No
703	One of my friends is a stoner and keeps his stash and paraphernalia in his car (not the wisest decision, I know). Sometimes I ride in his car. If, while I am in the car, he were to get pulled over and searched and his stash was found, what would happen to me, even though none of the items are mine?  I'm completely unfamiliar with marijuana laws in Maryland as I never have and never will use it, and this situation came to mind. Wondering if I'm making a mistake by riding with him.	No
704	"Nearly 2 years ago my husband and I signed a lease to rent a house. The owner of the home had contracted with a company to handle all the legal paperwork, collection of rent, repairs etc...The lease agreement stated that once the lease up after a year we can either sign a new lease for a year or it goes month to month.   Last year nearing the time the lease was going to be up for renewal, our contact at the rental company told us that the owner was ""considering selling the house"" and that we would be going month to month instead of another year long lease agreement.  We were ok with this.   End of the March 2017, a major hail storm sweeps through and most of the homes in our town had some sort of damage.  Our home had a window broke and enough damage to the roof that the ceiling right inside the front door was leaking and a small ( maybe an inch wide after 2 rains ) appeared.   My husband called the day after the hailstorm and left a message about the damage from the storm.   No Response.   A week later he calls again, brings up the damages from the hailstorm and also informs them that the day before this call the air conditioning unit had stopped working.  He is  told to use the website they have to inform them about the damage and to schedule repairs.   My husband did what they told him to do .   Someone did come out and tape heavy plastic up to cover the broken window and fix the pressing issues surrounding the air conditioning.   After that, nothing is done about the roof nor is the window repaired.   2 weeks later he calls again and gets a call back from the contact person informing him that our landlord wants to sell the home. If we want to buy it we have first right of refusal.  After maybe an hour long discussion we decided we didn't want to buy that house and we started to look for a new rental.   We were fortunate enough to find a home close buy that met our needs, contacted the rental agent, were approved with in a week.   We then went about and gave a 45 day written notice to our current contact at the rental company.  We also wrote a short paragraph on the contact website that stated while we were moving out we still expected to have the roof and window fixed.   While all this time has passed no one has come to fix the window or the roof.   We proceeded to move into our new home. We pack, we move, we clean, etc.... At one point the contact did come over to take pictures of the window and damage to the ceiling caused by damage to the roof. He informed my husband that they would be flying a drone over the house to access the damage.   3 days before our final day of the old house, we got a call saying someone from a carpet company was coming over to measure the rooms because the home would be listed for sale the week after we move out.  We let him in, it took a few minutes, and he left.    Our last day there we had the carpets cleaned , by a company we used before. Same guy came out, and we chatted before and I asked him about the quality of the carpets. He informed me I would be hard pressed to find cheaper carpets out there. I left the receipt for the carpet cleaning on the counter for the rental company to see that I had in good faith, according our our lease, had the carpets cleaned as we were moving out.   The window was still broken when we moved out. As for the roof being fixed, I don't know. I had gotten sick and wasn't able to go to the house for a week and half, so it might have gotten done in that time.  So now it's June 3, more than 2 months since the hailstorm.  We have moved out, and are awaiting our security deposit.  Halfway through the next month my husband checked the website that we used to contact the rental company about repairs, maintenance and pay rent, etc...  He sees a charge on there for $700 and some change, which we automatically assumed was for things I will admit were our liability. ( The carpet in my boys room did need replacing and they had accidentally knocked a hole in the wall which my husband repaired).   My husband called twice in the next 2 weeks, left messages for the contact to call him.   No response.   We finally received a security deposit statement not quite 2 weeks ago.   They charged $650 for touch up painting and repair.  They also charge $2175 and change for carpet replacement.   I now owe them money, allegedly.   I was shocked but I guess I shouldn't be.   I immediately googled my old address and the real estate listing came up. Lots of pictures attached. Not only has all the old carpet been replace, but its much nicer quality, and in rooms where there was no carpet. Also, the kitchen floor has had all the old flooring removed and new tile floors put in. The entire house has been repainted and the master bathroom tile floors have either been painted or replaced.  I should also had that in the years before we moved in, our neighbors had tried to reason with the rental company about an issue with the privacy fencing. 2 neighbors had to replace their fence portions and legally speaking ( according to them and town law) my rental company has to share the cost of the fence replacement. One neighbor claims she is owed a fair sum and they refuse to return her calls. One neighbor informed us as he was moving out that he spent years asking the rental company to replace our fence as it was an eye sore.   If you have made it this far, Thank You. I am sorry its such a long post. I do appreciate any and all advice. Is this worth filing on my own or lawyer-ing up, do I have a case or should I just role over and pay them the $1500 they are alleging I owe. Should I be concerned of the counter suing us for anything above and beyond what is stated in the statement, ie the fence which is now in amazing condition compared to the what it was the last 2 years."	No
705	"USA / Texas  The person that owns adjoining property to mine is considering selling it.  They say that all the other adjoining owners on other sides have also expressed interest.  I'm especially interested because my home looks out over this adjoining property, and I'm interested in keeping this great view that none of the other adjoining owners have.  I know there is a ""Right of First Refusal"" and ""Right of First Offer"" that I can potentially offer to buy from the adjoining owner.  But, is there such an agreement that would allow me to make a final counteroffer on any offer the adjoining owner is considering?  I really don't want to lose this chance if/when it comes up, but don't want to back myself into a corner either.  Thanks"	No
706	So my friends sister is married to a marine. They have been married for nine months. Yesterday he served her divorce papers but would not let her see the papers. He now is telling her today that if she doesn't sign by 5am tomorrow then he is going to go to the court and say she is refusing to sign them. With a quick Google search it looks like she has 30 days before he can do anything. But he is refusing to let her even see the papers so she can't sign even if she wanted to. What's her best course of action? Thanks!	No
707	Four months ago I began renovations on my weed infested, eye soar of a back yard. After tarping, mulching, planting, sweating, and cursing for four months I finaly loved my little sanctuary that I called my home. Luckily I kept the majority of receipts, which most likely totaled some where around $2,000 not including my labor.       I've been on vacation all week and just received a phone call from up stairs neighbor informing me there was a note on my door. The note came from a construction company employee, which stated my back yard would be demolished within 24 hours. I immediately called the number on the bottom of the note to gather more information. Appearantly 30 days ago the construction company and my property manager made an agreement to tear down my backyard. The property manager accepted $3,500 to allow the construction company to destroy and build on the backyard. The construction company reached out to my property manager many times over the last 30 days urging him to inform me of the demolition. He neglected to tell me a damn thing about it.       My lovely neighbors and friends are taking care of all the pots and plants and seats and grills and so on. I know there is no way to stop the demolition but at the very least I would like some sort of compensation for all the sweat and tears that I have dumped into the space. I feel entitled to something. Maybe if my landlord had come to me 30 days ago I would be more understanding but the stress he has put me through alone should deserve something. I'm currently waiting to reach out to management until I know exactly what I want to say.	No
708	One of my best friends with two children is currently going through a divorce but her husband is basically making her wait out till she runs out of money. He took all of the cash before she could get any from their joint account. He got his own apartment when she told him to leave, he left her with the girls and will only see them once a week for a few hours when he chooses. He already hired a lawyer and will not provide her any money for child support. He is basically holding out knowing that her job will not support her and the two children. He was very abusive before she finally kicked him out. I've been trying to help financially as much as I can but I know it's going to get worse. Does anyone have any recommendations? She cannot afford an expensive lawyer and the ones she's called all expect lots of money. I know his lawyer is holding out to make as much money as possible but any help now will be great. I honestly just want any options for her because he keeps making threats that his lawyer will make sure she doesn't get any money and that he will get full custody even though he never watched them and multiple times he left them unattended and would choose to sleep or game instead.	No
709	Hello!      I am located in Milwaukee, WI.  In July, my apartment was without power for (4) days due to the LL not fixing a simple issue.
