Docket No.	question	answer	index
22-506	Just briefly. There's some discussion in the briefs that going past with this provision or that modification or waiver, that this is, in effect, a cancellation of a debt -- that's really what we're talking about -- and that as a cancellation of $400 billion in debt, in effect, this is a grant of $400 billion, and it runs head long into Congress's appropriations authority, and I'd like to give you some time to respond to that.	Background	0
22-506	Because MOHELA was not giving over information voluntarily?	Background	1
22-506	Sunshine law requests brought by?	Background	2
22-506	Well, have we ever decided a case that presents what you see is the issue here or what the parties see as the issue, as one of the issues, which is whether, for Article III standing purposes, a -- an entity is part of a state?	Background	3
22-506	And the -- the -- the most -- the part of the Article III test that's most disputed is injury in fact, is that correct?	Background	4
22-506	May I ask you a question about standing? So it's the case, isn't it, that if any party in either of these two cases has standing, then it would be permissible for us to reach the merits of the issue?	Background	5
21-908	I have just one question that really is out of curiosity. Why did the trial in this case take 19 days?	Background	6
21-86	I guess I was pretty surprised when I read your brief, Mr. Stewart, because, you know, three times in the last couple of decades we've confronted a case like this one and three times we've used Thunder Basin to decide it. And your brief doesn't talk about Thunder Basin until page 51, and it doesn't use -- it doesn't talk about Thunder Basin at all in your summary of the argument. And I guess I read your brief and I'm trying to figure out, do you think you lose under Thunder Basin? Because I thought Thunder Basin was the law here.	Background	7
21-86	But you are in the active agency review process, right?	Background	8
21-86	Just briefly. Mr. Clement, there's a lot of discussion about reaching a final order and then assuming, I guess, an appeal. What percentage of these cases actually go to a cease-and-desist order and what percentage actually are appealed?	Background	9
21-86	Could you take just a minute to set out just more specifically why the agency could not consider these constitutional claims within its structure? What -- I think you have to start by saying what it actually does and what would be reviewed at the appellate level after the agency issues an order.	Background	10
21-86	Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement, is this case distinguishable from Free Enterprise? We -- it seems as though we've been down this road.	Background	11
22-506	And I didn't see anything in the memorandum that dealt with those kinds of questions, and if there is something, I'd be appreciative if you could point me to it.	Background	12
21-1484	And so are you -- you're not relying on the Tucker Act's waiver of sovereign immunity for the claims that you're bringing in this case?	Background	13
21-1484	Have you, throughout this litigation, suggested any other source than the Lower Colorado?	Background	14
21-1484	In your years of litigating this, has there been a suggestion of any source other than the Lower Colorado?	Background	15
21-1484	Mr. Liu, would you just take a step back and address the jurisdictional issue, particularly with respect to redressability and this Court's retention of jurisdiction on the Colorado River.	Background	16
21-757	"You mentioned I think a couple of times there, and you do on your reply brief at page 7, you said the -- where an invention has many embodiments, the patent enables the invention's full scope if skilled artisans can reasonably make and use variations. Can you flesh out ""reasonably"" a little bit for me?"	Background	17
21-476	From the briefs, I saw a lot of agreement actually between the parties in this case on basic legal principles. In your reply brief at page 15, you say that hairstylists, landscapers, plumbers, caterers, tailors, jewelers, and restaurants ordinarily wouldn't have a First Amendment free speech right to decline to serve a same-sex wedding. At least that's how I read that reference in your brief. But you say artists are different, like publishing houses. And I think the other side -- I'll hear from them -- but agree that artists are different because of the First Amendment rights that artists possess. *44 But then, at least as I read the briefs, the case comes down to a fairly narrower -- narrow question of, how do you characterize website designers? Are they more like the restaurants and the jewelers and the tailors, or are they more like, you know, the publishing houses and the other free speech analogues that are raised on the other side? That's what I took away from the briefs. A lot of agreement on broad legal principles and some disagreement about how to characterize the website designers. So why are you right about how you characterize website designers or, put another way, why are they different -- and you've gotten this question -- but why are they different from, say, restaurants or caterers, for example?	Background	18
21-476	Counsel, you have spent quite a bit of your brief talking about the history -- the tradition of public accommodations laws. Would you just spend a few minutes or whatever amount of time you can explaining whether there is a similarly long tradition of public accommodations laws applying to speech -- or expressive conduct?	Background	19
21-476	What I'm interested in is, when you are talking about public accommodations laws directly or indirectly regulating speech, is there a tradition of that? Can you point to cases? Can you point to common law treatises, et cetera?	Background	20
21-476	Not -- not 150 years ago, but I think it's 10 or -- or -- or 12 years ago, in City of Fulton, which you cite in your brief, it sort of follows up on Justice Thomas's question, although you don't even get to speech. I think the Court in that case said, when you're looking at some of the concerns that you're talking about, that a individualized, subjective, multifactor, whatever, determination, in that case foster care and adoption, is not the same as a seat on the bus *63 or a room in the hotel. How -- how does your argument fit with that position that was articulated in the Court with respect to the nature of individual speakers' message?	Background	21
21-476	But, in terms of -- in terms of the concern expressed in a lot of our cases about compelled speech and the distinction of others where you can have a requirement of serving people without regard to certain characteristics, the case did make the point that to the extent there's subjective, individualized determinations that go into the decision about placing children, that it did not -- that those cases were not, at least not directly, applicable?	Background	22
21-476	Yeah, and I'd like to ask you a question about one other case. It's the one you rely on most heavily in your brief, Rumsfeld against FAIR. And it seems to me that a distinction you have to deal with in that case is that the speech there was not compelled, or what was compelled was not considered speech. It involved the schools providing rooms for the military recruiter, and when it came to the question of compelled *65 speech, what the Court said is empty rooms don't speak. But, here, of course, the whole argument is that the speech is being compelled. So -- so how does the either holding or analysis in FAIR help you?	Background	23
21-476	In what other case have we upheld compelling speech, in other words, not simply just restricting speech but actually compelling an individual to engage in speech contrary to her beliefs?	Background	24
21-476	Advising -- advising people that the military recruiters were available in a particular room, right?	Background	25
21-1484	Can I ask you if -- are you bringing this lawsuit under the Tucker Act?	Background	26
21-476	in Obergefell, did the Court say that religious objections to same-sex marriage are the same thing as religious or other objections to people of color?	Background	27
21-908	I have one -- I have one question. I thought your Petitioner and her husband had an LLC. I thought that was on -- in the Joint Appendix 3.	Background	28
22-506	General, I think, at the beginning, you should comment some on the relationship between MOHELA and the State of Missouri, primarily, the -- as you've heard, the effect of this forgiveness program on MOHELA and, by extension, on the State of Missouri for the -- at least to establish standing.	Background	29
21-376	Counsel, you haven't challenged the regulation?, But not in the cert granted question?	Background	30
21-376	I'm not asking about the complaint. The cert granted question does not include challenges to the regulation?	Background	31
21-376	Did you seek cert on that question?	Background	32
21-376	I mean, General Stone, it would profit us that if you would address your standing in this case, particularly since it seems that, to the extent that you're representing parents or potential parents, they can represent themselves, and I think it would be good to get an explanation of your standing.	Background	33
21-887	Couldn't you have solved this problem or precluded this, obviated this problem by obtaining a general release in your settlement?	Background	34
21-887	So the -- was there -- before you had (l), this provision, 1415(l), did you have an exhaustion requirement?	Background	35
21-1164	Mr. McCoy, was there a time when this Court regarded sovereign immunity as tied to subject matter jurisdiction?	Background	36
22-506	General, my first question is clarifying because I think I may have misunderstood. You said at the start of your argument that the Secretary both waived and modified. I had understood that the Secretary only relied on the modification in the Federal Register at the relevant cites at 87 Federal Register 61512 and 61514. Is it in those same -- did I just miss in there, did he also specifically say waive?	Background	37
21-376	Would you spend a minute on what the good cause standard is? I think -- of course, you understand that there's already a placement, there's already adoption in process, but how does that work?	Background	38
21-1449	I guess I'm not sure I understand your answer to the question, whether you think that your test captures conduct that the reasonable precautions test does not. So, in your latter half of the answer, you suggested yes. I took the former half to say no. So maybe I was ---- just misunderstanding. But is -- is -- does it go further, does it capture conduct that you think the Board's test does not?	Background	39
21-1333	I'm glad, but I'm going to be to look at complaint because it can only survive if the complaint is adequate. So you're going to have to tell me where in the complaint you're saying this if I'm going to think about holding them liable.	Background	40
21-1333	Can I break down your complaint a moment? There -- the vast majority of it is paragraph after paragraph after paragraph that says they're liable because they failed to take ISIS off their website. I think, as I'm listening to you today, you seem to have abandoned that and -- and are saying they don't have to take it off their website.	Background	41
22-535	How is that sufficiently concrete and particularized in the context of something that the government would address if it can't do what it's doing now?	Background	42
22-535	Is that -- I mean, I think your challenge is -- is to make that sufficiently particularized and non-speculative. I mean, the -- the problem with standing jurisprudence for something that looks for something concrete and particularized, it's also very academic, you know, a dollar of injury and you're in, hundreds of millions that they can't trace directly to the agency action and -- and you're not. So what is it that makes the interest of your client who has, what, a $17,000 loan?	Background	43
22-535	Mr. Connolly, has this Court ever held that the notice-and-comment provisions of the APA can establish -- are enough for standing in a case like this?	Background	44
22-506	MOHELA isn't here, General Crawford, is that correct?	Background	45
22-535	Can I just ask you, I -- I had understood them to be complaining about the procedures. Am I completely off base here?	Background	46
22-535	This action has nothing to do with their right if they thought it was permissible to seek relief under the Education Act, correct?	Background	47
21-1195	One of the things that seemed problematic to me is you cite 5314, but it doesn't mention accounts.	Background	48
22-535	Are there any instances in which you would have procedural standing?	Background	49
21-1195	Can you just help me on the second paragraph of the reasonable cause provision? Because I had trouble.	Background	50
22-145	Well ---- what -- what was the value of the -- typical value of the agent and teller's checks?	Background	51
22-535	Were the procedures in Summers applied in Summers?	Background	52
21-846	Have there been examples where the Arizona Supreme Court changed one of its precedents or overruled one of its precedents and then said it wasn't a significant change?	Background	53
21-1170	Haven't we treated qualified immunity differently from other interlocutory appeals?	Background	54
21-1170	So you say you object -- that reserved ---- preserved your jury instruction?	Background	55
21-1170	Justice Alito's question assumed a jury waiver, a jury instruction waiver. Did you waive here?	Background	56
21-476	What if the law schools also had to make available their CDO to sit down with the military and help them craft, you know, in a statement that would be attributable to the military, you know, this is why a career with the military -- this is what it would be, this is why it's attractive, and then post it? Would that change Rumsfeld?	Clarification	57
21-476	And I guess I was thinking, isn't part of the problem trying to figure out whose statement of opinion it is when you have a public accommodation? 	Clarification	58
21-476	Do you think that's the same as the speech that's compelled here, which is directly opposite to the beliefs that the -- Ms. Smith is -- is seeking to convey?	Clarification	59
21-476	I mean, you agree that in Hurley the parade was a public accommodation, as we held? Because Hurley is your hardest case, right?	Clarification	60
21-476	And you protect religious beliefs under the statute, right?	Clarification	61
21-476	Well, they're paid. Why? I mean, they're paid.	Clarification	62
21-476	So, for gay pride month, a newspaper can't choose to try to celebrate that and communicate a message by running only gay marriage announcements?	Clarification	63
21-476	Even though they say there's no serious question that it does, you disagree with that?	Clarification	64
21-476	Do you agree it involves compelled speech?	Clarification	65
21-476	So the website designer is different from the publishing house how?	Clarification	66
21-476	But, if it were a public accommodation, it would still have a First Amendment right, correct?	Clarification	67
21-476	What do you call it?	Clarification	68
21-476	Mr. Phillips did go through a re-education training program pursuant to Colorado law, did he not, Mr. Olson?	Clarification	69
21-476	What's different about this case? Because -- I'll just finish the question. I know you're already ready to answer it. But we have an individual who says she will sell and does sell to everyone all manner of websites. But she won't sell a website that requires her to express a view about marriage that she finds offensive to her religious beliefs. What's the difference between the two cases? I'm struggling to understand.	Clarification	70
21-476	Okay, why?	Clarification	71
21-476	And, counsel, we also have stipulations from Colorado that the plaintiff is willing to work with all people, regardless of classifications such as race, creed, sexual orientation, and gender, right?	Clarification	72
21-476	So they can be compelled to -- it's not -- it's not that they have anything against opposite-sex unions, but they can be compelled to give their, you know, web space to those -- to those announcements even though it's not consistent with the message of their organization?	Clarification	73
21-476	Do you disagree with that? It's a stipulated fact in this case.	Clarification	74
21-476	Counsel, would you spend just a few minutes on whether or not this -- your case is ripe?	Clarification	75
21-476	Just as she wouldn't sell a website that celebrates a heterosexual union that she disagreed with to anyone regardless of their sexual orientation, right?	Clarification	76
21-476	So the answer is yes, Colorado would compel that person?	Clarification	77
21-1043	It's not necessarily -- not necessary to overrule that case, but the best way to make sense of Steele going forward would be to narrow it in the way that you're proposing?	Clarification	78
21-1043	So would it be fair to characterize your position as saying Steele would come out a different way today?	Clarification	79
21-1043	So explain to me how a U.S. citizen in a foreign country who does exactly what your client does, why should they be responsible but you not.	Clarification	80
21-1043	Doesn't your view overrule Steele?	Clarification	81
21-1043	Could you imagine any set of circumstances where a sale that involves an international transaction could also involve conduct in the United States that violates the Lanham Act?	Clarification	82
21-476	They would say that's this case, and you say it's not because?	Clarification	83
21-476	It can be -- it can be status or it can be message, and we have to figure that out in this case, right?	Clarification	84
21-476	Right?	Clarification	85
21-476	You think this is a status case. The other side thinks it's a -- a viewpoint case. Is that fair too?	Clarification	86
21-476	Justice Gorsuch says we don't want to do things based on relief because courts are in control of relief, so take out that part of your -- I mean, whether he might be right, he might not be right, but would it matter if we took that out?	Clarification	87
21-476	And we have a case without any of that in it. And what should I do with that?	Clarification	88
21-476	So how much selectivity do you think is required?	Clarification	89
21-476	It can't define it to include political affiliations ---- or ideology?	Clarification	90
21-476	You believe that that's permissible?	Clarification	91
21-476	Do you agree with Mr. Olson that a -- a website for marriages can tailor the website in a way that makes the website unacceptable to same-sex couples?	Clarification	92
21-476	So my first question is whether you believe that speech can be compelled so long as the person who is compelled to speech -- to speak is -- is not associated with the compelled speech.	Clarification	93
21-476	Why?	Clarification	94
21-476	Do we agree as well that this is -- this work that the plaintiff performs is expressive in nature?	Clarification	95
21-476	-- and she wouldn't provide it to a heterosexual couple either, right?	Clarification	96
21-476	Okay. Okay. And then, separately, I -- I was intrigued by your answer before my friends at the Tenth Circuit about freelance writers and people like that and the notion that Colorado could compel, for example, an individual to write a speech or a *87 press release on behalf of, say, a religious entity with whom he or she disagrees. Does -- does every press release writer, freelance writer have to write a press release for the Church of Scientology, say, even though the beliefs of that institution may be inimical to that person?	Clarification	97
21-476	It can't define it as political affiliation?	Clarification	98
21-476	Yeah, I understand that. So to sell to everyone. So this goes to your -- to the interpretation of your statute, and I'm not quite clear what your position is on it. If a business provides a service that is “open to the public,” it's a public accommodation, right?	Clarification	99
21-476	So, as I understand your argument, the kind of you can say anything you want as long as you say it to everybody or not say anything you want as long as you don't say it to anybody. So a gay couple walks in to Ms. Smith's office and says, we want a quote from Obergefell, and she says, I don't do that. That's okay with you, yes?	Clarification	100
21-476	It may be an edge case meaning it could fall on either side, you're not sure?	Clarification	101
21-476	What do you mean? I mean, the objection, just like your client's objection, is to expressions that violate their own views of what is being depicted, and so their view of what is being depicted is that a scene with Santa and a child on the lap and all of that in sepia tone, trying to harken back to the good old days, should only have white children in it. That's their firm belief. They are not willing to take photographs of black, Hispanic, Asian *28 children on Santa's lap. Why is that any different than a situation like this?	Clarification	102
21-476	Can I give you a hypothetical? It's not really a hypothetical, because I happen to have two clerks in my chambers this year who are engaged, so, in looking at this case and preparing this case, I looked at their websites. And so the hypothetical is about, like, I'm going to call it the standard website. They both have their names on it, the date of the wedding, a picture of the couple. Then there are a bunch of places that you can click to, and one is the schedule of events and the other is travel and hotel arrangements, and another is favorite things to do in town while you're here, and another is registry. So that's what most websites look like, yeah? And they're not particularly ideological and they're not particularly religious. They're not particularly anything, all right? And -- and then there's a tag line just like the tag line in this case about sort of who created the website or whose graphics and design and typefaces and so forth were used in the website. And so one of them says -- I'm going to substitute a woman's name just to not advertise -- but one of them says, Made By Love With Amber by -- Made With Love By Amber, right? It's actually bigger than the 303 tag line. So I guess what I want to know is suppose Amber wakes up tomorrow morning and says, you know what, I don't want to do those websites anymore for same-sex couples. Could she do that?	Clarification	103
21-476	Okay. So I think that if I understand you, you're saying, yes, she can refuse because there's ideology just in the fact that it's Mike and Harry and there's a picture of these two guys together.	Clarification	104
21-476	so it's really nothing about the content of this speech. I mean, it could be Mike and Pat and you don't *10 actually even know whether Pat is a woman or a man. There's really nothing about the content of this speech, am -- am I right? In your case, you have, like, scripture examples, and so that might, you know, be different maybe, but you're being forthright and saying it's really not about that. It's nothing about the content of the speech. It's just that the content is being -- what -- what -- whatever the graphics and typefaces and, you know -- you know, which hotels are -- you know, have been reserved for the wedding, it's being used in a same-sex marriage.	Clarification	105
21-476	So their message is not actually the content of the website. I mean, this is Justice Kagan's point. We could have a situation in which the identical website is being offered, one to Harry and Ann and one to Harry and Steve, but everything on the website is exactly the same. I think I hear you saying that the message that the designer would be sending when she offered the website to Harry and Steve would be different and contrary to her beliefs, and so -- so it's -- it's the implicit message that she's endorsing that wedding --	Clarification	106
21-476	Well, that's -- that's a particular message. But I looked to your proposed website, and turn to page 51. It says Save The Date, Lilly and Luke, November 17, 2017. So what's the message if it says, Save The Date, Lilly and -- Lilly and Lillian or Lilly and Mary? What's the message there?	Clarification	107
21-476	But why is it your invitation? I go to a wedding website. It's something that I send, meaning you, your client, I send it to my family and friends or Lilly and Luke send it to their family and friends. You don't send it. They go to this website. You're not inviting them to the wedding. Lilly and Mary are. So how does it become your message?	Clarification	108
21-476	Suppose -- suppose we agreed that the website designer could not refuse to provide that service to a same-sex couple if the website is of the kind that Justice Kagan described. What does that say about the particular case that is before us on stipulated facts?	Clarification	109
21-476	Well, so what are the differences between -- what differences do you see between her hypothetical and the actual case that is before us?	Clarification	110
21-476	So please tell me why it's not protected speech, the identical message that -- that Justice Barrett put forth but by a disabled couple. And you say, I don't want disabled people to get married. I think propagating a disability is against my personal *23 belief. It doesn't have to be religious because we're not dealing with the religious part of this. I don't want to speak that message. I too believe that two disabled people getting married and telling their story of how they got in love, I'm not going to serve those people because I don't believe that they should be married. What's the difference between that and I don't believe black people and white people should get married?	Clarification	111
21-476	That concepts of gender or, you know, sexual orientation were irrelevant to their relationship because they believe that those categories don't matter. What matters is their union of souls.	Clarification	112
21-476	And, Ms. Waggoner, can I just ask you to clarify before we move on? *20 When I first asked you the question about the cisgender heterosexual couple, you said you thought she would publish it, but then it seemed like you wavered and said something different a minute ago.	Clarification	113
21-476	Ms. Waggoner, can I ask you -- a question about a heterosexual couple? So, in response to Justice Sotomayor's questions, I took it that your website where you say why a wedding website, you go through and it seems like careful, Ms. Smith was careful to say things like I fully customize the look, feel, theme, message, color palettes, et cetera. And then *18 there's the engagement story page and inspired by -- “a page inspired by you and written by Lorie that captures and conveys the cherished storybook of your love.” So I want to ask you a hypothetical about a heterosexual couple that comes to your client, and their wedding story, you know, that they want to write under the engagement story page goes like this: We are both cisgender and heterosexual, but that is irrelevant to our relationship which transcends such categories. We knew we were soulmates from the moment that we met and on and on. Would your client publish that site?	Clarification	114
21-476	Even though that narrative, I assume, is inconsistent with her biblical views about marriage? I'll give you another related one. A heterosexual couple comes to her and in the engagement story part writes a story that goes like this: We met at *19 work, we were both married to other people, but what began as late nights at the office quickly turned into love. After six months, we realized we could be happy only with each other, so we decided to begin our story today, got divorced, and are marrying each other. Does she publish it?	Clarification	115
21-476	So it's about the message and not about the sexuality of the couple that asked her to express it that matters?	Clarification	116
21-476	So you -- you're -- you're saying a print shop, a web designer, a -- a cake maker, a jewelry -- a photographer, a jewelry maker, they can refuse to serve anyone they want to refuse because they have a deeply felt belief that serving -- taking pictures of black couples, black and white couples, taking pictures of disabled people, people are going to believe that they're speaking that message?	Clarification	117
21-476	Because she doesn't do it for anybody, yeah?	Clarification	118
21-476	Then this is -- your argument is -- you're making kind of a sliver of an argument, right? What is the difference between that and what you think is a violation of your law\	Clarification	119
21-476	Okay. Gay couple walks in and says -- this is the harder one, all *77 right? A gay couple walks in and says, I'd like the standard website, you know, everything standard, the kind of website we were talking about before, but I want something in addition to that. I want -- I want in the -- on the home page the website to say “God blesses this union.” All right? And Ms. Smith says -- well, that's a problem, Ms. Smith says. And the gay couple says, well, you would say that if -- if we were an opposite-sex couple, right? And -- and she says, we -- I would say that if you were an opposite-sex couple. And the gay couple says, well, what's the big deal then? I don't know, I think that that kind of is different, so I'm wondering whether you think it's different.	Clarification	120
21-476	So the question isn't who, it's what?	Clarification	121
21-476	It's good to see you. We -- we've had some discussion about whether websites are speech or whether they are some -- a service off the shelf. And I -- I -- I, like a lot of my colleagues, don't profess to know much about this. But I do know that there are some stipulations that you made in paragraphs 81, 82, 83, which say that this is customized, personalized, and expressive activity in each and every circumstance. What do we do about that from your perspective? Don't we have to take that as given?	Clarification	122
21-476	This would be the first time in the Court's history, correct, that it would say that a business open to the public, as this Petitioner has said it is, that it's open -- a commercial business open to the public, serving the public, that it could refuse to serve a customer based on race, sex, religion, or sexual orientation, correct?	Clarification	123
21-476	So then -- I mean, the difference is one couple is opposite *39 sex, one couple is same sex. How is this -- you know, what -- what are the different meanings? What is the speech that your client is expected -- is -- is required to provide in the way I expressed it to you?	Clarification	124
21-476	So why does it matter?	Clarification	125
21-476	So now it's not Mike and Mary. Now it's Mike and Mark, and they want the identical site. We saw Mike and Mary's site. We loved it. We're getting married. You know -- you know, all they want to change is the date maybe or, you know, their names, whatever. We loved it. And -- and they don't get it. And the question -- and -- and you say no, right? You -- you -- you wouldn't be up there if you weren't going to say no, right? They can't get that site?	Clarification	126
21-476	Well, is -- is -- is the prohibition or the limitation against compelled speech limited to things that are unconstitutional?	Clarification	127
21-476	Let me just give you one -- one more hypothetical. Suppose someone offers the service of writing customized wedding vows or customized speeches to be given at a wedding by people who have an idea what they would like to say about a family member or a good friend, but they just don't feel they're very good with words. They can't put it into words. And let's say that this outfit is just starting up. They don't have a lot of clients. They're sitting at -- you know, they're sitting by the phone and their computer waiting for somebody to show up, so they will take anybody. All right? Can -- can they be forced to write vows or speeches that espouse things they loathe?	Clarification	128
21-476	Okay. So what does “open to the public” mean? Does that mean no selectivity whatsoever? Anybody who wants this service can get it and it may be, if there's a greater demand, then the demand exceeds the supply, you've got to wait in line. But, if there's any selectivity at all, they're out?	Clarification	129
21-476	Yeah. I mean, and they say we don't want your scripture. That's all right with you? They don't have to have scripture?	Clarification	130
21-476	Yeah. I -- I wanted to take you back to my opening questions and then Justice Alito's question about how your case is different from my hypothetical, and maybe the way to sort of cut through some of this is to not make it a hypothetical and just ask about your client. So Mike and Mary go into your client, we love your graphics, we saw them someplace else, we love how this looks. Here's what we want. We want a standard site, our names, our -- the picture, the hotels, the registry, you know, just -- just that. And you say okay, don't you?	Clarification	131
21-476	I guess I don't understand that answer. In other words, is it simply adding for religious reasons to the label that would change whether it could be regulated or not?	Clarification	132
21-476	So it has to satisfy a constitutional requirement? Your argument is dependent on that?	Clarification	133
21-476	Well, back to my black Santa example, suppose it's a state that defines a public accomodation -- prohibits a public accommodation to discriminate on the basis of political ideology. So then -- then the picture has to be taken?	Clarification	134
21-476	Yeah, possible. I get the -- I get the idea that there's a kind of religious element to it. I wish I could think *78 of one that didn't have that component because I feel like there's something else going on there as well, that it is a statement of opinion about the nature of this marriage, which, you know, in my earlier hypotheticals I took care to remove. But now there's a kind of statement of opinion about the nature of this marriage, and unlike the kind of “our story” things, which is like -- obviously, it's their story, it's not the designer's story. You know, unlike that, it feels a little bit to me as though it could be a kind of third person saying God blesses this union. And who would the third person be other than the person who's put the whole website together? So I have difficulty with that hypothetical, and I'm wondering what you think about it.	Clarification	135
21-476	But why is yours not a service?	Clarification	136
21-476	Let me see if I *67 understand your argument. I understand you to be arguing that a website designer can put anything it wants on a standardized website, even if that includes a denunciation of same-sex marriage. Is that correct?	Clarification	137
21-476	Well, do you think Justice Kennedy would have said that there are -- that it's honorable to oppose -- to discriminate on the basis of race?	Clarification	138
21-476	And just so I make sure I understood your colloquy with Justice Barrett, the objections to compelled speech on religious grounds could include, in fact, do include, some objections with respect to certain heterosexual marriages, that there are certain heterosexual unions that your client would not speak toward either, is that correct?	Clarification	139
21-1052	So just following up on Justice Kagan and Kavanaugh's point about intervention. So you -- I thought you said to Justice Kagan that intervention would be problematic because it's subjecting the government's dismissal decision to second-guessing. But it's not the -- it's not the intervention that is subjecting the motion to dismiss. It's the fact that they -- you have to have a hearing for a motion to dismiss, right? I mean, regardless, even without intervention, do you concede that the statute says that the government's filing of a motion to dismiss at least entitles the relator to an opportunity for a hearing?	Communicate	140
22-148	And we have amicus brief from different stakeholders, some saying it may not apply in parody, but it could apply in movie titles, it might apply in something else and not this, in novels, et cetera. Why should we rule broadly? And if we rule narrowly, on what basis? You heard earlier at least three alliterations, one, the -- Justice Kagan's, one Justice Jackson, one me, limit this just to parodies, because parodies really do rely on is this a joke that people are going to get.	Communicate	141
21-1052	If you let the government in and you're saying -- you responded to Justice Jackson by saying, well, the government can then be a full litigant. Well, litigants can move to dismiss, so what can the government do?	Communicate	142
21-1052	So to bind the government to its initial decision strikes me as just increasing the Article II concerns that Justice Thomas asked about with the statute. First of all, do you agree that things can change after the first 60 days?	Communicate	143
21-1052	On the question of the hearing that Justice Gorsuch raised, the statute itself, the text of the statute imposes no standard whatsoever, correct?	Communicate	144
21-1052	Well, answer Justice Alito's entire question. The astrologer might not be good enough. I don't feel like it, is that good enough?	Communicate	145
21-1052	It doesn't say you have to meet the standards of the federal rules. It's -- and it reflects the backdrop, again, as Justice Thomas alluded to, of the Article II concern that would exist if the government's power to control prosecution of a case or pursuit of a civil action were somehow removed from the government's power. So why shouldn't we read the statute, given the Article II concern, read that provision for what it says?	Communicate	146
22-148	So going back to Justice Gorsuch's point, isn't trademark consistent with the First Amendment because of trademark infringement's limited scope? And by that, I mean, if the -- isn't the point of having a trademark to identify the mark owner's own goods or services and to prevent others from passing off their goods and services as the mark owner? So the confusion that we care about is that people in the marketplace are going to be looking at these items and think they are the mark owner's because of the way they're labeled rather than the person who actually created them. If I'm right about that, then I guess I'm trying to understand why -- shouldn't the defendant have to be using the mark in a way that identifies who is responsible for it in order for trademark infringement to even apply?	Communicate	147
22-148	Well, that's going back to Justice Kagan -- Justice Jackson's point, and you said it's not only about source, so what else is it about?	Communicate	148
22-148	All right? And I want you to answer them in view of what Justice Thomas said.	Communicate	149
21-476	Can I -- can I -- can I -- Yeah? Is that all right?	Communicate	150
22-148	What they're trying to get at is whether the use of this trademark in this context can or is confusing. And so I see the Rogers test perhaps not as -- as articulated, but all of the circuits have some form of it and it's all different, but I see them all doing something where they're saying there are certain contexts of use that are less likely or not likely to confuse. And what the Second Circuit said with respect to titles is, when you're talking about a title use, the context of a movie, you can't decide whether it's confusing until you look at the movie and you decide whether or not the movie uses the title in an aesthetically pleasing way. I think they did add something to the likelihood-of-confusion standard that's not there, because they said it has to have -- I don't remember the words -- but something greater than just a likelihood of confusion.	Communicate	151
21-1052	Just to follow up on Justice Alito's question, would it be okay to come in and say we don't think it's the best use of agency resources to proceed?	Communicate	152
21-1052	But, if we get to the hearing that Justice Gorsuch raised rightly and what -- what has to happen at that hearing, I think the court's interfering with the government's ability to control -- the executive's ability to control the suit. That's -- that's an Article II concern, it seems to me.	Communicate	153
21-432	I -- I -- I'm not sort of, you know, sliding into the pro-veteran canons, but does it make any sense as an abstract matter to say the one area where we're not going to waive it, where we're going to insist on strict adherence, is service-connected disabilities?	Criticism	154
21-432	Counsel, I am not sure which way your emphasis on the 16 exceptions really cuts. I mean, if there are 16 exceptions to the rule, that kind of suggests to me that the insistence upon strict enforcement is really not that important. I mean, your -- your friend points out that these things came in at different times and different considerations. To me, the sort of strict notion of -- of sovereign immunity, I mean, you've already compromised it quite -- quite a bit, and yet you're going to insist on it when it comes to service-connected disability. That seems -- in other words, the plethora of exceptions seems to me to make it more likely that you ought to stick with the normal rule in the private sector and allow equitable tolling.

21-476	It's the couple's photo gallery. Page 54 is “Funny Dating Story.” It's their story, not your story. I'm looking at every page, and, basically, it's the story of the couple. It's a date on page 51. Fifty-two is “Our Special Day.” Fifty-three is RSVP. “Our Photo Gallery.” Fifty-four is a funny dating story. *17 I keep looking at all of the mockups, and all of them relate to what Lilly and Luke are saying or doing, who they are, who are their grooms, who aren't their -- who's their bridesmaids. I don't understand. How is this your story? It's their story.	Criticism	157
21-869	Where do you get the idea that you have to need the -- the original work?	Criticism	158
21-869	Mr. Martinez, I think one of the problems that you have, as evidenced by a lot of the questions that you've been getting, is with the derivative works protection, you know, which, in, you know, 106(2), actually talks about transforming any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. And it seems to me like your test, this meaning or message test, risks stretching the concept of transformation so broadly that it kind of eviscerates Factor 1 and puts all of the emphasis on Factor 4. I mean, when you've been asked about book to movie and -- and -- and, you know, songs, you keep flipping to Factor 4. So, if a work is derivative, like Lord of the Rings, you know, book to movie, is your answer just like, well, sure, that's a new meaning or message, it's transformative, so all that matters is 4?	Criticism	159
21-869	Can I just stop you for a second? Are you just sort of hypothesizing about that, or are you saying that was actually the purpose of this use in this situation?	Criticism	160
21-869	Why? I mean, derivative works are generally in a different medium, and almost all of them, even a dramatization on -- on theater or even a motion picture or a sequel, they add something new according to your definition in your brief. So why shouldn't they be protected as well according to your theory?	Criticism	161
21-757	"Can I quote ---- two sections from the Federal Circuit -- two statements it made, and you tell me whether they're right or wrong.

Is that a correct statement of law by the Federal Circuit?"	Criticism	162
21-1484	Mr. Liu, with respect to that, there are provisions in the treaty with respect to agricultural -- agriculture, a promise that this will be a permanent home and that there will be a opportunity for raising animals, right?	Criticism	163
21-1484	And there's an obligation to provide opportunities for a permanent home. Now let's say, as a matter of state contract, I promise you a permanent home and that you'll be able to raise animals there and you'll be able to conduct agriculture there. Would it not be a breach of contract to then provide a home where none of those things is possible? Is that a permanent home?	Criticism	164
21-1484	They agreed to sit -- to a land that would permit them to return to agriculture, and the bargain they got in return was we, the United States, took away all of your other lands, we gave you this piece of land here, survive, even if it's -- it turns into a desert condition, where you admit there are significant water needs on the reservation, but the tribe can't do anything about it ---- against you, can't hold you responsible?	Criticism	165
21-1484	You don't think that's a breach of good faith and fair dealing?	Criticism	166
21-1484	There are no rights to water. But you're not reading the treaty that way. You're saying, look, when the treaty gives land, the treaty also says, you know, implicit in that is that you have a right to the water that will enable you to live on that land. So then there seems to me to be a gap because then you're saying, well, notwithstanding that the treaty gives water, that the treaty promises water. That's what treaties do. It's a contract that promises something. You're saying those rights are unenforceable. And I guess I don't understand, if the treaty promises water, where you get the idea that that is unenforceable?	Criticism	167
21-1484	But what you're saying is your trust obligation is meaningless. They can't force you to do anything to protect their water rights. That's what you're saying, correct?	Criticism	168
21-476	Well, they can ask for what they want. What they get might be another thing, Mr. Olson. But how we analyze the case depends upon those stipulations.	Criticism	169
21-1484	That's a -- that's -- that's quite an odd agreement the tribe entered into, isn't it? They agreed to go back to a piece of their homeland and gave -- gave the United States control over the vast majority of it.	Criticism	170
21-476	But they're not public accommodations in the same way.	Criticism	171
21-476	No, she -- what you're saying is, I want to give gay couples a limited menu, not a full menu, just the way that luncheonette said.	Criticism	172
21-476	Tell me how that's different, by the way. What you're basically saying is, in our Ollie's Barbecue case, the company there said, I'll serve blacks but only on a takeout window, not inside my restaurant because that sends a message that I endorse integration.	Criticism	173
21-476	But you're not asking for that. You're saying, I don't want to serve a particular person, a disabled person, a black and white couple, a disabled couple, a -- *33 a gay couple. You're basing it not on the nature of the message, you're basing it on who you're serving.	Criticism	174
21-476	But then why does an off-the-shelf website -- the creator of an off-the-shelf website is then speaking? That's what you're saying.	Criticism	175
21-476	But why not? I'm saying your identical website, and I don't see a page in here where it says I am speaking, 303. That's on your personal website. It's not on the wedding website. I've asked you to show me where, in which pages, it's your message as opposed to the couple's message.	Criticism	176
21-476	I'm sorry. Show me on your website -- show me in -- on the pages of your petition for a writ of certiorari, show me a page on that website that is an endorsement of a marriage as opposed to the story of a couple.	Criticism	177
21-1484	If you'd just answer my question. Could I bring a good breach-of-contract claim for someone who promised me a permanent home, the right to conduct agriculture and raise animals if it turns out it's the Sahara Desert? Really?	Criticism	178
21-757	And what happened and why did it take you so long to do the post-filing discovery of more?	Criticism	179
21-476	But those are the stipulations.	Criticism	180
21-1484	You don't think there's a fiduciary relationship here at all?	Criticism	181
21-476	But -- but aren't -- don't we have cases that suggest that people's conduct can be expressive? I thought there was a whole line of cases that said you didn't have to actually have an express message, you could be acting in such a way as to express a message. And in my restaurant hypo, I'm saying, if I sell to non-Protestants, I'd be expressing a message contrary to Grandma Helen's core beliefs.	Criticism	182
21-476	It was a re-education program, right?	Criticism	183
21-476	In light of what Justice Kennedy wrote in Obergefell about honorable people who object to same-sex *81 marriage, do you think it's fair to equate opposition to same-sex marriage with opposition to interracial marriage?	Criticism	184
21-476	How can you disagree with that in light of the stipulations that Justice Gorsuch reviewed with you? Because, if it's speech, you know, as the stipulations Justice Gorsuch read did, and she has to say it, why isn't it compelled speech?	Criticism	185
21-476	So have you reviewed this website?	Criticism	186
21-476	Do you believe that there's any page that says celebrate the marriage?	Criticism	187
21-476	You can't change their religious belief, right?	Criticism	188
21-476	Well, my question really was not whether this website is a public accommodation. I understand that's been stipulated. That wasn't my question. What I'm trying to understand is the breadth of your argument, and what I get is that you're making a -- a tiny sliver of an argument. So the website can put anything on its website, even something that will blatantly or subtly *72 tell a same-sex couple, well, this is not a service that I want. They can do that. And a website can also potentially get itself out from being a public accommodation simply by reserving a degree of selectivity. That's what you've told me so far.	Criticism	189
21-476	And isn't part of the problem here in terms of trying to answer Justice Alito's various hypotheticals that we're *71 presented with a record of stipulated facts and that the opposing -- your friend on the other side actually stipulated to the application of the statute? So it's really hard for us to know and figure out and determine in this context how the statute would actually apply because we don't really have a real record on that -- on that score.	Criticism	190
21-476	Well, you should understand what your statute means. So suppose a website designer says, I'm -- I'm offering my services, but I'm really in -- I -- I'm in a lot of demand for my services and I reserve the right to decide who I will provide a website for and who I will not. Is it a public accommodation then?	Criticism	191
21-476	No, I understand that. Does it make any difference in the real world as a practical matter?	Criticism	192
21-476	So this is a carveout that's applicable just to the same-sex context?	Criticism	193
21-1043	Well, if I were looking for the holding in Steele and I were back in law school, I might look at the first sentence of the opinion, which says the issue is whether a United States district court has jurisdiction to award relief to an American corporation against acts of trademark infringement and unfair competition consummated in a foreign country by a citizen and resident of the United States. So you say it's not a jurisdictional issue and it doesn't matter whether it's a citizen or -- or a resident of the United States. It sounds to me like you're asking us to overrule Steele in part.	Criticism	194
21-476	You sure about that?	Criticism	195
21-476	Isn't that kind of a silly distinction?	Criticism	196
21-1043	You know that they're buying it to ship it into the U.S. Why aren't you aiding and abetting?	Criticism	197
21-476	I mean, you're not -- that website designer is not going to be serving a same-sex couple if the website designer puts that on the website. They're turning away *68 same-sex couples by doing that, are they not?	Criticism	198
21-1043	So, even if you know that it's going to the U.S., you're not responsible?	Criticism	199
21-476	Why not? Because I do see a thing very different if I put a cake on display, it's been made, it is what it is, or a website that you can then go customize yourself, and another thing to commission an expressive *86 activity and -- and -- and to require somebody to create an expression. Those are two different things analytically in our law. So help me out.	Criticism	200
21-476	So I will -- I will write a press release for many faiths and many belief systems that are -- but they have to be consistent with mine and I won't do it if it -- if it offends my religious faith. Good to go?	Criticism	201
21-1043	It seems to me that your position in this world of the internet makes very little sense. Foreign buyers today do what almost all buyers do, which is advertise their goods on the internet, and they purposely target American customers in America. The fact that they choose to deliver those goods at the border, outside the United States, or into the U.S., to me, should make no difference. They are competing with the trademark owner in the U.S. to secure U.S. customers. And so I just can't see your territoriality rule making any sense because the case I gave is a version of Steele, frankly, and I don't see why overturning Steele or making it depend on the citizenship of the defendant is important. I think the SG is right. The issue is whether or not these acts are intended to cause confusion in the U.S., and that internet sale, to me, is clearly intended to violate the Act. But not by you, the manufacturer. You advertised it. You delivered it to the border and said to the customer: Come with your truck, or pay a freight forwarder to bring it to you across the border. Why does that make sense?	Criticism	202
21-1043	And isn't that an effect as direct as the Lanham Act can ask for? 	Criticism	203
21-1043	So are you saying that the cleanest thing and the way to bring our cases in -- in line, to bring Steele and maybe this case before us in line with our modern extraterritoriality jurisprudence, is just to overrule it?	Criticism	204
21-1271	"When -- at page -- near the end of your brief, at page 49, you say that this Court ""always has jurisdiction to intervene in rare cases where state courts act lawlessly to obstruct federal rights.""

21-1333	Yeah, so I don't think that a court did it over there, and I think that that's my concern, is I can imagine a world where you're right that none of this stuff gets protection. And, you know, every other industry has to internalize the costs of its conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear. On the other hand, I mean, we're a court. We really don't know about these things. You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the Internet.	Humor	217

I mean, you -- you suggest that you, you know, come to the hearing officer and you get what you get and you don't get upset and you don't get to choose. That's what my daughters sometimes say. So -- but -- but don't we have language in the statute just before the five words that you focused on that we have to take into account with respect to what it is that the person is actually seeking? Help -- help me to understand whether you're cutting that out of the -- of -- of your scenario or how it squares with your view that it doesn't matter what it is that you -- you really want in terms of your relief."

21-887	Every lawyer knows that's dangerous. I'm bound by circuit precedent and arguments that weren't made to me, okay? Here we are with all sorts of excellently lawyered arguments on both sides and no circuit precedent. Proceed with caution.	Humor	226
21-1449	You intentionally stop the work, but the question is, can you do something that actually intends to affect the property directly to make the property unsalvageable. We can't get new people in here as a result of the strike and pick up where we left off because you literally burned down the factory. We agree that you can't burn down the factory, right?	Humor	227
22-535	Okay. Last question. I can't resist on Justice Gorsuch's earlier question.If -- if it were party-specific relief and it went up to the court of appeals and the court of -- and you had sought an emergency injunction in the court of appeals and the court of appeals ruled against the government on that, would you then follow that in that circuit or not? Because you might not in the future, right?	Humor	228
22-535	General, I -- I appreciate your standing arguments and they've been laid out very clearly here. An interesting feature of this particular case is -- as you well know, is that the Court entered a universal decree. We've chatted about this in prior cases.And I -- I -- I just wanted to give you another chance to talk about universal vacatur with some of my friends here ---- if you want it. And if you don't, that's fine	Humor	229
21-454	How does anyone know, any reasonable person know, within maybe several hundred square miles in -- in a watershed that drains into a body of water that is a water of the United States, know whether or not their -- their land is adjacent to? So how about 3,000 feet? Could be? Could it be three miles? One -- I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm just -- I'm just -- so -- so it couldn't be three miles? Could it be two miles? One mile?	Humor	230
21-1168	Are there any natural persons who are present at the same time in all 50 states?	Humor	231
21-454	"No, I mean, you know, I grew up in -- in low country Georgia and you had standing water. That was normal. And I'm thinking of something that's natural like that that is presumptively not covered and is not near -- not bordering on -- I don't want to use the term ""adjacent."" I'm done with that word."	Humor	232
21-476	One can view these websites, or last time around we had cakes, as either expressing the maker's point of view or the couple's point of view, and -- and that's really at -- at the heart of a lot of this. And I guess I'm -- I'm a little confused because sometimes, as I -- as I understand it, you're saying inherently here it is my client's point of view and not just the couple's point of view. I'm being compelled to speak. I get it. And sometimes Colorado agrees with you, for example, when it comes to the example *22 you just gave, which is why it popped up. I believe it was William Jack in -- in the Masterpiece Cake example where Colorado said he didn't have to create cakes that -- that spoke against same-sex marriage, that that would be his compelled speech, not just the couple's speech. So what do we do about this level of generality problem, if you will, where people slide back and forth based upon their priors? How do we avoid that as a Court? What rule would you have us draw?	Implications	233
21-476	And if it's expressive, what -- what about my photograph hypothetical?	Implications	234
21-476	Well, tell me what the clear line is. It's compelled -- you're saying it's compelled speech, correct, not compelled service?	Implications	235
21-476	So it doesn't really -- there is no line on race, there is no *24 line on disability, ethnicity, none of the protected categories in a public accommodation law?	Implications	236
21-476	Can it do that? That's a protected characteristic under the law?	Implications	237
21-476	The hypothetical -- where there is a website and, basically, all the -- the website operator does is to put in the names of the two people who are getting married.	Implications	238
21-476	Let me ask you a -- a -- and then I'll finish this line -- some hypotheticals in a brief submitted by Josh Blackman, okay? A -- a Jewish man and a Jewish woman who are engaged to be married ask a Jewish website designer to build a website to celebrate their upcoming -- their nuptials. No problem. Okay. Another Jewish man and a Christian *73 woman who are engaged to be married ask a Jewish website designer to build a website to celebrate their -- their nuptials. Big problem. “Many Jews consider intermarriage an existential threat to the future of Judaism.” Does that website have to accept the second couple?	Implications	239
21-476	So the fact that they offer this to -- that this is a Jewish -- that it's offered mostly to Jews, that's enough to make it -- or exclusively to Jews, that's enough to make it sufficiently selective to get them out from your --	Implications	240
21-476	So what's the limiting line of yours -- of yours? Justice Kagan asked you about another website designer. But how about people who don't believe in interracial marriage or about people who don't believe that What's -- where's the line? I choose to serve whom I want. If I disagree with their personal characteristics, like race or disability, I can choose not to sell to those peopledisabled people should get married?	Implications	241
21-476	Okay. An unmarried Jewish person asks a Jewish photographer to take a photograph for his Jdate dating profile. It's a dating service, I gather, for Jewish people. All right. Maybe Justice Kagan will also be familiar with the next website I'm going to mention. So, next, a Jewish person asks a Jewish photographer to take a photograph for his ashleymadison.com dating profile. I'm not suggesting that. I mean, she knows a lot of things. I'm not suggesting -- okay. Does he have to do it?	Implications	242
21-476	Justice Jackson's example of the -- the Santa in the mall who doesn't want his picture taken with black children. So, if there's a -- a black Santa at the other end of the mall and he doesn't want to have his picture taken with a child who's dressed up in a Ku Klux Klan outfit, that -- that black Santa has to do that?	Implications	243
21-476	Could -- could it be that we would say, you know, the First Amendment protects the web designer's abilities to, you know, not have this kind of a same-sex wedding website only if it would be clear from, you know, a neutral observer or from the audience that having that website is their own expression?	Implications	244
21-476	So can I can I ask you a hypothetical that just sort of helps me to flesh that out? Because I also heard you suggest *26 earlier that there's something different about race, maybe the person wouldn't sell to someone of a different race. So -- so suppose -- you say that photography is expressive. Can you give me your thoughts on a photography business in a shopping mall during the holiday season that offers a product called Scenes with Santa, and this business wants to express its own view of nostalgia about Christmases past by reproducing classic 1940s and 1950s Santa scenes. They do it in sepia tone and they are customizing each one. This is not off a rack. They're really bringing the people in and having them interact with Santa, children, because they're trying to capture the feelings of a certain era. But precisely because they're trying to capture -- capture the feelings of a certain era, their policy is that only white children can be photographed with Santa in this way because that's how they view the scenes with Santa that they're trying to depict. Now the business will gladly refer families of color to the Santa at the other end of the mall who will take anybody, but -- and -- *27 and they will photograph families of color in other scenes -- other scenes, so they're not discriminating against the families. What they're saying is Scenes with Santa is preserved for white families and they want to have a sign next to the Santa that says “only white children.” Why isn't your argument that they should be able to do that? And maybe it is.	Implications	245
21-476	I mean, you know, just like -- I -- I mean, I have to think that your client does something similar. You have lots of graphics, you have, you know, typefaces, and, you know, maybe, you know, some are a little bit more you talk to the client and some are a little bit less you talk to the client. But, basically, you know, clients are coming in and they're saying, we just want a standard website, you know, that tells people where to stay and what -- how to travel there and -- and, you know, what our favorite things to do are. And -- and the question is, can a website designer say, sorry, that's not my kind of marriage?	Implications	246
21-476	No, you know, like she's providing these templates and she has all these designs and -- and -- and typefaces and -- and that's what people use when they create their own website because they give her the date and they give her the -- the -- you know, the -- the list of hotels and so forth. So can Amber wake up and just say no more gay couples?	Implications	247
21-476	What if they do it for everyone? The Career Development Office will do that for, you know, law firms, this is the job of an associate, and here is why it would appealing, what you'd be getting out of it? If they do that, then they would have had to do that for the military, or would that make that case more like Hurley?	Implications	248
21-476	who's making an expression here?	Implications	249
22-506	Well, would we be breaking new ground if we found that there was standing since we've never been presented, as you admitted earlier, with a case that presents precisely the issue that's here?	Implications	250
21-476	And it seems to me in my hypothetical that the status of the club is inextricably intertwined with the message they want to speak. So why is it different?	Implications	251
21-476	Would this be -- would that make this case -- would this case come out differently then?	Implications	252
21-1484	I hate to ---- be stuck on the same question, Mr. Dvoretzky, but, as between these two positions, which is Mr. Liu's position is that you have a right and they have a duty -- you know, you have -- they have a duty not to interfere with your water, as opposed to they have a duty to ensure access to your water. Both of those are not spelled out in the contract. You know, both of those are implied rights and duties. So how do we choose between them?	Implications	253
21-1484	And what does ensuring access to the waters entail then or encompass potentially?	Implications	254
21-476	It is to announce a wedding. I mean, let's -- this is a standard site. You know, there's not a whole lot of, gosh, isn't this great? It's just like here's the registry, you know. It's announcing the wedding. It's announcing where to get the hotel reservations and so forth, right? So what speech is being -- I mean, that's -- that's what -- that's what websites do, just like it's what invitations do, right? So, you know, next, we'll have the stationer up there saying, you know, we print the station -- the stationery, right? I mean, it would be the same. It is announcing the wedding. What's the speech that's been required of your client that we -- I mean, I'm going to have lots of questions for these guys too, but, *40 in -- in that context, what is the speech that is required of your client that would violate the First Amendment?	Implications	255
21-476	I mean, but that just sounds to me like I would be participating in a wedding, I would be, you know, lending my services to a wedding. You know, as Justice Sotomayor suggested, the florist, the baker, and the guy who provides the chairs are also providing the services in a wedding that they don't like. So why are they any different?	Implications	256
21-1484	The APA also has a cause of action. That's what I'm asking you. If they're relying on the APA's cause of action, not anything analogous to the Tucker Act or anything else, then don't they at least survive the motion to dismiss and then we can go on to other parts of this litigation?	Implications	257
21-1484	So, if we think -- if we think this is a -- an APA claim, if we think that what's actually happening is that the tribe is suing the government under 706 for otherwise violating the law under their -- what they perceive to be a fiduciary duty, a breach of fiduciary duty, do you lose?	Implications	258
21-1484	But the tribes can't sue you if they think you're not up to task with respect to that?	Implications	259
21-1484	Why then would this necessarily be -- why would resolving this dispute be at odds with the decree? Because it sounds to me like what you're saying is that they could get water from places other than the mainstream.	Implications	260
21-1484	A different tack. The Ninth Circuit decision is barely defended by the Navajo Nation. What should we do with that?	Implications	261
21-1484	To pick up on Justice Alito's questions from earlier and ask you about assertion made in the amicus brief of the Western Water Users and just to get the United States' assessment of them. That amicus brief says the reduction of available water would necessarily come at the expense of existing allocation holders, particularly from the Central Arizona Project, which delivers water to 80 percent of the state's population. This amicus brief says that would have severe negative consequences for Arizona, its businesses, and its agricultural and industrial sectors, and would strike at the heart of the social and economic livelihood of Arizona, with dire consequences. I'm not saying I agree with that. I just want -- that's an assertion in the amicus brief. I want your assessment of the implications.	Implications	262
21-476	So my photographer could -- is speaking by -- by being forced to create a Santa photo with minority children in it that they don't want to, they don't think that should be there?	Implications	263
21-476	But what about my photographer? My photographer is speaking through photography, yes?	Implications	264
21-476	But isn't an artist typically sort of a -- a freelancer and they are selling their own messages? They're not purporting to be a business for hire in -- in -- in any meaningful sense. And so I -- I want to kind of go back to Justice Kavanaugh's thought of, like, where do we place your client as between, you know, restaurants and artists. I thought that there really isn't that clear a distinction in a situation like this because your client is an artist for hire essentially. Yes, she does customize things, they're not off the shelf, but she purports to be a public accommodation providing customized things to anyone who pays her, except for people whose messages are those that she disagrees with. And I just don't know that I've ever seen that kind of scenario, even in the cases that you're talking about, because sort of what Justice Gorsuch was saying, it's -- it's relying on the implicit message that she does not want to convey by supporting this person. There's an explicit message in the actual work, but to the extent that actual work *52 is identical to the -- to the work that she would otherwise sell to the gay couple except for their names, then she is implicitly saying, you know, by selling this, I'm going to be violating my own beliefs. So let me just ask you another quick hypo. So I -- I'm trying to understand the extent to which this matters that she's a speaker as opposed to a restaurant. So I sell food, and one line of products that I make is from scratch for particular customers that are based on my grandmother's cherished family recipes. My dearly departed grandmother was clear that she only wanted to provide this kind of nourishment for people who share our same religious heritage. So I call these products Grandma Helen's Protestant Provisions. And I sit with each customer who comes in and I hear about their faith and their family, and I customize the recipe for them after having this discussion. So the food is not expressive, right? I'm not speaking in my food, but I am trying to convey that only certain people get to partake *53 in this product. Can I do that consistent with the First Amendment or not?	Implications	265
21-476	So context changes meaning. What if, instead of a graphic designer, she's a songwriter and she writes a song, you know, let's say “At Last” or “Wind Beneath My Wings” or something that people want to dance to at their wedding, and the lyrics are out there. You know, it could be played at a *50 heterosexual wedding or it could be played at a gay wedding. Once the artist has created that song, can the artist say, but I'm not licensing it to be played at certain kinds of weddings?	Implications	266
21-476	So why is it different? Justice Kagan said, so maybe you do create customized websites and you've created one for, you know, Lilly and Luke, and then, you know, Mike and Henry see it and say, you've created that already, we love it, we want to buy it. Don't create anything new for us. Just give us exactly what you did for them. Why is that different than plug-and-play, or is it?	Implications	267
21-476	What if it is plug-and-play? I don't know that much about website design, so I don't know how it could be plug-and-play. I'm sure it can be. She -- she does the programming, the coding. She has stock pictures. And she sells that as a product, and the customers, you know, Mike and Henry or, you know, Lilly and Luke, fill it in themselves. Is that protected?	Implications	268
21-476	But the -- the caterer, the -- the list of things that you had on page 15 of the reply brief, at least ordinarily -- you had a caveat in there -- but ordinarily wouldn't -- wouldn't have the same right that your client here does, who's a website designer?	Implications	269
21-476	So, if you win this case, if you prevail here, you know, and the next case involves a caterer, at least your position here is that's different.	Implications	270
21-1043	Would Steele come out the same way today?	Implications	271
21-476	So, for you, as -- as there's an effort to protect both the equal rights of gay and lesbian people and same-sex couples and at the same time protect free speech rights, your line is look at whether the action of the business involves speech?	Implications	272
21-476	But Hurley was a private association. It wasn't a public business. What I'm asking you is I have a public business. I'm a photographer. My belief is that -- you know, I'm doing “It's a Wonderful Life” scenes. That's what I'm offering, okay? I want to do video depictions of “It's a Wonderful Life.” And I -- knowing that movie very well, I want to be authentic, and so only white children and families can be customers for that particular product. Everybody else can -- I'll give to everybody else, I'll sell them anything they want, just not the “It's a Wonderful Life” depictions. I'm expressing something, right? For your purposes, that's speech. What about -- *56 what's the other step? It's speech, and I can say anti-discrimination laws can't make me sell the “It's a Wonderful Life” package to nonwhite individuals.	Implications	273
21-476	so, if my hypothetical is an invitation to join me in the 1950s through looking at this photo, you say one is different?	Implications	274
21-476	 Does the publishing house have a First Amendment ability to select the kinds of books that it will publish along the lines of my hypotheticals there?	Implications	275
21-476	What about the characteristics that form the basis for an impermissible denial of service? Any limit to those?	Implications	276
22-506	And then, finally, on standing, in the New York census case, the majority of this Court held that the failure to count an individual, potential failure to count an individual, undercount the census, would have potential effects to the State of New York in the term -- in terms of the benefits it might later receive. That kind of knock-on effect was sufficient to constitute standing in that case. And I'd just like to get your thoughts on how you'd have us distinguish that.	Implications	277
21-476	But tell me how to write this decision for you that draws the line just on gay marriage, because that's what you seem to be saying right now, but draws a line that doesn't affect my example of a disabled person or an interracial couple. You're saying it's just because it's compelled speech.	Implications	278
22-506	I just have a question on -- on the major questions doctrine, and I wanted just a little bit of background for why -- I want to get your views on how it applies. You're -- you're arguing here that no notice-and-comment proceeding was required before the action taken on the half trillion dollars of loans and that because of your view that the President can act unilaterally, that there was no role for Congress to play in this either, and at least in this case, given your view of standing, there's no role for us to play in this -- in this either. Now we take very seriously the idea of the separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse, and there are many procedural niceties that have to be followed for the same purpose. The case reminds me of the one we had a few years ago under a different administration where the administration tried acting on its own to cancel the Dreamers program, and we blocked that effort. And I just wonder, given the posture of the case and given our historic concern about the separation of powers, you would recognize at least that this is a case that presents extraordinarily serious, important issues about the role of Congress and about the role that we should exercise in scrutinizing that, significant enough that the major questions doctrine ought to be considered implicated?	Implications	279
22-506	Would you have the same position with respect to federal corporations? Like what about the FDIC or, you know, organizations like that, what if the agency didn't want to sue? Could the United States sue to protect the federal government's interests if the corporate identity was separate like here?	Implications	280
21-476	Well, outside of that context, in general, does the prohibition or restriction of compelled speech apply only where there is no danger of attribution?	Implications	281
21-476	So, if the -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's hypothetical from earlier this morning, if the standard announcement is Made With Love by Amber, who believes that a valid marriage is a union between one man and one woman,” that's okay?	Implications	282
21-476	Can the gay rights organization do that?	Implications	283
22-506	And so would we be breaking ---- would we be breaking new ground then if, on this basis, we found standing?	Implications	284
21-476	But that's dependent on the views of the community about opposite-sex -- about same-sex -- I'm sorry, about same-sex marriages. What if it's in a community where 99 percent of the public agree with that view, that same-sex marriages are -- are bad, and they're happy to have that associated with it?	Implications	285
22-506	Then let me ask you a question about MOHELA or maybe a question or two. If MOHELA itself had brought this suit, would you contest Article III standing?	Implications	286
21-476	Is there any limit to how broadly a state can define a public accommodation?	Implications	287
21-908	Ms. Ross, could you just comment? You heard the various hypotheticals about trying to find a limit to your -- to Respondent's theory that you apparently share. Would you spend a few minutes on that, what the limit is?	Implications	288
21-476	Well, when I sit down to eat a meal by a full chef who creates this beautiful picture on a plate, why can't he say, I make specialized meals for my clients. I will not serve a black person. I won't serve a disabled person because they can't appreciate fully what I'm creating. That's basically what you're saying.	Implications	289
21-908	So we have to look at something else to find as a basis for the vicarious liability? But we would -- if the statutory language is not dispositive, we would have to look someplace else, in which case you don't care about whether anybody would be liable -- vicariously liable under any other body of law? We have to look to some other body of law, right?	Implications	290
21-908	Well, what if the particular state has some very far-reaching and esoteric and sui generis under -- principle of vicarious liability? Then what?	Implications	291
21-476	Would that make -- mean it's no -- it can't be regarded as public accommodations anymore?	Implications	292
21-908	Isn't that a good argument, though, for then state law to change -- you're not disputing, I think, that your client was liable under state law -- or for the Bankruptcy Code to change to create an exception for a situation like this?	Implications	293
21-476	If your -- if your client's website was the same as it is, but the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only, could that constitutionally be applied under the Colorado statute?	Implications	294
21-476	What if it said, I won't provide websites for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons? Could that be covered, or is it simply the invocation of religious basis for the objection that protects it from coverage under the statute?	Implications	295
21-476	And that's why I want to know how far that can be expanded. So some selectivity would not necessarily take a business outside of the -- the definition of public accommodations? The same arguments would apply?	Implications	296
21-86	I think that the -- the gloss you put on the procedures language doesn't go all that far. I mean, even if you say it's a challenge to a procedure that extends to all cases, I mean, you know, agencies have a lot of procedures, just as courts do. And, you know, suppose you claimed something about the way agencies treated witnesses or what kinds of witnesses were allowed or what kinds of cross-examination or when subpoenas were issued or -- you could just keep on going. I mean, would all of that go to a court first?	Implications	297
21-476	No, I'm not talking about -- you're -- you're sort of slipping into, like, a thousand different analogies. I just *57 want -- I just want you to focus on whether or not I am -- I have speech when I am a photography business and I hang out my shingle. Everybody can come. But I have certain products that I'll only sell to non -- to -- to white individuals because the speech that I'm trying to depict is the authentic depiction of that scene as I understand it and that I want to put out there in the world and it has my signature on the bottom of it, so people are seeing my photos, and I want my photos of “It's a Wonderful Life” to be as authentic as possible, meaning no people of color.	Implications	298
21-476	Can they turn away opposite-sex marriage announcements?	Implications	299
22-148	-- can I get you back to a question that Justice Thomas asked, okay, and in part that Justice Kagan did. I have some hesitation doing away with the Rogers test because -- without knowing that the likelihood-of-confusion test is sufficiently flexible itself. By the way, you talk about making things up, the Polaroid test, the Steel Craft test, it's all judicially crafted. These tests have to be because the statute talks about likelihood of confusion, and what judges have to do is figure out how do -- how do we get to that, how do we decide whether it's confused. So we've got to create some principles. I don't -- I think you're right about it can't be just commercial products because then you get into can you use it in one setting but not another. It can't be just designation of origin because that doesn't have to do with improper use. I think it's contextual, and I think that all -- you're shaking your head yes.	Support	300
21-476	so whatever we decide here, as Justice Barrett suggested, could have implications for other kinds of categorizations and First Amendment -- strongly religious held First Amendment invocations of rights?	Support	301
21-376	There were several questions earlier about the justification for granting preference for foster or adoptive parents who are members of an entirely different tribe. Could you speak to that?	Support	302
22-506	I'd like to follow up on Justice Kagan's question, General. Under State Farm, one of the things that the government must normally do is, in its memoranda, explain not just the benefits of its proposed course of action but also grapple with the costs or negative effects of a program that it proposes. And your friends on the other side argue that that's another deficiency in the Secretary's memorandum, and I'd like to give you the chance to respond to that.	Support	303
21-1484	You said earlier that you had some things to say about Arizona v. California and the nature of what happened there. Have you gotten that out?	Support	304
21-1484	Counsel, Justice Kavanaugh -- this is -- Justice Kavanaugh asked a question earlier that you're not defending the Ninth Circuit decision. Could you succinctly point out why you're not or, if you are, why he's wrong and -- and explain how your position differs from the Ninth Circuit, if it does?	Support	305
21-1484	You were going to make a second area of confusion. I just wanted to make sure you get that out.	Support	306
21-476	 but what she's really asking for in this case, I think, is the right to say the same thing, here's the wedding, it's at this place, et cetera, et cetera, but she's afraid that if she says it for gay people that that will be sort of like an implicit endorsement of their wedding, and so she wants to be able to protect against implicitly endorsing, right, in a way that we've never really recognized before in the same way, when it isn't really clear that that's her message, when we don't -- when an objective observer would know that she was really trying to do that? Am I right in trying to think about explicit versus implicit in this way?	Support	307
21-432	The solicitor general adds two other buckets of arguments, among others, in addition to the text. One is the immense practical problems, to use their phrase, that would be caused by ruling in your favor, and they say that makes it especially implausible to allow equitable tolling or that Congress intended to allow it here. So that's one. The second is that the VA's longstanding regulatory practice has been in this direction and that Congress has not disturbed that. So I want to just make sure you get a chance to respond to both of those.	Support	308
21-1043	I agree with that. And then can you add to that? Would there be problems created by having one rule for U.S. defendants and a different rule for foreign defendants in how the statute applies?
